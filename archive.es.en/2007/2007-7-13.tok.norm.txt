but the result was clouded by the decision of various turkish associations to abstain from attending the summit , and it 's been clear for days that the atmosphere of the first summit , which took place in 2006 , would not be replicated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp the associations are annoyed that the german government did not sufficiently consult with them about tightening an immigration law , critics say .
though not explicitly named , turkish immigrants are particularly discriminated against , the associations also said .
not only because they make the largest group of so-called " migrants , " but also for concrete reasons : spouses have to learn german in their home countries and have to be at least 18 years old before they can come to germany .
the irritated turkish association pushed forward a debate that more than clearly demonstrated how poorly the law handles integration .
some of the associations ' representatives even spoke of it violating their human rights .
" absurd , " the politicians countered , adding that raising the age of immigration to 18 would avoid forced marriages .
and secondly , it must be clear that people who want to live in germany should speak german .
the politicians do n't bring up the fact that this is n't quite as easy in anatolian villages as in new york or tokyo - where the condition is n't even being imposed .
not to mention that german is best learnt in germany .
the turkish groups - somewhat unskillfully - gave the impression that they wanted to put pressure on the government .
but german politicians tried to trivialize the situation and insinuate that the groups wanted to prevent what is clear to everyone and questioned by few : that the integration of immigrants is important and that language skills are , naturally , required .
but acquiring language skills in anatolia - even if it 's just the " 300 words " that german politicians suddenly say are necessary - is a hurdle for the people who live there and want to move to germany .
while talking about avoiding forced marriages may be politically beneficial , it can not be achieved by raising the age of immigration and certainly not by 300 german words .
these are problems that have to be solved in germany .
and that has to be done on equal footing with the immigrants , as the politicians like to say .
this is what should have happened before the changes were made to the immigration law .
then we could have saved ourselves a lot of aggravation , and some things could have really improved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 13.07.2007 in europe , iraqi asylum-seekers find doors being shut großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi bodyguard muhannad yousif who sought a new life in sweden experts have criticized germany 's policies towards iraqi asylum-seekers as too restrictive .
fearful of a refugee influx , however , other european nations have started tightening their asylum rules . " when you go out in baghdad , there 's a 50 percent chance you may never come home , " said murad atshan , an iraqi filmmaker living in germany . anyone who follows news of daily suicide bombings , a bloody insurgency and sectarian violence in the iraqi capital will probably nod in agreement at the statement .
german authorities in munich , however , rejected atshan 's application for asylum a year ago , saying he did n't give a good enough reason for seeking protection . the 27-year-old has since been confined to a refugee center in a tiny village in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , near the swiss border . while german authorities are deciding what to do with him , atshan is n't allowed to leave the district or work . " it 's very frustrating , " he said .
" i did n't come here looking for a good life , i just wanted to be somewhere safe .
but this is no normal life . " in addition to worrying about his family back home in baghdad , atshan is grappling with getting used to life in a small foreign village . " i 'm used to living in big cities , " he said . " i ca n't even go to the movies here . " living in limbo atshan 's case is depressingly familiar in the country whose complicated asylum and refugee laws have come under increasing criticism from aid and refugee groups .
germany is home to an estimated 73,000 iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi family at a refugee home in germany experts say german asylum rules date back to the 1990s when tens of thousands of iraqis fleeing saddam hussein 's dictatorship applied for and easily received asylum status in germany on grounds of political persecution . " the moment saddam was toppled in 2003 , however , the german government sent out letters to thousands of iraqis saying their asylum status would be revoked since the persecutor was now gone , " said bernd mesovic of campaign group proasyl .
" it 's as if the authorities did n't watch television and did n't know what 's happening in iraq . " last year , german authorities stripped 8,189 refugees of their asylum status .
this week , human rights watch slammed germany 's move earlier this year to revoke the refugee status of over 18,000 iraqis . " losing your asylum status has serious repercussions , " said marianne heuwagen , head of the german section of human rights watch , because it can lead to reduced social benefits and severe restrictions on work , mobility and unification with family members . " in others words , it leaves you in limbo and with an uncertain future , " she said . civil war not asylum-worthy german authorities admit that iraqis seeking asylum must now prove they face personal risk in their homeland .
general instability or civil war is not reason enough to grant asylum though it is sufficient to put a freeze on deportations . at the same time , revoking asylum status does not automatically mean iraqis will be sent back home , said claudia moebus , spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis in baghdad have to live with daily car and suicide bombings " each refugee has the right to appeal and each individual case is carefully considered before any decision is taken , " moebus said . she added that german authorities had also reversed their recent decision to strip 18,000 iraqis of their refugee status with the exceptions of criminals and those who returned to northern iraq , which is considered relatively stable .
she declined to give exact figures . liberal sweden puts up barriers germany is not alone in its restrictive attitude towards iraqi asylum-seekers . experts point out that most eu nations remain reluctant to take in iraqi asylum-seekers even though those who knock on their doors make up only a fraction of the estimated four million displaced since the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
neighboring jordan and syria have taken in two million , while another two million remain uprooted within iraq . last year , just about 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the bloc . sweden has thus far stood out among europeans for having the most welcoming attitude and taking in the highest numbers of iraqi asylum-seekers - some 9,000 alone last year .
many of the refugees in sweden have joined existing iraqi communities in towns such as malmo on the southwest coast . last week , however , the country , which has long called on other eu members to shoulder the burden , said it 's tightening its asylum rules and will forcibly deport iraqis who are denied permission to stay . " asylum a dangerous lottery " " asylum in europe has become a dangerous lottery , " said richard williams of the european council of refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , referring to the disparate practices among eu nations on granting asylum . " generally every european country is afraid of being seen as too attractive to asylum-seekers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi refugee djabar lafte latif who lives in saxony-anhalt in germany in addition to german and swedish restrictions , britain , in particular , and denmark have sent iraqis back home .
experts are also concerned that the policies of these countries are not in accordance with international treaties such as the geneva convention . in addition to plodding moves towards a harmonized eu asylum policy - a goal hoped to be achieved by 2010 - some say european leaders need to do more to sell the idea of asylum on humanitarian grounds . " asylum and migration remain major political fault lines in europe , " williams said .

while the gaza strip is controlled by hamas , the west bank is ruled by an emergency government under salam fayyad in cooperation with the president and fatah chairman , mahmoud abbas . israel and the international community have interpreted the split as a chance .
thus , the islamists in the gaza strip could be more easily isolated and the emergency government in the west bank could be a partner for the resumption of cooperation , economic development and a diplomatic process .
" flourishing landscapes " and new freedom of movement in the west bank would convince the palestinian population of fatah being the right choice for the future . but the " hamastan vs fatah-land " -approach is hugely unrealistic . bildunterschrift : muriel asseburg israel has announced a gradual release of customs duties and value-added tax revenues collected on behalf of the palestinian authority and worth some $ 700 million that it has withheld since the establishment of the hamas-led government in march 2006 .
it has also promised to lift a few roadblocks in the west bank , dismantle some settlement outposts and allow weapon deliveries such as armoured vehicles to strengthen fatah . but all these measures are far from sufficient to trigger a new dynamic and to tangibly improve the situation in the west bank : as long as the system of roadblocks and permits remains in place , the palestinian economy will not see a sustainable recovery . an approach that pins hopes on a military confrontation between fatah and hamas will not stabilize the situation either .
instead , it carries the danger of a renewed flare-up of internal palestinian fighting and its escalation into a civil war . also , increasing the pressure on the population in the gaza strip is hardly possible without causing a humanitarian catastrophe .
the official unemployment rate in the region is already at some 35 percent , the poverty rate at above 75 percent .
around two thirds of the population depend on international aid deliveries .
the danger of economic isolation then is to radicalize the gaza strip ’ s population and to increase the attraction of salafist and jihadist groups – which , in contrast to hamas , neither have a national agenda nor an interest in stabilization . the new-old approach of the international community is contributing to making the vision of a two-state settlement increasingly unrealistic .
this is because it sacrifices the creation of functioning and democratic palestinian institutions in favour of short-term stability .
and because it does nothing to prevent the ever greater erosion of a contiguous territory for a palestinian state – which is a result of the separation barrier , the expansion of settlements and the corresponding transportation network in the west bank . german and european policies should therefore concentrate on averting a humanitarian catastrophe in the gaza strip and on creating conditions for an economic revival both there and in the west bank .
they should avoid undermining reconciliation among palestinian factions , support improved governance of palestinian institutions and take serious steps to achieve a two-state settlement in cooperation with the middle east quartet and the arab peace initiative . muriel asseburg is head of the research unit for the middle east and africa at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has denied it helped with secret renditions . a new report by the eu 's human rights watchdog accuses germany of assisting in cia kidnappings of suspected terrorists for interrogation in third countries .
germany has consistently denied its involvement in this practice , called " extraordinary rendition . "

el masri said he was beaten and mistreated and flown by members of a cia team to afghanistan , where he was held as a terrorism suspect for five months and was tortured .
hammarberg 's report said a german intelligence officer visited el masri and traveled with him to europe .
the report expressed concern about the " questioning by german officials of terrorist suspects who have been detained without due process and allegedly tortured . "
" the commissioner calls upon germany to fully investigate all cases of alleged extraordinary renditions that were carried out on german territory or that involved german nationals or long-term residents , " according to the report .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 13.07.2007 in europe , iraqi asylum-seekers find doors being shut großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi bodyguard muhannad yousif who sought a new life in sweden experts have criticized germany 's policies towards iraqi asylum-seekers as too restrictive .
fearful of a refugee influx , however , other european nations have started tightening their asylum rules . " when you go out in baghdad , there 's a 50 percent chance you may never come home , " said murad atshan , an iraqi filmmaker living in germany . anyone who follows news of daily suicide bombings , a bloody insurgency and sectarian violence in the iraqi capital will probably nod in agreement at the statement .
german authorities in munich , however , rejected atshan 's application for asylum a year ago , saying he did n't give a good enough reason for seeking protection . the 27-year-old has since been confined to a refugee center in a tiny village in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , near the swiss border . while german authorities are deciding what to do with him , atshan is n't allowed to leave the district or work . " it 's very frustrating , " he said .
" i did n't come here looking for a good life , i just wanted to be somewhere safe .
but this is no normal life . " in addition to worrying about his family back home in baghdad , atshan is grappling with getting used to life in a small foreign village . " i 'm used to living in big cities , " he said . " i ca n't even go to the movies here . " living in limbo atshan 's case is depressingly familiar in the country whose complicated asylum and refugee laws have come under increasing criticism from aid and refugee groups .
germany is home to an estimated 73,000 iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi family at a refugee home in germany experts say german asylum rules date back to the 1990s when tens of thousands of iraqis fleeing saddam hussein 's dictatorship applied for and easily received asylum status in germany on grounds of political persecution . " the moment saddam was toppled in 2003 , however , the german government sent out letters to thousands of iraqis saying their asylum status would be revoked since the persecutor was now gone , " said bernd mesovic of campaign group proasyl .
" it 's as if the authorities did n't watch television and did n't know what 's happening in iraq . " last year , german authorities stripped 8,189 refugees of their asylum status .
this week , human rights watch slammed germany 's move earlier this year to revoke the refugee status of over 18,000 iraqis . " losing your asylum status has serious repercussions , " said marianne heuwagen , head of the german section of human rights watch , because it can lead to reduced social benefits and severe restrictions on work , mobility and unification with family members . " in others words , it leaves you in limbo and with an uncertain future , " she said . civil war not asylum-worthy german authorities admit that iraqis seeking asylum must now prove they face personal risk in their homeland .
general instability or civil war is not reason enough to grant asylum though it is sufficient to put a freeze on deportations . at the same time , revoking asylum status does not automatically mean iraqis will be sent back home , said claudia moebus , spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis in baghdad have to live with daily car and suicide bombings " each refugee has the right to appeal and each individual case is carefully considered before any decision is taken , " moebus said . she added that german authorities had also reversed their recent decision to strip 18,000 iraqis of their refugee status with the exceptions of criminals and those who returned to northern iraq , which is considered relatively stable .
she declined to give exact figures . liberal sweden puts up barriers germany is not alone in its restrictive attitude towards iraqi asylum-seekers . experts point out that most eu nations remain reluctant to take in iraqi asylum-seekers even though those who knock on their doors make up only a fraction of the estimated four million displaced since the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
neighboring jordan and syria have taken in two million , while another two million remain uprooted within iraq . last year , just about 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the bloc . sweden has thus far stood out among europeans for having the most welcoming attitude and taking in the highest numbers of iraqi asylum-seekers - some 9,000 alone last year .
many of the refugees in sweden have joined existing iraqi communities in towns such as malmo on the southwest coast . last week , however , the country , which has long called on other eu members to shoulder the burden , said it 's tightening its asylum rules and will forcibly deport iraqis who are denied permission to stay . " asylum a dangerous lottery " " asylum in europe has become a dangerous lottery , " said richard williams of the european council of refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , referring to the disparate practices among eu nations on granting asylum . " generally every european country is afraid of being seen as too attractive to asylum-seekers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi refugee djabar lafte latif who lives in saxony-anhalt in germany in addition to german and swedish restrictions , britain , in particular , and denmark have sent iraqis back home .
experts are also concerned that the policies of these countries are not in accordance with international treaties such as the geneva convention . in addition to plodding moves towards a harmonized eu asylum policy - a goal hoped to be achieved by 2010 - some say european leaders need to do more to sell the idea of asylum on humanitarian grounds . " asylum and migration remain major political fault lines in europe , " williams said .

"
nord stream bosses wo n't know for sure until at least 2010 the german-russian gas pipeline saga continues with a new disputed region causing a rethink over its route .
the nord stream consortium is again forced into finding an alternative direction for its maligned project . when it is finally completed , the planned russian-german natural gas pipeline may have more twists and turns than a bowl of spaghetti .
a spokesman for the nord stream consortium said wednesday that the disputed pipeline would again have to change its route after it was revealed a section had been earmarked for a stretch of water that both poland and denmark claim as an exclusive economic zone .
in april this year , nord stream - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - had its plans for running a stretch of the pipeline through estonian waters thrown into doubt over fears that it could disturb unexploded munitions and chemical dumps from world war ii .
such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry at the time .
this latest obstacle to the 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 750-mile -rrb- pipeline may prove to be more concrete in its disruption .
both denmark and poland claim the ownership of the area and nord stream is reluctant to get involved with any dispute .
pipeline consortium resorts to plan b ... or c bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord stream has had to adapt its plans after complaints now accustomed to the need to redirect the pipeline when opposition arises , nord stream said that it already has an alternative route that it proposes to take to avoid the disputed territory .
the consortium would attempt to squeeze the pipeline between the danish island of bornholm and sweden 's southeastern coast ; although nord stream stated that no final decision had been made .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
several coastal nations have expressed concern over the pipeline which is to deliver natural gas from russia to germany , saying it will damage the baltic sea 's delicate ecosystem .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment while sweden in particular has complained that the pipeline could disrupt the baltic sea ’ s sensitive flora and fauna .
study hopes to alleviate environmental fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns over the pipeline 's route out at sea in accordance with the european union rules , nord stream is required to furnish an environmental impact assessment -lrb- eia -rrb- to those countries whose territorial waters would be affected .
the consortium is expected to do so later this year .
" nord stream has decided to launch additional studies to investigate areas where the route of the pipeline through the baltic sea can be further optimized in a reasonable way to minimize environmental impacts , " the consortium said in a statement earlier this year . the pipeline has also created political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
in-between nations concerned at duopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schröder co-developed the project the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
the fact that the project was negotiated by russia and germany without consulting the countries between them has also created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the recent heightening of political tensions between russia and estonia has also left many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
if completed by 2010 as planned , the 1,200-kilometer pipeline would pump 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year from vyborg , russia to greifswald in northern germany .
in a second phase , a parallel pipeline would double that transport capacity , and nord stream estimates that will meet about 25 percent of the additional gas needs of the european union . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a spokesman for the nord stream consortium said wednesday that the disputed pipeline would again have to change its route after it was revealed a section had been earmarked for a stretch of water that both poland and denmark claim as an exclusive economic zone .
in april this year , nord stream - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - had its plans for running a stretch of the pipeline through estonian waters thrown into doubt over fears that it could disturb unexploded munitions and chemical dumps from world war ii .
such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry at the time .
this latest obstacle to the 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 750-mile -rrb- pipeline may prove to be more concrete in its disruption .
both denmark and poland claim the ownership of the area and nord stream is reluctant to get involved with any dispute .
pipeline consortium resorts to plan b ... or c bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord stream has had to adapt its plans after complaints now accustomed to the need to redirect the pipeline when opposition arises , nord stream said that it already has an alternative route that it proposes to take to avoid the disputed territory .
the consortium would attempt to squeeze the pipeline between the danish island of bornholm and sweden 's southeastern coast ; although nord stream stated that no final decision had been made .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
several coastal nations have expressed concern over the pipeline which is to deliver natural gas from russia to germany , saying it will damage the baltic sea 's delicate ecosystem .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment while sweden in particular has complained that the pipeline could disrupt the baltic sea ’ s sensitive flora and fauna .
study hopes to alleviate environmental fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns over the pipeline 's route out at sea in accordance with the european union rules , nord stream is required to furnish an environmental impact assessment -lrb- eia -rrb- to those countries whose territorial waters would be affected .
the consortium is expected to do so later this year .
" nord stream has decided to launch additional studies to investigate areas where the route of the pipeline through the baltic sea can be further optimized in a reasonable way to minimize environmental impacts , " the consortium said in a statement earlier this year . the pipeline has also created political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
in-between nations concerned at duopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schröder co-developed the project the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
the fact that the project was negotiated by russia and germany without consulting the countries between them has also created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the recent heightening of political tensions between russia and estonia has also left many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
if completed by 2010 as planned , the 1,200-kilometer pipeline would pump 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year from vyborg , russia to greifswald in northern germany .
in a second phase , a parallel pipeline would double that transport capacity , and nord stream estimates that will meet about 25 percent of the additional gas needs of the european union . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he suggested launching a " citizenship campaign " to persuade foreigners to change their nationality .
" we should persuade people who have a right to citizenship to do more than be just residents and to become citizens , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
but edathy 's idea was met with skepticism in the conservative ranks of the german political establishment .
stephan mayer , parliamentary head for the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , questioned whether giving citizenship to foreigners would lead to better integration .
" awarding citizenship can only take place at the end of a successful integration process , certainly not at the beginning , " mayer said .
" the state can not offer citizenship as a concession . "
a sensitive issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners have to give up their previous citizenship to become german the integration issue in germany has been traditionally plagued by the widely divergent positions of the spd and the cdu / csu - now united under the umbrella of merkel 's grand coalition government .
foreigners , who are not married to german citizens , currently obtain the right to apply for german citizenship if they have been legally living in germany for at least eight years , if they can financially support themselves and their families without state aid , if they possess sufficient german language skills , have not been convicted of a crime , and if they avow they will adhere to germany 's basic law and democratic principles .

" it is key that we improve migrants ' political participation by a right to vote in municipal election for foreigners who have lived in germany for a long time , " he said .
while federal and state elections are open only to a country 's citizens , the european union law opened municipal elections across the 27-member bloc to all eu citizens who are local residents , even if they are not citizens of the country where they live .
" i do n't think much of extending the right to vote because it does n't contribute to integration , " bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein told deutschlandfunk radio on friday .
" integration is a hard task : namely learning the legal system , leaning that you can speak the language and that you fit in to society . "
new ideas after integration summit edathy 's suggestions were not subject to discussion at germany 's second integration summit on thursday , which dealt with proposals from six working groups on how to improve the integration of immigrants living in germany .
despite the decision of some turkish groups to boycott the meeting in protest of a recent law placing additional restrictions on some foreigners before they are allowed to move to germany , merkel called the day-long meeting a success and " milestone " for the country 's integration efforts .

but a clemency deal could be in the offing . " the court rejects the appeals of the defendants and confirms the death penalty , " judge fathi dahn said after a five-minute hearing . the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor were found guilty late last year of intentional infecting more than 400 libyan children with hiv in the late 1990s .
all worked in the al-fateh children 's hospital in the city of benghazi . the defendants have been incarcerated since 1999 .

fearful of a refugee influx , however , other european nations have started tightening their asylum rules . " when you go out in baghdad , there 's a 50 percent chance you may never come home , " said murad atshan , an iraqi filmmaker living in germany . anyone who follows news of daily suicide bombings , a bloody insurgency and sectarian violence in the iraqi capital will probably nod in agreement at the statement .
german authorities in munich , however , rejected atshan 's application for asylum a year ago , saying he did n't give a good enough reason for seeking protection . the 27-year-old has since been confined to a refugee center in a tiny village in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , near the swiss border . while german authorities are deciding what to do with him , atshan is n't allowed to leave the district or work . " it 's very frustrating , " he said .
" i did n't come here looking for a good life , i just wanted to be somewhere safe .
but this is no normal life . " in addition to worrying about his family back home in baghdad , atshan is grappling with getting used to life in a small foreign village . " i 'm used to living in big cities , " he said . " i ca n't even go to the movies here . " living in limbo atshan 's case is depressingly familiar in the country whose complicated asylum and refugee laws have come under increasing criticism from aid and refugee groups .
germany is home to an estimated 73,000 iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi family at a refugee home in germany experts say german asylum rules date back to the 1990s when tens of thousands of iraqis fleeing saddam hussein 's dictatorship applied for and easily received asylum status in germany on grounds of political persecution . " the moment saddam was toppled in 2003 , however , the german government sent out letters to thousands of iraqis saying their asylum status would be revoked since the persecutor was now gone , " said bernd mesovic of campaign group proasyl .
" it 's as if the authorities did n't watch television and did n't know what 's happening in iraq . " last year , german authorities stripped 8,189 refugees of their asylum status .
this week , human rights watch slammed germany 's move earlier this year to revoke the refugee status of over 18,000 iraqis . " losing your asylum status has serious repercussions , " said marianne heuwagen , head of the german section of human rights watch , because it can lead to reduced social benefits and severe restrictions on work , mobility and unification with family members . " in others words , it leaves you in limbo and with an uncertain future , " she said . civil war not asylum-worthy german authorities admit that iraqis seeking asylum must now prove they face personal risk in their homeland .
general instability or civil war is not reason enough to grant asylum though it is sufficient to put a freeze on deportations . at the same time , revoking asylum status does not automatically mean iraqis will be sent back home , said claudia moebus , spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis in baghdad have to live with daily car and suicide bombings " each refugee has the right to appeal and each individual case is carefully considered before any decision is taken , " moebus said . she added that german authorities had also reversed their recent decision to strip 18,000 iraqis of their refugee status with the exceptions of criminals and those who returned to northern iraq , which is considered relatively stable .
she declined to give exact figures . liberal sweden puts up barriers germany is not alone in its restrictive attitude towards iraqi asylum-seekers . experts point out that most eu nations remain reluctant to take in iraqi asylum-seekers even though those who knock on their doors make up only a fraction of the estimated four million displaced since the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
neighboring jordan and syria have taken in two million , while another two million remain uprooted within iraq . last year , just about 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the bloc . sweden has thus far stood out among europeans for having the most welcoming attitude and taking in the highest numbers of iraqi asylum-seekers - some 9,000 alone last year .
many of the refugees in sweden have joined existing iraqi communities in towns such as malmo on the southwest coast . last week , however , the country , which has long called on other eu members to shoulder the burden , said it 's tightening its asylum rules and will forcibly deport iraqis who are denied permission to stay . " asylum a dangerous lottery " " asylum in europe has become a dangerous lottery , " said richard williams of the european council of refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , referring to the disparate practices among eu nations on granting asylum . " generally every european country is afraid of being seen as too attractive to asylum-seekers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi refugee djabar lafte latif who lives in saxony-anhalt in germany in addition to german and swedish restrictions , britain , in particular , and denmark have sent iraqis back home .
experts are also concerned that the policies of these countries are not in accordance with international treaties such as the geneva convention . in addition to plodding moves towards a harmonized eu asylum policy - a goal hoped to be achieved by 2010 - some say european leaders need to do more to sell the idea of asylum on humanitarian grounds .

while the gaza strip is controlled by hamas , the west bank is ruled by an emergency government under salam fayyad in cooperation with the president and fatah chairman , mahmoud abbas . israel and the international community have interpreted the split as a chance .
thus , the islamists in the gaza strip could be more easily isolated and the emergency government in the west bank could be a partner for the resumption of cooperation , economic development and a diplomatic process .
" flourishing landscapes " and new freedom of movement in the west bank would convince the palestinian population of fatah being the right choice for the future . but the " hamastan vs fatah-land " -approach is hugely unrealistic . bildunterschrift : muriel asseburg israel has announced a gradual release of customs duties and value-added tax revenues collected on behalf of the palestinian authority and worth some $ 700 million that it has withheld since the establishment of the hamas-led government in march 2006 .
it has also promised to lift a few roadblocks in the west bank , dismantle some settlement outposts and allow weapon deliveries such as armoured vehicles to strengthen fatah . but all these measures are far from sufficient to trigger a new dynamic and to tangibly improve the situation in the west bank : as long as the system of roadblocks and permits remains in place , the palestinian economy will not see a sustainable recovery . an approach that pins hopes on a military confrontation between fatah and hamas will not stabilize the situation either .
instead , it carries the danger of a renewed flare-up of internal palestinian fighting and its escalation into a civil war . also , increasing the pressure on the population in the gaza strip is hardly possible without causing a humanitarian catastrophe .
the official unemployment rate in the region is already at some 35 percent , the poverty rate at above 75 percent .
around two thirds of the population depend on international aid deliveries .
the danger of economic isolation then is to radicalize the gaza strip ’ s population and to increase the attraction of salafist and jihadist groups – which , in contrast to hamas , neither have a national agenda nor an interest in stabilization . the new-old approach of the international community is contributing to making the vision of a two-state settlement increasingly unrealistic .
this is because it sacrifices the creation of functioning and democratic palestinian institutions in favour of short-term stability .
and because it does nothing to prevent the ever greater erosion of a contiguous territory for a palestinian state – which is a result of the separation barrier , the expansion of settlements and the corresponding transportation network in the west bank . german and european policies should therefore concentrate on averting a humanitarian catastrophe in the gaza strip and on creating conditions for an economic revival both there and in the west bank .
they should avoid undermining reconciliation among palestinian factions , support improved governance of palestinian institutions and take serious steps to achieve a two-state settlement in cooperation with the middle east quartet and the arab peace initiative . muriel asseburg is head of the research unit for the middle east and africa at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the computer-generated creature is part of an exhibit opening friday at the museum of natural history in berlin . what sounds like a scene from the adventure film jurassic park can be seen in a computer animation exhibit that opened friday at berlin 's museum of natural history . but the " evolution in action " exhibit , housed in four renovated halls , is intended to act as a bridge between scientific research and everyday life . the star of the exhibit is a 13-meter-high and 15-meter-long -lrb- 42.6 foot-high and 49.2-foot long -rrb- brachiosaurus , the tallest dinosaur model ever mounted in a museum .

a crane was needed to rebuild the brachiosaurus - a process which took several weeks .
after reconstruction , the creature 's head is not one meter higher than it was before , in accordance with the latest scientific research .
the colossus also stands more upright and is presented as running when seen through the light of the hall 's glass-domed roof .

animated films show the dinosaurs smacking their lips and letting out loud roars as they trample through the prehistoric landscape .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 13.07.2007 proposal to promote german citizenship divides parties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians ca n't agree on whether to push immigrants to take on german citizenship one day after german chancellor angela merkel termed the country 's second integration summit a success , a social democratic politician has called for a new program to encourage immigrants to take on german citizenship . sebastian edathy , chairman of the bundestag 's interior committee and senior member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , called on friday for more political involvement on the part of immigrants in germany .
he suggested launching a " citizenship campaign " to persuade foreigners to change their nationality .
" we should persuade people who have a right to citizenship to do more than be just residents and to become citizens , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
but edathy 's idea was met with skepticism in the conservative ranks of the german political establishment .
stephan mayer , parliamentary head for the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , questioned whether giving citizenship to foreigners would lead to better integration .
" awarding citizenship can only take place at the end of a successful integration process , certainly not at the beginning , " mayer said .
" the state can not offer citizenship as a concession . "
a sensitive issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners have to give up their previous citizenship to become german the integration issue in germany has been traditionally plagued by the widely divergent positions of the spd and the cdu / csu - now united under the umbrella of merkel 's grand coalition government .
foreigners , who are not married to german citizens , currently obtain the right to apply for german citizenship if they have been legally living in germany for at least eight years , if they can financially support themselves and their families without state aid , if they possess sufficient german language skills , have not been convicted of a crime , and if they avow they will adhere to germany 's basic law and democratic principles .
by adopting german citizenship , foreigners living in germany are also expected to give up any other citizenship they have .
extending local voting rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu citizens can participate in local elections wherever in the bloc they live edathy also said germany should provide some foreigners with a right to vote in local elections .
" it is key that we improve migrants ' political participation by a right to vote in municipal election for foreigners who have lived in germany for a long time , " he said .
while federal and state elections are open only to a country 's citizens , the european union law opened municipal elections across the 27-member bloc to all eu citizens who are local residents , even if they are not citizens of the country where they live .
" i do n't think much of extending the right to vote because it does n't contribute to integration , " bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein told deutschlandfunk radio on friday .
" integration is a hard task : namely learning the legal system , leaning that you can speak the language and that you fit in to society . "
new ideas after integration summit edathy 's suggestions were not subject to discussion at germany 's second integration summit on thursday , which dealt with proposals from six working groups on how to improve the integration of immigrants living in germany .
despite the decision of some turkish groups to boycott the meeting in protest of a recent law placing additional restrictions on some foreigners before they are allowed to move to germany , merkel called the day-long meeting a success and " milestone " for the country 's integration efforts .
representatives of the federal government , the states and some 90 community leaders at the summit adopted a " national integration plan " containing 400 promises for improvements - ranging from aid for ethnic sports clubs to making more german-language classes available . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the result was clouded by the decision of various turkish associations to abstain from attending the summit , and it 's been clear for days that the atmosphere of the first summit , which took place in 2006 , would not be replicated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp the associations are annoyed that the german government did not sufficiently consult with them about tightening an immigration law , critics say .
though not explicitly named , turkish immigrants are particularly discriminated against , the associations also said .
not only because they make the largest group of so-called " migrants , " but also for concrete reasons : spouses have to learn german in their home countries and have to be at least 18 years old before they can come to germany .
the irritated turkish association pushed forward a debate that more than clearly demonstrated how poorly the law handles integration .
some of the associations ' representatives even spoke of it violating their human rights .
" absurd , " the politicians countered , adding that raising the age of immigration to 18 would avoid forced marriages .
and secondly , it must be clear that people who want to live in germany should speak german .
the politicians do n't bring up the fact that this is n't quite as easy in anatolian villages as in new york or tokyo - where the condition is n't even being imposed .
not to mention that german is best learnt in germany .
the turkish groups - somewhat unskillfully - gave the impression that they wanted to put pressure on the government .
but german politicians tried to trivialize the situation and insinuate that the groups wanted to prevent what is clear to everyone and questioned by few : that the integration of immigrants is important and that language skills are , naturally , required .
but acquiring language skills in anatolia - even if it 's just the " 300 words " that german politicians suddenly say are necessary - is a hurdle for the people who live there and want to move to germany .
while talking about avoiding forced marriages may be politically beneficial , it can not be achieved by raising the age of immigration and certainly not by 300 german words .
these are problems that have to be solved in germany .
and that has to be done on equal footing with the immigrants , as the politicians like to say .
this is what should have happened before the changes were made to the immigration law .
then we could have saved ourselves a lot of aggravation , and some things could have really improved .

while the gaza strip is controlled by hamas , the west bank is ruled by an emergency government under salam fayyad in cooperation with the president and fatah chairman , mahmoud abbas . israel and the international community have interpreted the split as a chance .
thus , the islamists in the gaza strip could be more easily isolated and the emergency government in the west bank could be a partner for the resumption of cooperation , economic development and a diplomatic process .
" flourishing landscapes " and new freedom of movement in the west bank would convince the palestinian population of fatah being the right choice for the future . but the " hamastan vs fatah-land " -approach is hugely unrealistic . bildunterschrift : muriel asseburg israel has announced a gradual release of customs duties and value-added tax revenues collected on behalf of the palestinian authority and worth some $ 700 million that it has withheld since the establishment of the hamas-led government in march 2006 .
it has also promised to lift a few roadblocks in the west bank , dismantle some settlement outposts and allow weapon deliveries such as armoured vehicles to strengthen fatah . but all these measures are far from sufficient to trigger a new dynamic and to tangibly improve the situation in the west bank : as long as the system of roadblocks and permits remains in place , the palestinian economy will not see a sustainable recovery . an approach that pins hopes on a military confrontation between fatah and hamas will not stabilize the situation either .
instead , it carries the danger of a renewed flare-up of internal palestinian fighting and its escalation into a civil war . also , increasing the pressure on the population in the gaza strip is hardly possible without causing a humanitarian catastrophe .
the official unemployment rate in the region is already at some 35 percent , the poverty rate at above 75 percent .
around two thirds of the population depend on international aid deliveries .
the danger of economic isolation then is to radicalize the gaza strip ’ s population and to increase the attraction of salafist and jihadist groups – which , in contrast to hamas , neither have a national agenda nor an interest in stabilization . the new-old approach of the international community is contributing to making the vision of a two-state settlement increasingly unrealistic .
this is because it sacrifices the creation of functioning and democratic palestinian institutions in favour of short-term stability .
and because it does nothing to prevent the ever greater erosion of a contiguous territory for a palestinian state – which is a result of the separation barrier , the expansion of settlements and the corresponding transportation network in the west bank . german and european policies should therefore concentrate on averting a humanitarian catastrophe in the gaza strip and on creating conditions for an economic revival both there and in the west bank .
they should avoid undermining reconciliation among palestinian factions , support improved governance of palestinian institutions and take serious steps to achieve a two-state settlement in cooperation with the middle east quartet and the arab peace initiative . muriel asseburg is head of the research unit for the middle east and africa at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 13.07.2007 opinion : prior debate overshadows integration summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whatever reasons three turkish groups had for boycotting germany 's second integration summit , their absence overshadowed the entire event , according to dw commentator peter philipp . it all could have all been so nice : the chancellor 's second " integration summit " presents a " national integration plan " in which hundreds of measures on integrating immigrants are put down on paper .
but the result was clouded by the decision of various turkish associations to abstain from attending the summit , and it 's been clear for days that the atmosphere of the first summit , which took place in 2006 , would not be replicated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp the associations are annoyed that the german government did not sufficiently consult with them about tightening an immigration law , critics say .
though not explicitly named , turkish immigrants are particularly discriminated against , the associations also said .
not only because they make the largest group of so-called " migrants , " but also for concrete reasons : spouses have to learn german in their home countries and have to be at least 18 years old before they can come to germany .
the irritated turkish association pushed forward a debate that more than clearly demonstrated how poorly the law handles integration .
some of the associations ' representatives even spoke of it violating their human rights .
" absurd , " the politicians countered , adding that raising the age of immigration to 18 would avoid forced marriages .
and secondly , it must be clear that people who want to live in germany should speak german .
the politicians do n't bring up the fact that this is n't quite as easy in anatolian villages as in new york or tokyo - where the condition is n't even being imposed .
not to mention that german is best learnt in germany .
the turkish groups - somewhat unskillfully - gave the impression that they wanted to put pressure on the government .
but german politicians tried to trivialize the situation and insinuate that the groups wanted to prevent what is clear to everyone and questioned by few : that the integration of immigrants is important and that language skills are , naturally , required .
but acquiring language skills in anatolia - even if it 's just the " 300 words " that german politicians suddenly say are necessary - is a hurdle for the people who live there and want to move to germany .
while talking about avoiding forced marriages may be politically beneficial , it can not be achieved by raising the age of immigration and certainly not by 300 german words .
these are problems that have to be solved in germany .
and that has to be done on equal footing with the immigrants , as the politicians like to say .
this is what should have happened before the changes were made to the immigration law .
then we could have saved ourselves a lot of aggravation , and some things could have really improved .

the computer-generated creature is part of an exhibit opening friday at the museum of natural history in berlin . what sounds like a scene from the adventure film jurassic park can be seen in a computer animation exhibit that opened friday at berlin 's museum of natural history . but the " evolution in action " exhibit , housed in four renovated halls , is intended to act as a bridge between scientific research and everyday life . the star of the exhibit is a 13-meter-high and 15-meter-long -lrb- 42.6 foot-high and 49.2-foot long -rrb- brachiosaurus , the tallest dinosaur model ever mounted in a museum .
five additional skeletons from the museum 's collection of 150-million-year-old dinosaurs from tanzania 's mount tendaguru are also on display , along with fossil plants and animals that lived in eastern africa at the same time . brachiosaurus , taller than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the record breaking brachiosaurus model in its new home the dinosaur skeletons , discovered by german researchers in tanzania 100 years ago , had to be dismantled and conserved while restoration work costing 18 million euros -lrb- $ 24 million -rrb- was carried out in the 120-year-old museum , which is part of berlin 's humboldt university . each individual piece , from toe to teeth , was covered in a protective layer and reassembled in new steel corsets .
a crane was needed to rebuild the brachiosaurus - a process which took several weeks .
after reconstruction , the creature 's head is not one meter higher than it was before , in accordance with the latest scientific research .
the colossus also stands more upright and is presented as running when seen through the light of the hall 's glass-domed roof .
scoping the jurassic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a crane was needed to rebuild the brachiosaurus in a process taking several weeks positioned close to the skeletons are binoculars or jurascopes , as museum director reinhold leinfelder called them , which enable visitors to see the tendaguru world as if they had actually been there 150 million years ago .
animated films show the dinosaurs smacking their lips and letting out loud roars as they trample through the prehistoric landscape .
though the exhibit makes use of the most up-to-date information , the jurascopes remain an imaginative exercise as experts do n't know what colors the dinosaurs were or how their roars sounded . dw staff / dpa -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she likes to read and meet with her friends .
but where she is above average is in the classroom .
she has just passed the high school exam taken by 18-year-olds . child prodigies : you either love them -lrb- if they 're your own -rrb- or hate them -lrb- if you 're a jealous classmate -rrb- .
some turn out to be precocious little brats who know exactly how brainy they are ; they never stop telling others about how brainy they are and then they start their own computer software firm to prove how brainy they are .
others quietly go about the business of overachieving , leave education with awards falling out of their spongebob squarepants rucksack and go on to make a real difference in the world .
from the level-headed and unassuming way young minu dietlinde tizabi has completed the german version of the high school diploma at the tender age of 14 , the indications are that she will join the second group .
tizabi not only completed the abitur exam four years earlier than usual but she passed with the highest possible grade , a 1.0 .
out of a maximum of 840 points she could have scored on the test , the youngster from pforzheim racked up an amazing 815 .
a reader and writer of english bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harry potter : one of minu 's preferred reads but " just a book " the grounded teenager , who lost her mother when she was just a month old and was raised by her father , does n't see anything special in her results .
her friend hanna , after all , scored more than her .
hanna scored 835 points - but she is 18 .
" i do n't study more than any of the others , " tizabi said in an interview with spiegel magazine .
" but i do have a lot of hobbies .
for example i took part in the biology olympic games , just out of interest . "
now that she is a high school graduate , tizabi said she did n't have any special plans for the summer vacation - other than pursuing her usual interests in literature and creative writing .
" i love to read , especially in english , " she said .
" and i also write my own stories in english .
i read the harry potter books in english … i think they 're good but the whole thing is exaggerated .
it 's just a book like any other . "
some children already show an aptitude for learning at very early ages .
tizabi was definitely one of these .
as a one year old , she was constructing the toys which came with her favorite chocolate eggs .
she was reading at three , tackling encyclopedias and studying astronomy books .
at age six , she went to school and immediately jumped three years .
swiftly up the education ladder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minu immediately leapt three classes when starting school " in total , i have jumped four classes , " she said .
" because i could read so well , i was moved up as soon as i started school .
when i started high school , i was moved up a year within three weeks of starting .
all my friends were three and four years older than me . "
despite the tragedy of losing her mother at such an early age , tizabi has certainly prospered under her father 's guidance .
father djamshid , an iranian-born certified engineer in quantum electronics , is obviously no slouch either and has not only instilled a love of learning in his daughter but has given her the humility that he himself shows .
" she is no child prodigy , " he said matter-of-factly in a recent interview with a local newspaper .
" she is quite normal . "
while she more than keeps up with her classmates in the academic stakes , there is one aspect of school in which tizabi does show her age : sports .
she is a lot smaller than her classmates and , as a result , has been taken out of physical education classes for her own good .
in the class , however , she is seen as a peer - by most of her classmates .
" with the girls , it was always okay , " she said .
" but the boys have never completely accepted me .
why , i do not know .
i do n't feel that there is any envy . "
a career in medicine beckons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 14-year-old dreams of a career in medical research it appears that the future is hers for the taking and tizabi already has a plan forming as to what she would like to do with her life .
" i would like to study medicine and then work in research , " the 14-year-old said .
" medical research can save lives , this is very important .
therefore , i think that this is a great occupational goal .
i would most like to study in heidelberg as the university is very good there , especially for studying medicine . "
and while age has not yet been a barrier to her achievements , does tizabi worry that her tender years may go against her in the future ?
" right now , my age is n't a problem in the application process and i have had only positive reactions from the universities . "
" however , if i do get a place at a university to study … my father will have to go there and sign a parental consent form ! " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tax payers ' day is the day of the year from which on people don ’ t work to pay taxes anymore , but just for themselves .
this day is proclaimed by tax payers ' unions worldwide : in the united states , it falls on april 30th , and in the uk , on june 3rd .
the date is calculated by dividing the amount of all taxes collected by all the income earned in a given year .
in germany , the authorities - federal , state and local - will take 53 percent of income this year .
with a little math , this puts german tax payer 's day to july 13th .
a misleading calculation ?
but it 's a calculation the german finance ministry calls misleading .
" it 's a one-sided interpretation of the data that does little to judge the actual situation , " ministry spokesman torsten albig said , adding that the association 's estimate of state spending is considerably higher than that of the federal bank and other economic institutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state will be taking about 53 pecent of what 's in there after reading a report in the handelsblatt newspaper , however , some germans may still call for the country 's tax payers ' memorial day to be moved to earlier in the year and ask to keep more than 47 cents per euro they make .
federal and state finance offices saw the total tax income increase faster than it expected in the first half of 2007 , according to the german business paper .
citing anonymous finance ministry sources , the paper said the ministry took in 238.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 329 billion -rrb- in the first half of 2007 , 29 billion euros more than in for the same period of 2006 , an increase of 13.9 percent .
an official report , scheduled to be released next week , is also reported to show that june tax revenues were nearly 50 billion euros , 12.6 percent more than in june 2006 .
lower unemployment is one of the key reasons why the state 's revenues have increased , according to the german finance ministry .
" the deciding factor comes mainly from the increase compared to last year of tax contributions through the social welfare system , " the ministry said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some turn out to be precocious little brats who know exactly how brainy they are ; they never stop telling others about how brainy they are and then they start their own computer software firm to prove how brainy they are .
others quietly go about the business of overachieving , leave education with awards falling out of their spongebob squarepants rucksack and go on to make a real difference in the world .
from the level-headed and unassuming way young minu dietlinde tizabi has completed the german version of the high school diploma at the tender age of 14 , the indications are that she will join the second group .
tizabi not only completed the abitur exam four years earlier than usual but she passed with the highest possible grade , a 1.0 .

" and i also write my own stories in english .
i read the harry potter books in english … i think they 're good but the whole thing is exaggerated .

" because i could read so well , i was moved up as soon as i started school .
when i started high school , i was moved up a year within three weeks of starting .
all my friends were three and four years older than me . "
despite the tragedy of losing her mother at such an early age , tizabi has certainly prospered under her father 's guidance .
father djamshid , an iranian-born certified engineer in quantum electronics , is obviously no slouch either and has not only instilled a love of learning in his daughter but has given her the humility that he himself shows .
" she is no child prodigy , " he said matter-of-factly in a recent interview with a local newspaper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 13.07.2007 in europe , iraqi asylum-seekers find doors being shut großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi bodyguard muhannad yousif who sought a new life in sweden experts have criticized germany 's policies towards iraqi asylum-seekers as too restrictive .
fearful of a refugee influx , however , other european nations have started tightening their asylum rules . " when you go out in baghdad , there 's a 50 percent chance you may never come home , " said murad atshan , an iraqi filmmaker living in germany . anyone who follows news of daily suicide bombings , a bloody insurgency and sectarian violence in the iraqi capital will probably nod in agreement at the statement .
german authorities in munich , however , rejected atshan 's application for asylum a year ago , saying he did n't give a good enough reason for seeking protection . the 27-year-old has since been confined to a refugee center in a tiny village in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , near the swiss border . while german authorities are deciding what to do with him , atshan is n't allowed to leave the district or work . " it 's very frustrating , " he said .
" i did n't come here looking for a good life , i just wanted to be somewhere safe .
but this is no normal life . " in addition to worrying about his family back home in baghdad , atshan is grappling with getting used to life in a small foreign village . " i 'm used to living in big cities , " he said . " i ca n't even go to the movies here . " living in limbo atshan 's case is depressingly familiar in the country whose complicated asylum and refugee laws have come under increasing criticism from aid and refugee groups .
germany is home to an estimated 73,000 iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi family at a refugee home in germany experts say german asylum rules date back to the 1990s when tens of thousands of iraqis fleeing saddam hussein 's dictatorship applied for and easily received asylum status in germany on grounds of political persecution . " the moment saddam was toppled in 2003 , however , the german government sent out letters to thousands of iraqis saying their asylum status would be revoked since the persecutor was now gone , " said bernd mesovic of campaign group proasyl .
" it 's as if the authorities did n't watch television and did n't know what 's happening in iraq . " last year , german authorities stripped 8,189 refugees of their asylum status .
this week , human rights watch slammed germany 's move earlier this year to revoke the refugee status of over 18,000 iraqis . " losing your asylum status has serious repercussions , " said marianne heuwagen , head of the german section of human rights watch , because it can lead to reduced social benefits and severe restrictions on work , mobility and unification with family members . " in others words , it leaves you in limbo and with an uncertain future , " she said . civil war not asylum-worthy german authorities admit that iraqis seeking asylum must now prove they face personal risk in their homeland .
general instability or civil war is not reason enough to grant asylum though it is sufficient to put a freeze on deportations . at the same time , revoking asylum status does not automatically mean iraqis will be sent back home , said claudia moebus , spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis in baghdad have to live with daily car and suicide bombings " each refugee has the right to appeal and each individual case is carefully considered before any decision is taken , " moebus said . she added that german authorities had also reversed their recent decision to strip 18,000 iraqis of their refugee status with the exceptions of criminals and those who returned to northern iraq , which is considered relatively stable .
she declined to give exact figures . liberal sweden puts up barriers germany is not alone in its restrictive attitude towards iraqi asylum-seekers . experts point out that most eu nations remain reluctant to take in iraqi asylum-seekers even though those who knock on their doors make up only a fraction of the estimated four million displaced since the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
neighboring jordan and syria have taken in two million , while another two million remain uprooted within iraq . last year , just about 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the bloc . sweden has thus far stood out among europeans for having the most welcoming attitude and taking in the highest numbers of iraqi asylum-seekers - some 9,000 alone last year .
many of the refugees in sweden have joined existing iraqi communities in towns such as malmo on the southwest coast . last week , however , the country , which has long called on other eu members to shoulder the burden , said it 's tightening its asylum rules and will forcibly deport iraqis who are denied permission to stay . " asylum a dangerous lottery " " asylum in europe has become a dangerous lottery , " said richard williams of the european council of refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , referring to the disparate practices among eu nations on granting asylum . " generally every european country is afraid of being seen as too attractive to asylum-seekers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi refugee djabar lafte latif who lives in saxony-anhalt in germany in addition to german and swedish restrictions , britain , in particular , and denmark have sent iraqis back home .
experts are also concerned that the policies of these countries are not in accordance with international treaties such as the geneva convention . in addition to plodding moves towards a harmonized eu asylum policy - a goal hoped to be achieved by 2010 - some say european leaders need to do more to sell the idea of asylum on humanitarian grounds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de taxes -pipe- 13.07.2007 german tax income higher than expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german finance ministry called the association of tax payers ' calculation " silly " with 53 percent of the year gone , german employees , as of friday at 11:40 a.m. , have earned enough to pay their annual tax bill , while a german newspaper said more money than expected will be flowing into state coffers . coldly calculated through the year , it takes germans 194 days of work to pay their tax bill , according to karl heinz däke , president of the german association of tax payers , which calculates the so-called " income burden rate " each year .
tax payers ' day is the day of the year from which on people don ’ t work to pay taxes anymore , but just for themselves .
this day is proclaimed by tax payers ' unions worldwide : in the united states , it falls on april 30th , and in the uk , on june 3rd .
the date is calculated by dividing the amount of all taxes collected by all the income earned in a given year .
in germany , the authorities - federal , state and local - will take 53 percent of income this year .
with a little math , this puts german tax payer 's day to july 13th .
a misleading calculation ?
but it 's a calculation the german finance ministry calls misleading .
" it 's a one-sided interpretation of the data that does little to judge the actual situation , " ministry spokesman torsten albig said , adding that the association 's estimate of state spending is considerably higher than that of the federal bank and other economic institutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state will be taking about 53 pecent of what 's in there after reading a report in the handelsblatt newspaper , however , some germans may still call for the country 's tax payers ' memorial day to be moved to earlier in the year and ask to keep more than 47 cents per euro they make .
federal and state finance offices saw the total tax income increase faster than it expected in the first half of 2007 , according to the german business paper .
citing anonymous finance ministry sources , the paper said the ministry took in 238.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 329 billion -rrb- in the first half of 2007 , 29 billion euros more than in for the same period of 2006 , an increase of 13.9 percent .
an official report , scheduled to be released next week , is also reported to show that june tax revenues were nearly 50 billion euros , 12.6 percent more than in june 2006 .
lower unemployment is one of the key reasons why the state 's revenues have increased , according to the german finance ministry .
" the deciding factor comes mainly from the increase compared to last year of tax contributions through the social welfare system , " the ministry said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 13.07.2007 proposal to promote german citizenship divides parties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians ca n't agree on whether to push immigrants to take on german citizenship one day after german chancellor angela merkel termed the country 's second integration summit a success , a social democratic politician has called for a new program to encourage immigrants to take on german citizenship . sebastian edathy , chairman of the bundestag 's interior committee and senior member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , called on friday for more political involvement on the part of immigrants in germany .
he suggested launching a " citizenship campaign " to persuade foreigners to change their nationality .
" we should persuade people who have a right to citizenship to do more than be just residents and to become citizens , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
but edathy 's idea was met with skepticism in the conservative ranks of the german political establishment .
stephan mayer , parliamentary head for the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , questioned whether giving citizenship to foreigners would lead to better integration .
" awarding citizenship can only take place at the end of a successful integration process , certainly not at the beginning , " mayer said .
" the state can not offer citizenship as a concession . "
a sensitive issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners have to give up their previous citizenship to become german the integration issue in germany has been traditionally plagued by the widely divergent positions of the spd and the cdu / csu - now united under the umbrella of merkel 's grand coalition government .
foreigners , who are not married to german citizens , currently obtain the right to apply for german citizenship if they have been legally living in germany for at least eight years , if they can financially support themselves and their families without state aid , if they possess sufficient german language skills , have not been convicted of a crime , and if they avow they will adhere to germany 's basic law and democratic principles .
by adopting german citizenship , foreigners living in germany are also expected to give up any other citizenship they have .
extending local voting rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu citizens can participate in local elections wherever in the bloc they live edathy also said germany should provide some foreigners with a right to vote in local elections .
" it is key that we improve migrants ' political participation by a right to vote in municipal election for foreigners who have lived in germany for a long time , " he said .
while federal and state elections are open only to a country 's citizens , the european union law opened municipal elections across the 27-member bloc to all eu citizens who are local residents , even if they are not citizens of the country where they live .
" i do n't think much of extending the right to vote because it does n't contribute to integration , " bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein told deutschlandfunk radio on friday .
" integration is a hard task : namely learning the legal system , leaning that you can speak the language and that you fit in to society . "
new ideas after integration summit edathy 's suggestions were not subject to discussion at germany 's second integration summit on thursday , which dealt with proposals from six working groups on how to improve the integration of immigrants living in germany .
despite the decision of some turkish groups to boycott the meeting in protest of a recent law placing additional restrictions on some foreigners before they are allowed to move to germany , merkel called the day-long meeting a success and " milestone " for the country 's integration efforts .
representatives of the federal government , the states and some 90 community leaders at the summit adopted a " national integration plan " containing 400 promises for improvements - ranging from aid for ethnic sports clubs to making more german-language classes available . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the result was clouded by the decision of various turkish associations to abstain from attending the summit , and it 's been clear for days that the atmosphere of the first summit , which took place in 2006 , would not be replicated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp the associations are annoyed that the german government did not sufficiently consult with them about tightening an immigration law , critics say .

not only because they make the largest group of so-called " migrants , " but also for concrete reasons : spouses have to learn german in their home countries and have to be at least 18 years old before they can come to germany .
the irritated turkish association pushed forward a debate that more than clearly demonstrated how poorly the law handles integration .
some of the associations ' representatives even spoke of it violating their human rights .
" absurd , " the politicians countered , adding that raising the age of immigration to 18 would avoid forced marriages .
and secondly , it must be clear that people who want to live in germany should speak german .
the politicians do n't bring up the fact that this is n't quite as easy in anatolian villages as in new york or tokyo - where the condition is n't even being imposed .
not to mention that german is best learnt in germany .
the turkish groups - somewhat unskillfully - gave the impression that they wanted to put pressure on the government .
but german politicians tried to trivialize the situation and insinuate that the groups wanted to prevent what is clear to everyone and questioned by few : that the integration of immigrants is important and that language skills are , naturally , required .
but acquiring language skills in anatolia - even if it 's just the " 300 words " that german politicians suddenly say are necessary - is a hurdle for the people who live there and want to move to germany .
while talking about avoiding forced marriages may be politically beneficial , it can not be achieved by raising the age of immigration and certainly not by 300 german words .
these are problems that have to be solved in germany .
and that has to be done on equal footing with the immigrants , as the politicians like to say .
this is what should have happened before the changes were made to the immigration law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 13.07.2007 in europe , iraqi asylum-seekers find doors being shut großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi bodyguard muhannad yousif who sought a new life in sweden experts have criticized germany 's policies towards iraqi asylum-seekers as too restrictive .
fearful of a refugee influx , however , other european nations have started tightening their asylum rules . " when you go out in baghdad , there 's a 50 percent chance you may never come home , " said murad atshan , an iraqi filmmaker living in germany . anyone who follows news of daily suicide bombings , a bloody insurgency and sectarian violence in the iraqi capital will probably nod in agreement at the statement .
german authorities in munich , however , rejected atshan 's application for asylum a year ago , saying he did n't give a good enough reason for seeking protection . the 27-year-old has since been confined to a refugee center in a tiny village in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , near the swiss border . while german authorities are deciding what to do with him , atshan is n't allowed to leave the district or work . " it 's very frustrating , " he said .
" i did n't come here looking for a good life , i just wanted to be somewhere safe .
but this is no normal life . " in addition to worrying about his family back home in baghdad , atshan is grappling with getting used to life in a small foreign village . " i 'm used to living in big cities , " he said . " i ca n't even go to the movies here . " living in limbo atshan 's case is depressingly familiar in the country whose complicated asylum and refugee laws have come under increasing criticism from aid and refugee groups .
germany is home to an estimated 73,000 iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi family at a refugee home in germany experts say german asylum rules date back to the 1990s when tens of thousands of iraqis fleeing saddam hussein 's dictatorship applied for and easily received asylum status in germany on grounds of political persecution . " the moment saddam was toppled in 2003 , however , the german government sent out letters to thousands of iraqis saying their asylum status would be revoked since the persecutor was now gone , " said bernd mesovic of campaign group proasyl .
" it 's as if the authorities did n't watch television and did n't know what 's happening in iraq . " last year , german authorities stripped 8,189 refugees of their asylum status .
this week , human rights watch slammed germany 's move earlier this year to revoke the refugee status of over 18,000 iraqis . " losing your asylum status has serious repercussions , " said marianne heuwagen , head of the german section of human rights watch , because it can lead to reduced social benefits and severe restrictions on work , mobility and unification with family members . " in others words , it leaves you in limbo and with an uncertain future , " she said . civil war not asylum-worthy german authorities admit that iraqis seeking asylum must now prove they face personal risk in their homeland .
general instability or civil war is not reason enough to grant asylum though it is sufficient to put a freeze on deportations . at the same time , revoking asylum status does not automatically mean iraqis will be sent back home , said claudia moebus , spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis in baghdad have to live with daily car and suicide bombings " each refugee has the right to appeal and each individual case is carefully considered before any decision is taken , " moebus said . she added that german authorities had also reversed their recent decision to strip 18,000 iraqis of their refugee status with the exceptions of criminals and those who returned to northern iraq , which is considered relatively stable .
she declined to give exact figures . liberal sweden puts up barriers germany is not alone in its restrictive attitude towards iraqi asylum-seekers . experts point out that most eu nations remain reluctant to take in iraqi asylum-seekers even though those who knock on their doors make up only a fraction of the estimated four million displaced since the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
neighboring jordan and syria have taken in two million , while another two million remain uprooted within iraq . last year , just about 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the bloc . sweden has thus far stood out among europeans for having the most welcoming attitude and taking in the highest numbers of iraqi asylum-seekers - some 9,000 alone last year .
many of the refugees in sweden have joined existing iraqi communities in towns such as malmo on the southwest coast . last week , however , the country , which has long called on other eu members to shoulder the burden , said it 's tightening its asylum rules and will forcibly deport iraqis who are denied permission to stay . " asylum a dangerous lottery " " asylum in europe has become a dangerous lottery , " said richard williams of the european council of refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , referring to the disparate practices among eu nations on granting asylum . " generally every european country is afraid of being seen as too attractive to asylum-seekers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi refugee djabar lafte latif who lives in saxony-anhalt in germany in addition to german and swedish restrictions , britain , in particular , and denmark have sent iraqis back home .
experts are also concerned that the policies of these countries are not in accordance with international treaties such as the geneva convention . in addition to plodding moves towards a harmonized eu asylum policy - a goal hoped to be achieved by 2010 - some say european leaders need to do more to sell the idea of asylum on humanitarian grounds . " asylum and migration remain major political fault lines in europe , " williams said .

fearful of a refugee influx , however , other european nations have started tightening their asylum rules . " when you go out in baghdad , there 's a 50 percent chance you may never come home , " said murad atshan , an iraqi filmmaker living in germany . anyone who follows news of daily suicide bombings , a bloody insurgency and sectarian violence in the iraqi capital will probably nod in agreement at the statement .
german authorities in munich , however , rejected atshan 's application for asylum a year ago , saying he did n't give a good enough reason for seeking protection . the 27-year-old has since been confined to a refugee center in a tiny village in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , near the swiss border . while german authorities are deciding what to do with him , atshan is n't allowed to leave the district or work . " it 's very frustrating , " he said .
" i did n't come here looking for a good life , i just wanted to be somewhere safe .
but this is no normal life . " in addition to worrying about his family back home in baghdad , atshan is grappling with getting used to life in a small foreign village . " i 'm used to living in big cities , " he said . " i ca n't even go to the movies here . " living in limbo atshan 's case is depressingly familiar in the country whose complicated asylum and refugee laws have come under increasing criticism from aid and refugee groups .
germany is home to an estimated 73,000 iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi family at a refugee home in germany experts say german asylum rules date back to the 1990s when tens of thousands of iraqis fleeing saddam hussein 's dictatorship applied for and easily received asylum status in germany on grounds of political persecution . " the moment saddam was toppled in 2003 , however , the german government sent out letters to thousands of iraqis saying their asylum status would be revoked since the persecutor was now gone , " said bernd mesovic of campaign group proasyl .
" it 's as if the authorities did n't watch television and did n't know what 's happening in iraq . " last year , german authorities stripped 8,189 refugees of their asylum status .
this week , human rights watch slammed germany 's move earlier this year to revoke the refugee status of over 18,000 iraqis . " losing your asylum status has serious repercussions , " said marianne heuwagen , head of the german section of human rights watch , because it can lead to reduced social benefits and severe restrictions on work , mobility and unification with family members . " in others words , it leaves you in limbo and with an uncertain future , " she said . civil war not asylum-worthy german authorities admit that iraqis seeking asylum must now prove they face personal risk in their homeland .
general instability or civil war is not reason enough to grant asylum though it is sufficient to put a freeze on deportations . at the same time , revoking asylum status does not automatically mean iraqis will be sent back home , said claudia moebus , spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis in baghdad have to live with daily car and suicide bombings " each refugee has the right to appeal and each individual case is carefully considered before any decision is taken , " moebus said . she added that german authorities had also reversed their recent decision to strip 18,000 iraqis of their refugee status with the exceptions of criminals and those who returned to northern iraq , which is considered relatively stable .
she declined to give exact figures . liberal sweden puts up barriers germany is not alone in its restrictive attitude towards iraqi asylum-seekers . experts point out that most eu nations remain reluctant to take in iraqi asylum-seekers even though those who knock on their doors make up only a fraction of the estimated four million displaced since the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
neighboring jordan and syria have taken in two million , while another two million remain uprooted within iraq . last year , just about 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the bloc . sweden has thus far stood out among europeans for having the most welcoming attitude and taking in the highest numbers of iraqi asylum-seekers - some 9,000 alone last year .
many of the refugees in sweden have joined existing iraqi communities in towns such as malmo on the southwest coast . last week , however , the country , which has long called on other eu members to shoulder the burden , said it 's tightening its asylum rules and will forcibly deport iraqis who are denied permission to stay . " asylum a dangerous lottery " " asylum in europe has become a dangerous lottery , " said richard williams of the european council of refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , referring to the disparate practices among eu nations on granting asylum . " generally every european country is afraid of being seen as too attractive to asylum-seekers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi refugee djabar lafte latif who lives in saxony-anhalt in germany in addition to german and swedish restrictions , britain , in particular , and denmark have sent iraqis back home .
experts are also concerned that the policies of these countries are not in accordance with international treaties such as the geneva convention . in addition to plodding moves towards a harmonized eu asylum policy - a goal hoped to be achieved by 2010 - some say european leaders need to do more to sell the idea of asylum on humanitarian grounds . " asylum and migration remain major political fault lines in europe , " williams said .

"
nord stream bosses wo n't know for sure until at least 2010 the german-russian gas pipeline saga continues with a new disputed region causing a rethink over its route .
the nord stream consortium is again forced into finding an alternative direction for its maligned project . when it is finally completed , the planned russian-german natural gas pipeline may have more twists and turns than a bowl of spaghetti .
a spokesman for the nord stream consortium said wednesday that the disputed pipeline would again have to change its route after it was revealed a section had been earmarked for a stretch of water that both poland and denmark claim as an exclusive economic zone .
in april this year , nord stream - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - had its plans for running a stretch of the pipeline through estonian waters thrown into doubt over fears that it could disturb unexploded munitions and chemical dumps from world war ii .
such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry at the time .
this latest obstacle to the 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 750-mile -rrb- pipeline may prove to be more concrete in its disruption .
both denmark and poland claim the ownership of the area and nord stream is reluctant to get involved with any dispute .
pipeline consortium resorts to plan b ... or c bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord stream has had to adapt its plans after complaints now accustomed to the need to redirect the pipeline when opposition arises , nord stream said that it already has an alternative route that it proposes to take to avoid the disputed territory .
the consortium would attempt to squeeze the pipeline between the danish island of bornholm and sweden 's southeastern coast ; although nord stream stated that no final decision had been made .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
several coastal nations have expressed concern over the pipeline which is to deliver natural gas from russia to germany , saying it will damage the baltic sea 's delicate ecosystem .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment while sweden in particular has complained that the pipeline could disrupt the baltic sea ’ s sensitive flora and fauna .
study hopes to alleviate environmental fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns over the pipeline 's route out at sea in accordance with the european union rules , nord stream is required to furnish an environmental impact assessment -lrb- eia -rrb- to those countries whose territorial waters would be affected .
the consortium is expected to do so later this year .
" nord stream has decided to launch additional studies to investigate areas where the route of the pipeline through the baltic sea can be further optimized in a reasonable way to minimize environmental impacts , " the consortium said in a statement earlier this year . the pipeline has also created political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
in-between nations concerned at duopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schröder co-developed the project the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
the fact that the project was negotiated by russia and germany without consulting the countries between them has also created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the recent heightening of political tensions between russia and estonia has also left many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
if completed by 2010 as planned , the 1,200-kilometer pipeline would pump 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year from vyborg , russia to greifswald in northern germany .
in a second phase , a parallel pipeline would double that transport capacity , and nord stream estimates that will meet about 25 percent of the additional gas needs of the european union . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the gaza strip is controlled by hamas , the west bank is ruled by an emergency government under salam fayyad in cooperation with the president and fatah chairman , mahmoud abbas . israel and the international community have interpreted the split as a chance .
thus , the islamists in the gaza strip could be more easily isolated and the emergency government in the west bank could be a partner for the resumption of cooperation , economic development and a diplomatic process .
" flourishing landscapes " and new freedom of movement in the west bank would convince the palestinian population of fatah being the right choice for the future . but the " hamastan vs fatah-land " -approach is hugely unrealistic . bildunterschrift : muriel asseburg israel has announced a gradual release of customs duties and value-added tax revenues collected on behalf of the palestinian authority and worth some $ 700 million that it has withheld since the establishment of the hamas-led government in march 2006 .
it has also promised to lift a few roadblocks in the west bank , dismantle some settlement outposts and allow weapon deliveries such as armoured vehicles to strengthen fatah . but all these measures are far from sufficient to trigger a new dynamic and to tangibly improve the situation in the west bank : as long as the system of roadblocks and permits remains in place , the palestinian economy will not see a sustainable recovery . an approach that pins hopes on a military confrontation between fatah and hamas will not stabilize the situation either .
instead , it carries the danger of a renewed flare-up of internal palestinian fighting and its escalation into a civil war . also , increasing the pressure on the population in the gaza strip is hardly possible without causing a humanitarian catastrophe .
the official unemployment rate in the region is already at some 35 percent , the poverty rate at above 75 percent .
around two thirds of the population depend on international aid deliveries .
the danger of economic isolation then is to radicalize the gaza strip ’ s population and to increase the attraction of salafist and jihadist groups – which , in contrast to hamas , neither have a national agenda nor an interest in stabilization . the new-old approach of the international community is contributing to making the vision of a two-state settlement increasingly unrealistic .
this is because it sacrifices the creation of functioning and democratic palestinian institutions in favour of short-term stability .
and because it does nothing to prevent the ever greater erosion of a contiguous territory for a palestinian state – which is a result of the separation barrier , the expansion of settlements and the corresponding transportation network in the west bank . german and european policies should therefore concentrate on averting a humanitarian catastrophe in the gaza strip and on creating conditions for an economic revival both there and in the west bank .
they should avoid undermining reconciliation among palestinian factions , support improved governance of palestinian institutions and take serious steps to achieve a two-state settlement in cooperation with the middle east quartet and the arab peace initiative . muriel asseburg is head of the research unit for the middle east and africa at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a clemency deal could be in the offing . " the court rejects the appeals of the defendants and confirms the death penalty , " judge fathi dahn said after a five-minute hearing . the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor were found guilty late last year of intentional infecting more than 400 libyan children with hiv in the late 1990s .
all worked in the al-fateh children 's hospital in the city of benghazi . the defendants have been incarcerated since 1999 .
they deny intentionally infecting the children and claim that they were tortured while in libyan prisons , saying the confessions at the center of the prosecution 's case were coerced . in 2003 , a french doctor charged with investigating the outbreak of hiv at the hospital found that it had started before the six medics arrived there . the sentence has become an international political issue , with bulgaria , the eu and the us urging libya not to carry out the executions .

the council will meet on july 16 . " we hope things will be clear on monday , " bulgaria 's prime minister sergei stanishev said on bulgarian radio .
" the decision of the council will open the way for solving the case on a political level and will be the final step in the talks held in the last few months . " there has been speculation that the six medics could be freed in exchange for money to provide for the infected children 's medical care . on tuesday , it was reported that such an agreement had been mediated by the gadhafi foundation , a charity organization run by one of the sons of libyan leader moammar gadhafi . but the families of the children have reportedly asked for 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.7 million -rrb- in compensation per child , a sum the eu has been unwilling to pay .

" ecofin agrees to support dominique strauss-kahn for imf director , " the presidency said , using eu shorthand for the meeting of finance ministers in brussels tuesday . french president nicolas sarkozy , a conservative , had named strauss-kahn , a social democrat , who failed to win his party 's presidential nomination in the 2007 election , as his favorite candidate .
strauss-kahn served as french finance minister in the past . the nomination means that strauss-kahn is likely to get the job since under an informal agreement , europe chooses the head of the imf while the us picks the leader of the world bank . in a surprise announcement late last month , current imf managing director rodrigo rato said that he would step down in october . respected candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy nominated strauss-kahn strauss-kahn , 58 , is a respected advocate of social democratic economics .
germany and the netherlands said strauss-kahn was suited for the job , but added that other candidates existed as well . poland proposed its own candidate , marek belka , a left-leaning economist who twice served as poland 's finance minister and prime minister in 2004-2005 . british finance minister alistair darling , however , said the position should not just be open to europeans , but to to candidates from other parts of the world . " we think there needs to be an opportunity for all members of the imf to make their own assessment as to individual candidates ... and then , of course , pick the best candidate for the job , " he told reporters . developing nations , for their part , are challenging assumptions that europeans and americans should divvy up top jobs in global finance . they argue that the structure no longer reflects the balance of economic power since the rise of china and other countries . dutch finance minister wouter bos said the post should be open to all but europe should not give up its claims . " if we have a good european candidate , we should go for it , " he said . last week , the united states indicated it would not challenge europe 's claim on the imf leader role since it had just picked american robert zoellick for the top world bank job . dw staff -lrb- win / als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
nord stream bosses wo n't know for sure until at least 2010 the german-russian gas pipeline saga continues with a new disputed region causing a rethink over its route .
the nord stream consortium is again forced into finding an alternative direction for its maligned project . when it is finally completed , the planned russian-german natural gas pipeline may have more twists and turns than a bowl of spaghetti .
a spokesman for the nord stream consortium said wednesday that the disputed pipeline would again have to change its route after it was revealed a section had been earmarked for a stretch of water that both poland and denmark claim as an exclusive economic zone .
in april this year , nord stream - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - had its plans for running a stretch of the pipeline through estonian waters thrown into doubt over fears that it could disturb unexploded munitions and chemical dumps from world war ii .
such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry at the time .
this latest obstacle to the 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 750-mile -rrb- pipeline may prove to be more concrete in its disruption .
both denmark and poland claim the ownership of the area and nord stream is reluctant to get involved with any dispute .
pipeline consortium resorts to plan b ... or c bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord stream has had to adapt its plans after complaints now accustomed to the need to redirect the pipeline when opposition arises , nord stream said that it already has an alternative route that it proposes to take to avoid the disputed territory .
the consortium would attempt to squeeze the pipeline between the danish island of bornholm and sweden 's southeastern coast ; although nord stream stated that no final decision had been made .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
several coastal nations have expressed concern over the pipeline which is to deliver natural gas from russia to germany , saying it will damage the baltic sea 's delicate ecosystem .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment while sweden in particular has complained that the pipeline could disrupt the baltic sea ’ s sensitive flora and fauna .
study hopes to alleviate environmental fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns over the pipeline 's route out at sea in accordance with the european union rules , nord stream is required to furnish an environmental impact assessment -lrb- eia -rrb- to those countries whose territorial waters would be affected .
the consortium is expected to do so later this year .
" nord stream has decided to launch additional studies to investigate areas where the route of the pipeline through the baltic sea can be further optimized in a reasonable way to minimize environmental impacts , " the consortium said in a statement earlier this year . the pipeline has also created political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
in-between nations concerned at duopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schröder co-developed the project the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
the fact that the project was negotiated by russia and germany without consulting the countries between them has also created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the recent heightening of political tensions between russia and estonia has also left many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
if completed by 2010 as planned , the 1,200-kilometer pipeline would pump 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year from vyborg , russia to greifswald in northern germany .

"
nord stream bosses wo n't know for sure until at least 2010 the german-russian gas pipeline saga continues with a new disputed region causing a rethink over its route .
the nord stream consortium is again forced into finding an alternative direction for its maligned project . when it is finally completed , the planned russian-german natural gas pipeline may have more twists and turns than a bowl of spaghetti .
a spokesman for the nord stream consortium said wednesday that the disputed pipeline would again have to change its route after it was revealed a section had been earmarked for a stretch of water that both poland and denmark claim as an exclusive economic zone .
in april this year , nord stream - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - had its plans for running a stretch of the pipeline through estonian waters thrown into doubt over fears that it could disturb unexploded munitions and chemical dumps from world war ii .
such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry at the time .
this latest obstacle to the 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 750-mile -rrb- pipeline may prove to be more concrete in its disruption .
both denmark and poland claim the ownership of the area and nord stream is reluctant to get involved with any dispute .
pipeline consortium resorts to plan b ... or c bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord stream has had to adapt its plans after complaints now accustomed to the need to redirect the pipeline when opposition arises , nord stream said that it already has an alternative route that it proposes to take to avoid the disputed territory .
the consortium would attempt to squeeze the pipeline between the danish island of bornholm and sweden 's southeastern coast ; although nord stream stated that no final decision had been made .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
several coastal nations have expressed concern over the pipeline which is to deliver natural gas from russia to germany , saying it will damage the baltic sea 's delicate ecosystem .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment while sweden in particular has complained that the pipeline could disrupt the baltic sea ’ s sensitive flora and fauna .
study hopes to alleviate environmental fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns over the pipeline 's route out at sea in accordance with the european union rules , nord stream is required to furnish an environmental impact assessment -lrb- eia -rrb- to those countries whose territorial waters would be affected .
the consortium is expected to do so later this year .
" nord stream has decided to launch additional studies to investigate areas where the route of the pipeline through the baltic sea can be further optimized in a reasonable way to minimize environmental impacts , " the consortium said in a statement earlier this year . the pipeline has also created political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
in-between nations concerned at duopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schröder co-developed the project the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
the fact that the project was negotiated by russia and germany without consulting the countries between them has also created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the recent heightening of political tensions between russia and estonia has also left many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
if completed by 2010 as planned , the 1,200-kilometer pipeline would pump 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year from vyborg , russia to greifswald in northern germany .
in a second phase , a parallel pipeline would double that transport capacity , and nord stream estimates that will meet about 25 percent of the additional gas needs of the european union . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the gaza strip is controlled by hamas , the west bank is ruled by an emergency government under salam fayyad in cooperation with the president and fatah chairman , mahmoud abbas . israel and the international community have interpreted the split as a chance .
thus , the islamists in the gaza strip could be more easily isolated and the emergency government in the west bank could be a partner for the resumption of cooperation , economic development and a diplomatic process .
" flourishing landscapes " and new freedom of movement in the west bank would convince the palestinian population of fatah being the right choice for the future . but the " hamastan vs fatah-land " -approach is hugely unrealistic . bildunterschrift : muriel asseburg israel has announced a gradual release of customs duties and value-added tax revenues collected on behalf of the palestinian authority and worth some $ 700 million that it has withheld since the establishment of the hamas-led government in march 2006 .
it has also promised to lift a few roadblocks in the west bank , dismantle some settlement outposts and allow weapon deliveries such as armoured vehicles to strengthen fatah . but all these measures are far from sufficient to trigger a new dynamic and to tangibly improve the situation in the west bank : as long as the system of roadblocks and permits remains in place , the palestinian economy will not see a sustainable recovery . an approach that pins hopes on a military confrontation between fatah and hamas will not stabilize the situation either .
instead , it carries the danger of a renewed flare-up of internal palestinian fighting and its escalation into a civil war . also , increasing the pressure on the population in the gaza strip is hardly possible without causing a humanitarian catastrophe .
the official unemployment rate in the region is already at some 35 percent , the poverty rate at above 75 percent .
around two thirds of the population depend on international aid deliveries .
the danger of economic isolation then is to radicalize the gaza strip ’ s population and to increase the attraction of salafist and jihadist groups – which , in contrast to hamas , neither have a national agenda nor an interest in stabilization . the new-old approach of the international community is contributing to making the vision of a two-state settlement increasingly unrealistic .
this is because it sacrifices the creation of functioning and democratic palestinian institutions in favour of short-term stability .
and because it does nothing to prevent the ever greater erosion of a contiguous territory for a palestinian state – which is a result of the separation barrier , the expansion of settlements and the corresponding transportation network in the west bank . german and european policies should therefore concentrate on averting a humanitarian catastrophe in the gaza strip and on creating conditions for an economic revival both there and in the west bank .
they should avoid undermining reconciliation among palestinian factions , support improved governance of palestinian institutions and take serious steps to achieve a two-state settlement in cooperation with the middle east quartet and the arab peace initiative . muriel asseburg is head of the research unit for the middle east and africa at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the gaza strip is controlled by hamas , the west bank is ruled by an emergency government under salam fayyad in cooperation with the president and fatah chairman , mahmoud abbas . israel and the international community have interpreted the split as a chance .
thus , the islamists in the gaza strip could be more easily isolated and the emergency government in the west bank could be a partner for the resumption of cooperation , economic development and a diplomatic process .
" flourishing landscapes " and new freedom of movement in the west bank would convince the palestinian population of fatah being the right choice for the future . but the " hamastan vs fatah-land " -approach is hugely unrealistic . bildunterschrift : muriel asseburg israel has announced a gradual release of customs duties and value-added tax revenues collected on behalf of the palestinian authority and worth some $ 700 million that it has withheld since the establishment of the hamas-led government in march 2006 .
it has also promised to lift a few roadblocks in the west bank , dismantle some settlement outposts and allow weapon deliveries such as armoured vehicles to strengthen fatah . but all these measures are far from sufficient to trigger a new dynamic and to tangibly improve the situation in the west bank : as long as the system of roadblocks and permits remains in place , the palestinian economy will not see a sustainable recovery . an approach that pins hopes on a military confrontation between fatah and hamas will not stabilize the situation either .
instead , it carries the danger of a renewed flare-up of internal palestinian fighting and its escalation into a civil war . also , increasing the pressure on the population in the gaza strip is hardly possible without causing a humanitarian catastrophe .
the official unemployment rate in the region is already at some 35 percent , the poverty rate at above 75 percent .
around two thirds of the population depend on international aid deliveries .
the danger of economic isolation then is to radicalize the gaza strip ’ s population and to increase the attraction of salafist and jihadist groups – which , in contrast to hamas , neither have a national agenda nor an interest in stabilization . the new-old approach of the international community is contributing to making the vision of a two-state settlement increasingly unrealistic .
this is because it sacrifices the creation of functioning and democratic palestinian institutions in favour of short-term stability .
and because it does nothing to prevent the ever greater erosion of a contiguous territory for a palestinian state – which is a result of the separation barrier , the expansion of settlements and the corresponding transportation network in the west bank . german and european policies should therefore concentrate on averting a humanitarian catastrophe in the gaza strip and on creating conditions for an economic revival both there and in the west bank .
they should avoid undermining reconciliation among palestinian factions , support improved governance of palestinian institutions and take serious steps to achieve a two-state settlement in cooperation with the middle east quartet and the arab peace initiative . muriel asseburg is head of the research unit for the middle east and africa at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 13.07.2007 opinion : prior debate overshadows integration summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whatever reasons three turkish groups had for boycotting germany 's second integration summit , their absence overshadowed the entire event , according to dw commentator peter philipp . it all could have all been so nice : the chancellor 's second " integration summit " presents a " national integration plan " in which hundreds of measures on integrating immigrants are put down on paper .
but the result was clouded by the decision of various turkish associations to abstain from attending the summit , and it 's been clear for days that the atmosphere of the first summit , which took place in 2006 , would not be replicated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp the associations are annoyed that the german government did not sufficiently consult with them about tightening an immigration law , critics say .
though not explicitly named , turkish immigrants are particularly discriminated against , the associations also said .
not only because they make the largest group of so-called " migrants , " but also for concrete reasons : spouses have to learn german in their home countries and have to be at least 18 years old before they can come to germany .
the irritated turkish association pushed forward a debate that more than clearly demonstrated how poorly the law handles integration .
some of the associations ' representatives even spoke of it violating their human rights .
" absurd , " the politicians countered , adding that raising the age of immigration to 18 would avoid forced marriages .
and secondly , it must be clear that people who want to live in germany should speak german .
the politicians do n't bring up the fact that this is n't quite as easy in anatolian villages as in new york or tokyo - where the condition is n't even being imposed .
not to mention that german is best learnt in germany .
the turkish groups - somewhat unskillfully - gave the impression that they wanted to put pressure on the government .
but german politicians tried to trivialize the situation and insinuate that the groups wanted to prevent what is clear to everyone and questioned by few : that the integration of immigrants is important and that language skills are , naturally , required .
but acquiring language skills in anatolia - even if it 's just the " 300 words " that german politicians suddenly say are necessary - is a hurdle for the people who live there and want to move to germany .
while talking about avoiding forced marriages may be politically beneficial , it can not be achieved by raising the age of immigration and certainly not by 300 german words .
these are problems that have to be solved in germany .
and that has to be done on equal footing with the immigrants , as the politicians like to say .
this is what should have happened before the changes were made to the immigration law .
then we could have saved ourselves a lot of aggravation , and some things could have really improved .

from the level-headed and unassuming way young minu dietlinde tizabi has completed the german version of the high school diploma at the tender age of 14 , the indications are that she will join the second group .
tizabi not only completed the abitur exam four years earlier than usual but she passed with the highest possible grade , a 1.0 .

" and i also write my own stories in english .
i read the harry potter books in english … i think they 're good but the whole thing is exaggerated .

when i started high school , i was moved up a year within three weeks of starting .
all my friends were three and four years older than me . "
despite the tragedy of losing her mother at such an early age , tizabi has certainly prospered under her father 's guidance .
father djamshid , an iranian-born certified engineer in quantum electronics , is obviously no slouch either and has not only instilled a love of learning in his daughter but has given her the humility that he himself shows .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 13.07.2007 proposal to promote german citizenship divides parties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians ca n't agree on whether to push immigrants to take on german citizenship one day after german chancellor angela merkel termed the country 's second integration summit a success , a social democratic politician has called for a new program to encourage immigrants to take on german citizenship . sebastian edathy , chairman of the bundestag 's interior committee and senior member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , called on friday for more political involvement on the part of immigrants in germany .
he suggested launching a " citizenship campaign " to persuade foreigners to change their nationality .
" we should persuade people who have a right to citizenship to do more than be just residents and to become citizens , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
but edathy 's idea was met with skepticism in the conservative ranks of the german political establishment .
stephan mayer , parliamentary head for the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , questioned whether giving citizenship to foreigners would lead to better integration .
" awarding citizenship can only take place at the end of a successful integration process , certainly not at the beginning , " mayer said .
" the state can not offer citizenship as a concession . "
a sensitive issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners have to give up their previous citizenship to become german the integration issue in germany has been traditionally plagued by the widely divergent positions of the spd and the cdu / csu - now united under the umbrella of merkel 's grand coalition government .
foreigners , who are not married to german citizens , currently obtain the right to apply for german citizenship if they have been legally living in germany for at least eight years , if they can financially support themselves and their families without state aid , if they possess sufficient german language skills , have not been convicted of a crime , and if they avow they will adhere to germany 's basic law and democratic principles .
by adopting german citizenship , foreigners living in germany are also expected to give up any other citizenship they have .
extending local voting rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu citizens can participate in local elections wherever in the bloc they live edathy also said germany should provide some foreigners with a right to vote in local elections .
" it is key that we improve migrants ' political participation by a right to vote in municipal election for foreigners who have lived in germany for a long time , " he said .
while federal and state elections are open only to a country 's citizens , the european union law opened municipal elections across the 27-member bloc to all eu citizens who are local residents , even if they are not citizens of the country where they live .
" i do n't think much of extending the right to vote because it does n't contribute to integration , " bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein told deutschlandfunk radio on friday .
" integration is a hard task : namely learning the legal system , leaning that you can speak the language and that you fit in to society . "
new ideas after integration summit edathy 's suggestions were not subject to discussion at germany 's second integration summit on thursday , which dealt with proposals from six working groups on how to improve the integration of immigrants living in germany .
despite the decision of some turkish groups to boycott the meeting in protest of a recent law placing additional restrictions on some foreigners before they are allowed to move to germany , merkel called the day-long meeting a success and " milestone " for the country 's integration efforts .
representatives of the federal government , the states and some 90 community leaders at the summit adopted a " national integration plan " containing 400 promises for improvements - ranging from aid for ethnic sports clubs to making more german-language classes available . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he suggested launching a " citizenship campaign " to persuade foreigners to change their nationality .
" we should persuade people who have a right to citizenship to do more than be just residents and to become citizens , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
but edathy 's idea was met with skepticism in the conservative ranks of the german political establishment .
stephan mayer , parliamentary head for the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , questioned whether giving citizenship to foreigners would lead to better integration .
" awarding citizenship can only take place at the end of a successful integration process , certainly not at the beginning , " mayer said .
" the state can not offer citizenship as a concession . "
a sensitive issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners have to give up their previous citizenship to become german the integration issue in germany has been traditionally plagued by the widely divergent positions of the spd and the cdu / csu - now united under the umbrella of merkel 's grand coalition government .
foreigners , who are not married to german citizens , currently obtain the right to apply for german citizenship if they have been legally living in germany for at least eight years , if they can financially support themselves and their families without state aid , if they possess sufficient german language skills , have not been convicted of a crime , and if they avow they will adhere to germany 's basic law and democratic principles .
by adopting german citizenship , foreigners living in germany are also expected to give up any other citizenship they have .
extending local voting rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu citizens can participate in local elections wherever in the bloc they live edathy also said germany should provide some foreigners with a right to vote in local elections .
" it is key that we improve migrants ' political participation by a right to vote in municipal election for foreigners who have lived in germany for a long time , " he said .
while federal and state elections are open only to a country 's citizens , the european union law opened municipal elections across the 27-member bloc to all eu citizens who are local residents , even if they are not citizens of the country where they live .
" i do n't think much of extending the right to vote because it does n't contribute to integration , " bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein told deutschlandfunk radio on friday .
" integration is a hard task : namely learning the legal system , leaning that you can speak the language and that you fit in to society . "
new ideas after integration summit edathy 's suggestions were not subject to discussion at germany 's second integration summit on thursday , which dealt with proposals from six working groups on how to improve the integration of immigrants living in germany .
despite the decision of some turkish groups to boycott the meeting in protest of a recent law placing additional restrictions on some foreigners before they are allowed to move to germany , merkel called the day-long meeting a success and " milestone " for the country 's integration efforts .
representatives of the federal government , the states and some 90 community leaders at the summit adopted a " national integration plan " containing 400 promises for improvements - ranging from aid for ethnic sports clubs to making more german-language classes available . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he suggested launching a " citizenship campaign " to persuade foreigners to change their nationality .
" we should persuade people who have a right to citizenship to do more than be just residents and to become citizens , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
but edathy 's idea was met with skepticism in the conservative ranks of the german political establishment .
stephan mayer , parliamentary head for the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , questioned whether giving citizenship to foreigners would lead to better integration .
" awarding citizenship can only take place at the end of a successful integration process , certainly not at the beginning , " mayer said .
" the state can not offer citizenship as a concession . "
a sensitive issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners have to give up their previous citizenship to become german the integration issue in germany has been traditionally plagued by the widely divergent positions of the spd and the cdu / csu - now united under the umbrella of merkel 's grand coalition government .
foreigners , who are not married to german citizens , currently obtain the right to apply for german citizenship if they have been legally living in germany for at least eight years , if they can financially support themselves and their families without state aid , if they possess sufficient german language skills , have not been convicted of a crime , and if they avow they will adhere to germany 's basic law and democratic principles .
by adopting german citizenship , foreigners living in germany are also expected to give up any other citizenship they have .
extending local voting rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu citizens can participate in local elections wherever in the bloc they live edathy also said germany should provide some foreigners with a right to vote in local elections .
" it is key that we improve migrants ' political participation by a right to vote in municipal election for foreigners who have lived in germany for a long time , " he said .
while federal and state elections are open only to a country 's citizens , the european union law opened municipal elections across the 27-member bloc to all eu citizens who are local residents , even if they are not citizens of the country where they live .
" i do n't think much of extending the right to vote because it does n't contribute to integration , " bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein told deutschlandfunk radio on friday .
" integration is a hard task : namely learning the legal system , leaning that you can speak the language and that you fit in to society . "
new ideas after integration summit edathy 's suggestions were not subject to discussion at germany 's second integration summit on thursday , which dealt with proposals from six working groups on how to improve the integration of immigrants living in germany .
despite the decision of some turkish groups to boycott the meeting in protest of a recent law placing additional restrictions on some foreigners before they are allowed to move to germany , merkel called the day-long meeting a success and " milestone " for the country 's integration efforts .
representatives of the federal government , the states and some 90 community leaders at the summit adopted a " national integration plan " containing 400 promises for improvements - ranging from aid for ethnic sports clubs to making more german-language classes available . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 13.07.2007 in europe , iraqi asylum-seekers find doors being shut großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi bodyguard muhannad yousif who sought a new life in sweden experts have criticized germany 's policies towards iraqi asylum-seekers as too restrictive .
fearful of a refugee influx , however , other european nations have started tightening their asylum rules . " when you go out in baghdad , there 's a 50 percent chance you may never come home , " said murad atshan , an iraqi filmmaker living in germany . anyone who follows news of daily suicide bombings , a bloody insurgency and sectarian violence in the iraqi capital will probably nod in agreement at the statement .
german authorities in munich , however , rejected atshan 's application for asylum a year ago , saying he did n't give a good enough reason for seeking protection . the 27-year-old has since been confined to a refugee center in a tiny village in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , near the swiss border . while german authorities are deciding what to do with him , atshan is n't allowed to leave the district or work . " it 's very frustrating , " he said .
" i did n't come here looking for a good life , i just wanted to be somewhere safe .
but this is no normal life . " in addition to worrying about his family back home in baghdad , atshan is grappling with getting used to life in a small foreign village . " i 'm used to living in big cities , " he said . " i ca n't even go to the movies here . " living in limbo atshan 's case is depressingly familiar in the country whose complicated asylum and refugee laws have come under increasing criticism from aid and refugee groups .
germany is home to an estimated 73,000 iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi family at a refugee home in germany experts say german asylum rules date back to the 1990s when tens of thousands of iraqis fleeing saddam hussein 's dictatorship applied for and easily received asylum status in germany on grounds of political persecution . " the moment saddam was toppled in 2003 , however , the german government sent out letters to thousands of iraqis saying their asylum status would be revoked since the persecutor was now gone , " said bernd mesovic of campaign group proasyl .
" it 's as if the authorities did n't watch television and did n't know what 's happening in iraq . " last year , german authorities stripped 8,189 refugees of their asylum status .
this week , human rights watch slammed germany 's move earlier this year to revoke the refugee status of over 18,000 iraqis . " losing your asylum status has serious repercussions , " said marianne heuwagen , head of the german section of human rights watch , because it can lead to reduced social benefits and severe restrictions on work , mobility and unification with family members . " in others words , it leaves you in limbo and with an uncertain future , " she said . civil war not asylum-worthy german authorities admit that iraqis seeking asylum must now prove they face personal risk in their homeland .
general instability or civil war is not reason enough to grant asylum though it is sufficient to put a freeze on deportations . at the same time , revoking asylum status does not automatically mean iraqis will be sent back home , said claudia moebus , spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis in baghdad have to live with daily car and suicide bombings " each refugee has the right to appeal and each individual case is carefully considered before any decision is taken , " moebus said . she added that german authorities had also reversed their recent decision to strip 18,000 iraqis of their refugee status with the exceptions of criminals and those who returned to northern iraq , which is considered relatively stable .
she declined to give exact figures . liberal sweden puts up barriers germany is not alone in its restrictive attitude towards iraqi asylum-seekers . experts point out that most eu nations remain reluctant to take in iraqi asylum-seekers even though those who knock on their doors make up only a fraction of the estimated four million displaced since the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
neighboring jordan and syria have taken in two million , while another two million remain uprooted within iraq . last year , just about 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the bloc . sweden has thus far stood out among europeans for having the most welcoming attitude and taking in the highest numbers of iraqi asylum-seekers - some 9,000 alone last year .
many of the refugees in sweden have joined existing iraqi communities in towns such as malmo on the southwest coast . last week , however , the country , which has long called on other eu members to shoulder the burden , said it 's tightening its asylum rules and will forcibly deport iraqis who are denied permission to stay . " asylum a dangerous lottery " " asylum in europe has become a dangerous lottery , " said richard williams of the european council of refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , referring to the disparate practices among eu nations on granting asylum . " generally every european country is afraid of being seen as too attractive to asylum-seekers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi refugee djabar lafte latif who lives in saxony-anhalt in germany in addition to german and swedish restrictions , britain , in particular , and denmark have sent iraqis back home .
experts are also concerned that the policies of these countries are not in accordance with international treaties such as the geneva convention . in addition to plodding moves towards a harmonized eu asylum policy - a goal hoped to be achieved by 2010 - some say european leaders need to do more to sell the idea of asylum on humanitarian grounds . " asylum and migration remain major political fault lines in europe , " williams said .

hammarberg 's report said a german intelligence officer visited el masri and traveled with him to europe .
the report expressed concern about the " questioning by german officials of terrorist suspects who have been detained without due process and allegedly tortured . "
" the commissioner calls upon germany to fully investigate all cases of alleged extraordinary renditions that were carried out on german territory or that involved german nationals or long-term residents , " according to the report .

but the result was clouded by the decision of various turkish associations to abstain from attending the summit , and it 's been clear for days that the atmosphere of the first summit , which took place in 2006 , would not be replicated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp the associations are annoyed that the german government did not sufficiently consult with them about tightening an immigration law , critics say .
though not explicitly named , turkish immigrants are particularly discriminated against , the associations also said .
not only because they make the largest group of so-called " migrants , " but also for concrete reasons : spouses have to learn german in their home countries and have to be at least 18 years old before they can come to germany .
the irritated turkish association pushed forward a debate that more than clearly demonstrated how poorly the law handles integration .
some of the associations ' representatives even spoke of it violating their human rights .
" absurd , " the politicians countered , adding that raising the age of immigration to 18 would avoid forced marriages .
and secondly , it must be clear that people who want to live in germany should speak german .
the politicians do n't bring up the fact that this is n't quite as easy in anatolian villages as in new york or tokyo - where the condition is n't even being imposed .
not to mention that german is best learnt in germany .
the turkish groups - somewhat unskillfully - gave the impression that they wanted to put pressure on the government .
but german politicians tried to trivialize the situation and insinuate that the groups wanted to prevent what is clear to everyone and questioned by few : that the integration of immigrants is important and that language skills are , naturally , required .
but acquiring language skills in anatolia - even if it 's just the " 300 words " that german politicians suddenly say are necessary - is a hurdle for the people who live there and want to move to germany .
while talking about avoiding forced marriages may be politically beneficial , it can not be achieved by raising the age of immigration and certainly not by 300 german words .
these are problems that have to be solved in germany .
and that has to be done on equal footing with the immigrants , as the politicians like to say .
this is what should have happened before the changes were made to the immigration law .
then we could have saved ourselves a lot of aggravation , and some things could have really improved .

but the result was clouded by the decision of various turkish associations to abstain from attending the summit , and it 's been clear for days that the atmosphere of the first summit , which took place in 2006 , would not be replicated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp the associations are annoyed that the german government did not sufficiently consult with them about tightening an immigration law , critics say .
though not explicitly named , turkish immigrants are particularly discriminated against , the associations also said .
not only because they make the largest group of so-called " migrants , " but also for concrete reasons : spouses have to learn german in their home countries and have to be at least 18 years old before they can come to germany .
the irritated turkish association pushed forward a debate that more than clearly demonstrated how poorly the law handles integration .
some of the associations ' representatives even spoke of it violating their human rights .
" absurd , " the politicians countered , adding that raising the age of immigration to 18 would avoid forced marriages .
and secondly , it must be clear that people who want to live in germany should speak german .
the politicians do n't bring up the fact that this is n't quite as easy in anatolian villages as in new york or tokyo - where the condition is n't even being imposed .
not to mention that german is best learnt in germany .
the turkish groups - somewhat unskillfully - gave the impression that they wanted to put pressure on the government .
but german politicians tried to trivialize the situation and insinuate that the groups wanted to prevent what is clear to everyone and questioned by few : that the integration of immigrants is important and that language skills are , naturally , required .
but acquiring language skills in anatolia - even if it 's just the " 300 words " that german politicians suddenly say are necessary - is a hurdle for the people who live there and want to move to germany .
while talking about avoiding forced marriages may be politically beneficial , it can not be achieved by raising the age of immigration and certainly not by 300 german words .
these are problems that have to be solved in germany .
and that has to be done on equal footing with the immigrants , as the politicians like to say .
this is what should have happened before the changes were made to the immigration law .
then we could have saved ourselves a lot of aggravation , and some things could have really improved .

tax payers ' day is the day of the year from which on people don ’ t work to pay taxes anymore , but just for themselves .
this day is proclaimed by tax payers ' unions worldwide : in the united states , it falls on april 30th , and in the uk , on june 3rd .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 13.07.2007 in europe , iraqi asylum-seekers find doors being shut großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi bodyguard muhannad yousif who sought a new life in sweden experts have criticized germany 's policies towards iraqi asylum-seekers as too restrictive .
fearful of a refugee influx , however , other european nations have started tightening their asylum rules . " when you go out in baghdad , there 's a 50 percent chance you may never come home , " said murad atshan , an iraqi filmmaker living in germany . anyone who follows news of daily suicide bombings , a bloody insurgency and sectarian violence in the iraqi capital will probably nod in agreement at the statement .
german authorities in munich , however , rejected atshan 's application for asylum a year ago , saying he did n't give a good enough reason for seeking protection . the 27-year-old has since been confined to a refugee center in a tiny village in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , near the swiss border . while german authorities are deciding what to do with him , atshan is n't allowed to leave the district or work . " it 's very frustrating , " he said .
" i did n't come here looking for a good life , i just wanted to be somewhere safe .
but this is no normal life . " in addition to worrying about his family back home in baghdad , atshan is grappling with getting used to life in a small foreign village . " i 'm used to living in big cities , " he said . " i ca n't even go to the movies here . " living in limbo atshan 's case is depressingly familiar in the country whose complicated asylum and refugee laws have come under increasing criticism from aid and refugee groups .
germany is home to an estimated 73,000 iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi family at a refugee home in germany experts say german asylum rules date back to the 1990s when tens of thousands of iraqis fleeing saddam hussein 's dictatorship applied for and easily received asylum status in germany on grounds of political persecution . " the moment saddam was toppled in 2003 , however , the german government sent out letters to thousands of iraqis saying their asylum status would be revoked since the persecutor was now gone , " said bernd mesovic of campaign group proasyl .
" it 's as if the authorities did n't watch television and did n't know what 's happening in iraq . " last year , german authorities stripped 8,189 refugees of their asylum status .
this week , human rights watch slammed germany 's move earlier this year to revoke the refugee status of over 18,000 iraqis . " losing your asylum status has serious repercussions , " said marianne heuwagen , head of the german section of human rights watch , because it can lead to reduced social benefits and severe restrictions on work , mobility and unification with family members . " in others words , it leaves you in limbo and with an uncertain future , " she said . civil war not asylum-worthy german authorities admit that iraqis seeking asylum must now prove they face personal risk in their homeland .
general instability or civil war is not reason enough to grant asylum though it is sufficient to put a freeze on deportations . at the same time , revoking asylum status does not automatically mean iraqis will be sent back home , said claudia moebus , spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis in baghdad have to live with daily car and suicide bombings " each refugee has the right to appeal and each individual case is carefully considered before any decision is taken , " moebus said . she added that german authorities had also reversed their recent decision to strip 18,000 iraqis of their refugee status with the exceptions of criminals and those who returned to northern iraq , which is considered relatively stable .
she declined to give exact figures . liberal sweden puts up barriers germany is not alone in its restrictive attitude towards iraqi asylum-seekers . experts point out that most eu nations remain reluctant to take in iraqi asylum-seekers even though those who knock on their doors make up only a fraction of the estimated four million displaced since the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
neighboring jordan and syria have taken in two million , while another two million remain uprooted within iraq . last year , just about 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the bloc . sweden has thus far stood out among europeans for having the most welcoming attitude and taking in the highest numbers of iraqi asylum-seekers - some 9,000 alone last year .
many of the refugees in sweden have joined existing iraqi communities in towns such as malmo on the southwest coast . last week , however , the country , which has long called on other eu members to shoulder the burden , said it 's tightening its asylum rules and will forcibly deport iraqis who are denied permission to stay . " asylum a dangerous lottery " " asylum in europe has become a dangerous lottery , " said richard williams of the european council of refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , referring to the disparate practices among eu nations on granting asylum . " generally every european country is afraid of being seen as too attractive to asylum-seekers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi refugee djabar lafte latif who lives in saxony-anhalt in germany in addition to german and swedish restrictions , britain , in particular , and denmark have sent iraqis back home .
experts are also concerned that the policies of these countries are not in accordance with international treaties such as the geneva convention . in addition to plodding moves towards a harmonized eu asylum policy - a goal hoped to be achieved by 2010 - some say european leaders need to do more to sell the idea of asylum on humanitarian grounds . " asylum and migration remain major political fault lines in europe , " williams said .

" the court rejects the appeals of the defendants and confirms the death penalty , " judge fathi dahn said after a five-minute hearing . the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor were found guilty late last year of intentional infecting more than 400 libyan children with hiv in the late 1990s .

"
nord stream bosses wo n't know for sure until at least 2010 the german-russian gas pipeline saga continues with a new disputed region causing a rethink over its route .
the nord stream consortium is again forced into finding an alternative direction for its maligned project . when it is finally completed , the planned russian-german natural gas pipeline may have more twists and turns than a bowl of spaghetti .
a spokesman for the nord stream consortium said wednesday that the disputed pipeline would again have to change its route after it was revealed a section had been earmarked for a stretch of water that both poland and denmark claim as an exclusive economic zone .
in april this year , nord stream - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - had its plans for running a stretch of the pipeline through estonian waters thrown into doubt over fears that it could disturb unexploded munitions and chemical dumps from world war ii .
such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry at the time .
this latest obstacle to the 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 750-mile -rrb- pipeline may prove to be more concrete in its disruption .
both denmark and poland claim the ownership of the area and nord stream is reluctant to get involved with any dispute .
pipeline consortium resorts to plan b ... or c bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord stream has had to adapt its plans after complaints now accustomed to the need to redirect the pipeline when opposition arises , nord stream said that it already has an alternative route that it proposes to take to avoid the disputed territory .
the consortium would attempt to squeeze the pipeline between the danish island of bornholm and sweden 's southeastern coast ; although nord stream stated that no final decision had been made .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
several coastal nations have expressed concern over the pipeline which is to deliver natural gas from russia to germany , saying it will damage the baltic sea 's delicate ecosystem .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment while sweden in particular has complained that the pipeline could disrupt the baltic sea ’ s sensitive flora and fauna .
study hopes to alleviate environmental fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns over the pipeline 's route out at sea in accordance with the european union rules , nord stream is required to furnish an environmental impact assessment -lrb- eia -rrb- to those countries whose territorial waters would be affected .
the consortium is expected to do so later this year .
" nord stream has decided to launch additional studies to investigate areas where the route of the pipeline through the baltic sea can be further optimized in a reasonable way to minimize environmental impacts , " the consortium said in a statement earlier this year . the pipeline has also created political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
in-between nations concerned at duopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schröder co-developed the project the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
the fact that the project was negotiated by russia and germany without consulting the countries between them has also created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the recent heightening of political tensions between russia and estonia has also left many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
if completed by 2010 as planned , the 1,200-kilometer pipeline would pump 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year from vyborg , russia to greifswald in northern germany .
in a second phase , a parallel pipeline would double that transport capacity , and nord stream estimates that will meet about 25 percent of the additional gas needs of the european union . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
nord stream bosses wo n't know for sure until at least 2010 the german-russian gas pipeline saga continues with a new disputed region causing a rethink over its route .
the nord stream consortium is again forced into finding an alternative direction for its maligned project . when it is finally completed , the planned russian-german natural gas pipeline may have more twists and turns than a bowl of spaghetti .
a spokesman for the nord stream consortium said wednesday that the disputed pipeline would again have to change its route after it was revealed a section had been earmarked for a stretch of water that both poland and denmark claim as an exclusive economic zone .
in april this year , nord stream - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - had its plans for running a stretch of the pipeline through estonian waters thrown into doubt over fears that it could disturb unexploded munitions and chemical dumps from world war ii .
such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry at the time .
this latest obstacle to the 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 750-mile -rrb- pipeline may prove to be more concrete in its disruption .
both denmark and poland claim the ownership of the area and nord stream is reluctant to get involved with any dispute .
pipeline consortium resorts to plan b ... or c bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord stream has had to adapt its plans after complaints now accustomed to the need to redirect the pipeline when opposition arises , nord stream said that it already has an alternative route that it proposes to take to avoid the disputed territory .
the consortium would attempt to squeeze the pipeline between the danish island of bornholm and sweden 's southeastern coast ; although nord stream stated that no final decision had been made .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
several coastal nations have expressed concern over the pipeline which is to deliver natural gas from russia to germany , saying it will damage the baltic sea 's delicate ecosystem .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment while sweden in particular has complained that the pipeline could disrupt the baltic sea ’ s sensitive flora and fauna .
study hopes to alleviate environmental fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns over the pipeline 's route out at sea in accordance with the european union rules , nord stream is required to furnish an environmental impact assessment -lrb- eia -rrb- to those countries whose territorial waters would be affected .
the consortium is expected to do so later this year .
" nord stream has decided to launch additional studies to investigate areas where the route of the pipeline through the baltic sea can be further optimized in a reasonable way to minimize environmental impacts , " the consortium said in a statement earlier this year . the pipeline has also created political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
in-between nations concerned at duopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schröder co-developed the project the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
the fact that the project was negotiated by russia and germany without consulting the countries between them has also created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the recent heightening of political tensions between russia and estonia has also left many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
if completed by 2010 as planned , the 1,200-kilometer pipeline would pump 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year from vyborg , russia to greifswald in northern germany .
in a second phase , a parallel pipeline would double that transport capacity , and nord stream estimates that will meet about 25 percent of the additional gas needs of the european union . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 13.07.2007 in europe , iraqi asylum-seekers find doors being shut großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi bodyguard muhannad yousif who sought a new life in sweden experts have criticized germany 's policies towards iraqi asylum-seekers as too restrictive .
fearful of a refugee influx , however , other european nations have started tightening their asylum rules . " when you go out in baghdad , there 's a 50 percent chance you may never come home , " said murad atshan , an iraqi filmmaker living in germany . anyone who follows news of daily suicide bombings , a bloody insurgency and sectarian violence in the iraqi capital will probably nod in agreement at the statement .
german authorities in munich , however , rejected atshan 's application for asylum a year ago , saying he did n't give a good enough reason for seeking protection . the 27-year-old has since been confined to a refugee center in a tiny village in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , near the swiss border . while german authorities are deciding what to do with him , atshan is n't allowed to leave the district or work . " it 's very frustrating , " he said .
" i did n't come here looking for a good life , i just wanted to be somewhere safe .
but this is no normal life . " in addition to worrying about his family back home in baghdad , atshan is grappling with getting used to life in a small foreign village . " i 'm used to living in big cities , " he said . " i ca n't even go to the movies here . " living in limbo atshan 's case is depressingly familiar in the country whose complicated asylum and refugee laws have come under increasing criticism from aid and refugee groups .
germany is home to an estimated 73,000 iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi family at a refugee home in germany experts say german asylum rules date back to the 1990s when tens of thousands of iraqis fleeing saddam hussein 's dictatorship applied for and easily received asylum status in germany on grounds of political persecution . " the moment saddam was toppled in 2003 , however , the german government sent out letters to thousands of iraqis saying their asylum status would be revoked since the persecutor was now gone , " said bernd mesovic of campaign group proasyl .
" it 's as if the authorities did n't watch television and did n't know what 's happening in iraq . " last year , german authorities stripped 8,189 refugees of their asylum status .
this week , human rights watch slammed germany 's move earlier this year to revoke the refugee status of over 18,000 iraqis . " losing your asylum status has serious repercussions , " said marianne heuwagen , head of the german section of human rights watch , because it can lead to reduced social benefits and severe restrictions on work , mobility and unification with family members . " in others words , it leaves you in limbo and with an uncertain future , " she said . civil war not asylum-worthy german authorities admit that iraqis seeking asylum must now prove they face personal risk in their homeland .
general instability or civil war is not reason enough to grant asylum though it is sufficient to put a freeze on deportations . at the same time , revoking asylum status does not automatically mean iraqis will be sent back home , said claudia moebus , spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis in baghdad have to live with daily car and suicide bombings " each refugee has the right to appeal and each individual case is carefully considered before any decision is taken , " moebus said . she added that german authorities had also reversed their recent decision to strip 18,000 iraqis of their refugee status with the exceptions of criminals and those who returned to northern iraq , which is considered relatively stable .
she declined to give exact figures . liberal sweden puts up barriers germany is not alone in its restrictive attitude towards iraqi asylum-seekers . experts point out that most eu nations remain reluctant to take in iraqi asylum-seekers even though those who knock on their doors make up only a fraction of the estimated four million displaced since the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
neighboring jordan and syria have taken in two million , while another two million remain uprooted within iraq . last year , just about 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the bloc . sweden has thus far stood out among europeans for having the most welcoming attitude and taking in the highest numbers of iraqi asylum-seekers - some 9,000 alone last year .
many of the refugees in sweden have joined existing iraqi communities in towns such as malmo on the southwest coast . last week , however , the country , which has long called on other eu members to shoulder the burden , said it 's tightening its asylum rules and will forcibly deport iraqis who are denied permission to stay . " asylum a dangerous lottery " " asylum in europe has become a dangerous lottery , " said richard williams of the european council of refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , referring to the disparate practices among eu nations on granting asylum . " generally every european country is afraid of being seen as too attractive to asylum-seekers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi refugee djabar lafte latif who lives in saxony-anhalt in germany in addition to german and swedish restrictions , britain , in particular , and denmark have sent iraqis back home .
experts are also concerned that the policies of these countries are not in accordance with international treaties such as the geneva convention . in addition to plodding moves towards a harmonized eu asylum policy - a goal hoped to be achieved by 2010 - some say european leaders need to do more to sell the idea of asylum on humanitarian grounds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 13.07.2007 in europe , iraqi asylum-seekers find doors being shut großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi bodyguard muhannad yousif who sought a new life in sweden experts have criticized germany 's policies towards iraqi asylum-seekers as too restrictive .
fearful of a refugee influx , however , other european nations have started tightening their asylum rules . " when you go out in baghdad , there 's a 50 percent chance you may never come home , " said murad atshan , an iraqi filmmaker living in germany . anyone who follows news of daily suicide bombings , a bloody insurgency and sectarian violence in the iraqi capital will probably nod in agreement at the statement .
german authorities in munich , however , rejected atshan 's application for asylum a year ago , saying he did n't give a good enough reason for seeking protection . the 27-year-old has since been confined to a refugee center in a tiny village in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , near the swiss border . while german authorities are deciding what to do with him , atshan is n't allowed to leave the district or work . " it 's very frustrating , " he said .
" i did n't come here looking for a good life , i just wanted to be somewhere safe .
but this is no normal life . " in addition to worrying about his family back home in baghdad , atshan is grappling with getting used to life in a small foreign village . " i 'm used to living in big cities , " he said . " i ca n't even go to the movies here . " living in limbo atshan 's case is depressingly familiar in the country whose complicated asylum and refugee laws have come under increasing criticism from aid and refugee groups .
germany is home to an estimated 73,000 iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi family at a refugee home in germany experts say german asylum rules date back to the 1990s when tens of thousands of iraqis fleeing saddam hussein 's dictatorship applied for and easily received asylum status in germany on grounds of political persecution . " the moment saddam was toppled in 2003 , however , the german government sent out letters to thousands of iraqis saying their asylum status would be revoked since the persecutor was now gone , " said bernd mesovic of campaign group proasyl .
" it 's as if the authorities did n't watch television and did n't know what 's happening in iraq . " last year , german authorities stripped 8,189 refugees of their asylum status .
this week , human rights watch slammed germany 's move earlier this year to revoke the refugee status of over 18,000 iraqis . " losing your asylum status has serious repercussions , " said marianne heuwagen , head of the german section of human rights watch , because it can lead to reduced social benefits and severe restrictions on work , mobility and unification with family members . " in others words , it leaves you in limbo and with an uncertain future , " she said . civil war not asylum-worthy german authorities admit that iraqis seeking asylum must now prove they face personal risk in their homeland .
general instability or civil war is not reason enough to grant asylum though it is sufficient to put a freeze on deportations . at the same time , revoking asylum status does not automatically mean iraqis will be sent back home , said claudia moebus , spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis in baghdad have to live with daily car and suicide bombings " each refugee has the right to appeal and each individual case is carefully considered before any decision is taken , " moebus said . she added that german authorities had also reversed their recent decision to strip 18,000 iraqis of their refugee status with the exceptions of criminals and those who returned to northern iraq , which is considered relatively stable .
she declined to give exact figures . liberal sweden puts up barriers germany is not alone in its restrictive attitude towards iraqi asylum-seekers . experts point out that most eu nations remain reluctant to take in iraqi asylum-seekers even though those who knock on their doors make up only a fraction of the estimated four million displaced since the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
neighboring jordan and syria have taken in two million , while another two million remain uprooted within iraq . last year , just about 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the bloc . sweden has thus far stood out among europeans for having the most welcoming attitude and taking in the highest numbers of iraqi asylum-seekers - some 9,000 alone last year .
many of the refugees in sweden have joined existing iraqi communities in towns such as malmo on the southwest coast . last week , however , the country , which has long called on other eu members to shoulder the burden , said it 's tightening its asylum rules and will forcibly deport iraqis who are denied permission to stay . " asylum a dangerous lottery " " asylum in europe has become a dangerous lottery , " said richard williams of the european council of refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , referring to the disparate practices among eu nations on granting asylum . " generally every european country is afraid of being seen as too attractive to asylum-seekers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi refugee djabar lafte latif who lives in saxony-anhalt in germany in addition to german and swedish restrictions , britain , in particular , and denmark have sent iraqis back home .
experts are also concerned that the policies of these countries are not in accordance with international treaties such as the geneva convention . in addition to plodding moves towards a harmonized eu asylum policy - a goal hoped to be achieved by 2010 - some say european leaders need to do more to sell the idea of asylum on humanitarian grounds .

but the result was clouded by the decision of various turkish associations to abstain from attending the summit , and it 's been clear for days that the atmosphere of the first summit , which took place in 2006 , would not be replicated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp the associations are annoyed that the german government did not sufficiently consult with them about tightening an immigration law , critics say .
though not explicitly named , turkish immigrants are particularly discriminated against , the associations also said .
not only because they make the largest group of so-called " migrants , " but also for concrete reasons : spouses have to learn german in their home countries and have to be at least 18 years old before they can come to germany .
the irritated turkish association pushed forward a debate that more than clearly demonstrated how poorly the law handles integration .
some of the associations ' representatives even spoke of it violating their human rights .
" absurd , " the politicians countered , adding that raising the age of immigration to 18 would avoid forced marriages .
and secondly , it must be clear that people who want to live in germany should speak german .
the politicians do n't bring up the fact that this is n't quite as easy in anatolian villages as in new york or tokyo - where the condition is n't even being imposed .
not to mention that german is best learnt in germany .
the turkish groups - somewhat unskillfully - gave the impression that they wanted to put pressure on the government .
but german politicians tried to trivialize the situation and insinuate that the groups wanted to prevent what is clear to everyone and questioned by few : that the integration of immigrants is important and that language skills are , naturally , required .
but acquiring language skills in anatolia - even if it 's just the " 300 words " that german politicians suddenly say are necessary - is a hurdle for the people who live there and want to move to germany .
while talking about avoiding forced marriages may be politically beneficial , it can not be achieved by raising the age of immigration and certainly not by 300 german words .
these are problems that have to be solved in germany .
and that has to be done on equal footing with the immigrants , as the politicians like to say .
this is what should have happened before the changes were made to the immigration law .
then we could have saved ourselves a lot of aggravation , and some things could have really improved .

but the result was clouded by the decision of various turkish associations to abstain from attending the summit , and it 's been clear for days that the atmosphere of the first summit , which took place in 2006 , would not be replicated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp the associations are annoyed that the german government did not sufficiently consult with them about tightening an immigration law , critics say .
though not explicitly named , turkish immigrants are particularly discriminated against , the associations also said .
not only because they make the largest group of so-called " migrants , " but also for concrete reasons : spouses have to learn german in their home countries and have to be at least 18 years old before they can come to germany .
the irritated turkish association pushed forward a debate that more than clearly demonstrated how poorly the law handles integration .
some of the associations ' representatives even spoke of it violating their human rights .
" absurd , " the politicians countered , adding that raising the age of immigration to 18 would avoid forced marriages .
and secondly , it must be clear that people who want to live in germany should speak german .
the politicians do n't bring up the fact that this is n't quite as easy in anatolian villages as in new york or tokyo - where the condition is n't even being imposed .
not to mention that german is best learnt in germany .
the turkish groups - somewhat unskillfully - gave the impression that they wanted to put pressure on the government .
but german politicians tried to trivialize the situation and insinuate that the groups wanted to prevent what is clear to everyone and questioned by few : that the integration of immigrants is important and that language skills are , naturally , required .
but acquiring language skills in anatolia - even if it 's just the " 300 words " that german politicians suddenly say are necessary - is a hurdle for the people who live there and want to move to germany .
while talking about avoiding forced marriages may be politically beneficial , it can not be achieved by raising the age of immigration and certainly not by 300 german words .
these are problems that have to be solved in germany .
and that has to be done on equal footing with the immigrants , as the politicians like to say .
this is what should have happened before the changes were made to the immigration law .
then we could have saved ourselves a lot of aggravation , and some things could have really improved .

he suggested launching a " citizenship campaign " to persuade foreigners to change their nationality .
" we should persuade people who have a right to citizenship to do more than be just residents and to become citizens , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
but edathy 's idea was met with skepticism in the conservative ranks of the german political establishment .
stephan mayer , parliamentary head for the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , questioned whether giving citizenship to foreigners would lead to better integration .
" awarding citizenship can only take place at the end of a successful integration process , certainly not at the beginning , " mayer said .
" the state can not offer citizenship as a concession . "
a sensitive issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners have to give up their previous citizenship to become german the integration issue in germany has been traditionally plagued by the widely divergent positions of the spd and the cdu / csu - now united under the umbrella of merkel 's grand coalition government .
foreigners , who are not married to german citizens , currently obtain the right to apply for german citizenship if they have been legally living in germany for at least eight years , if they can financially support themselves and their families without state aid , if they possess sufficient german language skills , have not been convicted of a crime , and if they avow they will adhere to germany 's basic law and democratic principles .
by adopting german citizenship , foreigners living in germany are also expected to give up any other citizenship they have .
extending local voting rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu citizens can participate in local elections wherever in the bloc they live edathy also said germany should provide some foreigners with a right to vote in local elections .
" it is key that we improve migrants ' political participation by a right to vote in municipal election for foreigners who have lived in germany for a long time , " he said .
while federal and state elections are open only to a country 's citizens , the european union law opened municipal elections across the 27-member bloc to all eu citizens who are local residents , even if they are not citizens of the country where they live .
" i do n't think much of extending the right to vote because it does n't contribute to integration , " bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein told deutschlandfunk radio on friday .
" integration is a hard task : namely learning the legal system , leaning that you can speak the language and that you fit in to society . "
new ideas after integration summit edathy 's suggestions were not subject to discussion at germany 's second integration summit on thursday , which dealt with proposals from six working groups on how to improve the integration of immigrants living in germany .
despite the decision of some turkish groups to boycott the meeting in protest of a recent law placing additional restrictions on some foreigners before they are allowed to move to germany , merkel called the day-long meeting a success and " milestone " for the country 's integration efforts .
representatives of the federal government , the states and some 90 community leaders at the summit adopted a " national integration plan " containing 400 promises for improvements - ranging from aid for ethnic sports clubs to making more german-language classes available . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

foreigners , who are not married to german citizens , currently obtain the right to apply for german citizenship if they have been legally living in germany for at least eight years , if they can financially support themselves and their families without state aid , if they possess sufficient german language skills , have not been convicted of a crime , and if they avow they will adhere to germany 's basic law and democratic principles .

tax payers ' day is the day of the year from which on people don ’ t work to pay taxes anymore , but just for themselves .
this day is proclaimed by tax payers ' unions worldwide : in the united states , it falls on april 30th , and in the uk , on june 3rd .
the date is calculated by dividing the amount of all taxes collected by all the income earned in a given year .
in germany , the authorities - federal , state and local - will take 53 percent of income this year .
with a little math , this puts german tax payer 's day to july 13th .
a misleading calculation ?
but it 's a calculation the german finance ministry calls misleading .
" it 's a one-sided interpretation of the data that does little to judge the actual situation , " ministry spokesman torsten albig said , adding that the association 's estimate of state spending is considerably higher than that of the federal bank and other economic institutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state will be taking about 53 pecent of what 's in there after reading a report in the handelsblatt newspaper , however , some germans may still call for the country 's tax payers ' memorial day to be moved to earlier in the year and ask to keep more than 47 cents per euro they make .
federal and state finance offices saw the total tax income increase faster than it expected in the first half of 2007 , according to the german business paper .
citing anonymous finance ministry sources , the paper said the ministry took in 238.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 329 billion -rrb- in the first half of 2007 , 29 billion euros more than in for the same period of 2006 , an increase of 13.9 percent .
an official report , scheduled to be released next week , is also reported to show that june tax revenues were nearly 50 billion euros , 12.6 percent more than in june 2006 .
lower unemployment is one of the key reasons why the state 's revenues have increased , according to the german finance ministry .
" the deciding factor comes mainly from the increase compared to last year of tax contributions through the social welfare system , " the ministry said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
nord stream bosses wo n't know for sure until at least 2010 the german-russian gas pipeline saga continues with a new disputed region causing a rethink over its route .
the nord stream consortium is again forced into finding an alternative direction for its maligned project . when it is finally completed , the planned russian-german natural gas pipeline may have more twists and turns than a bowl of spaghetti .
a spokesman for the nord stream consortium said wednesday that the disputed pipeline would again have to change its route after it was revealed a section had been earmarked for a stretch of water that both poland and denmark claim as an exclusive economic zone .
in april this year , nord stream - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - had its plans for running a stretch of the pipeline through estonian waters thrown into doubt over fears that it could disturb unexploded munitions and chemical dumps from world war ii .
such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry at the time .
this latest obstacle to the 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 750-mile -rrb- pipeline may prove to be more concrete in its disruption .
both denmark and poland claim the ownership of the area and nord stream is reluctant to get involved with any dispute .
pipeline consortium resorts to plan b ... or c bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord stream has had to adapt its plans after complaints now accustomed to the need to redirect the pipeline when opposition arises , nord stream said that it already has an alternative route that it proposes to take to avoid the disputed territory .
the consortium would attempt to squeeze the pipeline between the danish island of bornholm and sweden 's southeastern coast ; although nord stream stated that no final decision had been made .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
several coastal nations have expressed concern over the pipeline which is to deliver natural gas from russia to germany , saying it will damage the baltic sea 's delicate ecosystem .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment while sweden in particular has complained that the pipeline could disrupt the baltic sea ’ s sensitive flora and fauna .
study hopes to alleviate environmental fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns over the pipeline 's route out at sea in accordance with the european union rules , nord stream is required to furnish an environmental impact assessment -lrb- eia -rrb- to those countries whose territorial waters would be affected .
the consortium is expected to do so later this year .
" nord stream has decided to launch additional studies to investigate areas where the route of the pipeline through the baltic sea can be further optimized in a reasonable way to minimize environmental impacts , " the consortium said in a statement earlier this year . the pipeline has also created political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
in-between nations concerned at duopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schröder co-developed the project the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
the fact that the project was negotiated by russia and germany without consulting the countries between them has also created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the recent heightening of political tensions between russia and estonia has also left many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
if completed by 2010 as planned , the 1,200-kilometer pipeline would pump 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year from vyborg , russia to greifswald in northern germany .
in a second phase , a parallel pipeline would double that transport capacity , and nord stream estimates that will meet about 25 percent of the additional gas needs of the european union . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

from the level-headed and unassuming way young minu dietlinde tizabi has completed the german version of the high school diploma at the tender age of 14 , the indications are that she will join the second group .
tizabi not only completed the abitur exam four years earlier than usual but she passed with the highest possible grade , a 1.0 .
out of a maximum of 840 points she could have scored on the test , the youngster from pforzheim racked up an amazing 815 .

" i do n't study more than any of the others , " tizabi said in an interview with spiegel magazine .
" but i do have a lot of hobbies .
for example i took part in the biology olympic games , just out of interest . "
now that she is a high school graduate , tizabi said she did n't have any special plans for the summer vacation - other than pursuing her usual interests in literature and creative writing .
" i love to read , especially in english , " she said .
" and i also write my own stories in english .
i read the harry potter books in english … i think they 're good but the whole thing is exaggerated .

despite the tragedy of losing her mother at such an early age , tizabi has certainly prospered under her father 's guidance .
father djamshid , an iranian-born certified engineer in quantum electronics , is obviously no slouch either and has not only instilled a love of learning in his daughter but has given her the humility that he himself shows .

while she more than keeps up with her classmates in the academic stakes , there is one aspect of school in which tizabi does show her age : sports .

"
nord stream bosses wo n't know for sure until at least 2010 the german-russian gas pipeline saga continues with a new disputed region causing a rethink over its route .
the nord stream consortium is again forced into finding an alternative direction for its maligned project . when it is finally completed , the planned russian-german natural gas pipeline may have more twists and turns than a bowl of spaghetti .
a spokesman for the nord stream consortium said wednesday that the disputed pipeline would again have to change its route after it was revealed a section had been earmarked for a stretch of water that both poland and denmark claim as an exclusive economic zone .
in april this year , nord stream - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - had its plans for running a stretch of the pipeline through estonian waters thrown into doubt over fears that it could disturb unexploded munitions and chemical dumps from world war ii .
such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry at the time .
this latest obstacle to the 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 750-mile -rrb- pipeline may prove to be more concrete in its disruption .
both denmark and poland claim the ownership of the area and nord stream is reluctant to get involved with any dispute .
pipeline consortium resorts to plan b ... or c bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord stream has had to adapt its plans after complaints now accustomed to the need to redirect the pipeline when opposition arises , nord stream said that it already has an alternative route that it proposes to take to avoid the disputed territory .
the consortium would attempt to squeeze the pipeline between the danish island of bornholm and sweden 's southeastern coast ; although nord stream stated that no final decision had been made .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
several coastal nations have expressed concern over the pipeline which is to deliver natural gas from russia to germany , saying it will damage the baltic sea 's delicate ecosystem .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment while sweden in particular has complained that the pipeline could disrupt the baltic sea ’ s sensitive flora and fauna .
study hopes to alleviate environmental fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns over the pipeline 's route out at sea in accordance with the european union rules , nord stream is required to furnish an environmental impact assessment -lrb- eia -rrb- to those countries whose territorial waters would be affected .
the consortium is expected to do so later this year .
" nord stream has decided to launch additional studies to investigate areas where the route of the pipeline through the baltic sea can be further optimized in a reasonable way to minimize environmental impacts , " the consortium said in a statement earlier this year . the pipeline has also created political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
in-between nations concerned at duopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schröder co-developed the project the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
the fact that the project was negotiated by russia and germany without consulting the countries between them has also created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the recent heightening of political tensions between russia and estonia has also left many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
if completed by 2010 as planned , the 1,200-kilometer pipeline would pump 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year from vyborg , russia to greifswald in northern germany .
in a second phase , a parallel pipeline would double that transport capacity , and nord stream estimates that will meet about 25 percent of the additional gas needs of the european union . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she likes to read and meet with her friends .
but where she is above average is in the classroom .
she has just passed the high school exam taken by 18-year-olds . child prodigies : you either love them -lrb- if they 're your own -rrb- or hate them -lrb- if you 're a jealous classmate -rrb- .
some turn out to be precocious little brats who know exactly how brainy they are ; they never stop telling others about how brainy they are and then they start their own computer software firm to prove how brainy they are .
others quietly go about the business of overachieving , leave education with awards falling out of their spongebob squarepants rucksack and go on to make a real difference in the world .
from the level-headed and unassuming way young minu dietlinde tizabi has completed the german version of the high school diploma at the tender age of 14 , the indications are that she will join the second group .
tizabi not only completed the abitur exam four years earlier than usual but she passed with the highest possible grade , a 1.0 .
out of a maximum of 840 points she could have scored on the test , the youngster from pforzheim racked up an amazing 815 .
a reader and writer of english bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harry potter : one of minu 's preferred reads but " just a book " the grounded teenager , who lost her mother when she was just a month old and was raised by her father , does n't see anything special in her results .
her friend hanna , after all , scored more than her .
hanna scored 835 points - but she is 18 .
" i do n't study more than any of the others , " tizabi said in an interview with spiegel magazine .
" but i do have a lot of hobbies .
for example i took part in the biology olympic games , just out of interest . "
now that she is a high school graduate , tizabi said she did n't have any special plans for the summer vacation - other than pursuing her usual interests in literature and creative writing .
" i love to read , especially in english , " she said .
" and i also write my own stories in english .
i read the harry potter books in english … i think they 're good but the whole thing is exaggerated .
it 's just a book like any other . "
some children already show an aptitude for learning at very early ages .
tizabi was definitely one of these .
as a one year old , she was constructing the toys which came with her favorite chocolate eggs .
she was reading at three , tackling encyclopedias and studying astronomy books .
at age six , she went to school and immediately jumped three years .
swiftly up the education ladder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minu immediately leapt three classes when starting school " in total , i have jumped four classes , " she said .
" because i could read so well , i was moved up as soon as i started school .
when i started high school , i was moved up a year within three weeks of starting .
all my friends were three and four years older than me . "
despite the tragedy of losing her mother at such an early age , tizabi has certainly prospered under her father 's guidance .
father djamshid , an iranian-born certified engineer in quantum electronics , is obviously no slouch either and has not only instilled a love of learning in his daughter but has given her the humility that he himself shows .
" she is no child prodigy , " he said matter-of-factly in a recent interview with a local newspaper .
" she is quite normal . "
while she more than keeps up with her classmates in the academic stakes , there is one aspect of school in which tizabi does show her age : sports .
she is a lot smaller than her classmates and , as a result , has been taken out of physical education classes for her own good .
in the class , however , she is seen as a peer - by most of her classmates .

while the gaza strip is controlled by hamas , the west bank is ruled by an emergency government under salam fayyad in cooperation with the president and fatah chairman , mahmoud abbas . israel and the international community have interpreted the split as a chance .
thus , the islamists in the gaza strip could be more easily isolated and the emergency government in the west bank could be a partner for the resumption of cooperation , economic development and a diplomatic process .
" flourishing landscapes " and new freedom of movement in the west bank would convince the palestinian population of fatah being the right choice for the future . but the " hamastan vs fatah-land " -approach is hugely unrealistic . bildunterschrift : muriel asseburg israel has announced a gradual release of customs duties and value-added tax revenues collected on behalf of the palestinian authority and worth some $ 700 million that it has withheld since the establishment of the hamas-led government in march 2006 .
it has also promised to lift a few roadblocks in the west bank , dismantle some settlement outposts and allow weapon deliveries such as armoured vehicles to strengthen fatah . but all these measures are far from sufficient to trigger a new dynamic and to tangibly improve the situation in the west bank : as long as the system of roadblocks and permits remains in place , the palestinian economy will not see a sustainable recovery . an approach that pins hopes on a military confrontation between fatah and hamas will not stabilize the situation either .
instead , it carries the danger of a renewed flare-up of internal palestinian fighting and its escalation into a civil war . also , increasing the pressure on the population in the gaza strip is hardly possible without causing a humanitarian catastrophe .
the official unemployment rate in the region is already at some 35 percent , the poverty rate at above 75 percent .
around two thirds of the population depend on international aid deliveries .
the danger of economic isolation then is to radicalize the gaza strip ’ s population and to increase the attraction of salafist and jihadist groups – which , in contrast to hamas , neither have a national agenda nor an interest in stabilization . the new-old approach of the international community is contributing to making the vision of a two-state settlement increasingly unrealistic .
this is because it sacrifices the creation of functioning and democratic palestinian institutions in favour of short-term stability .
and because it does nothing to prevent the ever greater erosion of a contiguous territory for a palestinian state – which is a result of the separation barrier , the expansion of settlements and the corresponding transportation network in the west bank . german and european policies should therefore concentrate on averting a humanitarian catastrophe in the gaza strip and on creating conditions for an economic revival both there and in the west bank .
they should avoid undermining reconciliation among palestinian factions , support improved governance of palestinian institutions and take serious steps to achieve a two-state settlement in cooperation with the middle east quartet and the arab peace initiative . muriel asseburg is head of the research unit for the middle east and africa at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the gaza strip is controlled by hamas , the west bank is ruled by an emergency government under salam fayyad in cooperation with the president and fatah chairman , mahmoud abbas . israel and the international community have interpreted the split as a chance .
thus , the islamists in the gaza strip could be more easily isolated and the emergency government in the west bank could be a partner for the resumption of cooperation , economic development and a diplomatic process .
" flourishing landscapes " and new freedom of movement in the west bank would convince the palestinian population of fatah being the right choice for the future . but the " hamastan vs fatah-land " -approach is hugely unrealistic . bildunterschrift : muriel asseburg israel has announced a gradual release of customs duties and value-added tax revenues collected on behalf of the palestinian authority and worth some $ 700 million that it has withheld since the establishment of the hamas-led government in march 2006 .
it has also promised to lift a few roadblocks in the west bank , dismantle some settlement outposts and allow weapon deliveries such as armoured vehicles to strengthen fatah . but all these measures are far from sufficient to trigger a new dynamic and to tangibly improve the situation in the west bank : as long as the system of roadblocks and permits remains in place , the palestinian economy will not see a sustainable recovery . an approach that pins hopes on a military confrontation between fatah and hamas will not stabilize the situation either .
instead , it carries the danger of a renewed flare-up of internal palestinian fighting and its escalation into a civil war . also , increasing the pressure on the population in the gaza strip is hardly possible without causing a humanitarian catastrophe .
the official unemployment rate in the region is already at some 35 percent , the poverty rate at above 75 percent .
around two thirds of the population depend on international aid deliveries .
the danger of economic isolation then is to radicalize the gaza strip ’ s population and to increase the attraction of salafist and jihadist groups – which , in contrast to hamas , neither have a national agenda nor an interest in stabilization . the new-old approach of the international community is contributing to making the vision of a two-state settlement increasingly unrealistic .
this is because it sacrifices the creation of functioning and democratic palestinian institutions in favour of short-term stability .
and because it does nothing to prevent the ever greater erosion of a contiguous territory for a palestinian state – which is a result of the separation barrier , the expansion of settlements and the corresponding transportation network in the west bank . german and european policies should therefore concentrate on averting a humanitarian catastrophe in the gaza strip and on creating conditions for an economic revival both there and in the west bank .
they should avoid undermining reconciliation among palestinian factions , support improved governance of palestinian institutions and take serious steps to achieve a two-state settlement in cooperation with the middle east quartet and the arab peace initiative . muriel asseburg is head of the research unit for the middle east and africa at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a clemency deal could be in the offing . " the court rejects the appeals of the defendants and confirms the death penalty , " judge fathi dahn said after a five-minute hearing . the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor were found guilty late last year of intentional infecting more than 400 libyan children with hiv in the late 1990s .
all worked in the al-fateh children 's hospital in the city of benghazi . the defendants have been incarcerated since 1999 .
they deny intentionally infecting the children and claim that they were tortured while in libyan prisons , saying the confessions at the center of the prosecution 's case were coerced . in 2003 , a french doctor charged with investigating the outbreak of hiv at the hospital found that it had started before the six medics arrived there . the sentence has become an international political issue , with bulgaria , the eu and the us urging libya not to carry out the executions .
" we regret that these decisions have been taken , but i would also like to express my confidence that a solution will be found , " eu commission president jose manuel barroso told the european parliament after the libyan court 's ruling was announced . behind-the-scenes negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the key to a settlement could be gadhafi , who wants closer ties with the west the case now goes to the government-controlled high judicial council , which has the authority to change the sentence or even pardon the defendants .
the council will meet on july 16 . " we hope things will be clear on monday , " bulgaria 's prime minister sergei stanishev said on bulgarian radio .
" the decision of the council will open the way for solving the case on a political level and will be the final step in the talks held in the last few months . " there has been speculation that the six medics could be freed in exchange for money to provide for the infected children 's medical care . on tuesday , it was reported that such an agreement had been mediated by the gadhafi foundation , a charity organization run by one of the sons of libyan leader moammar gadhafi . but the families of the children have reportedly asked for 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.7 million -rrb- in compensation per child , a sum the eu has been unwilling to pay .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 13.07.2007 in europe , iraqi asylum-seekers find doors being shut großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi bodyguard muhannad yousif who sought a new life in sweden experts have criticized germany 's policies towards iraqi asylum-seekers as too restrictive .
fearful of a refugee influx , however , other european nations have started tightening their asylum rules . " when you go out in baghdad , there 's a 50 percent chance you may never come home , " said murad atshan , an iraqi filmmaker living in germany . anyone who follows news of daily suicide bombings , a bloody insurgency and sectarian violence in the iraqi capital will probably nod in agreement at the statement .
german authorities in munich , however , rejected atshan 's application for asylum a year ago , saying he did n't give a good enough reason for seeking protection . the 27-year-old has since been confined to a refugee center in a tiny village in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , near the swiss border . while german authorities are deciding what to do with him , atshan is n't allowed to leave the district or work . " it 's very frustrating , " he said .
" i did n't come here looking for a good life , i just wanted to be somewhere safe .
but this is no normal life . " in addition to worrying about his family back home in baghdad , atshan is grappling with getting used to life in a small foreign village . " i 'm used to living in big cities , " he said . " i ca n't even go to the movies here . " living in limbo atshan 's case is depressingly familiar in the country whose complicated asylum and refugee laws have come under increasing criticism from aid and refugee groups .
germany is home to an estimated 73,000 iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi family at a refugee home in germany experts say german asylum rules date back to the 1990s when tens of thousands of iraqis fleeing saddam hussein 's dictatorship applied for and easily received asylum status in germany on grounds of political persecution . " the moment saddam was toppled in 2003 , however , the german government sent out letters to thousands of iraqis saying their asylum status would be revoked since the persecutor was now gone , " said bernd mesovic of campaign group proasyl .
" it 's as if the authorities did n't watch television and did n't know what 's happening in iraq . " last year , german authorities stripped 8,189 refugees of their asylum status .
this week , human rights watch slammed germany 's move earlier this year to revoke the refugee status of over 18,000 iraqis . " losing your asylum status has serious repercussions , " said marianne heuwagen , head of the german section of human rights watch , because it can lead to reduced social benefits and severe restrictions on work , mobility and unification with family members . " in others words , it leaves you in limbo and with an uncertain future , " she said . civil war not asylum-worthy german authorities admit that iraqis seeking asylum must now prove they face personal risk in their homeland .
general instability or civil war is not reason enough to grant asylum though it is sufficient to put a freeze on deportations . at the same time , revoking asylum status does not automatically mean iraqis will be sent back home , said claudia moebus , spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis in baghdad have to live with daily car and suicide bombings " each refugee has the right to appeal and each individual case is carefully considered before any decision is taken , " moebus said . she added that german authorities had also reversed their recent decision to strip 18,000 iraqis of their refugee status with the exceptions of criminals and those who returned to northern iraq , which is considered relatively stable .
she declined to give exact figures . liberal sweden puts up barriers germany is not alone in its restrictive attitude towards iraqi asylum-seekers . experts point out that most eu nations remain reluctant to take in iraqi asylum-seekers even though those who knock on their doors make up only a fraction of the estimated four million displaced since the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
neighboring jordan and syria have taken in two million , while another two million remain uprooted within iraq . last year , just about 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the bloc . sweden has thus far stood out among europeans for having the most welcoming attitude and taking in the highest numbers of iraqi asylum-seekers - some 9,000 alone last year .
many of the refugees in sweden have joined existing iraqi communities in towns such as malmo on the southwest coast . last week , however , the country , which has long called on other eu members to shoulder the burden , said it 's tightening its asylum rules and will forcibly deport iraqis who are denied permission to stay . " asylum a dangerous lottery " " asylum in europe has become a dangerous lottery , " said richard williams of the european council of refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , referring to the disparate practices among eu nations on granting asylum . " generally every european country is afraid of being seen as too attractive to asylum-seekers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi refugee djabar lafte latif who lives in saxony-anhalt in germany in addition to german and swedish restrictions , britain , in particular , and denmark have sent iraqis back home .
experts are also concerned that the policies of these countries are not in accordance with international treaties such as the geneva convention . in addition to plodding moves towards a harmonized eu asylum policy - a goal hoped to be achieved by 2010 - some say european leaders need to do more to sell the idea of asylum on humanitarian grounds .

german authorities in munich , however , rejected atshan 's application for asylum a year ago , saying he did n't give a good enough reason for seeking protection . the 27-year-old has since been confined to a refugee center in a tiny village in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , near the swiss border . while german authorities are deciding what to do with him , atshan is n't allowed to leave the district or work . " it 's very frustrating , " he said .
" i did n't come here looking for a good life , i just wanted to be somewhere safe .

germany is home to an estimated 73,000 iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi family at a refugee home in germany experts say german asylum rules date back to the 1990s when tens of thousands of iraqis fleeing saddam hussein 's dictatorship applied for and easily received asylum status in germany on grounds of political persecution . " the moment saddam was toppled in 2003 , however , the german government sent out letters to thousands of iraqis saying their asylum status would be revoked since the persecutor was now gone , " said bernd mesovic of campaign group proasyl .
" it 's as if the authorities did n't watch television and did n't know what 's happening in iraq . " last year , german authorities stripped 8,189 refugees of their asylum status .
this week , human rights watch slammed germany 's move earlier this year to revoke the refugee status of over 18,000 iraqis . " losing your asylum status has serious repercussions , " said marianne heuwagen , head of the german section of human rights watch , because it can lead to reduced social benefits and severe restrictions on work , mobility and unification with family members . " in others words , it leaves you in limbo and with an uncertain future , " she said . civil war not asylum-worthy german authorities admit that iraqis seeking asylum must now prove they face personal risk in their homeland .
general instability or civil war is not reason enough to grant asylum though it is sufficient to put a freeze on deportations . at the same time , revoking asylum status does not automatically mean iraqis will be sent back home , said claudia moebus , spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis in baghdad have to live with daily car and suicide bombings " each refugee has the right to appeal and each individual case is carefully considered before any decision is taken , " moebus said . she added that german authorities had also reversed their recent decision to strip 18,000 iraqis of their refugee status with the exceptions of criminals and those who returned to northern iraq , which is considered relatively stable .
she declined to give exact figures . liberal sweden puts up barriers germany is not alone in its restrictive attitude towards iraqi asylum-seekers . experts point out that most eu nations remain reluctant to take in iraqi asylum-seekers even though those who knock on their doors make up only a fraction of the estimated four million displaced since the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
neighboring jordan and syria have taken in two million , while another two million remain uprooted within iraq . last year , just about 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the bloc . sweden has thus far stood out among europeans for having the most welcoming attitude and taking in the highest numbers of iraqi asylum-seekers - some 9,000 alone last year .
many of the refugees in sweden have joined existing iraqi communities in towns such as malmo on the southwest coast . last week , however , the country , which has long called on other eu members to shoulder the burden , said it 's tightening its asylum rules and will forcibly deport iraqis who are denied permission to stay . " asylum a dangerous lottery " " asylum in europe has become a dangerous lottery , " said richard williams of the european council of refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , referring to the disparate practices among eu nations on granting asylum . " generally every european country is afraid of being seen as too attractive to asylum-seekers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi refugee djabar lafte latif who lives in saxony-anhalt in germany in addition to german and swedish restrictions , britain , in particular , and denmark have sent iraqis back home .
experts are also concerned that the policies of these countries are not in accordance with international treaties such as the geneva convention . in addition to plodding moves towards a harmonized eu asylum policy - a goal hoped to be achieved by 2010 - some say european leaders need to do more to sell the idea of asylum on humanitarian grounds .

fearful of a refugee influx , however , other european nations have started tightening their asylum rules . " when you go out in baghdad , there 's a 50 percent chance you may never come home , " said murad atshan , an iraqi filmmaker living in germany . anyone who follows news of daily suicide bombings , a bloody insurgency and sectarian violence in the iraqi capital will probably nod in agreement at the statement .
german authorities in munich , however , rejected atshan 's application for asylum a year ago , saying he did n't give a good enough reason for seeking protection . the 27-year-old has since been confined to a refugee center in a tiny village in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , near the swiss border . while german authorities are deciding what to do with him , atshan is n't allowed to leave the district or work . " it 's very frustrating , " he said .
" i did n't come here looking for a good life , i just wanted to be somewhere safe .
but this is no normal life . " in addition to worrying about his family back home in baghdad , atshan is grappling with getting used to life in a small foreign village . " i 'm used to living in big cities , " he said . " i ca n't even go to the movies here . " living in limbo atshan 's case is depressingly familiar in the country whose complicated asylum and refugee laws have come under increasing criticism from aid and refugee groups .
germany is home to an estimated 73,000 iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi family at a refugee home in germany experts say german asylum rules date back to the 1990s when tens of thousands of iraqis fleeing saddam hussein 's dictatorship applied for and easily received asylum status in germany on grounds of political persecution . " the moment saddam was toppled in 2003 , however , the german government sent out letters to thousands of iraqis saying their asylum status would be revoked since the persecutor was now gone , " said bernd mesovic of campaign group proasyl .
" it 's as if the authorities did n't watch television and did n't know what 's happening in iraq . " last year , german authorities stripped 8,189 refugees of their asylum status .
this week , human rights watch slammed germany 's move earlier this year to revoke the refugee status of over 18,000 iraqis . " losing your asylum status has serious repercussions , " said marianne heuwagen , head of the german section of human rights watch , because it can lead to reduced social benefits and severe restrictions on work , mobility and unification with family members . " in others words , it leaves you in limbo and with an uncertain future , " she said . civil war not asylum-worthy german authorities admit that iraqis seeking asylum must now prove they face personal risk in their homeland .
general instability or civil war is not reason enough to grant asylum though it is sufficient to put a freeze on deportations . at the same time , revoking asylum status does not automatically mean iraqis will be sent back home , said claudia moebus , spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis in baghdad have to live with daily car and suicide bombings " each refugee has the right to appeal and each individual case is carefully considered before any decision is taken , " moebus said . she added that german authorities had also reversed their recent decision to strip 18,000 iraqis of their refugee status with the exceptions of criminals and those who returned to northern iraq , which is considered relatively stable .
she declined to give exact figures . liberal sweden puts up barriers germany is not alone in its restrictive attitude towards iraqi asylum-seekers . experts point out that most eu nations remain reluctant to take in iraqi asylum-seekers even though those who knock on their doors make up only a fraction of the estimated four million displaced since the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
neighboring jordan and syria have taken in two million , while another two million remain uprooted within iraq . last year , just about 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the bloc . sweden has thus far stood out among europeans for having the most welcoming attitude and taking in the highest numbers of iraqi asylum-seekers - some 9,000 alone last year .
many of the refugees in sweden have joined existing iraqi communities in towns such as malmo on the southwest coast . last week , however , the country , which has long called on other eu members to shoulder the burden , said it 's tightening its asylum rules and will forcibly deport iraqis who are denied permission to stay . " asylum a dangerous lottery " " asylum in europe has become a dangerous lottery , " said richard williams of the european council of refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , referring to the disparate practices among eu nations on granting asylum . " generally every european country is afraid of being seen as too attractive to asylum-seekers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi refugee djabar lafte latif who lives in saxony-anhalt in germany in addition to german and swedish restrictions , britain , in particular , and denmark have sent iraqis back home .
experts are also concerned that the policies of these countries are not in accordance with international treaties such as the geneva convention . in addition to plodding moves towards a harmonized eu asylum policy - a goal hoped to be achieved by 2010 - some say european leaders need to do more to sell the idea of asylum on humanitarian grounds .

while the gaza strip is controlled by hamas , the west bank is ruled by an emergency government under salam fayyad in cooperation with the president and fatah chairman , mahmoud abbas . israel and the international community have interpreted the split as a chance .
thus , the islamists in the gaza strip could be more easily isolated and the emergency government in the west bank could be a partner for the resumption of cooperation , economic development and a diplomatic process .
" flourishing landscapes " and new freedom of movement in the west bank would convince the palestinian population of fatah being the right choice for the future . but the " hamastan vs fatah-land " -approach is hugely unrealistic . bildunterschrift : muriel asseburg israel has announced a gradual release of customs duties and value-added tax revenues collected on behalf of the palestinian authority and worth some $ 700 million that it has withheld since the establishment of the hamas-led government in march 2006 .
it has also promised to lift a few roadblocks in the west bank , dismantle some settlement outposts and allow weapon deliveries such as armoured vehicles to strengthen fatah . but all these measures are far from sufficient to trigger a new dynamic and to tangibly improve the situation in the west bank : as long as the system of roadblocks and permits remains in place , the palestinian economy will not see a sustainable recovery . an approach that pins hopes on a military confrontation between fatah and hamas will not stabilize the situation either .
instead , it carries the danger of a renewed flare-up of internal palestinian fighting and its escalation into a civil war . also , increasing the pressure on the population in the gaza strip is hardly possible without causing a humanitarian catastrophe .
the official unemployment rate in the region is already at some 35 percent , the poverty rate at above 75 percent .
around two thirds of the population depend on international aid deliveries .
the danger of economic isolation then is to radicalize the gaza strip ’ s population and to increase the attraction of salafist and jihadist groups – which , in contrast to hamas , neither have a national agenda nor an interest in stabilization . the new-old approach of the international community is contributing to making the vision of a two-state settlement increasingly unrealistic .
this is because it sacrifices the creation of functioning and democratic palestinian institutions in favour of short-term stability .
and because it does nothing to prevent the ever greater erosion of a contiguous territory for a palestinian state – which is a result of the separation barrier , the expansion of settlements and the corresponding transportation network in the west bank . german and european policies should therefore concentrate on averting a humanitarian catastrophe in the gaza strip and on creating conditions for an economic revival both there and in the west bank .
they should avoid undermining reconciliation among palestinian factions , support improved governance of palestinian institutions and take serious steps to achieve a two-state settlement in cooperation with the middle east quartet and the arab peace initiative . muriel asseburg is head of the research unit for the middle east and africa at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a clemency deal could be in the offing . " the court rejects the appeals of the defendants and confirms the death penalty , " judge fathi dahn said after a five-minute hearing . the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor were found guilty late last year of intentional infecting more than 400 libyan children with hiv in the late 1990s .
all worked in the al-fateh children 's hospital in the city of benghazi . the defendants have been incarcerated since 1999 .
they deny intentionally infecting the children and claim that they were tortured while in libyan prisons , saying the confessions at the center of the prosecution 's case were coerced . in 2003 , a french doctor charged with investigating the outbreak of hiv at the hospital found that it had started before the six medics arrived there . the sentence has become an international political issue , with bulgaria , the eu and the us urging libya not to carry out the executions .
" we regret that these decisions have been taken , but i would also like to express my confidence that a solution will be found , " eu commission president jose manuel barroso told the european parliament after the libyan court 's ruling was announced . behind-the-scenes negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the key to a settlement could be gadhafi , who wants closer ties with the west the case now goes to the government-controlled high judicial council , which has the authority to change the sentence or even pardon the defendants .
the council will meet on july 16 . " we hope things will be clear on monday , " bulgaria 's prime minister sergei stanishev said on bulgarian radio .
" the decision of the council will open the way for solving the case on a political level and will be the final step in the talks held in the last few months . " there has been speculation that the six medics could be freed in exchange for money to provide for the infected children 's medical care . on tuesday , it was reported that such an agreement had been mediated by the gadhafi foundation , a charity organization run by one of the sons of libyan leader moammar gadhafi . but the families of the children have reportedly asked for 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.7 million -rrb- in compensation per child , a sum the eu has been unwilling to pay .

but the result was clouded by the decision of various turkish associations to abstain from attending the summit , and it 's been clear for days that the atmosphere of the first summit , which took place in 2006 , would not be replicated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp the associations are annoyed that the german government did not sufficiently consult with them about tightening an immigration law , critics say .
though not explicitly named , turkish immigrants are particularly discriminated against , the associations also said .
not only because they make the largest group of so-called " migrants , " but also for concrete reasons : spouses have to learn german in their home countries and have to be at least 18 years old before they can come to germany .
the irritated turkish association pushed forward a debate that more than clearly demonstrated how poorly the law handles integration .
some of the associations ' representatives even spoke of it violating their human rights .
" absurd , " the politicians countered , adding that raising the age of immigration to 18 would avoid forced marriages .
and secondly , it must be clear that people who want to live in germany should speak german .
the politicians do n't bring up the fact that this is n't quite as easy in anatolian villages as in new york or tokyo - where the condition is n't even being imposed .
not to mention that german is best learnt in germany .
the turkish groups - somewhat unskillfully - gave the impression that they wanted to put pressure on the government .
but german politicians tried to trivialize the situation and insinuate that the groups wanted to prevent what is clear to everyone and questioned by few : that the integration of immigrants is important and that language skills are , naturally , required .
but acquiring language skills in anatolia - even if it 's just the " 300 words " that german politicians suddenly say are necessary - is a hurdle for the people who live there and want to move to germany .
while talking about avoiding forced marriages may be politically beneficial , it can not be achieved by raising the age of immigration and certainly not by 300 german words .
these are problems that have to be solved in germany .
and that has to be done on equal footing with the immigrants , as the politicians like to say .
this is what should have happened before the changes were made to the immigration law .
then we could have saved ourselves a lot of aggravation , and some things could have really improved .

but the result was clouded by the decision of various turkish associations to abstain from attending the summit , and it 's been clear for days that the atmosphere of the first summit , which took place in 2006 , would not be replicated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp the associations are annoyed that the german government did not sufficiently consult with them about tightening an immigration law , critics say .
though not explicitly named , turkish immigrants are particularly discriminated against , the associations also said .
not only because they make the largest group of so-called " migrants , " but also for concrete reasons : spouses have to learn german in their home countries and have to be at least 18 years old before they can come to germany .
the irritated turkish association pushed forward a debate that more than clearly demonstrated how poorly the law handles integration .
some of the associations ' representatives even spoke of it violating their human rights .
" absurd , " the politicians countered , adding that raising the age of immigration to 18 would avoid forced marriages .
and secondly , it must be clear that people who want to live in germany should speak german .
the politicians do n't bring up the fact that this is n't quite as easy in anatolian villages as in new york or tokyo - where the condition is n't even being imposed .
not to mention that german is best learnt in germany .
the turkish groups - somewhat unskillfully - gave the impression that they wanted to put pressure on the government .
but german politicians tried to trivialize the situation and insinuate that the groups wanted to prevent what is clear to everyone and questioned by few : that the integration of immigrants is important and that language skills are , naturally , required .

"
nord stream bosses wo n't know for sure until at least 2010 the german-russian gas pipeline saga continues with a new disputed region causing a rethink over its route .
the nord stream consortium is again forced into finding an alternative direction for its maligned project . when it is finally completed , the planned russian-german natural gas pipeline may have more twists and turns than a bowl of spaghetti .
a spokesman for the nord stream consortium said wednesday that the disputed pipeline would again have to change its route after it was revealed a section had been earmarked for a stretch of water that both poland and denmark claim as an exclusive economic zone .
in april this year , nord stream - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - had its plans for running a stretch of the pipeline through estonian waters thrown into doubt over fears that it could disturb unexploded munitions and chemical dumps from world war ii .
such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry at the time .
this latest obstacle to the 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 750-mile -rrb- pipeline may prove to be more concrete in its disruption .
both denmark and poland claim the ownership of the area and nord stream is reluctant to get involved with any dispute .
pipeline consortium resorts to plan b ... or c bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord stream has had to adapt its plans after complaints now accustomed to the need to redirect the pipeline when opposition arises , nord stream said that it already has an alternative route that it proposes to take to avoid the disputed territory .
the consortium would attempt to squeeze the pipeline between the danish island of bornholm and sweden 's southeastern coast ; although nord stream stated that no final decision had been made .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
several coastal nations have expressed concern over the pipeline which is to deliver natural gas from russia to germany , saying it will damage the baltic sea 's delicate ecosystem .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment while sweden in particular has complained that the pipeline could disrupt the baltic sea ’ s sensitive flora and fauna .
study hopes to alleviate environmental fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns over the pipeline 's route out at sea in accordance with the european union rules , nord stream is required to furnish an environmental impact assessment -lrb- eia -rrb- to those countries whose territorial waters would be affected .
the consortium is expected to do so later this year .
" nord stream has decided to launch additional studies to investigate areas where the route of the pipeline through the baltic sea can be further optimized in a reasonable way to minimize environmental impacts , " the consortium said in a statement earlier this year . the pipeline has also created political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
in-between nations concerned at duopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schröder co-developed the project the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
the fact that the project was negotiated by russia and germany without consulting the countries between them has also created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the recent heightening of political tensions between russia and estonia has also left many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
if completed by 2010 as planned , the 1,200-kilometer pipeline would pump 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year from vyborg , russia to greifswald in northern germany .
in a second phase , a parallel pipeline would double that transport capacity , and nord stream estimates that will meet about 25 percent of the additional gas needs of the european union . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 13.07.2007 proposal to promote german citizenship divides parties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians ca n't agree on whether to push immigrants to take on german citizenship one day after german chancellor angela merkel termed the country 's second integration summit a success , a social democratic politician has called for a new program to encourage immigrants to take on german citizenship . sebastian edathy , chairman of the bundestag 's interior committee and senior member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , called on friday for more political involvement on the part of immigrants in germany .
he suggested launching a " citizenship campaign " to persuade foreigners to change their nationality .
" we should persuade people who have a right to citizenship to do more than be just residents and to become citizens , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
but edathy 's idea was met with skepticism in the conservative ranks of the german political establishment .
stephan mayer , parliamentary head for the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , questioned whether giving citizenship to foreigners would lead to better integration .
" awarding citizenship can only take place at the end of a successful integration process , certainly not at the beginning , " mayer said .
" the state can not offer citizenship as a concession . "
a sensitive issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners have to give up their previous citizenship to become german the integration issue in germany has been traditionally plagued by the widely divergent positions of the spd and the cdu / csu - now united under the umbrella of merkel 's grand coalition government .
foreigners , who are not married to german citizens , currently obtain the right to apply for german citizenship if they have been legally living in germany for at least eight years , if they can financially support themselves and their families without state aid , if they possess sufficient german language skills , have not been convicted of a crime , and if they avow they will adhere to germany 's basic law and democratic principles .
by adopting german citizenship , foreigners living in germany are also expected to give up any other citizenship they have .
extending local voting rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu citizens can participate in local elections wherever in the bloc they live edathy also said germany should provide some foreigners with a right to vote in local elections .
" it is key that we improve migrants ' political participation by a right to vote in municipal election for foreigners who have lived in germany for a long time , " he said .
while federal and state elections are open only to a country 's citizens , the european union law opened municipal elections across the 27-member bloc to all eu citizens who are local residents , even if they are not citizens of the country where they live .
" i do n't think much of extending the right to vote because it does n't contribute to integration , " bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein told deutschlandfunk radio on friday .
" integration is a hard task : namely learning the legal system , leaning that you can speak the language and that you fit in to society . "
new ideas after integration summit edathy 's suggestions were not subject to discussion at germany 's second integration summit on thursday , which dealt with proposals from six working groups on how to improve the integration of immigrants living in germany .
despite the decision of some turkish groups to boycott the meeting in protest of a recent law placing additional restrictions on some foreigners before they are allowed to move to germany , merkel called the day-long meeting a success and " milestone " for the country 's integration efforts .
representatives of the federal government , the states and some 90 community leaders at the summit adopted a " national integration plan " containing 400 promises for improvements - ranging from aid for ethnic sports clubs to making more german-language classes available . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opinion : prior debate overshadows integration summit whatever reasons three turkish groups had for boycotting germany 's second integration summit , their absence overshadowed the entire event , according to dw commentator peter philipp .
-lrb- 13.07.2007 -rrb- merkel hails integration milestone , hits back at critics chancellor angela merkel on thursday called germany 's new integration plan for immigrants " a milestone " and rejected criticism from ethnic turkish groups who boycotted a key summit on the issue .

the computer-generated creature is part of an exhibit opening friday at the museum of natural history in berlin . what sounds like a scene from the adventure film jurassic park can be seen in a computer animation exhibit that opened friday at berlin 's museum of natural history . but the " evolution in action " exhibit , housed in four renovated halls , is intended to act as a bridge between scientific research and everyday life . the star of the exhibit is a 13-meter-high and 15-meter-long -lrb- 42.6 foot-high and 49.2-foot long -rrb- brachiosaurus , the tallest dinosaur model ever mounted in a museum .

tax payers ' day is the day of the year from which on people don ’ t work to pay taxes anymore , but just for themselves .
this day is proclaimed by tax payers ' unions worldwide : in the united states , it falls on april 30th , and in the uk , on june 3rd .

"
nord stream bosses wo n't know for sure until at least 2010 the german-russian gas pipeline saga continues with a new disputed region causing a rethink over its route .
the nord stream consortium is again forced into finding an alternative direction for its maligned project . when it is finally completed , the planned russian-german natural gas pipeline may have more twists and turns than a bowl of spaghetti .
a spokesman for the nord stream consortium said wednesday that the disputed pipeline would again have to change its route after it was revealed a section had been earmarked for a stretch of water that both poland and denmark claim as an exclusive economic zone .
in april this year , nord stream - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - had its plans for running a stretch of the pipeline through estonian waters thrown into doubt over fears that it could disturb unexploded munitions and chemical dumps from world war ii .
such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry at the time .
this latest obstacle to the 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 750-mile -rrb- pipeline may prove to be more concrete in its disruption .
both denmark and poland claim the ownership of the area and nord stream is reluctant to get involved with any dispute .
pipeline consortium resorts to plan b ... or c bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord stream has had to adapt its plans after complaints now accustomed to the need to redirect the pipeline when opposition arises , nord stream said that it already has an alternative route that it proposes to take to avoid the disputed territory .
the consortium would attempt to squeeze the pipeline between the danish island of bornholm and sweden 's southeastern coast ; although nord stream stated that no final decision had been made .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
several coastal nations have expressed concern over the pipeline which is to deliver natural gas from russia to germany , saying it will damage the baltic sea 's delicate ecosystem .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment while sweden in particular has complained that the pipeline could disrupt the baltic sea ’ s sensitive flora and fauna .
study hopes to alleviate environmental fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns over the pipeline 's route out at sea in accordance with the european union rules , nord stream is required to furnish an environmental impact assessment -lrb- eia -rrb- to those countries whose territorial waters would be affected .
the consortium is expected to do so later this year .
" nord stream has decided to launch additional studies to investigate areas where the route of the pipeline through the baltic sea can be further optimized in a reasonable way to minimize environmental impacts , " the consortium said in a statement earlier this year . the pipeline has also created political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
in-between nations concerned at duopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schröder co-developed the project the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
the fact that the project was negotiated by russia and germany without consulting the countries between them has also created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the recent heightening of political tensions between russia and estonia has also left many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
if completed by 2010 as planned , the 1,200-kilometer pipeline would pump 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year from vyborg , russia to greifswald in northern germany .
in a second phase , a parallel pipeline would double that transport capacity , and nord stream estimates that will meet about 25 percent of the additional gas needs of the european union . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she likes to read and meet with her friends .
but where she is above average is in the classroom .
she has just passed the high school exam taken by 18-year-olds . child prodigies : you either love them -lrb- if they 're your own -rrb- or hate them -lrb- if you 're a jealous classmate -rrb- .
some turn out to be precocious little brats who know exactly how brainy they are ; they never stop telling others about how brainy they are and then they start their own computer software firm to prove how brainy they are .
others quietly go about the business of overachieving , leave education with awards falling out of their spongebob squarepants rucksack and go on to make a real difference in the world .
from the level-headed and unassuming way young minu dietlinde tizabi has completed the german version of the high school diploma at the tender age of 14 , the indications are that she will join the second group .
tizabi not only completed the abitur exam four years earlier than usual but she passed with the highest possible grade , a 1.0 .
out of a maximum of 840 points she could have scored on the test , the youngster from pforzheim racked up an amazing 815 .
a reader and writer of english bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harry potter : one of minu 's preferred reads but " just a book " the grounded teenager , who lost her mother when she was just a month old and was raised by her father , does n't see anything special in her results .
her friend hanna , after all , scored more than her .
hanna scored 835 points - but she is 18 .
" i do n't study more than any of the others , " tizabi said in an interview with spiegel magazine .
" but i do have a lot of hobbies .
for example i took part in the biology olympic games , just out of interest . "
now that she is a high school graduate , tizabi said she did n't have any special plans for the summer vacation - other than pursuing her usual interests in literature and creative writing .
" i love to read , especially in english , " she said .
" and i also write my own stories in english .
i read the harry potter books in english … i think they 're good but the whole thing is exaggerated .
it 's just a book like any other . "
some children already show an aptitude for learning at very early ages .
tizabi was definitely one of these .
as a one year old , she was constructing the toys which came with her favorite chocolate eggs .
she was reading at three , tackling encyclopedias and studying astronomy books .
at age six , she went to school and immediately jumped three years .
swiftly up the education ladder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minu immediately leapt three classes when starting school " in total , i have jumped four classes , " she said .
" because i could read so well , i was moved up as soon as i started school .
when i started high school , i was moved up a year within three weeks of starting .
all my friends were three and four years older than me . "
despite the tragedy of losing her mother at such an early age , tizabi has certainly prospered under her father 's guidance .
father djamshid , an iranian-born certified engineer in quantum electronics , is obviously no slouch either and has not only instilled a love of learning in his daughter but has given her the humility that he himself shows .
" she is no child prodigy , " he said matter-of-factly in a recent interview with a local newspaper .
" she is quite normal . "
while she more than keeps up with her classmates in the academic stakes , there is one aspect of school in which tizabi does show her age : sports .
she is a lot smaller than her classmates and , as a result , has been taken out of physical education classes for her own good .
in the class , however , she is seen as a peer - by most of her classmates .
" with the girls , it was always okay , " she said .
" but the boys have never completely accepted me .
why , i do not know .
i do n't feel that there is any envy . "
a career in medicine beckons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 14-year-old dreams of a career in medical research it appears that the future is hers for the taking and tizabi already has a plan forming as to what she would like to do with her life .
" i would like to study medicine and then work in research , " the 14-year-old said .
" medical research can save lives , this is very important .
therefore , i think that this is a great occupational goal .
i would most like to study in heidelberg as the university is very good there , especially for studying medicine . "
and while age has not yet been a barrier to her achievements , does tizabi worry that her tender years may go against her in the future ?
" right now , my age is n't a problem in the application process and i have had only positive reactions from the universities . "
" however , if i do get a place at a university to study … my father will have to go there and sign a parental consent form ! " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
nord stream bosses wo n't know for sure until at least 2010 the german-russian gas pipeline saga continues with a new disputed region causing a rethink over its route .
the nord stream consortium is again forced into finding an alternative direction for its maligned project . when it is finally completed , the planned russian-german natural gas pipeline may have more twists and turns than a bowl of spaghetti .
a spokesman for the nord stream consortium said wednesday that the disputed pipeline would again have to change its route after it was revealed a section had been earmarked for a stretch of water that both poland and denmark claim as an exclusive economic zone .
in april this year , nord stream - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - had its plans for running a stretch of the pipeline through estonian waters thrown into doubt over fears that it could disturb unexploded munitions and chemical dumps from world war ii .
such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry at the time .
this latest obstacle to the 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 750-mile -rrb- pipeline may prove to be more concrete in its disruption .
both denmark and poland claim the ownership of the area and nord stream is reluctant to get involved with any dispute .
pipeline consortium resorts to plan b ... or c bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord stream has had to adapt its plans after complaints now accustomed to the need to redirect the pipeline when opposition arises , nord stream said that it already has an alternative route that it proposes to take to avoid the disputed territory .
the consortium would attempt to squeeze the pipeline between the danish island of bornholm and sweden 's southeastern coast ; although nord stream stated that no final decision had been made .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
several coastal nations have expressed concern over the pipeline which is to deliver natural gas from russia to germany , saying it will damage the baltic sea 's delicate ecosystem .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment while sweden in particular has complained that the pipeline could disrupt the baltic sea ’ s sensitive flora and fauna .
study hopes to alleviate environmental fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns over the pipeline 's route out at sea in accordance with the european union rules , nord stream is required to furnish an environmental impact assessment -lrb- eia -rrb- to those countries whose territorial waters would be affected .
the consortium is expected to do so later this year .
" nord stream has decided to launch additional studies to investigate areas where the route of the pipeline through the baltic sea can be further optimized in a reasonable way to minimize environmental impacts , " the consortium said in a statement earlier this year . the pipeline has also created political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
in-between nations concerned at duopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schröder co-developed the project the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
the fact that the project was negotiated by russia and germany without consulting the countries between them has also created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the recent heightening of political tensions between russia and estonia has also left many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
if completed by 2010 as planned , the 1,200-kilometer pipeline would pump 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year from vyborg , russia to greifswald in northern germany .
in a second phase , a parallel pipeline would double that transport capacity , and nord stream estimates that will meet about 25 percent of the additional gas needs of the european union . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a report by the eu human rights commissioner called on germany to investigate its role in secret cia detentions of suspected terrorists .
germany has denied it helped with secret renditions . a new report by the eu 's human rights watchdog accuses germany of assisting in cia kidnappings of suspected terrorists for interrogation in third countries .
germany has consistently denied its involvement in this practice , called " extraordinary rendition . "
the council of europe report said germany has a responsibility to investigate past cases and make sure similar human rights violations do n't happen in the future . german intelligence allegedly involved in el masri case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cia allegedly flew terrorism suspects to afghanistan the report by thomas hammarberg focuses on the case of khaled el masri .
the german national , who was born in lebanon , said he was abducted in 2003 while vacationing in macedonia .
el masri said he was beaten and mistreated and flown by members of a cia team to afghanistan , where he was held as a terrorism suspect for five months and was tortured .
hammarberg 's report said a german intelligence officer visited el masri and traveled with him to europe .
the report expressed concern about the " questioning by german officials of terrorist suspects who have been detained without due process and allegedly tortured . "
" the commissioner calls upon germany to fully investigate all cases of alleged extraordinary renditions that were carried out on german territory or that involved german nationals or long-term residents , " according to the report .
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has denied germany played a role in el masri 's kidnapping . request for compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el masri was held in afghanistan for five months " effective measures should be adopted to prevent unlawful renditions in the future , " the report said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 13.07.2007 in europe , iraqi asylum-seekers find doors being shut großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi bodyguard muhannad yousif who sought a new life in sweden experts have criticized germany 's policies towards iraqi asylum-seekers as too restrictive .
fearful of a refugee influx , however , other european nations have started tightening their asylum rules . " when you go out in baghdad , there 's a 50 percent chance you may never come home , " said murad atshan , an iraqi filmmaker living in germany . anyone who follows news of daily suicide bombings , a bloody insurgency and sectarian violence in the iraqi capital will probably nod in agreement at the statement .
german authorities in munich , however , rejected atshan 's application for asylum a year ago , saying he did n't give a good enough reason for seeking protection . the 27-year-old has since been confined to a refugee center in a tiny village in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , near the swiss border . while german authorities are deciding what to do with him , atshan is n't allowed to leave the district or work . " it 's very frustrating , " he said .
" i did n't come here looking for a good life , i just wanted to be somewhere safe .
but this is no normal life . " in addition to worrying about his family back home in baghdad , atshan is grappling with getting used to life in a small foreign village . " i 'm used to living in big cities , " he said . " i ca n't even go to the movies here . " living in limbo atshan 's case is depressingly familiar in the country whose complicated asylum and refugee laws have come under increasing criticism from aid and refugee groups .
germany is home to an estimated 73,000 iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi family at a refugee home in germany experts say german asylum rules date back to the 1990s when tens of thousands of iraqis fleeing saddam hussein 's dictatorship applied for and easily received asylum status in germany on grounds of political persecution . " the moment saddam was toppled in 2003 , however , the german government sent out letters to thousands of iraqis saying their asylum status would be revoked since the persecutor was now gone , " said bernd mesovic of campaign group proasyl .
" it 's as if the authorities did n't watch television and did n't know what 's happening in iraq . " last year , german authorities stripped 8,189 refugees of their asylum status .
this week , human rights watch slammed germany 's move earlier this year to revoke the refugee status of over 18,000 iraqis . " losing your asylum status has serious repercussions , " said marianne heuwagen , head of the german section of human rights watch , because it can lead to reduced social benefits and severe restrictions on work , mobility and unification with family members . " in others words , it leaves you in limbo and with an uncertain future , " she said . civil war not asylum-worthy german authorities admit that iraqis seeking asylum must now prove they face personal risk in their homeland .
general instability or civil war is not reason enough to grant asylum though it is sufficient to put a freeze on deportations . at the same time , revoking asylum status does not automatically mean iraqis will be sent back home , said claudia moebus , spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis in baghdad have to live with daily car and suicide bombings " each refugee has the right to appeal and each individual case is carefully considered before any decision is taken , " moebus said . she added that german authorities had also reversed their recent decision to strip 18,000 iraqis of their refugee status with the exceptions of criminals and those who returned to northern iraq , which is considered relatively stable .
she declined to give exact figures . liberal sweden puts up barriers germany is not alone in its restrictive attitude towards iraqi asylum-seekers . experts point out that most eu nations remain reluctant to take in iraqi asylum-seekers even though those who knock on their doors make up only a fraction of the estimated four million displaced since the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
neighboring jordan and syria have taken in two million , while another two million remain uprooted within iraq . last year , just about 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the bloc . sweden has thus far stood out among europeans for having the most welcoming attitude and taking in the highest numbers of iraqi asylum-seekers - some 9,000 alone last year .
many of the refugees in sweden have joined existing iraqi communities in towns such as malmo on the southwest coast . last week , however , the country , which has long called on other eu members to shoulder the burden , said it 's tightening its asylum rules and will forcibly deport iraqis who are denied permission to stay . " asylum a dangerous lottery " " asylum in europe has become a dangerous lottery , " said richard williams of the european council of refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , referring to the disparate practices among eu nations on granting asylum . " generally every european country is afraid of being seen as too attractive to asylum-seekers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi refugee djabar lafte latif who lives in saxony-anhalt in germany in addition to german and swedish restrictions , britain , in particular , and denmark have sent iraqis back home .
experts are also concerned that the policies of these countries are not in accordance with international treaties such as the geneva convention . in addition to plodding moves towards a harmonized eu asylum policy - a goal hoped to be achieved by 2010 - some say european leaders need to do more to sell the idea of asylum on humanitarian grounds . " asylum and migration remain major political fault lines in europe , " williams said .

fearful of a refugee influx , however , other european nations have started tightening their asylum rules . " when you go out in baghdad , there 's a 50 percent chance you may never come home , " said murad atshan , an iraqi filmmaker living in germany . anyone who follows news of daily suicide bombings , a bloody insurgency and sectarian violence in the iraqi capital will probably nod in agreement at the statement .
german authorities in munich , however , rejected atshan 's application for asylum a year ago , saying he did n't give a good enough reason for seeking protection . the 27-year-old has since been confined to a refugee center in a tiny village in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , near the swiss border . while german authorities are deciding what to do with him , atshan is n't allowed to leave the district or work . " it 's very frustrating , " he said .
" i did n't come here looking for a good life , i just wanted to be somewhere safe .
but this is no normal life . " in addition to worrying about his family back home in baghdad , atshan is grappling with getting used to life in a small foreign village . " i 'm used to living in big cities , " he said . " i ca n't even go to the movies here . " living in limbo atshan 's case is depressingly familiar in the country whose complicated asylum and refugee laws have come under increasing criticism from aid and refugee groups .
germany is home to an estimated 73,000 iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi family at a refugee home in germany experts say german asylum rules date back to the 1990s when tens of thousands of iraqis fleeing saddam hussein 's dictatorship applied for and easily received asylum status in germany on grounds of political persecution . " the moment saddam was toppled in 2003 , however , the german government sent out letters to thousands of iraqis saying their asylum status would be revoked since the persecutor was now gone , " said bernd mesovic of campaign group proasyl .
" it 's as if the authorities did n't watch television and did n't know what 's happening in iraq . " last year , german authorities stripped 8,189 refugees of their asylum status .
this week , human rights watch slammed germany 's move earlier this year to revoke the refugee status of over 18,000 iraqis . " losing your asylum status has serious repercussions , " said marianne heuwagen , head of the german section of human rights watch , because it can lead to reduced social benefits and severe restrictions on work , mobility and unification with family members . " in others words , it leaves you in limbo and with an uncertain future , " she said . civil war not asylum-worthy german authorities admit that iraqis seeking asylum must now prove they face personal risk in their homeland .
general instability or civil war is not reason enough to grant asylum though it is sufficient to put a freeze on deportations . at the same time , revoking asylum status does not automatically mean iraqis will be sent back home , said claudia moebus , spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis in baghdad have to live with daily car and suicide bombings " each refugee has the right to appeal and each individual case is carefully considered before any decision is taken , " moebus said . she added that german authorities had also reversed their recent decision to strip 18,000 iraqis of their refugee status with the exceptions of criminals and those who returned to northern iraq , which is considered relatively stable .
she declined to give exact figures . liberal sweden puts up barriers germany is not alone in its restrictive attitude towards iraqi asylum-seekers . experts point out that most eu nations remain reluctant to take in iraqi asylum-seekers even though those who knock on their doors make up only a fraction of the estimated four million displaced since the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
neighboring jordan and syria have taken in two million , while another two million remain uprooted within iraq . last year , just about 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the bloc . sweden has thus far stood out among europeans for having the most welcoming attitude and taking in the highest numbers of iraqi asylum-seekers - some 9,000 alone last year .
many of the refugees in sweden have joined existing iraqi communities in towns such as malmo on the southwest coast . last week , however , the country , which has long called on other eu members to shoulder the burden , said it 's tightening its asylum rules and will forcibly deport iraqis who are denied permission to stay . " asylum a dangerous lottery " " asylum in europe has become a dangerous lottery , " said richard williams of the european council of refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , referring to the disparate practices among eu nations on granting asylum . " generally every european country is afraid of being seen as too attractive to asylum-seekers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi refugee djabar lafte latif who lives in saxony-anhalt in germany in addition to german and swedish restrictions , britain , in particular , and denmark have sent iraqis back home .
experts are also concerned that the policies of these countries are not in accordance with international treaties such as the geneva convention . in addition to plodding moves towards a harmonized eu asylum policy - a goal hoped to be achieved by 2010 - some say european leaders need to do more to sell the idea of asylum on humanitarian grounds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 13.07.2007 opinion : prior debate overshadows integration summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whatever reasons three turkish groups had for boycotting germany 's second integration summit , their absence overshadowed the entire event , according to dw commentator peter philipp . it all could have all been so nice : the chancellor 's second " integration summit " presents a " national integration plan " in which hundreds of measures on integrating immigrants are put down on paper .
but the result was clouded by the decision of various turkish associations to abstain from attending the summit , and it 's been clear for days that the atmosphere of the first summit , which took place in 2006 , would not be replicated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp the associations are annoyed that the german government did not sufficiently consult with them about tightening an immigration law , critics say .
though not explicitly named , turkish immigrants are particularly discriminated against , the associations also said .
not only because they make the largest group of so-called " migrants , " but also for concrete reasons : spouses have to learn german in their home countries and have to be at least 18 years old before they can come to germany .
the irritated turkish association pushed forward a debate that more than clearly demonstrated how poorly the law handles integration .
some of the associations ' representatives even spoke of it violating their human rights .
" absurd , " the politicians countered , adding that raising the age of immigration to 18 would avoid forced marriages .
and secondly , it must be clear that people who want to live in germany should speak german .
the politicians do n't bring up the fact that this is n't quite as easy in anatolian villages as in new york or tokyo - where the condition is n't even being imposed .
not to mention that german is best learnt in germany .
the turkish groups - somewhat unskillfully - gave the impression that they wanted to put pressure on the government .
but german politicians tried to trivialize the situation and insinuate that the groups wanted to prevent what is clear to everyone and questioned by few : that the integration of immigrants is important and that language skills are , naturally , required .
but acquiring language skills in anatolia - even if it 's just the " 300 words " that german politicians suddenly say are necessary - is a hurdle for the people who live there and want to move to germany .
while talking about avoiding forced marriages may be politically beneficial , it can not be achieved by raising the age of immigration and certainly not by 300 german words .
these are problems that have to be solved in germany .
and that has to be done on equal footing with the immigrants , as the politicians like to say .
this is what should have happened before the changes were made to the immigration law .
then we could have saved ourselves a lot of aggravation , and some things could have really improved .

" we think there needs to be an opportunity for all members of the imf to make their own assessment as to individual candidates ... and then , of course , pick the best candidate for the job , " he told reporters . developing nations , for their part , are challenging assumptions that europeans and americans should divvy up top jobs in global finance . they argue that the structure no longer reflects the balance of economic power since the rise of china and other countries . dutch finance minister wouter bos said the post should be open to all but europe should not give up its claims .

" we think there needs to be an opportunity for all members of the imf to make their own assessment as to individual candidates ... and then , of course , pick the best candidate for the job , " he told reporters . developing nations , for their part , are challenging assumptions that europeans and americans should divvy up top jobs in global finance . they argue that the structure no longer reflects the balance of economic power since the rise of china and other countries . dutch finance minister wouter bos said the post should be open to all but europe should not give up its claims . " if we have a good european candidate , we should go for it , " he said . last week , the united states indicated it would not challenge europe 's claim on the imf leader role since it had just picked american robert zoellick for the top world bank job . dw staff -lrb- win / als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tax payers ' day is the day of the year from which on people don ’ t work to pay taxes anymore , but just for themselves .
this day is proclaimed by tax payers ' unions worldwide : in the united states , it falls on april 30th , and in the uk , on june 3rd .
the date is calculated by dividing the amount of all taxes collected by all the income earned in a given year .
in germany , the authorities - federal , state and local - will take 53 percent of income this year .
with a little math , this puts german tax payer 's day to july 13th .
a misleading calculation ?
but it 's a calculation the german finance ministry calls misleading .
" it 's a one-sided interpretation of the data that does little to judge the actual situation , " ministry spokesman torsten albig said , adding that the association 's estimate of state spending is considerably higher than that of the federal bank and other economic institutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state will be taking about 53 pecent of what 's in there after reading a report in the handelsblatt newspaper , however , some germans may still call for the country 's tax payers ' memorial day to be moved to earlier in the year and ask to keep more than 47 cents per euro they make .
federal and state finance offices saw the total tax income increase faster than it expected in the first half of 2007 , according to the german business paper .
citing anonymous finance ministry sources , the paper said the ministry took in 238.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 329 billion -rrb- in the first half of 2007 , 29 billion euros more than in for the same period of 2006 , an increase of 13.9 percent .
an official report , scheduled to be released next week , is also reported to show that june tax revenues were nearly 50 billion euros , 12.6 percent more than in june 2006 .
lower unemployment is one of the key reasons why the state 's revenues have increased , according to the german finance ministry .
" the deciding factor comes mainly from the increase compared to last year of tax contributions through the social welfare system , " the ministry said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the computer-generated creature is part of an exhibit opening friday at the museum of natural history in berlin . what sounds like a scene from the adventure film jurassic park can be seen in a computer animation exhibit that opened friday at berlin 's museum of natural history . but the " evolution in action " exhibit , housed in four renovated halls , is intended to act as a bridge between scientific research and everyday life . the star of the exhibit is a 13-meter-high and 15-meter-long -lrb- 42.6 foot-high and 49.2-foot long -rrb- brachiosaurus , the tallest dinosaur model ever mounted in a museum .
five additional skeletons from the museum 's collection of 150-million-year-old dinosaurs from tanzania 's mount tendaguru are also on display , along with fossil plants and animals that lived in eastern africa at the same time . brachiosaurus , taller than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the record breaking brachiosaurus model in its new home the dinosaur skeletons , discovered by german researchers in tanzania 100 years ago , had to be dismantled and conserved while restoration work costing 18 million euros -lrb- $ 24 million -rrb- was carried out in the 120-year-old museum , which is part of berlin 's humboldt university . each individual piece , from toe to teeth , was covered in a protective layer and reassembled in new steel corsets .
a crane was needed to rebuild the brachiosaurus - a process which took several weeks .
after reconstruction , the creature 's head is not one meter higher than it was before , in accordance with the latest scientific research .
the colossus also stands more upright and is presented as running when seen through the light of the hall 's glass-domed roof .
scoping the jurassic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a crane was needed to rebuild the brachiosaurus in a process taking several weeks positioned close to the skeletons are binoculars or jurascopes , as museum director reinhold leinfelder called them , which enable visitors to see the tendaguru world as if they had actually been there 150 million years ago .
animated films show the dinosaurs smacking their lips and letting out loud roars as they trample through the prehistoric landscape .
though the exhibit makes use of the most up-to-date information , the jurascopes remain an imaginative exercise as experts do n't know what colors the dinosaurs were or how their roars sounded . dw staff / dpa -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 13.07.2007 proposal to promote german citizenship divides parties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians ca n't agree on whether to push immigrants to take on german citizenship one day after german chancellor angela merkel termed the country 's second integration summit a success , a social democratic politician has called for a new program to encourage immigrants to take on german citizenship . sebastian edathy , chairman of the bundestag 's interior committee and senior member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , called on friday for more political involvement on the part of immigrants in germany .
he suggested launching a " citizenship campaign " to persuade foreigners to change their nationality .
" we should persuade people who have a right to citizenship to do more than be just residents and to become citizens , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
but edathy 's idea was met with skepticism in the conservative ranks of the german political establishment .
stephan mayer , parliamentary head for the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , questioned whether giving citizenship to foreigners would lead to better integration .
" awarding citizenship can only take place at the end of a successful integration process , certainly not at the beginning , " mayer said .
" the state can not offer citizenship as a concession . "
a sensitive issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners have to give up their previous citizenship to become german the integration issue in germany has been traditionally plagued by the widely divergent positions of the spd and the cdu / csu - now united under the umbrella of merkel 's grand coalition government .
foreigners , who are not married to german citizens , currently obtain the right to apply for german citizenship if they have been legally living in germany for at least eight years , if they can financially support themselves and their families without state aid , if they possess sufficient german language skills , have not been convicted of a crime , and if they avow they will adhere to germany 's basic law and democratic principles .
by adopting german citizenship , foreigners living in germany are also expected to give up any other citizenship they have .
extending local voting rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu citizens can participate in local elections wherever in the bloc they live edathy also said germany should provide some foreigners with a right to vote in local elections .
" it is key that we improve migrants ' political participation by a right to vote in municipal election for foreigners who have lived in germany for a long time , " he said .
while federal and state elections are open only to a country 's citizens , the european union law opened municipal elections across the 27-member bloc to all eu citizens who are local residents , even if they are not citizens of the country where they live .
" i do n't think much of extending the right to vote because it does n't contribute to integration , " bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein told deutschlandfunk radio on friday .
" integration is a hard task : namely learning the legal system , leaning that you can speak the language and that you fit in to society . "
new ideas after integration summit edathy 's suggestions were not subject to discussion at germany 's second integration summit on thursday , which dealt with proposals from six working groups on how to improve the integration of immigrants living in germany .
despite the decision of some turkish groups to boycott the meeting in protest of a recent law placing additional restrictions on some foreigners before they are allowed to move to germany , merkel called the day-long meeting a success and " milestone " for the country 's integration efforts .
representatives of the federal government , the states and some 90 community leaders at the summit adopted a " national integration plan " containing 400 promises for improvements - ranging from aid for ethnic sports clubs to making more german-language classes available . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the computer-generated creature is part of an exhibit opening friday at the museum of natural history in berlin . what sounds like a scene from the adventure film jurassic park can be seen in a computer animation exhibit that opened friday at berlin 's museum of natural history . but the " evolution in action " exhibit , housed in four renovated halls , is intended to act as a bridge between scientific research and everyday life . the star of the exhibit is a 13-meter-high and 15-meter-long -lrb- 42.6 foot-high and 49.2-foot long -rrb- brachiosaurus , the tallest dinosaur model ever mounted in a museum .
five additional skeletons from the museum 's collection of 150-million-year-old dinosaurs from tanzania 's mount tendaguru are also on display , along with fossil plants and animals that lived in eastern africa at the same time . brachiosaurus , taller than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the record breaking brachiosaurus model in its new home the dinosaur skeletons , discovered by german researchers in tanzania 100 years ago , had to be dismantled and conserved while restoration work costing 18 million euros -lrb- $ 24 million -rrb- was carried out in the 120-year-old museum , which is part of berlin 's humboldt university . each individual piece , from toe to teeth , was covered in a protective layer and reassembled in new steel corsets .
a crane was needed to rebuild the brachiosaurus - a process which took several weeks .
after reconstruction , the creature 's head is not one meter higher than it was before , in accordance with the latest scientific research .
the colossus also stands more upright and is presented as running when seen through the light of the hall 's glass-domed roof .
scoping the jurassic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a crane was needed to rebuild the brachiosaurus in a process taking several weeks positioned close to the skeletons are binoculars or jurascopes , as museum director reinhold leinfelder called them , which enable visitors to see the tendaguru world as if they had actually been there 150 million years ago .
animated films show the dinosaurs smacking their lips and letting out loud roars as they trample through the prehistoric landscape .
though the exhibit makes use of the most up-to-date information , the jurascopes remain an imaginative exercise as experts do n't know what colors the dinosaurs were or how their roars sounded . dw staff / dpa -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 13.07.2007 proposal to promote german citizenship divides parties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians ca n't agree on whether to push immigrants to take on german citizenship one day after german chancellor angela merkel termed the country 's second integration summit a success , a social democratic politician has called for a new program to encourage immigrants to take on german citizenship . sebastian edathy , chairman of the bundestag 's interior committee and senior member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , called on friday for more political involvement on the part of immigrants in germany .
he suggested launching a " citizenship campaign " to persuade foreigners to change their nationality .
" we should persuade people who have a right to citizenship to do more than be just residents and to become citizens , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
but edathy 's idea was met with skepticism in the conservative ranks of the german political establishment .
stephan mayer , parliamentary head for the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , questioned whether giving citizenship to foreigners would lead to better integration .
" awarding citizenship can only take place at the end of a successful integration process , certainly not at the beginning , " mayer said .
" the state can not offer citizenship as a concession . "
a sensitive issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners have to give up their previous citizenship to become german the integration issue in germany has been traditionally plagued by the widely divergent positions of the spd and the cdu / csu - now united under the umbrella of merkel 's grand coalition government .
foreigners , who are not married to german citizens , currently obtain the right to apply for german citizenship if they have been legally living in germany for at least eight years , if they can financially support themselves and their families without state aid , if they possess sufficient german language skills , have not been convicted of a crime , and if they avow they will adhere to germany 's basic law and democratic principles .
by adopting german citizenship , foreigners living in germany are also expected to give up any other citizenship they have .
extending local voting rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu citizens can participate in local elections wherever in the bloc they live edathy also said germany should provide some foreigners with a right to vote in local elections .
" it is key that we improve migrants ' political participation by a right to vote in municipal election for foreigners who have lived in germany for a long time , " he said .
while federal and state elections are open only to a country 's citizens , the european union law opened municipal elections across the 27-member bloc to all eu citizens who are local residents , even if they are not citizens of the country where they live .
" i do n't think much of extending the right to vote because it does n't contribute to integration , " bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein told deutschlandfunk radio on friday .
" integration is a hard task : namely learning the legal system , leaning that you can speak the language and that you fit in to society . "
new ideas after integration summit edathy 's suggestions were not subject to discussion at germany 's second integration summit on thursday , which dealt with proposals from six working groups on how to improve the integration of immigrants living in germany .
despite the decision of some turkish groups to boycott the meeting in protest of a recent law placing additional restrictions on some foreigners before they are allowed to move to germany , merkel called the day-long meeting a success and " milestone " for the country 's integration efforts .
representatives of the federal government , the states and some 90 community leaders at the summit adopted a " national integration plan " containing 400 promises for improvements - ranging from aid for ethnic sports clubs to making more german-language classes available . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de taxes -pipe- 13.07.2007 german tax income higher than expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german finance ministry called the association of tax payers ' calculation " silly " with 53 percent of the year gone , german employees , as of friday at 11:40 a.m. , have earned enough to pay their annual tax bill , while a german newspaper said more money than expected will be flowing into state coffers . coldly calculated through the year , it takes germans 194 days of work to pay their tax bill , according to karl heinz däke , president of the german association of tax payers , which calculates the so-called " income burden rate " each year .
tax payers ' day is the day of the year from which on people don ’ t work to pay taxes anymore , but just for themselves .
this day is proclaimed by tax payers ' unions worldwide : in the united states , it falls on april 30th , and in the uk , on june 3rd .
the date is calculated by dividing the amount of all taxes collected by all the income earned in a given year .
in germany , the authorities - federal , state and local - will take 53 percent of income this year .
with a little math , this puts german tax payer 's day to july 13th .
a misleading calculation ?
but it 's a calculation the german finance ministry calls misleading .
" it 's a one-sided interpretation of the data that does little to judge the actual situation , " ministry spokesman torsten albig said , adding that the association 's estimate of state spending is considerably higher than that of the federal bank and other economic institutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state will be taking about 53 pecent of what 's in there after reading a report in the handelsblatt newspaper , however , some germans may still call for the country 's tax payers ' memorial day to be moved to earlier in the year and ask to keep more than 47 cents per euro they make .
federal and state finance offices saw the total tax income increase faster than it expected in the first half of 2007 , according to the german business paper .
citing anonymous finance ministry sources , the paper said the ministry took in 238.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 329 billion -rrb- in the first half of 2007 , 29 billion euros more than in for the same period of 2006 , an increase of 13.9 percent .
an official report , scheduled to be released next week , is also reported to show that june tax revenues were nearly 50 billion euros , 12.6 percent more than in june 2006 .
lower unemployment is one of the key reasons why the state 's revenues have increased , according to the german finance ministry .
" the deciding factor comes mainly from the increase compared to last year of tax contributions through the social welfare system , " the ministry said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fearful of a refugee influx , however , other european nations have started tightening their asylum rules . " when you go out in baghdad , there 's a 50 percent chance you may never come home , " said murad atshan , an iraqi filmmaker living in germany . anyone who follows news of daily suicide bombings , a bloody insurgency and sectarian violence in the iraqi capital will probably nod in agreement at the statement .
german authorities in munich , however , rejected atshan 's application for asylum a year ago , saying he did n't give a good enough reason for seeking protection . the 27-year-old has since been confined to a refugee center in a tiny village in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , near the swiss border . while german authorities are deciding what to do with him , atshan is n't allowed to leave the district or work . " it 's very frustrating , " he said .
" i did n't come here looking for a good life , i just wanted to be somewhere safe .
but this is no normal life . " in addition to worrying about his family back home in baghdad , atshan is grappling with getting used to life in a small foreign village . " i 'm used to living in big cities , " he said . " i ca n't even go to the movies here . " living in limbo atshan 's case is depressingly familiar in the country whose complicated asylum and refugee laws have come under increasing criticism from aid and refugee groups .
germany is home to an estimated 73,000 iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi family at a refugee home in germany experts say german asylum rules date back to the 1990s when tens of thousands of iraqis fleeing saddam hussein 's dictatorship applied for and easily received asylum status in germany on grounds of political persecution . " the moment saddam was toppled in 2003 , however , the german government sent out letters to thousands of iraqis saying their asylum status would be revoked since the persecutor was now gone , " said bernd mesovic of campaign group proasyl .
" it 's as if the authorities did n't watch television and did n't know what 's happening in iraq . " last year , german authorities stripped 8,189 refugees of their asylum status .
this week , human rights watch slammed germany 's move earlier this year to revoke the refugee status of over 18,000 iraqis . " losing your asylum status has serious repercussions , " said marianne heuwagen , head of the german section of human rights watch , because it can lead to reduced social benefits and severe restrictions on work , mobility and unification with family members . " in others words , it leaves you in limbo and with an uncertain future , " she said . civil war not asylum-worthy german authorities admit that iraqis seeking asylum must now prove they face personal risk in their homeland .
general instability or civil war is not reason enough to grant asylum though it is sufficient to put a freeze on deportations . at the same time , revoking asylum status does not automatically mean iraqis will be sent back home , said claudia moebus , spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis in baghdad have to live with daily car and suicide bombings " each refugee has the right to appeal and each individual case is carefully considered before any decision is taken , " moebus said . she added that german authorities had also reversed their recent decision to strip 18,000 iraqis of their refugee status with the exceptions of criminals and those who returned to northern iraq , which is considered relatively stable .
she declined to give exact figures . liberal sweden puts up barriers germany is not alone in its restrictive attitude towards iraqi asylum-seekers . experts point out that most eu nations remain reluctant to take in iraqi asylum-seekers even though those who knock on their doors make up only a fraction of the estimated four million displaced since the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
neighboring jordan and syria have taken in two million , while another two million remain uprooted within iraq . last year , just about 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the bloc . sweden has thus far stood out among europeans for having the most welcoming attitude and taking in the highest numbers of iraqi asylum-seekers - some 9,000 alone last year .
many of the refugees in sweden have joined existing iraqi communities in towns such as malmo on the southwest coast . last week , however , the country , which has long called on other eu members to shoulder the burden , said it 's tightening its asylum rules and will forcibly deport iraqis who are denied permission to stay . " asylum a dangerous lottery " " asylum in europe has become a dangerous lottery , " said richard williams of the european council of refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , referring to the disparate practices among eu nations on granting asylum . " generally every european country is afraid of being seen as too attractive to asylum-seekers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi refugee djabar lafte latif who lives in saxony-anhalt in germany in addition to german and swedish restrictions , britain , in particular , and denmark have sent iraqis back home .
experts are also concerned that the policies of these countries are not in accordance with international treaties such as the geneva convention . in addition to plodding moves towards a harmonized eu asylum policy - a goal hoped to be achieved by 2010 - some say european leaders need to do more to sell the idea of asylum on humanitarian grounds .

this week , human rights watch slammed germany 's move earlier this year to revoke the refugee status of over 18,000 iraqis . " losing your asylum status has serious repercussions , " said marianne heuwagen , head of the german section of human rights watch , because it can lead to reduced social benefits and severe restrictions on work , mobility and unification with family members . " in others words , it leaves you in limbo and with an uncertain future , " she said . civil war not asylum-worthy german authorities admit that iraqis seeking asylum must now prove they face personal risk in their homeland .
general instability or civil war is not reason enough to grant asylum though it is sufficient to put a freeze on deportations . at the same time , revoking asylum status does not automatically mean iraqis will be sent back home , said claudia moebus , spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis in baghdad have to live with daily car and suicide bombings " each refugee has the right to appeal and each individual case is carefully considered before any decision is taken , " moebus said . she added that german authorities had also reversed their recent decision to strip 18,000 iraqis of their refugee status with the exceptions of criminals and those who returned to northern iraq , which is considered relatively stable .
she declined to give exact figures . liberal sweden puts up barriers germany is not alone in its restrictive attitude towards iraqi asylum-seekers . experts point out that most eu nations remain reluctant to take in iraqi asylum-seekers even though those who knock on their doors make up only a fraction of the estimated four million displaced since the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
neighboring jordan and syria have taken in two million , while another two million remain uprooted within iraq . last year , just about 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the bloc . sweden has thus far stood out among europeans for having the most welcoming attitude and taking in the highest numbers of iraqi asylum-seekers - some 9,000 alone last year .
many of the refugees in sweden have joined existing iraqi communities in towns such as malmo on the southwest coast . last week , however , the country , which has long called on other eu members to shoulder the burden , said it 's tightening its asylum rules and will forcibly deport iraqis who are denied permission to stay . " asylum a dangerous lottery " " asylum in europe has become a dangerous lottery , " said richard williams of the european council of refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , referring to the disparate practices among eu nations on granting asylum . " generally every european country is afraid of being seen as too attractive to asylum-seekers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi refugee djabar lafte latif who lives in saxony-anhalt in germany in addition to german and swedish restrictions , britain , in particular , and denmark have sent iraqis back home .
experts are also concerned that the policies of these countries are not in accordance with international treaties such as the geneva convention . in addition to plodding moves towards a harmonized eu asylum policy - a goal hoped to be achieved by 2010 - some say european leaders need to do more to sell the idea of asylum on humanitarian grounds .

fearful of a refugee influx , however , other european nations have started tightening their asylum rules . " when you go out in baghdad , there 's a 50 percent chance you may never come home , " said murad atshan , an iraqi filmmaker living in germany . anyone who follows news of daily suicide bombings , a bloody insurgency and sectarian violence in the iraqi capital will probably nod in agreement at the statement .
german authorities in munich , however , rejected atshan 's application for asylum a year ago , saying he did n't give a good enough reason for seeking protection . the 27-year-old has since been confined to a refugee center in a tiny village in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , near the swiss border . while german authorities are deciding what to do with him , atshan is n't allowed to leave the district or work . " it 's very frustrating , " he said .
" i did n't come here looking for a good life , i just wanted to be somewhere safe .
but this is no normal life . " in addition to worrying about his family back home in baghdad , atshan is grappling with getting used to life in a small foreign village . " i 'm used to living in big cities , " he said . " i ca n't even go to the movies here . " living in limbo atshan 's case is depressingly familiar in the country whose complicated asylum and refugee laws have come under increasing criticism from aid and refugee groups .
germany is home to an estimated 73,000 iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi family at a refugee home in germany experts say german asylum rules date back to the 1990s when tens of thousands of iraqis fleeing saddam hussein 's dictatorship applied for and easily received asylum status in germany on grounds of political persecution . " the moment saddam was toppled in 2003 , however , the german government sent out letters to thousands of iraqis saying their asylum status would be revoked since the persecutor was now gone , " said bernd mesovic of campaign group proasyl .

the computer-generated creature is part of an exhibit opening friday at the museum of natural history in berlin . what sounds like a scene from the adventure film jurassic park can be seen in a computer animation exhibit that opened friday at berlin 's museum of natural history . but the " evolution in action " exhibit , housed in four renovated halls , is intended to act as a bridge between scientific research and everyday life . the star of the exhibit is a 13-meter-high and 15-meter-long -lrb- 42.6 foot-high and 49.2-foot long -rrb- brachiosaurus , the tallest dinosaur model ever mounted in a museum .
five additional skeletons from the museum 's collection of 150-million-year-old dinosaurs from tanzania 's mount tendaguru are also on display , along with fossil plants and animals that lived in eastern africa at the same time . brachiosaurus , taller than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the record breaking brachiosaurus model in its new home the dinosaur skeletons , discovered by german researchers in tanzania 100 years ago , had to be dismantled and conserved while restoration work costing 18 million euros -lrb- $ 24 million -rrb- was carried out in the 120-year-old museum , which is part of berlin 's humboldt university . each individual piece , from toe to teeth , was covered in a protective layer and reassembled in new steel corsets .
a crane was needed to rebuild the brachiosaurus - a process which took several weeks .
after reconstruction , the creature 's head is not one meter higher than it was before , in accordance with the latest scientific research .
the colossus also stands more upright and is presented as running when seen through the light of the hall 's glass-domed roof .
scoping the jurassic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a crane was needed to rebuild the brachiosaurus in a process taking several weeks positioned close to the skeletons are binoculars or jurascopes , as museum director reinhold leinfelder called them , which enable visitors to see the tendaguru world as if they had actually been there 150 million years ago .
animated films show the dinosaurs smacking their lips and letting out loud roars as they trample through the prehistoric landscape .
though the exhibit makes use of the most up-to-date information , the jurascopes remain an imaginative exercise as experts do n't know what colors the dinosaurs were or how their roars sounded . dw staff / dpa -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 13.07.2007 proposal to promote german citizenship divides parties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians ca n't agree on whether to push immigrants to take on german citizenship one day after german chancellor angela merkel termed the country 's second integration summit a success , a social democratic politician has called for a new program to encourage immigrants to take on german citizenship . sebastian edathy , chairman of the bundestag 's interior committee and senior member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , called on friday for more political involvement on the part of immigrants in germany .
he suggested launching a " citizenship campaign " to persuade foreigners to change their nationality .
" we should persuade people who have a right to citizenship to do more than be just residents and to become citizens , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
but edathy 's idea was met with skepticism in the conservative ranks of the german political establishment .
stephan mayer , parliamentary head for the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , questioned whether giving citizenship to foreigners would lead to better integration .
" awarding citizenship can only take place at the end of a successful integration process , certainly not at the beginning , " mayer said .
" the state can not offer citizenship as a concession . "
a sensitive issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners have to give up their previous citizenship to become german the integration issue in germany has been traditionally plagued by the widely divergent positions of the spd and the cdu / csu - now united under the umbrella of merkel 's grand coalition government .
foreigners , who are not married to german citizens , currently obtain the right to apply for german citizenship if they have been legally living in germany for at least eight years , if they can financially support themselves and their families without state aid , if they possess sufficient german language skills , have not been convicted of a crime , and if they avow they will adhere to germany 's basic law and democratic principles .
by adopting german citizenship , foreigners living in germany are also expected to give up any other citizenship they have .
extending local voting rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu citizens can participate in local elections wherever in the bloc they live edathy also said germany should provide some foreigners with a right to vote in local elections .
" it is key that we improve migrants ' political participation by a right to vote in municipal election for foreigners who have lived in germany for a long time , " he said .
while federal and state elections are open only to a country 's citizens , the european union law opened municipal elections across the 27-member bloc to all eu citizens who are local residents , even if they are not citizens of the country where they live .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 13.07.2007 proposal to promote german citizenship divides parties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians ca n't agree on whether to push immigrants to take on german citizenship one day after german chancellor angela merkel termed the country 's second integration summit a success , a social democratic politician has called for a new program to encourage immigrants to take on german citizenship . sebastian edathy , chairman of the bundestag 's interior committee and senior member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , called on friday for more political involvement on the part of immigrants in germany .
he suggested launching a " citizenship campaign " to persuade foreigners to change their nationality .
" we should persuade people who have a right to citizenship to do more than be just residents and to become citizens , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
but edathy 's idea was met with skepticism in the conservative ranks of the german political establishment .
stephan mayer , parliamentary head for the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , questioned whether giving citizenship to foreigners would lead to better integration .
" awarding citizenship can only take place at the end of a successful integration process , certainly not at the beginning , " mayer said .
" the state can not offer citizenship as a concession . "
a sensitive issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners have to give up their previous citizenship to become german the integration issue in germany has been traditionally plagued by the widely divergent positions of the spd and the cdu / csu - now united under the umbrella of merkel 's grand coalition government .
foreigners , who are not married to german citizens , currently obtain the right to apply for german citizenship if they have been legally living in germany for at least eight years , if they can financially support themselves and their families without state aid , if they possess sufficient german language skills , have not been convicted of a crime , and if they avow they will adhere to germany 's basic law and democratic principles .
by adopting german citizenship , foreigners living in germany are also expected to give up any other citizenship they have .
extending local voting rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu citizens can participate in local elections wherever in the bloc they live edathy also said germany should provide some foreigners with a right to vote in local elections .
" it is key that we improve migrants ' political participation by a right to vote in municipal election for foreigners who have lived in germany for a long time , " he said .
while federal and state elections are open only to a country 's citizens , the european union law opened municipal elections across the 27-member bloc to all eu citizens who are local residents , even if they are not citizens of the country where they live .
" i do n't think much of extending the right to vote because it does n't contribute to integration , " bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein told deutschlandfunk radio on friday .
" integration is a hard task : namely learning the legal system , leaning that you can speak the language and that you fit in to society . "

but the result was clouded by the decision of various turkish associations to abstain from attending the summit , and it 's been clear for days that the atmosphere of the first summit , which took place in 2006 , would not be replicated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp the associations are annoyed that the german government did not sufficiently consult with them about tightening an immigration law , critics say .
though not explicitly named , turkish immigrants are particularly discriminated against , the associations also said .
not only because they make the largest group of so-called " migrants , " but also for concrete reasons : spouses have to learn german in their home countries and have to be at least 18 years old before they can come to germany .
the irritated turkish association pushed forward a debate that more than clearly demonstrated how poorly the law handles integration .
some of the associations ' representatives even spoke of it violating their human rights .
" absurd , " the politicians countered , adding that raising the age of immigration to 18 would avoid forced marriages .
and secondly , it must be clear that people who want to live in germany should speak german .
the politicians do n't bring up the fact that this is n't quite as easy in anatolian villages as in new york or tokyo - where the condition is n't even being imposed .
not to mention that german is best learnt in germany .
the turkish groups - somewhat unskillfully - gave the impression that they wanted to put pressure on the government .
but german politicians tried to trivialize the situation and insinuate that the groups wanted to prevent what is clear to everyone and questioned by few : that the integration of immigrants is important and that language skills are , naturally , required .
but acquiring language skills in anatolia - even if it 's just the " 300 words " that german politicians suddenly say are necessary - is a hurdle for the people who live there and want to move to germany .
while talking about avoiding forced marriages may be politically beneficial , it can not be achieved by raising the age of immigration and certainly not by 300 german words .
these are problems that have to be solved in germany .
and that has to be done on equal footing with the immigrants , as the politicians like to say .
this is what should have happened before the changes were made to the immigration law .
then we could have saved ourselves a lot of aggravation , and some things could have really improved .

while the gaza strip is controlled by hamas , the west bank is ruled by an emergency government under salam fayyad in cooperation with the president and fatah chairman , mahmoud abbas . israel and the international community have interpreted the split as a chance .
thus , the islamists in the gaza strip could be more easily isolated and the emergency government in the west bank could be a partner for the resumption of cooperation , economic development and a diplomatic process .
" flourishing landscapes " and new freedom of movement in the west bank would convince the palestinian population of fatah being the right choice for the future . but the " hamastan vs fatah-land " -approach is hugely unrealistic . bildunterschrift : muriel asseburg israel has announced a gradual release of customs duties and value-added tax revenues collected on behalf of the palestinian authority and worth some $ 700 million that it has withheld since the establishment of the hamas-led government in march 2006 .
it has also promised to lift a few roadblocks in the west bank , dismantle some settlement outposts and allow weapon deliveries such as armoured vehicles to strengthen fatah . but all these measures are far from sufficient to trigger a new dynamic and to tangibly improve the situation in the west bank : as long as the system of roadblocks and permits remains in place , the palestinian economy will not see a sustainable recovery . an approach that pins hopes on a military confrontation between fatah and hamas will not stabilize the situation either .
instead , it carries the danger of a renewed flare-up of internal palestinian fighting and its escalation into a civil war . also , increasing the pressure on the population in the gaza strip is hardly possible without causing a humanitarian catastrophe .
the official unemployment rate in the region is already at some 35 percent , the poverty rate at above 75 percent .
around two thirds of the population depend on international aid deliveries .
the danger of economic isolation then is to radicalize the gaza strip ’ s population and to increase the attraction of salafist and jihadist groups – which , in contrast to hamas , neither have a national agenda nor an interest in stabilization . the new-old approach of the international community is contributing to making the vision of a two-state settlement increasingly unrealistic .
this is because it sacrifices the creation of functioning and democratic palestinian institutions in favour of short-term stability .

while the gaza strip is controlled by hamas , the west bank is ruled by an emergency government under salam fayyad in cooperation with the president and fatah chairman , mahmoud abbas . israel and the international community have interpreted the split as a chance .
thus , the islamists in the gaza strip could be more easily isolated and the emergency government in the west bank could be a partner for the resumption of cooperation , economic development and a diplomatic process .
" flourishing landscapes " and new freedom of movement in the west bank would convince the palestinian population of fatah being the right choice for the future . but the " hamastan vs fatah-land " -approach is hugely unrealistic . bildunterschrift : muriel asseburg israel has announced a gradual release of customs duties and value-added tax revenues collected on behalf of the palestinian authority and worth some $ 700 million that it has withheld since the establishment of the hamas-led government in march 2006 .
it has also promised to lift a few roadblocks in the west bank , dismantle some settlement outposts and allow weapon deliveries such as armoured vehicles to strengthen fatah . but all these measures are far from sufficient to trigger a new dynamic and to tangibly improve the situation in the west bank : as long as the system of roadblocks and permits remains in place , the palestinian economy will not see a sustainable recovery . an approach that pins hopes on a military confrontation between fatah and hamas will not stabilize the situation either .
instead , it carries the danger of a renewed flare-up of internal palestinian fighting and its escalation into a civil war . also , increasing the pressure on the population in the gaza strip is hardly possible without causing a humanitarian catastrophe .
the official unemployment rate in the region is already at some 35 percent , the poverty rate at above 75 percent .
around two thirds of the population depend on international aid deliveries .
the danger of economic isolation then is to radicalize the gaza strip ’ s population and to increase the attraction of salafist and jihadist groups – which , in contrast to hamas , neither have a national agenda nor an interest in stabilization . the new-old approach of the international community is contributing to making the vision of a two-state settlement increasingly unrealistic .
this is because it sacrifices the creation of functioning and democratic palestinian institutions in favour of short-term stability .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 13.07.2007 proposal to promote german citizenship divides parties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians ca n't agree on whether to push immigrants to take on german citizenship one day after german chancellor angela merkel termed the country 's second integration summit a success , a social democratic politician has called for a new program to encourage immigrants to take on german citizenship . sebastian edathy , chairman of the bundestag 's interior committee and senior member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , called on friday for more political involvement on the part of immigrants in germany .
he suggested launching a " citizenship campaign " to persuade foreigners to change their nationality .
" we should persuade people who have a right to citizenship to do more than be just residents and to become citizens , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
but edathy 's idea was met with skepticism in the conservative ranks of the german political establishment .
stephan mayer , parliamentary head for the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , questioned whether giving citizenship to foreigners would lead to better integration .
" awarding citizenship can only take place at the end of a successful integration process , certainly not at the beginning , " mayer said .
" the state can not offer citizenship as a concession . "
a sensitive issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners have to give up their previous citizenship to become german the integration issue in germany has been traditionally plagued by the widely divergent positions of the spd and the cdu / csu - now united under the umbrella of merkel 's grand coalition government .
foreigners , who are not married to german citizens , currently obtain the right to apply for german citizenship if they have been legally living in germany for at least eight years , if they can financially support themselves and their families without state aid , if they possess sufficient german language skills , have not been convicted of a crime , and if they avow they will adhere to germany 's basic law and democratic principles .
by adopting german citizenship , foreigners living in germany are also expected to give up any other citizenship they have .
extending local voting rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu citizens can participate in local elections wherever in the bloc they live edathy also said germany should provide some foreigners with a right to vote in local elections .
" it is key that we improve migrants ' political participation by a right to vote in municipal election for foreigners who have lived in germany for a long time , " he said .
while federal and state elections are open only to a country 's citizens , the european union law opened municipal elections across the 27-member bloc to all eu citizens who are local residents , even if they are not citizens of the country where they live .
" i do n't think much of extending the right to vote because it does n't contribute to integration , " bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein told deutschlandfunk radio on friday .
" integration is a hard task : namely learning the legal system , leaning that you can speak the language and that you fit in to society . "
new ideas after integration summit edathy 's suggestions were not subject to discussion at germany 's second integration summit on thursday , which dealt with proposals from six working groups on how to improve the integration of immigrants living in germany .
despite the decision of some turkish groups to boycott the meeting in protest of a recent law placing additional restrictions on some foreigners before they are allowed to move to germany , merkel called the day-long meeting a success and " milestone " for the country 's integration efforts .
representatives of the federal government , the states and some 90 community leaders at the summit adopted a " national integration plan " containing 400 promises for improvements - ranging from aid for ethnic sports clubs to making more german-language classes available . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opinion : prior debate overshadows integration summit whatever reasons three turkish groups had for boycotting germany 's second integration summit , their absence overshadowed the entire event , according to dw commentator peter philipp .

instead , it carries the danger of a renewed flare-up of internal palestinian fighting and its escalation into a civil war . also , increasing the pressure on the population in the gaza strip is hardly possible without causing a humanitarian catastrophe .
the official unemployment rate in the region is already at some 35 percent , the poverty rate at above 75 percent .
around two thirds of the population depend on international aid deliveries .
the danger of economic isolation then is to radicalize the gaza strip ’ s population and to increase the attraction of salafist and jihadist groups – which , in contrast to hamas , neither have a national agenda nor an interest in stabilization . the new-old approach of the international community is contributing to making the vision of a two-state settlement increasingly unrealistic .
this is because it sacrifices the creation of functioning and democratic palestinian institutions in favour of short-term stability .
and because it does nothing to prevent the ever greater erosion of a contiguous territory for a palestinian state – which is a result of the separation barrier , the expansion of settlements and the corresponding transportation network in the west bank . german and european policies should therefore concentrate on averting a humanitarian catastrophe in the gaza strip and on creating conditions for an economic revival both there and in the west bank .
they should avoid undermining reconciliation among palestinian factions , support improved governance of palestinian institutions and take serious steps to achieve a two-state settlement in cooperation with the middle east quartet and the arab peace initiative . muriel asseburg is head of the research unit for the middle east and africa at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not to mention that german is best learnt in germany .

but german politicians tried to trivialize the situation and insinuate that the groups wanted to prevent what is clear to everyone and questioned by few : that the integration of immigrants is important and that language skills are , naturally , required .
but acquiring language skills in anatolia - even if it 's just the " 300 words " that german politicians suddenly say are necessary - is a hurdle for the people who live there and want to move to germany .
while talking about avoiding forced marriages may be politically beneficial , it can not be achieved by raising the age of immigration and certainly not by 300 german words .
these are problems that have to be solved in germany .

" ecofin agrees to support dominique strauss-kahn for imf director , " the presidency said , using eu shorthand for the meeting of finance ministers in brussels tuesday . french president nicolas sarkozy , a conservative , had named strauss-kahn , a social democrat , who failed to win his party 's presidential nomination in the 2007 election , as his favorite candidate .

while the gaza strip is controlled by hamas , the west bank is ruled by an emergency government under salam fayyad in cooperation with the president and fatah chairman , mahmoud abbas . israel and the international community have interpreted the split as a chance .
thus , the islamists in the gaza strip could be more easily isolated and the emergency government in the west bank could be a partner for the resumption of cooperation , economic development and a diplomatic process .
" flourishing landscapes " and new freedom of movement in the west bank would convince the palestinian population of fatah being the right choice for the future . but the " hamastan vs fatah-land " -approach is hugely unrealistic . bildunterschrift : muriel asseburg israel has announced a gradual release of customs duties and value-added tax revenues collected on behalf of the palestinian authority and worth some $ 700 million that it has withheld since the establishment of the hamas-led government in march 2006 .
it has also promised to lift a few roadblocks in the west bank , dismantle some settlement outposts and allow weapon deliveries such as armoured vehicles to strengthen fatah . but all these measures are far from sufficient to trigger a new dynamic and to tangibly improve the situation in the west bank : as long as the system of roadblocks and permits remains in place , the palestinian economy will not see a sustainable recovery . an approach that pins hopes on a military confrontation between fatah and hamas will not stabilize the situation either .
instead , it carries the danger of a renewed flare-up of internal palestinian fighting and its escalation into a civil war . also , increasing the pressure on the population in the gaza strip is hardly possible without causing a humanitarian catastrophe .
the official unemployment rate in the region is already at some 35 percent , the poverty rate at above 75 percent .
around two thirds of the population depend on international aid deliveries .
the danger of economic isolation then is to radicalize the gaza strip ’ s population and to increase the attraction of salafist and jihadist groups – which , in contrast to hamas , neither have a national agenda nor an interest in stabilization . the new-old approach of the international community is contributing to making the vision of a two-state settlement increasingly unrealistic .
this is because it sacrifices the creation of functioning and democratic palestinian institutions in favour of short-term stability .
and because it does nothing to prevent the ever greater erosion of a contiguous territory for a palestinian state – which is a result of the separation barrier , the expansion of settlements and the corresponding transportation network in the west bank . german and european policies should therefore concentrate on averting a humanitarian catastrophe in the gaza strip and on creating conditions for an economic revival both there and in the west bank .
they should avoid undermining reconciliation among palestinian factions , support improved governance of palestinian institutions and take serious steps to achieve a two-state settlement in cooperation with the middle east quartet and the arab peace initiative . muriel asseburg is head of the research unit for the middle east and africa at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the gaza strip is controlled by hamas , the west bank is ruled by an emergency government under salam fayyad in cooperation with the president and fatah chairman , mahmoud abbas . israel and the international community have interpreted the split as a chance .
thus , the islamists in the gaza strip could be more easily isolated and the emergency government in the west bank could be a partner for the resumption of cooperation , economic development and a diplomatic process .
" flourishing landscapes " and new freedom of movement in the west bank would convince the palestinian population of fatah being the right choice for the future . but the " hamastan vs fatah-land " -approach is hugely unrealistic . bildunterschrift : muriel asseburg israel has announced a gradual release of customs duties and value-added tax revenues collected on behalf of the palestinian authority and worth some $ 700 million that it has withheld since the establishment of the hamas-led government in march 2006 .
it has also promised to lift a few roadblocks in the west bank , dismantle some settlement outposts and allow weapon deliveries such as armoured vehicles to strengthen fatah . but all these measures are far from sufficient to trigger a new dynamic and to tangibly improve the situation in the west bank : as long as the system of roadblocks and permits remains in place , the palestinian economy will not see a sustainable recovery . an approach that pins hopes on a military confrontation between fatah and hamas will not stabilize the situation either .
instead , it carries the danger of a renewed flare-up of internal palestinian fighting and its escalation into a civil war . also , increasing the pressure on the population in the gaza strip is hardly possible without causing a humanitarian catastrophe .
the official unemployment rate in the region is already at some 35 percent , the poverty rate at above 75 percent .
around two thirds of the population depend on international aid deliveries .
the danger of economic isolation then is to radicalize the gaza strip ’ s population and to increase the attraction of salafist and jihadist groups – which , in contrast to hamas , neither have a national agenda nor an interest in stabilization . the new-old approach of the international community is contributing to making the vision of a two-state settlement increasingly unrealistic .
this is because it sacrifices the creation of functioning and democratic palestinian institutions in favour of short-term stability .
and because it does nothing to prevent the ever greater erosion of a contiguous territory for a palestinian state – which is a result of the separation barrier , the expansion of settlements and the corresponding transportation network in the west bank . german and european policies should therefore concentrate on averting a humanitarian catastrophe in the gaza strip and on creating conditions for an economic revival both there and in the west bank .
they should avoid undermining reconciliation among palestinian factions , support improved governance of palestinian institutions and take serious steps to achieve a two-state settlement in cooperation with the middle east quartet and the arab peace initiative . muriel asseburg is head of the research unit for the middle east and africa at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
nord stream bosses wo n't know for sure until at least 2010 the german-russian gas pipeline saga continues with a new disputed region causing a rethink over its route .
the nord stream consortium is again forced into finding an alternative direction for its maligned project . when it is finally completed , the planned russian-german natural gas pipeline may have more twists and turns than a bowl of spaghetti .
a spokesman for the nord stream consortium said wednesday that the disputed pipeline would again have to change its route after it was revealed a section had been earmarked for a stretch of water that both poland and denmark claim as an exclusive economic zone .
in april this year , nord stream - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - had its plans for running a stretch of the pipeline through estonian waters thrown into doubt over fears that it could disturb unexploded munitions and chemical dumps from world war ii .
such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry at the time .
this latest obstacle to the 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 750-mile -rrb- pipeline may prove to be more concrete in its disruption .
both denmark and poland claim the ownership of the area and nord stream is reluctant to get involved with any dispute .
pipeline consortium resorts to plan b ... or c bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord stream has had to adapt its plans after complaints now accustomed to the need to redirect the pipeline when opposition arises , nord stream said that it already has an alternative route that it proposes to take to avoid the disputed territory .
the consortium would attempt to squeeze the pipeline between the danish island of bornholm and sweden 's southeastern coast ; although nord stream stated that no final decision had been made .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
several coastal nations have expressed concern over the pipeline which is to deliver natural gas from russia to germany , saying it will damage the baltic sea 's delicate ecosystem .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment while sweden in particular has complained that the pipeline could disrupt the baltic sea ’ s sensitive flora and fauna .
study hopes to alleviate environmental fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns over the pipeline 's route out at sea in accordance with the european union rules , nord stream is required to furnish an environmental impact assessment -lrb- eia -rrb- to those countries whose territorial waters would be affected .
the consortium is expected to do so later this year .
" nord stream has decided to launch additional studies to investigate areas where the route of the pipeline through the baltic sea can be further optimized in a reasonable way to minimize environmental impacts , " the consortium said in a statement earlier this year . the pipeline has also created political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
in-between nations concerned at duopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schröder co-developed the project the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
the fact that the project was negotiated by russia and germany without consulting the countries between them has also created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the recent heightening of political tensions between russia and estonia has also left many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
if completed by 2010 as planned , the 1,200-kilometer pipeline would pump 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year from vyborg , russia to greifswald in northern germany .
in a second phase , a parallel pipeline would double that transport capacity , and nord stream estimates that will meet about 25 percent of the additional gas needs of the european union . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
nord stream bosses wo n't know for sure until at least 2010 the german-russian gas pipeline saga continues with a new disputed region causing a rethink over its route .
the nord stream consortium is again forced into finding an alternative direction for its maligned project . when it is finally completed , the planned russian-german natural gas pipeline may have more twists and turns than a bowl of spaghetti .
a spokesman for the nord stream consortium said wednesday that the disputed pipeline would again have to change its route after it was revealed a section had been earmarked for a stretch of water that both poland and denmark claim as an exclusive economic zone .
in april this year , nord stream - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - had its plans for running a stretch of the pipeline through estonian waters thrown into doubt over fears that it could disturb unexploded munitions and chemical dumps from world war ii .
such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry at the time .
this latest obstacle to the 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 750-mile -rrb- pipeline may prove to be more concrete in its disruption .
both denmark and poland claim the ownership of the area and nord stream is reluctant to get involved with any dispute .
pipeline consortium resorts to plan b ... or c bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord stream has had to adapt its plans after complaints now accustomed to the need to redirect the pipeline when opposition arises , nord stream said that it already has an alternative route that it proposes to take to avoid the disputed territory .
the consortium would attempt to squeeze the pipeline between the danish island of bornholm and sweden 's southeastern coast ; although nord stream stated that no final decision had been made .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
several coastal nations have expressed concern over the pipeline which is to deliver natural gas from russia to germany , saying it will damage the baltic sea 's delicate ecosystem .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment while sweden in particular has complained that the pipeline could disrupt the baltic sea ’ s sensitive flora and fauna .
study hopes to alleviate environmental fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns over the pipeline 's route out at sea in accordance with the european union rules , nord stream is required to furnish an environmental impact assessment -lrb- eia -rrb- to those countries whose territorial waters would be affected .
the consortium is expected to do so later this year .
" nord stream has decided to launch additional studies to investigate areas where the route of the pipeline through the baltic sea can be further optimized in a reasonable way to minimize environmental impacts , " the consortium said in a statement earlier this year . the pipeline has also created political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
in-between nations concerned at duopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schröder co-developed the project the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
the fact that the project was negotiated by russia and germany without consulting the countries between them has also created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the recent heightening of political tensions between russia and estonia has also left many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
if completed by 2010 as planned , the 1,200-kilometer pipeline would pump 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year from vyborg , russia to greifswald in northern germany .
in a second phase , a parallel pipeline would double that transport capacity , and nord stream estimates that will meet about 25 percent of the additional gas needs of the european union . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the computer-generated creature is part of an exhibit opening friday at the museum of natural history in berlin . what sounds like a scene from the adventure film jurassic park can be seen in a computer animation exhibit that opened friday at berlin 's museum of natural history . but the " evolution in action " exhibit , housed in four renovated halls , is intended to act as a bridge between scientific research and everyday life . the star of the exhibit is a 13-meter-high and 15-meter-long -lrb- 42.6 foot-high and 49.2-foot long -rrb- brachiosaurus , the tallest dinosaur model ever mounted in a museum .
five additional skeletons from the museum 's collection of 150-million-year-old dinosaurs from tanzania 's mount tendaguru are also on display , along with fossil plants and animals that lived in eastern africa at the same time . brachiosaurus , taller than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the record breaking brachiosaurus model in its new home the dinosaur skeletons , discovered by german researchers in tanzania 100 years ago , had to be dismantled and conserved while restoration work costing 18 million euros -lrb- $ 24 million -rrb- was carried out in the 120-year-old museum , which is part of berlin 's humboldt university . each individual piece , from toe to teeth , was covered in a protective layer and reassembled in new steel corsets .
a crane was needed to rebuild the brachiosaurus - a process which took several weeks .
after reconstruction , the creature 's head is not one meter higher than it was before , in accordance with the latest scientific research .
the colossus also stands more upright and is presented as running when seen through the light of the hall 's glass-domed roof .
scoping the jurassic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a crane was needed to rebuild the brachiosaurus in a process taking several weeks positioned close to the skeletons are binoculars or jurascopes , as museum director reinhold leinfelder called them , which enable visitors to see the tendaguru world as if they had actually been there 150 million years ago .
animated films show the dinosaurs smacking their lips and letting out loud roars as they trample through the prehistoric landscape .
though the exhibit makes use of the most up-to-date information , the jurascopes remain an imaginative exercise as experts do n't know what colors the dinosaurs were or how their roars sounded . dw staff / dpa -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she likes to read and meet with her friends .
but where she is above average is in the classroom .
she has just passed the high school exam taken by 18-year-olds . child prodigies : you either love them -lrb- if they 're your own -rrb- or hate them -lrb- if you 're a jealous classmate -rrb- .
some turn out to be precocious little brats who know exactly how brainy they are ; they never stop telling others about how brainy they are and then they start their own computer software firm to prove how brainy they are .
others quietly go about the business of overachieving , leave education with awards falling out of their spongebob squarepants rucksack and go on to make a real difference in the world .
from the level-headed and unassuming way young minu dietlinde tizabi has completed the german version of the high school diploma at the tender age of 14 , the indications are that she will join the second group .
tizabi not only completed the abitur exam four years earlier than usual but she passed with the highest possible grade , a 1.0 .
out of a maximum of 840 points she could have scored on the test , the youngster from pforzheim racked up an amazing 815 .
a reader and writer of english bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harry potter : one of minu 's preferred reads but " just a book " the grounded teenager , who lost her mother when she was just a month old and was raised by her father , does n't see anything special in her results .
her friend hanna , after all , scored more than her .

but the result was clouded by the decision of various turkish associations to abstain from attending the summit , and it 's been clear for days that the atmosphere of the first summit , which took place in 2006 , would not be replicated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp the associations are annoyed that the german government did not sufficiently consult with them about tightening an immigration law , critics say .
though not explicitly named , turkish immigrants are particularly discriminated against , the associations also said .
not only because they make the largest group of so-called " migrants , " but also for concrete reasons : spouses have to learn german in their home countries and have to be at least 18 years old before they can come to germany .
the irritated turkish association pushed forward a debate that more than clearly demonstrated how poorly the law handles integration .
some of the associations ' representatives even spoke of it violating their human rights .
" absurd , " the politicians countered , adding that raising the age of immigration to 18 would avoid forced marriages .
and secondly , it must be clear that people who want to live in germany should speak german .
the politicians do n't bring up the fact that this is n't quite as easy in anatolian villages as in new york or tokyo - where the condition is n't even being imposed .
not to mention that german is best learnt in germany .
the turkish groups - somewhat unskillfully - gave the impression that they wanted to put pressure on the government .
but german politicians tried to trivialize the situation and insinuate that the groups wanted to prevent what is clear to everyone and questioned by few : that the integration of immigrants is important and that language skills are , naturally , required .
but acquiring language skills in anatolia - even if it 's just the " 300 words " that german politicians suddenly say are necessary - is a hurdle for the people who live there and want to move to germany .
while talking about avoiding forced marriages may be politically beneficial , it can not be achieved by raising the age of immigration and certainly not by 300 german words .
these are problems that have to be solved in germany .
and that has to be done on equal footing with the immigrants , as the politicians like to say .
this is what should have happened before the changes were made to the immigration law .
then we could have saved ourselves a lot of aggravation , and some things could have really improved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 13.07.2007 in europe , iraqi asylum-seekers find doors being shut großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi bodyguard muhannad yousif who sought a new life in sweden experts have criticized germany 's policies towards iraqi asylum-seekers as too restrictive .
fearful of a refugee influx , however , other european nations have started tightening their asylum rules . " when you go out in baghdad , there 's a 50 percent chance you may never come home , " said murad atshan , an iraqi filmmaker living in germany . anyone who follows news of daily suicide bombings , a bloody insurgency and sectarian violence in the iraqi capital will probably nod in agreement at the statement .
german authorities in munich , however , rejected atshan 's application for asylum a year ago , saying he did n't give a good enough reason for seeking protection . the 27-year-old has since been confined to a refugee center in a tiny village in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , near the swiss border . while german authorities are deciding what to do with him , atshan is n't allowed to leave the district or work . " it 's very frustrating , " he said .
" i did n't come here looking for a good life , i just wanted to be somewhere safe .
but this is no normal life . " in addition to worrying about his family back home in baghdad , atshan is grappling with getting used to life in a small foreign village . " i 'm used to living in big cities , " he said . " i ca n't even go to the movies here . " living in limbo atshan 's case is depressingly familiar in the country whose complicated asylum and refugee laws have come under increasing criticism from aid and refugee groups .
germany is home to an estimated 73,000 iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi family at a refugee home in germany experts say german asylum rules date back to the 1990s when tens of thousands of iraqis fleeing saddam hussein 's dictatorship applied for and easily received asylum status in germany on grounds of political persecution . " the moment saddam was toppled in 2003 , however , the german government sent out letters to thousands of iraqis saying their asylum status would be revoked since the persecutor was now gone , " said bernd mesovic of campaign group proasyl .
" it 's as if the authorities did n't watch television and did n't know what 's happening in iraq . " last year , german authorities stripped 8,189 refugees of their asylum status .
this week , human rights watch slammed germany 's move earlier this year to revoke the refugee status of over 18,000 iraqis . " losing your asylum status has serious repercussions , " said marianne heuwagen , head of the german section of human rights watch , because it can lead to reduced social benefits and severe restrictions on work , mobility and unification with family members . " in others words , it leaves you in limbo and with an uncertain future , " she said . civil war not asylum-worthy german authorities admit that iraqis seeking asylum must now prove they face personal risk in their homeland .
general instability or civil war is not reason enough to grant asylum though it is sufficient to put a freeze on deportations . at the same time , revoking asylum status does not automatically mean iraqis will be sent back home , said claudia moebus , spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis in baghdad have to live with daily car and suicide bombings " each refugee has the right to appeal and each individual case is carefully considered before any decision is taken , " moebus said . she added that german authorities had also reversed their recent decision to strip 18,000 iraqis of their refugee status with the exceptions of criminals and those who returned to northern iraq , which is considered relatively stable .
she declined to give exact figures . liberal sweden puts up barriers germany is not alone in its restrictive attitude towards iraqi asylum-seekers . experts point out that most eu nations remain reluctant to take in iraqi asylum-seekers even though those who knock on their doors make up only a fraction of the estimated four million displaced since the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
neighboring jordan and syria have taken in two million , while another two million remain uprooted within iraq . last year , just about 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the bloc . sweden has thus far stood out among europeans for having the most welcoming attitude and taking in the highest numbers of iraqi asylum-seekers - some 9,000 alone last year .
many of the refugees in sweden have joined existing iraqi communities in towns such as malmo on the southwest coast . last week , however , the country , which has long called on other eu members to shoulder the burden , said it 's tightening its asylum rules and will forcibly deport iraqis who are denied permission to stay . " asylum a dangerous lottery " " asylum in europe has become a dangerous lottery , " said richard williams of the european council of refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , referring to the disparate practices among eu nations on granting asylum . " generally every european country is afraid of being seen as too attractive to asylum-seekers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi refugee djabar lafte latif who lives in saxony-anhalt in germany in addition to german and swedish restrictions , britain , in particular , and denmark have sent iraqis back home .
experts are also concerned that the policies of these countries are not in accordance with international treaties such as the geneva convention . in addition to plodding moves towards a harmonized eu asylum policy - a goal hoped to be achieved by 2010 - some say european leaders need to do more to sell the idea of asylum on humanitarian grounds . " asylum and migration remain major political fault lines in europe , " williams said .

she has just passed the high school exam taken by 18-year-olds . child prodigies : you either love them -lrb- if they 're your own -rrb- or hate them -lrb- if you 're a jealous classmate -rrb- .
some turn out to be precocious little brats who know exactly how brainy they are ; they never stop telling others about how brainy they are and then they start their own computer software firm to prove how brainy they are .
others quietly go about the business of overachieving , leave education with awards falling out of their spongebob squarepants rucksack and go on to make a real difference in the world .
from the level-headed and unassuming way young minu dietlinde tizabi has completed the german version of the high school diploma at the tender age of 14 , the indications are that she will join the second group .
tizabi not only completed the abitur exam four years earlier than usual but she passed with the highest possible grade , a 1.0 .

but a clemency deal could be in the offing . " the court rejects the appeals of the defendants and confirms the death penalty , " judge fathi dahn said after a five-minute hearing . the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor were found guilty late last year of intentional infecting more than 400 libyan children with hiv in the late 1990s .
all worked in the al-fateh children 's hospital in the city of benghazi . the defendants have been incarcerated since 1999 .
they deny intentionally infecting the children and claim that they were tortured while in libyan prisons , saying the confessions at the center of the prosecution 's case were coerced . in 2003 , a french doctor charged with investigating the outbreak of hiv at the hospital found that it had started before the six medics arrived there . the sentence has become an international political issue , with bulgaria , the eu and the us urging libya not to carry out the executions .
" we regret that these decisions have been taken , but i would also like to express my confidence that a solution will be found , " eu commission president jose manuel barroso told the european parliament after the libyan court 's ruling was announced . behind-the-scenes negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the key to a settlement could be gadhafi , who wants closer ties with the west the case now goes to the government-controlled high judicial council , which has the authority to change the sentence or even pardon the defendants .
the council will meet on july 16 . " we hope things will be clear on monday , " bulgaria 's prime minister sergei stanishev said on bulgarian radio .
" the decision of the council will open the way for solving the case on a political level and will be the final step in the talks held in the last few months . " there has been speculation that the six medics could be freed in exchange for money to provide for the infected children 's medical care . on tuesday , it was reported that such an agreement had been mediated by the gadhafi foundation , a charity organization run by one of the sons of libyan leader moammar gadhafi . but the families of the children have reportedly asked for 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.7 million -rrb- in compensation per child , a sum the eu has been unwilling to pay .
bulgaria also rejects the term " compensation , " saying that the word implies the medics are guilty . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the gaza strip is controlled by hamas , the west bank is ruled by an emergency government under salam fayyad in cooperation with the president and fatah chairman , mahmoud abbas . israel and the international community have interpreted the split as a chance .
thus , the islamists in the gaza strip could be more easily isolated and the emergency government in the west bank could be a partner for the resumption of cooperation , economic development and a diplomatic process .
" flourishing landscapes " and new freedom of movement in the west bank would convince the palestinian population of fatah being the right choice for the future . but the " hamastan vs fatah-land " -approach is hugely unrealistic . bildunterschrift : muriel asseburg israel has announced a gradual release of customs duties and value-added tax revenues collected on behalf of the palestinian authority and worth some $ 700 million that it has withheld since the establishment of the hamas-led government in march 2006 .
it has also promised to lift a few roadblocks in the west bank , dismantle some settlement outposts and allow weapon deliveries such as armoured vehicles to strengthen fatah . but all these measures are far from sufficient to trigger a new dynamic and to tangibly improve the situation in the west bank : as long as the system of roadblocks and permits remains in place , the palestinian economy will not see a sustainable recovery . an approach that pins hopes on a military confrontation between fatah and hamas will not stabilize the situation either .
instead , it carries the danger of a renewed flare-up of internal palestinian fighting and its escalation into a civil war . also , increasing the pressure on the population in the gaza strip is hardly possible without causing a humanitarian catastrophe .
the official unemployment rate in the region is already at some 35 percent , the poverty rate at above 75 percent .
around two thirds of the population depend on international aid deliveries .
the danger of economic isolation then is to radicalize the gaza strip ’ s population and to increase the attraction of salafist and jihadist groups – which , in contrast to hamas , neither have a national agenda nor an interest in stabilization . the new-old approach of the international community is contributing to making the vision of a two-state settlement increasingly unrealistic .
this is because it sacrifices the creation of functioning and democratic palestinian institutions in favour of short-term stability .
and because it does nothing to prevent the ever greater erosion of a contiguous territory for a palestinian state – which is a result of the separation barrier , the expansion of settlements and the corresponding transportation network in the west bank . german and european policies should therefore concentrate on averting a humanitarian catastrophe in the gaza strip and on creating conditions for an economic revival both there and in the west bank .
they should avoid undermining reconciliation among palestinian factions , support improved governance of palestinian institutions and take serious steps to achieve a two-state settlement in cooperation with the middle east quartet and the arab peace initiative . muriel asseburg is head of the research unit for the middle east and africa at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" ecofin agrees to support dominique strauss-kahn for imf director , " the presidency said , using eu shorthand for the meeting of finance ministers in brussels tuesday . french president nicolas sarkozy , a conservative , had named strauss-kahn , a social democrat , who failed to win his party 's presidential nomination in the 2007 election , as his favorite candidate .
strauss-kahn served as french finance minister in the past . the nomination means that strauss-kahn is likely to get the job since under an informal agreement , europe chooses the head of the imf while the us picks the leader of the world bank . in a surprise announcement late last month , current imf managing director rodrigo rato said that he would step down in october . respected candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy nominated strauss-kahn strauss-kahn , 58 , is a respected advocate of social democratic economics .
germany and the netherlands said strauss-kahn was suited for the job , but added that other candidates existed as well . poland proposed its own candidate , marek belka , a left-leaning economist who twice served as poland 's finance minister and prime minister in 2004-2005 . british finance minister alistair darling , however , said the position should not just be open to europeans , but to to candidates from other parts of the world . " we think there needs to be an opportunity for all members of the imf to make their own assessment as to individual candidates ... and then , of course , pick the best candidate for the job , " he told reporters . developing nations , for their part , are challenging assumptions that europeans and americans should divvy up top jobs in global finance . they argue that the structure no longer reflects the balance of economic power since the rise of china and other countries . dutch finance minister wouter bos said the post should be open to all but europe should not give up its claims . " if we have a good european candidate , we should go for it , " he said . last week , the united states indicated it would not challenge europe 's claim on the imf leader role since it had just picked american robert zoellick for the top world bank job . dw staff -lrb- win / als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the gaza strip is controlled by hamas , the west bank is ruled by an emergency government under salam fayyad in cooperation with the president and fatah chairman , mahmoud abbas . israel and the international community have interpreted the split as a chance .
thus , the islamists in the gaza strip could be more easily isolated and the emergency government in the west bank could be a partner for the resumption of cooperation , economic development and a diplomatic process .
" flourishing landscapes " and new freedom of movement in the west bank would convince the palestinian population of fatah being the right choice for the future . but the " hamastan vs fatah-land " -approach is hugely unrealistic . bildunterschrift : muriel asseburg israel has announced a gradual release of customs duties and value-added tax revenues collected on behalf of the palestinian authority and worth some $ 700 million that it has withheld since the establishment of the hamas-led government in march 2006 .
it has also promised to lift a few roadblocks in the west bank , dismantle some settlement outposts and allow weapon deliveries such as armoured vehicles to strengthen fatah . but all these measures are far from sufficient to trigger a new dynamic and to tangibly improve the situation in the west bank : as long as the system of roadblocks and permits remains in place , the palestinian economy will not see a sustainable recovery . an approach that pins hopes on a military confrontation between fatah and hamas will not stabilize the situation either .
instead , it carries the danger of a renewed flare-up of internal palestinian fighting and its escalation into a civil war . also , increasing the pressure on the population in the gaza strip is hardly possible without causing a humanitarian catastrophe .
the official unemployment rate in the region is already at some 35 percent , the poverty rate at above 75 percent .
around two thirds of the population depend on international aid deliveries .
the danger of economic isolation then is to radicalize the gaza strip ’ s population and to increase the attraction of salafist and jihadist groups – which , in contrast to hamas , neither have a national agenda nor an interest in stabilization . the new-old approach of the international community is contributing to making the vision of a two-state settlement increasingly unrealistic .
this is because it sacrifices the creation of functioning and democratic palestinian institutions in favour of short-term stability .
and because it does nothing to prevent the ever greater erosion of a contiguous territory for a palestinian state – which is a result of the separation barrier , the expansion of settlements and the corresponding transportation network in the west bank . german and european policies should therefore concentrate on averting a humanitarian catastrophe in the gaza strip and on creating conditions for an economic revival both there and in the west bank .
they should avoid undermining reconciliation among palestinian factions , support improved governance of palestinian institutions and take serious steps to achieve a two-state settlement in cooperation with the middle east quartet and the arab peace initiative . muriel asseburg is head of the research unit for the middle east and africa at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
nord stream bosses wo n't know for sure until at least 2010 the german-russian gas pipeline saga continues with a new disputed region causing a rethink over its route .
the nord stream consortium is again forced into finding an alternative direction for its maligned project . when it is finally completed , the planned russian-german natural gas pipeline may have more twists and turns than a bowl of spaghetti .
a spokesman for the nord stream consortium said wednesday that the disputed pipeline would again have to change its route after it was revealed a section had been earmarked for a stretch of water that both poland and denmark claim as an exclusive economic zone .
in april this year , nord stream - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - had its plans for running a stretch of the pipeline through estonian waters thrown into doubt over fears that it could disturb unexploded munitions and chemical dumps from world war ii .
such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry at the time .
this latest obstacle to the 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 750-mile -rrb- pipeline may prove to be more concrete in its disruption .
both denmark and poland claim the ownership of the area and nord stream is reluctant to get involved with any dispute .
pipeline consortium resorts to plan b ... or c bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord stream has had to adapt its plans after complaints now accustomed to the need to redirect the pipeline when opposition arises , nord stream said that it already has an alternative route that it proposes to take to avoid the disputed territory .
the consortium would attempt to squeeze the pipeline between the danish island of bornholm and sweden 's southeastern coast ; although nord stream stated that no final decision had been made .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
several coastal nations have expressed concern over the pipeline which is to deliver natural gas from russia to germany , saying it will damage the baltic sea 's delicate ecosystem .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment while sweden in particular has complained that the pipeline could disrupt the baltic sea ’ s sensitive flora and fauna .
study hopes to alleviate environmental fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns over the pipeline 's route out at sea in accordance with the european union rules , nord stream is required to furnish an environmental impact assessment -lrb- eia -rrb- to those countries whose territorial waters would be affected .
the consortium is expected to do so later this year .
" nord stream has decided to launch additional studies to investigate areas where the route of the pipeline through the baltic sea can be further optimized in a reasonable way to minimize environmental impacts , " the consortium said in a statement earlier this year . the pipeline has also created political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
in-between nations concerned at duopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schröder co-developed the project the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
the fact that the project was negotiated by russia and germany without consulting the countries between them has also created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the recent heightening of political tensions between russia and estonia has also left many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
if completed by 2010 as planned , the 1,200-kilometer pipeline would pump 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year from vyborg , russia to greifswald in northern germany .
in a second phase , a parallel pipeline would double that transport capacity , and nord stream estimates that will meet about 25 percent of the additional gas needs of the european union . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
nord stream bosses wo n't know for sure until at least 2010 the german-russian gas pipeline saga continues with a new disputed region causing a rethink over its route .
the nord stream consortium is again forced into finding an alternative direction for its maligned project . when it is finally completed , the planned russian-german natural gas pipeline may have more twists and turns than a bowl of spaghetti .
a spokesman for the nord stream consortium said wednesday that the disputed pipeline would again have to change its route after it was revealed a section had been earmarked for a stretch of water that both poland and denmark claim as an exclusive economic zone .
in april this year , nord stream - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - had its plans for running a stretch of the pipeline through estonian waters thrown into doubt over fears that it could disturb unexploded munitions and chemical dumps from world war ii .
such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry at the time .
this latest obstacle to the 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 750-mile -rrb- pipeline may prove to be more concrete in its disruption .
both denmark and poland claim the ownership of the area and nord stream is reluctant to get involved with any dispute .
pipeline consortium resorts to plan b ... or c bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord stream has had to adapt its plans after complaints now accustomed to the need to redirect the pipeline when opposition arises , nord stream said that it already has an alternative route that it proposes to take to avoid the disputed territory .
the consortium would attempt to squeeze the pipeline between the danish island of bornholm and sweden 's southeastern coast ; although nord stream stated that no final decision had been made .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
several coastal nations have expressed concern over the pipeline which is to deliver natural gas from russia to germany , saying it will damage the baltic sea 's delicate ecosystem .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment while sweden in particular has complained that the pipeline could disrupt the baltic sea ’ s sensitive flora and fauna .
study hopes to alleviate environmental fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns over the pipeline 's route out at sea in accordance with the european union rules , nord stream is required to furnish an environmental impact assessment -lrb- eia -rrb- to those countries whose territorial waters would be affected .
the consortium is expected to do so later this year .
" nord stream has decided to launch additional studies to investigate areas where the route of the pipeline through the baltic sea can be further optimized in a reasonable way to minimize environmental impacts , " the consortium said in a statement earlier this year . the pipeline has also created political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
in-between nations concerned at duopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schröder co-developed the project the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
the fact that the project was negotiated by russia and germany without consulting the countries between them has also created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the recent heightening of political tensions between russia and estonia has also left many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
if completed by 2010 as planned , the 1,200-kilometer pipeline would pump 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year from vyborg , russia to greifswald in northern germany .
in a second phase , a parallel pipeline would double that transport capacity , and nord stream estimates that will meet about 25 percent of the additional gas needs of the european union . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she likes to read and meet with her friends .
but where she is above average is in the classroom .
she has just passed the high school exam taken by 18-year-olds . child prodigies : you either love them -lrb- if they 're your own -rrb- or hate them -lrb- if you 're a jealous classmate -rrb- .
some turn out to be precocious little brats who know exactly how brainy they are ; they never stop telling others about how brainy they are and then they start their own computer software firm to prove how brainy they are .
others quietly go about the business of overachieving , leave education with awards falling out of their spongebob squarepants rucksack and go on to make a real difference in the world .
from the level-headed and unassuming way young minu dietlinde tizabi has completed the german version of the high school diploma at the tender age of 14 , the indications are that she will join the second group .
tizabi not only completed the abitur exam four years earlier than usual but she passed with the highest possible grade , a 1.0 .
out of a maximum of 840 points she could have scored on the test , the youngster from pforzheim racked up an amazing 815 .
a reader and writer of english bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harry potter : one of minu 's preferred reads but " just a book " the grounded teenager , who lost her mother when she was just a month old and was raised by her father , does n't see anything special in her results .
her friend hanna , after all , scored more than her .

she has just passed the high school exam taken by 18-year-olds . child prodigies : you either love them -lrb- if they 're your own -rrb- or hate them -lrb- if you 're a jealous classmate -rrb- .
some turn out to be precocious little brats who know exactly how brainy they are ; they never stop telling others about how brainy they are and then they start their own computer software firm to prove how brainy they are .
others quietly go about the business of overachieving , leave education with awards falling out of their spongebob squarepants rucksack and go on to make a real difference in the world .
from the level-headed and unassuming way young minu dietlinde tizabi has completed the german version of the high school diploma at the tender age of 14 , the indications are that she will join the second group .
tizabi not only completed the abitur exam four years earlier than usual but she passed with the highest possible grade , a 1.0 .
out of a maximum of 840 points she could have scored on the test , the youngster from pforzheim racked up an amazing 815 .
a reader and writer of english bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harry potter : one of minu 's preferred reads but " just a book " the grounded teenager , who lost her mother when she was just a month old and was raised by her father , does n't see anything special in her results .
her friend hanna , after all , scored more than her .
hanna scored 835 points - but she is 18 .
" i do n't study more than any of the others , " tizabi said in an interview with spiegel magazine .
" but i do have a lot of hobbies .
for example i took part in the biology olympic games , just out of interest . "
now that she is a high school graduate , tizabi said she did n't have any special plans for the summer vacation - other than pursuing her usual interests in literature and creative writing .
" i love to read , especially in english , " she said .
" and i also write my own stories in english .
i read the harry potter books in english … i think they 're good but the whole thing is exaggerated .
it 's just a book like any other . "
some children already show an aptitude for learning at very early ages .
tizabi was definitely one of these .
as a one year old , she was constructing the toys which came with her favorite chocolate eggs .
she was reading at three , tackling encyclopedias and studying astronomy books .
at age six , she went to school and immediately jumped three years .
swiftly up the education ladder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minu immediately leapt three classes when starting school " in total , i have jumped four classes , " she said .
" because i could read so well , i was moved up as soon as i started school .
when i started high school , i was moved up a year within three weeks of starting .
all my friends were three and four years older than me . "
despite the tragedy of losing her mother at such an early age , tizabi has certainly prospered under her father 's guidance .
father djamshid , an iranian-born certified engineer in quantum electronics , is obviously no slouch either and has not only instilled a love of learning in his daughter but has given her the humility that he himself shows .
" she is no child prodigy , " he said matter-of-factly in a recent interview with a local newspaper .
" she is quite normal . "
while she more than keeps up with her classmates in the academic stakes , there is one aspect of school in which tizabi does show her age : sports .
she is a lot smaller than her classmates and , as a result , has been taken out of physical education classes for her own good .
in the class , however , she is seen as a peer - by most of her classmates .
" with the girls , it was always okay , " she said .
" but the boys have never completely accepted me .
why , i do not know .
i do n't feel that there is any envy . "
a career in medicine beckons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 14-year-old dreams of a career in medical research it appears that the future is hers for the taking and tizabi already has a plan forming as to what she would like to do with her life .
" i would like to study medicine and then work in research , " the 14-year-old said .
" medical research can save lives , this is very important .
therefore , i think that this is a great occupational goal .
i would most like to study in heidelberg as the university is very good there , especially for studying medicine . "
and while age has not yet been a barrier to her achievements , does tizabi worry that her tender years may go against her in the future ?
" right now , my age is n't a problem in the application process and i have had only positive reactions from the universities . "
" however , if i do get a place at a university to study … my father will have to go there and sign a parental consent form ! " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fearful of a refugee influx , however , other european nations have started tightening their asylum rules . " when you go out in baghdad , there 's a 50 percent chance you may never come home , " said murad atshan , an iraqi filmmaker living in germany . anyone who follows news of daily suicide bombings , a bloody insurgency and sectarian violence in the iraqi capital will probably nod in agreement at the statement .
german authorities in munich , however , rejected atshan 's application for asylum a year ago , saying he did n't give a good enough reason for seeking protection . the 27-year-old has since been confined to a refugee center in a tiny village in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , near the swiss border . while german authorities are deciding what to do with him , atshan is n't allowed to leave the district or work . " it 's very frustrating , " he said .
" i did n't come here looking for a good life , i just wanted to be somewhere safe .
but this is no normal life . " in addition to worrying about his family back home in baghdad , atshan is grappling with getting used to life in a small foreign village . " i 'm used to living in big cities , " he said . " i ca n't even go to the movies here . " living in limbo atshan 's case is depressingly familiar in the country whose complicated asylum and refugee laws have come under increasing criticism from aid and refugee groups .
germany is home to an estimated 73,000 iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi family at a refugee home in germany experts say german asylum rules date back to the 1990s when tens of thousands of iraqis fleeing saddam hussein 's dictatorship applied for and easily received asylum status in germany on grounds of political persecution . " the moment saddam was toppled in 2003 , however , the german government sent out letters to thousands of iraqis saying their asylum status would be revoked since the persecutor was now gone , " said bernd mesovic of campaign group proasyl .
" it 's as if the authorities did n't watch television and did n't know what 's happening in iraq . " last year , german authorities stripped 8,189 refugees of their asylum status .
this week , human rights watch slammed germany 's move earlier this year to revoke the refugee status of over 18,000 iraqis . " losing your asylum status has serious repercussions , " said marianne heuwagen , head of the german section of human rights watch , because it can lead to reduced social benefits and severe restrictions on work , mobility and unification with family members . " in others words , it leaves you in limbo and with an uncertain future , " she said . civil war not asylum-worthy german authorities admit that iraqis seeking asylum must now prove they face personal risk in their homeland .
general instability or civil war is not reason enough to grant asylum though it is sufficient to put a freeze on deportations . at the same time , revoking asylum status does not automatically mean iraqis will be sent back home , said claudia moebus , spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis in baghdad have to live with daily car and suicide bombings " each refugee has the right to appeal and each individual case is carefully considered before any decision is taken , " moebus said . she added that german authorities had also reversed their recent decision to strip 18,000 iraqis of their refugee status with the exceptions of criminals and those who returned to northern iraq , which is considered relatively stable .
she declined to give exact figures . liberal sweden puts up barriers germany is not alone in its restrictive attitude towards iraqi asylum-seekers . experts point out that most eu nations remain reluctant to take in iraqi asylum-seekers even though those who knock on their doors make up only a fraction of the estimated four million displaced since the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
neighboring jordan and syria have taken in two million , while another two million remain uprooted within iraq . last year , just about 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the bloc . sweden has thus far stood out among europeans for having the most welcoming attitude and taking in the highest numbers of iraqi asylum-seekers - some 9,000 alone last year .
many of the refugees in sweden have joined existing iraqi communities in towns such as malmo on the southwest coast . last week , however , the country , which has long called on other eu members to shoulder the burden , said it 's tightening its asylum rules and will forcibly deport iraqis who are denied permission to stay . " asylum a dangerous lottery " " asylum in europe has become a dangerous lottery , " said richard williams of the european council of refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , referring to the disparate practices among eu nations on granting asylum . " generally every european country is afraid of being seen as too attractive to asylum-seekers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi refugee djabar lafte latif who lives in saxony-anhalt in germany in addition to german and swedish restrictions , britain , in particular , and denmark have sent iraqis back home .

he suggested launching a " citizenship campaign " to persuade foreigners to change their nationality .
" we should persuade people who have a right to citizenship to do more than be just residents and to become citizens , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
but edathy 's idea was met with skepticism in the conservative ranks of the german political establishment .
stephan mayer , parliamentary head for the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , questioned whether giving citizenship to foreigners would lead to better integration .
" awarding citizenship can only take place at the end of a successful integration process , certainly not at the beginning , " mayer said .
" the state can not offer citizenship as a concession . "
a sensitive issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners have to give up their previous citizenship to become german the integration issue in germany has been traditionally plagued by the widely divergent positions of the spd and the cdu / csu - now united under the umbrella of merkel 's grand coalition government .
foreigners , who are not married to german citizens , currently obtain the right to apply for german citizenship if they have been legally living in germany for at least eight years , if they can financially support themselves and their families without state aid , if they possess sufficient german language skills , have not been convicted of a crime , and if they avow they will adhere to germany 's basic law and democratic principles .
by adopting german citizenship , foreigners living in germany are also expected to give up any other citizenship they have .
extending local voting rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu citizens can participate in local elections wherever in the bloc they live edathy also said germany should provide some foreigners with a right to vote in local elections .
" it is key that we improve migrants ' political participation by a right to vote in municipal election for foreigners who have lived in germany for a long time , " he said .
while federal and state elections are open only to a country 's citizens , the european union law opened municipal elections across the 27-member bloc to all eu citizens who are local residents , even if they are not citizens of the country where they live .
" i do n't think much of extending the right to vote because it does n't contribute to integration , " bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein told deutschlandfunk radio on friday .
" integration is a hard task : namely learning the legal system , leaning that you can speak the language and that you fit in to society . "
new ideas after integration summit edathy 's suggestions were not subject to discussion at germany 's second integration summit on thursday , which dealt with proposals from six working groups on how to improve the integration of immigrants living in germany .
despite the decision of some turkish groups to boycott the meeting in protest of a recent law placing additional restrictions on some foreigners before they are allowed to move to germany , merkel called the day-long meeting a success and " milestone " for the country 's integration efforts .
representatives of the federal government , the states and some 90 community leaders at the summit adopted a " national integration plan " containing 400 promises for improvements - ranging from aid for ethnic sports clubs to making more german-language classes available . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fearful of a refugee influx , however , other european nations have started tightening their asylum rules . " when you go out in baghdad , there 's a 50 percent chance you may never come home , " said murad atshan , an iraqi filmmaker living in germany . anyone who follows news of daily suicide bombings , a bloody insurgency and sectarian violence in the iraqi capital will probably nod in agreement at the statement .
german authorities in munich , however , rejected atshan 's application for asylum a year ago , saying he did n't give a good enough reason for seeking protection . the 27-year-old has since been confined to a refugee center in a tiny village in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , near the swiss border . while german authorities are deciding what to do with him , atshan is n't allowed to leave the district or work . " it 's very frustrating , " he said .
" i did n't come here looking for a good life , i just wanted to be somewhere safe .
but this is no normal life . " in addition to worrying about his family back home in baghdad , atshan is grappling with getting used to life in a small foreign village . " i 'm used to living in big cities , " he said . " i ca n't even go to the movies here . " living in limbo atshan 's case is depressingly familiar in the country whose complicated asylum and refugee laws have come under increasing criticism from aid and refugee groups .
germany is home to an estimated 73,000 iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi family at a refugee home in germany experts say german asylum rules date back to the 1990s when tens of thousands of iraqis fleeing saddam hussein 's dictatorship applied for and easily received asylum status in germany on grounds of political persecution . " the moment saddam was toppled in 2003 , however , the german government sent out letters to thousands of iraqis saying their asylum status would be revoked since the persecutor was now gone , " said bernd mesovic of campaign group proasyl .
" it 's as if the authorities did n't watch television and did n't know what 's happening in iraq . " last year , german authorities stripped 8,189 refugees of their asylum status .
this week , human rights watch slammed germany 's move earlier this year to revoke the refugee status of over 18,000 iraqis . " losing your asylum status has serious repercussions , " said marianne heuwagen , head of the german section of human rights watch , because it can lead to reduced social benefits and severe restrictions on work , mobility and unification with family members . " in others words , it leaves you in limbo and with an uncertain future , " she said . civil war not asylum-worthy german authorities admit that iraqis seeking asylum must now prove they face personal risk in their homeland .
general instability or civil war is not reason enough to grant asylum though it is sufficient to put a freeze on deportations . at the same time , revoking asylum status does not automatically mean iraqis will be sent back home , said claudia moebus , spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis in baghdad have to live with daily car and suicide bombings " each refugee has the right to appeal and each individual case is carefully considered before any decision is taken , " moebus said . she added that german authorities had also reversed their recent decision to strip 18,000 iraqis of their refugee status with the exceptions of criminals and those who returned to northern iraq , which is considered relatively stable .
she declined to give exact figures . liberal sweden puts up barriers germany is not alone in its restrictive attitude towards iraqi asylum-seekers . experts point out that most eu nations remain reluctant to take in iraqi asylum-seekers even though those who knock on their doors make up only a fraction of the estimated four million displaced since the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
neighboring jordan and syria have taken in two million , while another two million remain uprooted within iraq . last year , just about 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the bloc . sweden has thus far stood out among europeans for having the most welcoming attitude and taking in the highest numbers of iraqi asylum-seekers - some 9,000 alone last year .
many of the refugees in sweden have joined existing iraqi communities in towns such as malmo on the southwest coast . last week , however , the country , which has long called on other eu members to shoulder the burden , said it 's tightening its asylum rules and will forcibly deport iraqis who are denied permission to stay . " asylum a dangerous lottery " " asylum in europe has become a dangerous lottery , " said richard williams of the european council of refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , referring to the disparate practices among eu nations on granting asylum .

fearful of a refugee influx , however , other european nations have started tightening their asylum rules . " when you go out in baghdad , there 's a 50 percent chance you may never come home , " said murad atshan , an iraqi filmmaker living in germany . anyone who follows news of daily suicide bombings , a bloody insurgency and sectarian violence in the iraqi capital will probably nod in agreement at the statement .
german authorities in munich , however , rejected atshan 's application for asylum a year ago , saying he did n't give a good enough reason for seeking protection . the 27-year-old has since been confined to a refugee center in a tiny village in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg , near the swiss border . while german authorities are deciding what to do with him , atshan is n't allowed to leave the district or work . " it 's very frustrating , " he said .
" i did n't come here looking for a good life , i just wanted to be somewhere safe .
but this is no normal life . " in addition to worrying about his family back home in baghdad , atshan is grappling with getting used to life in a small foreign village . " i 'm used to living in big cities , " he said . " i ca n't even go to the movies here . " living in limbo atshan 's case is depressingly familiar in the country whose complicated asylum and refugee laws have come under increasing criticism from aid and refugee groups .
germany is home to an estimated 73,000 iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi family at a refugee home in germany experts say german asylum rules date back to the 1990s when tens of thousands of iraqis fleeing saddam hussein 's dictatorship applied for and easily received asylum status in germany on grounds of political persecution . " the moment saddam was toppled in 2003 , however , the german government sent out letters to thousands of iraqis saying their asylum status would be revoked since the persecutor was now gone , " said bernd mesovic of campaign group proasyl .
" it 's as if the authorities did n't watch television and did n't know what 's happening in iraq . " last year , german authorities stripped 8,189 refugees of their asylum status .
this week , human rights watch slammed germany 's move earlier this year to revoke the refugee status of over 18,000 iraqis . " losing your asylum status has serious repercussions , " said marianne heuwagen , head of the german section of human rights watch , because it can lead to reduced social benefits and severe restrictions on work , mobility and unification with family members . " in others words , it leaves you in limbo and with an uncertain future , " she said . civil war not asylum-worthy german authorities admit that iraqis seeking asylum must now prove they face personal risk in their homeland .
general instability or civil war is not reason enough to grant asylum though it is sufficient to put a freeze on deportations . at the same time , revoking asylum status does not automatically mean iraqis will be sent back home , said claudia moebus , spokeswoman for the federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis in baghdad have to live with daily car and suicide bombings " each refugee has the right to appeal and each individual case is carefully considered before any decision is taken , " moebus said . she added that german authorities had also reversed their recent decision to strip 18,000 iraqis of their refugee status with the exceptions of criminals and those who returned to northern iraq , which is considered relatively stable .
she declined to give exact figures . liberal sweden puts up barriers germany is not alone in its restrictive attitude towards iraqi asylum-seekers . experts point out that most eu nations remain reluctant to take in iraqi asylum-seekers even though those who knock on their doors make up only a fraction of the estimated four million displaced since the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 .
neighboring jordan and syria have taken in two million , while another two million remain uprooted within iraq . last year , just about 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the bloc . sweden has thus far stood out among europeans for having the most welcoming attitude and taking in the highest numbers of iraqi asylum-seekers - some 9,000 alone last year .
many of the refugees in sweden have joined existing iraqi communities in towns such as malmo on the southwest coast . last week , however , the country , which has long called on other eu members to shoulder the burden , said it 's tightening its asylum rules and will forcibly deport iraqis who are denied permission to stay . " asylum a dangerous lottery " " asylum in europe has become a dangerous lottery , " said richard williams of the european council of refugees and exiles -lrb- ecre -rrb- , referring to the disparate practices among eu nations on granting asylum . " generally every european country is afraid of being seen as too attractive to asylum-seekers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi refugee djabar lafte latif who lives in saxony-anhalt in germany in addition to german and swedish restrictions , britain , in particular , and denmark have sent iraqis back home .
experts are also concerned that the policies of these countries are not in accordance with international treaties such as the geneva convention . in addition to plodding moves towards a harmonized eu asylum policy - a goal hoped to be achieved by 2010 - some say european leaders need to do more to sell the idea of asylum on humanitarian grounds . " asylum and migration remain major political fault lines in europe , " williams said .
" politicians must take the lead to explain global realities to the public . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 13.07.2007 child prodigy passes german high school exam with top grade großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minu tizabi started off reading astronomy books at the age of three minu dietlinde tizabi seems like an average 14-year-old .
she likes to read and meet with her friends .
but where she is above average is in the classroom .
she has just passed the high school exam taken by 18-year-olds . child prodigies : you either love them -lrb- if they 're your own -rrb- or hate them -lrb- if you 're a jealous classmate -rrb- .
some turn out to be precocious little brats who know exactly how brainy they are ; they never stop telling others about how brainy they are and then they start their own computer software firm to prove how brainy they are .
others quietly go about the business of overachieving , leave education with awards falling out of their spongebob squarepants rucksack and go on to make a real difference in the world .
from the level-headed and unassuming way young minu dietlinde tizabi has completed the german version of the high school diploma at the tender age of 14 , the indications are that she will join the second group .
tizabi not only completed the abitur exam four years earlier than usual but she passed with the highest possible grade , a 1.0 .
out of a maximum of 840 points she could have scored on the test , the youngster from pforzheim racked up an amazing 815 .
a reader and writer of english bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harry potter : one of minu 's preferred reads but " just a book " the grounded teenager , who lost her mother when she was just a month old and was raised by her father , does n't see anything special in her results .
her friend hanna , after all , scored more than her .
hanna scored 835 points - but she is 18 .
" i do n't study more than any of the others , " tizabi said in an interview with spiegel magazine .
" but i do have a lot of hobbies .
for example i took part in the biology olympic games , just out of interest . "
now that she is a high school graduate , tizabi said she did n't have any special plans for the summer vacation - other than pursuing her usual interests in literature and creative writing .
" i love to read , especially in english , " she said .
" and i also write my own stories in english .
i read the harry potter books in english … i think they 're good but the whole thing is exaggerated .
it 's just a book like any other . "
some children already show an aptitude for learning at very early ages .
tizabi was definitely one of these .
as a one year old , she was constructing the toys which came with her favorite chocolate eggs .
she was reading at three , tackling encyclopedias and studying astronomy books .
at age six , she went to school and immediately jumped three years .
swiftly up the education ladder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minu immediately leapt three classes when starting school " in total , i have jumped four classes , " she said .
" because i could read so well , i was moved up as soon as i started school .
when i started high school , i was moved up a year within three weeks of starting .
all my friends were three and four years older than me . "
despite the tragedy of losing her mother at such an early age , tizabi has certainly prospered under her father 's guidance .
father djamshid , an iranian-born certified engineer in quantum electronics , is obviously no slouch either and has not only instilled a love of learning in his daughter but has given her the humility that he himself shows .
" she is no child prodigy , " he said matter-of-factly in a recent interview with a local newspaper .
" she is quite normal . "
while she more than keeps up with her classmates in the academic stakes , there is one aspect of school in which tizabi does show her age : sports .
she is a lot smaller than her classmates and , as a result , has been taken out of physical education classes for her own good .
in the class , however , she is seen as a peer - by most of her classmates .
" with the girls , it was always okay , " she said .
" but the boys have never completely accepted me .
why , i do not know .
i do n't feel that there is any envy . "
a career in medicine beckons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 14-year-old dreams of a career in medical research it appears that the future is hers for the taking and tizabi already has a plan forming as to what she would like to do with her life .
" i would like to study medicine and then work in research , " the 14-year-old said .
" medical research can save lives , this is very important .
therefore , i think that this is a great occupational goal .
i would most like to study in heidelberg as the university is very good there , especially for studying medicine . "
and while age has not yet been a barrier to her achievements , does tizabi worry that her tender years may go against her in the future ?
" right now , my age is n't a problem in the application process and i have had only positive reactions from the universities . "
" however , if i do get a place at a university to study … my father will have to go there and sign a parental consent form ! " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the gaza strip is controlled by hamas , the west bank is ruled by an emergency government under salam fayyad in cooperation with the president and fatah chairman , mahmoud abbas . israel and the international community have interpreted the split as a chance .
thus , the islamists in the gaza strip could be more easily isolated and the emergency government in the west bank could be a partner for the resumption of cooperation , economic development and a diplomatic process .
" flourishing landscapes " and new freedom of movement in the west bank would convince the palestinian population of fatah being the right choice for the future . but the " hamastan vs fatah-land " -approach is hugely unrealistic . bildunterschrift : muriel asseburg israel has announced a gradual release of customs duties and value-added tax revenues collected on behalf of the palestinian authority and worth some $ 700 million that it has withheld since the establishment of the hamas-led government in march 2006 .
it has also promised to lift a few roadblocks in the west bank , dismantle some settlement outposts and allow weapon deliveries such as armoured vehicles to strengthen fatah . but all these measures are far from sufficient to trigger a new dynamic and to tangibly improve the situation in the west bank : as long as the system of roadblocks and permits remains in place , the palestinian economy will not see a sustainable recovery . an approach that pins hopes on a military confrontation between fatah and hamas will not stabilize the situation either .
instead , it carries the danger of a renewed flare-up of internal palestinian fighting and its escalation into a civil war . also , increasing the pressure on the population in the gaza strip is hardly possible without causing a humanitarian catastrophe .
the official unemployment rate in the region is already at some 35 percent , the poverty rate at above 75 percent .
around two thirds of the population depend on international aid deliveries .
the danger of economic isolation then is to radicalize the gaza strip ’ s population and to increase the attraction of salafist and jihadist groups – which , in contrast to hamas , neither have a national agenda nor an interest in stabilization . the new-old approach of the international community is contributing to making the vision of a two-state settlement increasingly unrealistic .
this is because it sacrifices the creation of functioning and democratic palestinian institutions in favour of short-term stability .
and because it does nothing to prevent the ever greater erosion of a contiguous territory for a palestinian state – which is a result of the separation barrier , the expansion of settlements and the corresponding transportation network in the west bank . german and european policies should therefore concentrate on averting a humanitarian catastrophe in the gaza strip and on creating conditions for an economic revival both there and in the west bank .
they should avoid undermining reconciliation among palestinian factions , support improved governance of palestinian institutions and take serious steps to achieve a two-state settlement in cooperation with the middle east quartet and the arab peace initiative . muriel asseburg is head of the research unit for the middle east and africa at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the gaza strip is controlled by hamas , the west bank is ruled by an emergency government under salam fayyad in cooperation with the president and fatah chairman , mahmoud abbas . israel and the international community have interpreted the split as a chance .
thus , the islamists in the gaza strip could be more easily isolated and the emergency government in the west bank could be a partner for the resumption of cooperation , economic development and a diplomatic process .
" flourishing landscapes " and new freedom of movement in the west bank would convince the palestinian population of fatah being the right choice for the future . but the " hamastan vs fatah-land " -approach is hugely unrealistic . bildunterschrift : muriel asseburg israel has announced a gradual release of customs duties and value-added tax revenues collected on behalf of the palestinian authority and worth some $ 700 million that it has withheld since the establishment of the hamas-led government in march 2006 .
it has also promised to lift a few roadblocks in the west bank , dismantle some settlement outposts and allow weapon deliveries such as armoured vehicles to strengthen fatah . but all these measures are far from sufficient to trigger a new dynamic and to tangibly improve the situation in the west bank : as long as the system of roadblocks and permits remains in place , the palestinian economy will not see a sustainable recovery . an approach that pins hopes on a military confrontation between fatah and hamas will not stabilize the situation either .
instead , it carries the danger of a renewed flare-up of internal palestinian fighting and its escalation into a civil war . also , increasing the pressure on the population in the gaza strip is hardly possible without causing a humanitarian catastrophe .
the official unemployment rate in the region is already at some 35 percent , the poverty rate at above 75 percent .
around two thirds of the population depend on international aid deliveries .
the danger of economic isolation then is to radicalize the gaza strip ’ s population and to increase the attraction of salafist and jihadist groups – which , in contrast to hamas , neither have a national agenda nor an interest in stabilization . the new-old approach of the international community is contributing to making the vision of a two-state settlement increasingly unrealistic .
this is because it sacrifices the creation of functioning and democratic palestinian institutions in favour of short-term stability .
and because it does nothing to prevent the ever greater erosion of a contiguous territory for a palestinian state – which is a result of the separation barrier , the expansion of settlements and the corresponding transportation network in the west bank . german and european policies should therefore concentrate on averting a humanitarian catastrophe in the gaza strip and on creating conditions for an economic revival both there and in the west bank .
they should avoid undermining reconciliation among palestinian factions , support improved governance of palestinian institutions and take serious steps to achieve a two-state settlement in cooperation with the middle east quartet and the arab peace initiative . muriel asseburg is head of the research unit for the middle east and africa at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 13.07.2007 opinion : prior debate overshadows integration summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whatever reasons three turkish groups had for boycotting germany 's second integration summit , their absence overshadowed the entire event , according to dw commentator peter philipp . it all could have all been so nice : the chancellor 's second " integration summit " presents a " national integration plan " in which hundreds of measures on integrating immigrants are put down on paper .
but the result was clouded by the decision of various turkish associations to abstain from attending the summit , and it 's been clear for days that the atmosphere of the first summit , which took place in 2006 , would not be replicated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp the associations are annoyed that the german government did not sufficiently consult with them about tightening an immigration law , critics say .
though not explicitly named , turkish immigrants are particularly discriminated against , the associations also said .
not only because they make the largest group of so-called " migrants , " but also for concrete reasons : spouses have to learn german in their home countries and have to be at least 18 years old before they can come to germany .
the irritated turkish association pushed forward a debate that more than clearly demonstrated how poorly the law handles integration .
some of the associations ' representatives even spoke of it violating their human rights .
" absurd , " the politicians countered , adding that raising the age of immigration to 18 would avoid forced marriages .
and secondly , it must be clear that people who want to live in germany should speak german .
the politicians do n't bring up the fact that this is n't quite as easy in anatolian villages as in new york or tokyo - where the condition is n't even being imposed .
not to mention that german is best learnt in germany .
the turkish groups - somewhat unskillfully - gave the impression that they wanted to put pressure on the government .
but german politicians tried to trivialize the situation and insinuate that the groups wanted to prevent what is clear to everyone and questioned by few : that the integration of immigrants is important and that language skills are , naturally , required .
but acquiring language skills in anatolia - even if it 's just the " 300 words " that german politicians suddenly say are necessary - is a hurdle for the people who live there and want to move to germany .
while talking about avoiding forced marriages may be politically beneficial , it can not be achieved by raising the age of immigration and certainly not by 300 german words .
these are problems that have to be solved in germany .
and that has to be done on equal footing with the immigrants , as the politicians like to say .
this is what should have happened before the changes were made to the immigration law .
then we could have saved ourselves a lot of aggravation , and some things could have really improved .

but the result was clouded by the decision of various turkish associations to abstain from attending the summit , and it 's been clear for days that the atmosphere of the first summit , which took place in 2006 , would not be replicated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp the associations are annoyed that the german government did not sufficiently consult with them about tightening an immigration law , critics say .
though not explicitly named , turkish immigrants are particularly discriminated against , the associations also said .
not only because they make the largest group of so-called " migrants , " but also for concrete reasons : spouses have to learn german in their home countries and have to be at least 18 years old before they can come to germany .
the irritated turkish association pushed forward a debate that more than clearly demonstrated how poorly the law handles integration .
some of the associations ' representatives even spoke of it violating their human rights .
" absurd , " the politicians countered , adding that raising the age of immigration to 18 would avoid forced marriages .
and secondly , it must be clear that people who want to live in germany should speak german .
the politicians do n't bring up the fact that this is n't quite as easy in anatolian villages as in new york or tokyo - where the condition is n't even being imposed .
not to mention that german is best learnt in germany .
the turkish groups - somewhat unskillfully - gave the impression that they wanted to put pressure on the government .
but german politicians tried to trivialize the situation and insinuate that the groups wanted to prevent what is clear to everyone and questioned by few : that the integration of immigrants is important and that language skills are , naturally , required .
but acquiring language skills in anatolia - even if it 's just the " 300 words " that german politicians suddenly say are necessary - is a hurdle for the people who live there and want to move to germany .
while talking about avoiding forced marriages may be politically beneficial , it can not be achieved by raising the age of immigration and certainly not by 300 german words .
these are problems that have to be solved in germany .
and that has to be done on equal footing with the immigrants , as the politicians like to say .
this is what should have happened before the changes were made to the immigration law .
then we could have saved ourselves a lot of aggravation , and some things could have really improved .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp the associations are annoyed that the german government did not sufficiently consult with them about tightening an immigration law , critics say .
though not explicitly named , turkish immigrants are particularly discriminated against , the associations also said .
not only because they make the largest group of so-called " migrants , " but also for concrete reasons : spouses have to learn german in their home countries and have to be at least 18 years old before they can come to germany .
the irritated turkish association pushed forward a debate that more than clearly demonstrated how poorly the law handles integration .
some of the associations ' representatives even spoke of it violating their human rights .
" absurd , " the politicians countered , adding that raising the age of immigration to 18 would avoid forced marriages .
and secondly , it must be clear that people who want to live in germany should speak german .
the politicians do n't bring up the fact that this is n't quite as easy in anatolian villages as in new york or tokyo - where the condition is n't even being imposed .
not to mention that german is best learnt in germany .
the turkish groups - somewhat unskillfully - gave the impression that they wanted to put pressure on the government .
but german politicians tried to trivialize the situation and insinuate that the groups wanted to prevent what is clear to everyone and questioned by few : that the integration of immigrants is important and that language skills are , naturally , required .
but acquiring language skills in anatolia - even if it 's just the " 300 words " that german politicians suddenly say are necessary - is a hurdle for the people who live there and want to move to germany .
while talking about avoiding forced marriages may be politically beneficial , it can not be achieved by raising the age of immigration and certainly not by 300 german words .
these are problems that have to be solved in germany .
and that has to be done on equal footing with the immigrants , as the politicians like to say .
this is what should have happened before the changes were made to the immigration law .
then we could have saved ourselves a lot of aggravation , and some things could have really improved .

but a clemency deal could be in the offing . " the court rejects the appeals of the defendants and confirms the death penalty , " judge fathi dahn said after a five-minute hearing . the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor were found guilty late last year of intentional infecting more than 400 libyan children with hiv in the late 1990s .
all worked in the al-fateh children 's hospital in the city of benghazi . the defendants have been incarcerated since 1999 .

but a clemency deal could be in the offing . " the court rejects the appeals of the defendants and confirms the death penalty , " judge fathi dahn said after a five-minute hearing . the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor were found guilty late last year of intentional infecting more than 400 libyan children with hiv in the late 1990s .

" ecofin agrees to support dominique strauss-kahn for imf director , " the presidency said , using eu shorthand for the meeting of finance ministers in brussels tuesday . french president nicolas sarkozy , a conservative , had named strauss-kahn , a social democrat , who failed to win his party 's presidential nomination in the 2007 election , as his favorite candidate .
strauss-kahn served as french finance minister in the past . the nomination means that strauss-kahn is likely to get the job since under an informal agreement , europe chooses the head of the imf while the us picks the leader of the world bank . in a surprise announcement late last month , current imf managing director rodrigo rato said that he would step down in october . respected candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy nominated strauss-kahn strauss-kahn , 58 , is a respected advocate of social democratic economics .
germany and the netherlands said strauss-kahn was suited for the job , but added that other candidates existed as well . poland proposed its own candidate , marek belka , a left-leaning economist who twice served as poland 's finance minister and prime minister in 2004-2005 . british finance minister alistair darling , however , said the position should not just be open to europeans , but to to candidates from other parts of the world . " we think there needs to be an opportunity for all members of the imf to make their own assessment as to individual candidates ... and then , of course , pick the best candidate for the job , " he told reporters . developing nations , for their part , are challenging assumptions that europeans and americans should divvy up top jobs in global finance . they argue that the structure no longer reflects the balance of economic power since the rise of china and other countries . dutch finance minister wouter bos said the post should be open to all but europe should not give up its claims . " if we have a good european candidate , we should go for it , " he said . last week , the united states indicated it would not challenge europe 's claim on the imf leader role since it had just picked american robert zoellick for the top world bank job . dw staff -lrb- win / als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he suggested launching a " citizenship campaign " to persuade foreigners to change their nationality .
" we should persuade people who have a right to citizenship to do more than be just residents and to become citizens , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
but edathy 's idea was met with skepticism in the conservative ranks of the german political establishment .
stephan mayer , parliamentary head for the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , questioned whether giving citizenship to foreigners would lead to better integration .
" awarding citizenship can only take place at the end of a successful integration process , certainly not at the beginning , " mayer said .
" the state can not offer citizenship as a concession . "
a sensitive issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners have to give up their previous citizenship to become german the integration issue in germany has been traditionally plagued by the widely divergent positions of the spd and the cdu / csu - now united under the umbrella of merkel 's grand coalition government .
foreigners , who are not married to german citizens , currently obtain the right to apply for german citizenship if they have been legally living in germany for at least eight years , if they can financially support themselves and their families without state aid , if they possess sufficient german language skills , have not been convicted of a crime , and if they avow they will adhere to germany 's basic law and democratic principles .
by adopting german citizenship , foreigners living in germany are also expected to give up any other citizenship they have .
extending local voting rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu citizens can participate in local elections wherever in the bloc they live edathy also said germany should provide some foreigners with a right to vote in local elections .
" it is key that we improve migrants ' political participation by a right to vote in municipal election for foreigners who have lived in germany for a long time , " he said .
while federal and state elections are open only to a country 's citizens , the european union law opened municipal elections across the 27-member bloc to all eu citizens who are local residents , even if they are not citizens of the country where they live .
" i do n't think much of extending the right to vote because it does n't contribute to integration , " bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein told deutschlandfunk radio on friday .
" integration is a hard task : namely learning the legal system , leaning that you can speak the language and that you fit in to society . "
new ideas after integration summit edathy 's suggestions were not subject to discussion at germany 's second integration summit on thursday , which dealt with proposals from six working groups on how to improve the integration of immigrants living in germany .
despite the decision of some turkish groups to boycott the meeting in protest of a recent law placing additional restrictions on some foreigners before they are allowed to move to germany , merkel called the day-long meeting a success and " milestone " for the country 's integration efforts .
representatives of the federal government , the states and some 90 community leaders at the summit adopted a " national integration plan " containing 400 promises for improvements - ranging from aid for ethnic sports clubs to making more german-language classes available . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he suggested launching a " citizenship campaign " to persuade foreigners to change their nationality .
" we should persuade people who have a right to citizenship to do more than be just residents and to become citizens , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
but edathy 's idea was met with skepticism in the conservative ranks of the german political establishment .
stephan mayer , parliamentary head for the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , questioned whether giving citizenship to foreigners would lead to better integration .
" awarding citizenship can only take place at the end of a successful integration process , certainly not at the beginning , " mayer said .
" the state can not offer citizenship as a concession . "
a sensitive issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners have to give up their previous citizenship to become german the integration issue in germany has been traditionally plagued by the widely divergent positions of the spd and the cdu / csu - now united under the umbrella of merkel 's grand coalition government .
foreigners , who are not married to german citizens , currently obtain the right to apply for german citizenship if they have been legally living in germany for at least eight years , if they can financially support themselves and their families without state aid , if they possess sufficient german language skills , have not been convicted of a crime , and if they avow they will adhere to germany 's basic law and democratic principles .
by adopting german citizenship , foreigners living in germany are also expected to give up any other citizenship they have .
extending local voting rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu citizens can participate in local elections wherever in the bloc they live edathy also said germany should provide some foreigners with a right to vote in local elections .
" it is key that we improve migrants ' political participation by a right to vote in municipal election for foreigners who have lived in germany for a long time , " he said .
while federal and state elections are open only to a country 's citizens , the european union law opened municipal elections across the 27-member bloc to all eu citizens who are local residents , even if they are not citizens of the country where they live .
" i do n't think much of extending the right to vote because it does n't contribute to integration , " bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein told deutschlandfunk radio on friday .
" integration is a hard task : namely learning the legal system , leaning that you can speak the language and that you fit in to society . "
new ideas after integration summit edathy 's suggestions were not subject to discussion at germany 's second integration summit on thursday , which dealt with proposals from six working groups on how to improve the integration of immigrants living in germany .
despite the decision of some turkish groups to boycott the meeting in protest of a recent law placing additional restrictions on some foreigners before they are allowed to move to germany , merkel called the day-long meeting a success and " milestone " for the country 's integration efforts .
representatives of the federal government , the states and some 90 community leaders at the summit adopted a " national integration plan " containing 400 promises for improvements - ranging from aid for ethnic sports clubs to making more german-language classes available . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" ecofin agrees to support dominique strauss-kahn for imf director , " the presidency said , using eu shorthand for the meeting of finance ministers in brussels tuesday . french president nicolas sarkozy , a conservative , had named strauss-kahn , a social democrat , who failed to win his party 's presidential nomination in the 2007 election , as his favorite candidate .
strauss-kahn served as french finance minister in the past . the nomination means that strauss-kahn is likely to get the job since under an informal agreement , europe chooses the head of the imf while the us picks the leader of the world bank . in a surprise announcement late last month , current imf managing director rodrigo rato said that he would step down in october . respected candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy nominated strauss-kahn strauss-kahn , 58 , is a respected advocate of social democratic economics .
germany and the netherlands said strauss-kahn was suited for the job , but added that other candidates existed as well . poland proposed its own candidate , marek belka , a left-leaning economist who twice served as poland 's finance minister and prime minister in 2004-2005 . british finance minister alistair darling , however , said the position should not just be open to europeans , but to to candidates from other parts of the world . " we think there needs to be an opportunity for all members of the imf to make their own assessment as to individual candidates ... and then , of course , pick the best candidate for the job , " he told reporters . developing nations , for their part , are challenging assumptions that europeans and americans should divvy up top jobs in global finance . they argue that the structure no longer reflects the balance of economic power since the rise of china and other countries . dutch finance minister wouter bos said the post should be open to all but europe should not give up its claims . " if we have a good european candidate , we should go for it , " he said . last week , the united states indicated it would not challenge europe 's claim on the imf leader role since it had just picked american robert zoellick for the top world bank job . dw staff -lrb- win / als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the computer-generated creature is part of an exhibit opening friday at the museum of natural history in berlin . what sounds like a scene from the adventure film jurassic park can be seen in a computer animation exhibit that opened friday at berlin 's museum of natural history . but the " evolution in action " exhibit , housed in four renovated halls , is intended to act as a bridge between scientific research and everyday life . the star of the exhibit is a 13-meter-high and 15-meter-long -lrb- 42.6 foot-high and 49.2-foot long -rrb- brachiosaurus , the tallest dinosaur model ever mounted in a museum .
five additional skeletons from the museum 's collection of 150-million-year-old dinosaurs from tanzania 's mount tendaguru are also on display , along with fossil plants and animals that lived in eastern africa at the same time . brachiosaurus , taller than ever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the record breaking brachiosaurus model in its new home the dinosaur skeletons , discovered by german researchers in tanzania 100 years ago , had to be dismantled and conserved while restoration work costing 18 million euros -lrb- $ 24 million -rrb- was carried out in the 120-year-old museum , which is part of berlin 's humboldt university . each individual piece , from toe to teeth , was covered in a protective layer and reassembled in new steel corsets .
a crane was needed to rebuild the brachiosaurus - a process which took several weeks .
after reconstruction , the creature 's head is not one meter higher than it was before , in accordance with the latest scientific research .
the colossus also stands more upright and is presented as running when seen through the light of the hall 's glass-domed roof .
scoping the jurassic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a crane was needed to rebuild the brachiosaurus in a process taking several weeks positioned close to the skeletons are binoculars or jurascopes , as museum director reinhold leinfelder called them , which enable visitors to see the tendaguru world as if they had actually been there 150 million years ago .
animated films show the dinosaurs smacking their lips and letting out loud roars as they trample through the prehistoric landscape .
though the exhibit makes use of the most up-to-date information , the jurascopes remain an imaginative exercise as experts do n't know what colors the dinosaurs were or how their roars sounded . dw staff / dpa -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he suggested launching a " citizenship campaign " to persuade foreigners to change their nationality .
" we should persuade people who have a right to citizenship to do more than be just residents and to become citizens , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
but edathy 's idea was met with skepticism in the conservative ranks of the german political establishment .
stephan mayer , parliamentary head for the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , questioned whether giving citizenship to foreigners would lead to better integration .
" awarding citizenship can only take place at the end of a successful integration process , certainly not at the beginning , " mayer said .
" the state can not offer citizenship as a concession . "
a sensitive issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners have to give up their previous citizenship to become german the integration issue in germany has been traditionally plagued by the widely divergent positions of the spd and the cdu / csu - now united under the umbrella of merkel 's grand coalition government .
foreigners , who are not married to german citizens , currently obtain the right to apply for german citizenship if they have been legally living in germany for at least eight years , if they can financially support themselves and their families without state aid , if they possess sufficient german language skills , have not been convicted of a crime , and if they avow they will adhere to germany 's basic law and democratic principles .
by adopting german citizenship , foreigners living in germany are also expected to give up any other citizenship they have .
extending local voting rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu citizens can participate in local elections wherever in the bloc they live edathy also said germany should provide some foreigners with a right to vote in local elections .
" it is key that we improve migrants ' political participation by a right to vote in municipal election for foreigners who have lived in germany for a long time , " he said .
while federal and state elections are open only to a country 's citizens , the european union law opened municipal elections across the 27-member bloc to all eu citizens who are local residents , even if they are not citizens of the country where they live .
" i do n't think much of extending the right to vote because it does n't contribute to integration , " bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein told deutschlandfunk radio on friday .
" integration is a hard task : namely learning the legal system , leaning that you can speak the language and that you fit in to society . "
new ideas after integration summit edathy 's suggestions were not subject to discussion at germany 's second integration summit on thursday , which dealt with proposals from six working groups on how to improve the integration of immigrants living in germany .
despite the decision of some turkish groups to boycott the meeting in protest of a recent law placing additional restrictions on some foreigners before they are allowed to move to germany , merkel called the day-long meeting a success and " milestone " for the country 's integration efforts .
representatives of the federal government , the states and some 90 community leaders at the summit adopted a " national integration plan " containing 400 promises for improvements - ranging from aid for ethnic sports clubs to making more german-language classes available . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
nord stream bosses wo n't know for sure until at least 2010 the german-russian gas pipeline saga continues with a new disputed region causing a rethink over its route .
the nord stream consortium is again forced into finding an alternative direction for its maligned project . when it is finally completed , the planned russian-german natural gas pipeline may have more twists and turns than a bowl of spaghetti .
a spokesman for the nord stream consortium said wednesday that the disputed pipeline would again have to change its route after it was revealed a section had been earmarked for a stretch of water that both poland and denmark claim as an exclusive economic zone .
in april this year , nord stream - owned by russian gas giant gazprom and german firms e.on and basf - had its plans for running a stretch of the pipeline through estonian waters thrown into doubt over fears that it could disturb unexploded munitions and chemical dumps from world war ii .
such dumps have been located in estonian waters , but the maps pinpointing them are very old and intensive research would have to be carried out to avoid the risk of an environmental disaster , said allan gromov of the estonian environment ministry at the time .
this latest obstacle to the 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 750-mile -rrb- pipeline may prove to be more concrete in its disruption .
both denmark and poland claim the ownership of the area and nord stream is reluctant to get involved with any dispute .
pipeline consortium resorts to plan b ... or c bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nord stream has had to adapt its plans after complaints now accustomed to the need to redirect the pipeline when opposition arises , nord stream said that it already has an alternative route that it proposes to take to avoid the disputed territory .
the consortium would attempt to squeeze the pipeline between the danish island of bornholm and sweden 's southeastern coast ; although nord stream stated that no final decision had been made .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since it was first proposed in 2005 .
several coastal nations have expressed concern over the pipeline which is to deliver natural gas from russia to germany , saying it will damage the baltic sea 's delicate ecosystem .
the finnish government recently asked that the pipeline be routed outside finnish waters in order to protect the environment while sweden in particular has complained that the pipeline could disrupt the baltic sea ’ s sensitive flora and fauna .
study hopes to alleviate environmental fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns over the pipeline 's route out at sea in accordance with the european union rules , nord stream is required to furnish an environmental impact assessment -lrb- eia -rrb- to those countries whose territorial waters would be affected .
the consortium is expected to do so later this year .
" nord stream has decided to launch additional studies to investigate areas where the route of the pipeline through the baltic sea can be further optimized in a reasonable way to minimize environmental impacts , " the consortium said in a statement earlier this year . the pipeline has also created political opposition .
if completed , it would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients .
in-between nations concerned at duopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-chancellor schröder co-developed the project the ukrainian gas crisis heightened fears that moscow would be willing to use its energy resources to exert political pressure in any disputes with its former satellites .
the fact that the project was negotiated by russia and germany without consulting the countries between them has also created great ill-will in former soviet satellites such as poland and the baltics .
the recent heightening of political tensions between russia and estonia has also left many estonian politicians skeptical of russia 's goodwill .
if completed by 2010 as planned , the 1,200-kilometer pipeline would pump 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year from vyborg , russia to greifswald in northern germany .
in a second phase , a parallel pipeline would double that transport capacity , and nord stream estimates that will meet about 25 percent of the additional gas needs of the european union . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

lucentis is being made available by only a few local health boards in wales while clinical guidelines are prepared .
the national institute for clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- has recommended it for limited use only in patients at risk of losing sight in both eyes .
the assembly government has voiced its concerns , and said denying the drug created more problems than it solved .
nice published the initial guidelines in june , stating that lucentis should be given only to a small number of patients who had already lost sight in one eye and suffered from a specific form of wet age-related macular degeneration -lrb- wet amd -rrb- .
this meant that funding for the drug , which comes at a cost of at least £ 20,000 per patient , could be granted to only one in five patients .
doctors have said the drug can mean the difference between keeping sight and blindness for patients with wet amd .
the condition is the leading cause of sight loss in the uk , affecting about 250,000 people .
there are 26,000 new cases each year .
if i lose my sight then i 'll get put on to the social services - they will have to spend their money on me mervyn meredith consultant ophthalmologist chris blyth said the drug stabilised vision for about 75 % of his patients and a third had " significant improvements " in their vision .
" it can mean the difference between carrying on working and giving up your job , and recognising your grandchildren , " he said .
according to the royal national institute of blind people , there are several patients in the swansea area who have been refused funding for lucentis .
one , mervyn meredith , lost sight in his left eye , then in may noticed it was starting to go in his right eye .
he was told about lucentis , but that he would not be funded for it .
" i am going to go blind and it is rapidly getting worse and worse , " said mr meredith .
" if i lose my sight then i 'll get put on to the social services - they will have to spend their money on me . "
concerns research by bbc wales showed that most health boards were using the nice draft guidance or accepting patients only on an individual basis .
many in north and west wales are not being offered lucentis at all .
full guidance on the drug is set to come in the autumn .
the assembly government has written to nice expressing its concerns over limiting access .
an assembly government letter to nice said the " psychological impact of depriving a potential patient of sight preserving therapy does not appear to be explicitly valued " in the current interim guidance .
lucentis , and another drug which treats wet amd called macugen , have both been made widely available in scotland .

a pakistani contingent was accused of selling gold and guns between 2005 and 2006 to congolese militia groups they were meant to disarm .
the investigation , which began in early 2006 , found no evidence of gun-running .
pakistani officials have previously denied all the accusations , describing the allegations as " baseless " .
in may the un said it would seek to discipline anyone who had compromised peacekeeping in dr congo by trafficking in gold or guns .
now the head of un peacekeeping , jean-marie guehenno , has told the bbc : " the investigation has found no evidence of gun smuggling but it has identified an individual who seems to have facilitated gold smuggling .
" we have shared the report with the concerned troop contributor and i 'm confident they will take the required action .
this issue is closed . "
' overstretched ' this is the latest in a series of scandals involving un peacekeepers .
mr guehenno said he thought un peacekeeping was overstretched , with 100,000 peacekeepers in the field but a support staff of just 1,000 at headquarters . "
i was there in the shop .
i saw it with my own eyes " liki likambo miners ' association head troops ' traded gold for guns ' that was a factor in continuing problems with discipline , he added .
the bbc 's un correspondent , laura trevelyan , says that although the un can send misbehaving peacekeepers home , the countries that provide the troops are responsible for their conduct .
the pakistani battalion at the centre of the claims was based in and around the mining town of mongbwalu , in the north-east of the country , in 2005 .
they helped bring peace to an area that had previously seen bitter fighting between the lendu and hema ethnic groups .
but witnesses said pakistani officers had also supplied weapons to notorious militia commanders in return for gold .
as the trade developed , the officers brought in the congolese army and then indian traders from kenya .
the un began a major investigation after being alerted by human rights watch in late 2005 .

a pakistani contingent was accused of selling gold and guns between 2005 and 2006 to congolese militia groups they were meant to disarm .
the investigation , which began in early 2006 , found no evidence of gun-running .
pakistani officials have previously denied all the accusations , describing the allegations as " baseless " .
in may the un said it would seek to discipline anyone who had compromised peacekeeping in dr congo by trafficking in gold or guns .
now the head of un peacekeeping , jean-marie guehenno , has told the bbc : " the investigation has found no evidence of gun smuggling but it has identified an individual who seems to have facilitated gold smuggling .
" we have shared the report with the concerned troop contributor and i 'm confident they will take the required action .
this issue is closed . "
' overstretched ' this is the latest in a series of scandals involving un peacekeepers .
mr guehenno said he thought un peacekeeping was overstretched , with 100,000 peacekeepers in the field but a support staff of just 1,000 at headquarters .
i was there in the shop .
i saw it with my own eyes liki likambo miners ' association head troops ' traded gold for guns ' that was a factor in continuing problems with discipline , he added .
the bbc 's un correspondent , laura trevelyan , says that although the un can send misbehaving peacekeepers home , the countries that provide the troops are responsible for their conduct .
the pakistani battalion at the centre of the claims was based in and around the mining town of mongbwalu , in the north-east of the country , in 2005 .
they helped bring peace to an area that had previously seen bitter fighting between the lendu and hema ethnic groups .
but witnesses said pakistani officers had also supplied weapons to notorious militia commanders in return for gold .
as the trade developed , the officers brought in the congolese army and then indian traders from kenya .
the un began a major investigation after being alerted by human rights watch in late 2005 .
a un official connected with the inquiry has previously told the bbc there seemed to have been a plan to bury the results , in order to avoid alienating pakistan - the largest contributor of troops to the un .

this means that more resources will be available to manage conservation work at the dinefwr estate , near llandeilo .
the estate 's lichen and insect populations are described as exceptional with more than 160 lichen and 400 beetle species recorded .
it is the first time any welsh parkland has been given the nnr designation .
the parklands , which are already a site of special scientific interest -lrb- sssi -rrb- , are also well known for their ancient trees .
some of the oaks are about 700 years old and many are left to die slowly as the dead wood is a rich habitat for many insects .
iwan huws from the national trust in wales , which co-runs the dinefwr estate with the wildlife trust , said the large numbers of these old trees reflected that they had probably been managed for at least 500 years .
it is a living testimony to one aspect of wales 's rich cultural and historical past john lloyd jones , countryside council for wales the recently expanded herd of white park cattle also linked the estate back to the native welsh rulers of medieval times , he said .
they were once used as payments in 10th century wales to the welsh princes and are now used to help manage the parkland 's wildlife interests .
the history of the estate stretches back to the iron age .
a recent survey of the land found an iron age promontory fort and two overlying roman forts .
dinefwr 's castle was once the residence and power base of the princes of the ancient kingdom of deheubarth from the 10th century .
conservation projects are already underway to restore the estate 's 18th century-designed landscape to its former glory .
these have been funded by the european union 's objective one programme , the heritage lottery fund and a private legacy left to the national trust .
cattle like these were once used as payments to welsh princes traditional styles are replacing modern fencing , historic walls are being repaired and plantations of poplars and conifers are being replaced by thousands of young oak trees .
major improvements to newton house , the centrepiece of the landscape design , have been undertaken , as well as the creation of new paths and information for visitors .
john lloyd jones , chairman of the countryside council for wales , which designates the nnr statuses , said the dinefwr estate 's new status reflected its " outstanding " natural features .
" a visit to dinefwr today is far more than an opportunity to enjoy nature at its best - thanks to the restoration work , it is a living testimony to one aspect of wales 's rich cultural and historical past , " he said .
the nnr is the highest designation awarded to areas of exceptional wildlife and conservation importance .

the 36-year-old 's impressive operatic voice went on to land him a £ 1m recording contract , an extensive tour and a stellar rise from anonymity to becoming a household name .
the imminent prospect of releasing a debut album in 15 countries - including the us - is leaving potts characteristically unassuming .
" it 's a completely new experience for me , but it 's just another job .
it 's a real privilege to make my hobby into a career , though , " explains the tenor , who began exploring his vocal talents in 1999 .
" if someone had told me i 'd be recording an album in the space of the week , i 'd have said ' do n't be so silly ! '

the singer says that cowell , who was one of his staunchest supporters during the show , has been in touch since signing him to his record label .
" he phoned me and told me he 's very happy with the album and aware that i worked very hard on it .
it was nice to get his supportive call . "

bristol-born potts rallied the public and britain 's got talent judges to his cause by seeming to be nervous before his auditions - and is now faced with the prospect of playing 20 sizeable venues across the uk .

but as a recent expedition to try and do just this has shown , the reality can be very different .
in april , a greenlandic-danish team of researchers set out to attach satellite tags to some of west greenland 's walruses so they could follow the animals during their migration .
they wanted to uncover the arctic animals ' secret summer location , as well as to find out how factors such as hunting , climate change and oil exploration were affecting their movements .
but over the last few months , the walrus tagging experiment has highlighted some of the highs and lows that wildlife biologists face in their endeavours .
" working with animals - particularly walruses - in the arctic is tough and you have to get used to disappointment , " says erik born , lead scientist on the walrus tagging project and a biologist at the greenland institute of natural resources .
" even getting to the animals can be a problem .
walruses are unpredictable , but the greatest challenge can be the weather and the ice - it can change so much from year-to-year and day-to-day . "
not a whisker while the recent satellite tagging mission , although threatened by some extremly cold and icy conditions , was successful in making contact with some of the tusked beasts , it is not unusual to travel out to the arctic and not even encounter a whisker of a walrus .
dr born says : " one year , we were in west greenland trying to find walruses .
we were amongst the ice-packs when the wind suddenly changed and we got stuck in the ice .
" we sat there for two weeks until the wind changed back , by which time we had to return back to port . "
even if you do manage to brave the tough environment and find some walruses , deploying a matchbox-sized satellite tag with a crossbow or co2-powered gun on to an animal that is the size and weight of a car is n't as easy as it sounds .
walruses are lumbering on land but they become infinitely more graceful - and evasive - once they hit the water .
with great skill and precision eight satellite tags were successfully attached to walruses ' hides during the recent expedition .
but it was also easy to see how a transmitter , which costs hundreds of pounds , could be lost in a split second to the sea by a rogue gust of wind or a slightly off-target shot , as happened with two other tags .
at this point , when your walruses are equipped with their new transmitting accessories , you would imagine all of the difficulties have been dealt with .
but , as dr born points out , these research projects can be hit with yet more complications .
a quick look at the bbc news website 's walrus watch map reveals how short-lived the signalling power of some tags can be - two of the tags attached to a mother and son failed to signal at all , probably because the electronics broke on impact with the walruses .
" each time you go out in the field , you refine the tags so they are likely to stay on as long as possible , " says dr born .
but , he says , despite tag improvements , it is still possible for the antenna and tag to be crushed under the weight of the walrus or scraped off by the ice .
even if the tags are working , the arctic elements can yet again cause more problems .
for walruses to begin their migration , the thick ice that they love sleeping and resting on needs to begin to retreat .
dr born explains : " because the tags do not stay on for long , we have a very short window for detecting walrus migration .
" this year there was a lot of very thick ice and it was very disappointing to see most of the tags stop working before the walruses had really begun to move . "
on the move but while six of the deployed tags only revealed local - although still important - information on walrus movement , two tags told another story , and seeing results emerge out of the raft of uncertainties is incredibly rewarding , says dr born .
in particular , one tagged walrus - a 10-to-12-year-old female who has a calf in tow - has been of much interest to the researchers .
her tag , which after almost three months is still beaming up signals to the overhead argos satellite system , has shown that she has recently travelled hundred of kilometres to the south west of baffin island , where it appears she has settled for the summer .
last walrus keeps on move " it is very satisfying when you get a result like this , " explains dr born , " and we will keep on watching the tag while it is still signalling to see where it goes . "
and although the migration path of just one walrus might not necessarily apply to the rest of the population , it does give the team a starting point for more research .
the trick will be , says dr born , to go out again with more tags and put them on more walruses in the following years - and to prepare yourself for the inevitable disappointments that will be scattered amongst the successes .
" with walruses , and with other arctic marine mammals , there is always some sort risk , " he says .
" but while you could sit there getting grumpy about it , you need to think of the wonderful place you are working , the wonderful people you are working with - and you have to remember that if the animals were straightforward to study , you would n't be out there doing it in the first place . "

for walruses to begin their migration , the thick ice that they love sleeping and resting on needs to begin to retreat .
dr born explains : " because the tags do not stay on for long , we have a very short window for detecting walrus migration .
" this year there was a lot of very thick ice and it was very disappointing to see most of the tags stop working before the walruses had really begun to move . "
on the move but while six of the deployed tags only revealed local - although still important - information on walrus movement , two tags told another story , and seeing results emerge out of the raft of uncertainties is incredibly rewarding , says dr born .
in particular , one tagged walrus - a 10-to-12-year-old female who has a calf in tow - has been of much interest to the researchers .
her tag , which after almost three months is still beaming up signals to the overhead argos satellite system , has shown that she has recently travelled hundred of kilometres to the south west of baffin island , where it appears she has settled for the summer .
last walrus keeps on move " it is very satisfying when you get a result like this , " explains dr born , " and we will keep on watching the tag while it is still signalling to see where it goes . "
and although the migration path of just one walrus might not necessarily apply to the rest of the population , it does give the team a starting point for more research .
the trick will be , says dr born , to go out again with more tags and put them on more walruses in the following years - and to prepare yourself for the inevitable disappointments that will be scattered amongst the successes .
" with walruses , and with other arctic marine mammals , there is always some sort risk , " he says .
" but while you could sit there getting grumpy about it , you need to think of the wonderful place you are working , the wonderful people you are working with - and you have to remember that if the animals were straightforward to study , you would n't be out there doing it in the first place . "

but as a recent expedition to try and do just this has shown , the reality can be very different .
in april , a greenlandic-danish team of researchers set out to attach satellite tags to some of west greenland 's walruses so they could follow the animals during their migration .
they wanted to uncover the arctic animals ' secret summer location , as well as to find out how factors such as hunting , climate change and oil exploration were affecting their movements .
walrus meets hunter but over the last few months , the walrus tagging experiment has highlighted some of the highs and lows that wildlife biologists face in their endeavours .
" working with animals - particularly walruses - in the arctic is tough and you have to get used to disappointment , " says erik born , lead scientist on the walrus tagging project and a biologist at the greenland institute of natural resources .
" even getting to the animals can be a problem .
walruses are unpredictable , but the greatest challenge can be the weather and the ice - it can change so much from year-to-year and day-to-day . "
not a whisker while the recent satellite tagging mission , although threatened by some extremly cold and icy conditions , was successful in making contact with some of the tusked beasts , it is not unusual to travel out to the arctic and not even encounter a whisker of a walrus .
getting stuck in ice is a common hazard in greenland dr born says : " one year , we were in west greenland trying to find walruses .
we were amongst the ice-packs when the wind suddenly changed and we got stuck in the ice .
" we sat there for two weeks until the wind changed back , by which time we had to return back to port . "
even if you do manage to brave the tough environment and find some walruses , deploying a matchbox-sized satellite tag with a crossbow or co2-powered gun on to an animal that is the size and weight of a car is n't as easy as it sounds .
it is easy to lose satellite tags walruses are lumbering on land but they become infinitely more graceful - and evasive - once they hit the water .
with great skill and precision eight satellite tags were successfully attached to walruses ' hides during the recent expedition .
but it was also easy to see how a transmitter , which costs hundreds of pounds , could be lost in a split second to the sea by a rogue gust of wind or a slightly off-target shot , as happened with two other tags .
see the migration map at this point , when your walruses are equipped with their new transmitting accessories , you would imagine all of the difficulties have been dealt with .
but , as dr born points out , these research projects can be hit with yet more complications .
a quick look at the bbc news website 's walrus watch map reveals how short-lived the signalling power of some tags can be - two of the tags attached to a mother and son failed to signal at all , probably because the electronics broke on impact with the walruses .
even when the tag is attached , things can still go wrong " each time you go out in the field , you refine the tags so they are likely to stay on as long as possible , " says dr born .

on the move but while six of the deployed tags only revealed local - although still important - information on walrus movement , two tags told another story , and seeing results emerge out of the raft of uncertainties is incredibly rewarding , says dr born .
in particular , one tagged walrus - a 10-to-12-year-old female who has a calf in tow - has been of much interest to the researchers .
her tag , which after almost three months is still beaming up signals to the overhead argos satellite system , has shown that she has recently travelled hundred of kilometres to the south west of baffin island , where it appears she has settled for the summer .
last walrus keeps on move " it is very satisfying when you get a result like this , " explains dr born , " and we will keep on watching the tag while it is still signalling to see where it goes . "
and although the migration path of just one walrus might not necessarily apply to the rest of the population , it does give the team a starting point for more research .
the trick will be , says dr born , to go out again with more tags and put them on more walruses in the following years - and to prepare yourself for the inevitable disappointments that will be scattered amongst the successes .
" with walruses , and with other arctic marine mammals , there is always some sort risk , " he says .
" but while you could sit there getting grumpy about it , you need to think of the wonderful place you are working , the wonderful people you are working with - and you have to remember that if the animals were straightforward to study , you would n't be out there doing it in the first place . "

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- continuing care ' lottery ' in nhs bbc news / health graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- health contents : medical notes friday , 13 july 2007 , 08:52 gmt 09:52 uk continuing care ' lottery ' in nhs huge variations in access to continuing care on the nhs are " unjustifiable " , a leading charity has warned .
age concern said government figures showed people in some areas of england are 160 times more likely to get continuing care than others .
the postcode lottery faced by those needing care was due to differences in local criteria for who was eligible .
but a national framework to be launched in october should increase access for thousands , the government said .
continuing health care - where the nhs is responsible for , and fully funds care outside of hospital when a person no longer needs acute inpatient care - mainly affects very ill patients in nursing homes . "
there can be no justification for such huge variations in access to care " gordon lishman , age concern it is hoped the framework , unveiled in june , will standardise decisions on who is eligible , making the process faster , fairer and more simple to understand .
age concern welcomed the measures , which they estimated would increase the numbers of people receiving continuing care by about 7,000 - at a cost of £ 220 million .
but they warned around 60,000 people would still be missing out on the continuing care they are legally entitled to .
and they stressed that the framework would not cover social or personal care , which includes help with washing , feeding and dressing .
care lottery figures obtained by the charity from the department of health show that the number of people receiving continuing care vary dramatically around the country .
in march this year derby city pct was giving just seven people continuing care , a rate of 0.26 people per 10,000 .
by comparison , harrow pct was giving 826 people continuing care - a rate of 41.75 per 10,000 people .
this is despite harrow having 75,000 fewer people and a younger population .
gordon lishman , director general of age concern , said they were fearful that the new framework alone would not result in the cultural change in pcts needed to reduce the variation .
" these new figures beggar belief .
" individuals face a postcode lottery in getting nhs continuing care .
" there can be no justification for such huge variations in access to care . "
he said the framework needed to be monitored carefully to assess its impact in stamping out the " unfair practice " .
care services minister , ivan lewis said : " we are aware of the variation which is exactly why we published the national framework for nhs continuing healthcare only two weeks ago .
" the new framework will help ensure that all the people who are eligible for nhs continuing healthcare or nhs-funded nursing care will receive the care they need . "
he added they would be monitoring the situation closely to make sure that individuals are not missing out .

age concern said government figures showed people in some areas of england are 160 times more likely to get continuing care than others .
the postcode lottery faced by those needing care was due to differences in local criteria for who was eligible .
but a national framework to be launched in october should increase access for thousands , the government said .
continuing health care - where the nhs is responsible for , and fully funds care outside of hospital when a person no longer needs acute inpatient care - mainly affects very ill patients in nursing homes .
there can be no justification for such huge variations in access to care gordon lishman , age concern it is hoped the framework , unveiled in june , will standardise decisions on who is eligible , making the process faster , fairer and more simple to understand .
age concern welcomed the measures , which they estimated would increase the numbers of people receiving continuing care by about 7,000 - at a cost of £ 220 million .
but they warned around 60,000 people would still be missing out on the continuing care they are legally entitled to .
and they stressed that the framework would not cover social or personal care , which includes help with washing , feeding and dressing .
care lottery figures obtained by the charity from the department of health show that the number of people receiving continuing care vary dramatically around the country .
in march this year derby city pct was giving just seven people continuing care , a rate of 0.26 people per 10,000 .
by comparison , harrow pct was giving 826 people continuing care - a rate of 41.75 per 10,000 people .
this is despite harrow having 75,000 fewer people and a younger population .
gordon lishman , director general of age concern , said they were fearful that the new framework alone would not result in the cultural change in pcts needed to reduce the variation .
" these new figures beggar belief .
" individuals face a postcode lottery in getting nhs continuing care .
" there can be no justification for such huge variations in access to care . "
he said the framework needed to be monitored carefully to assess its impact in stamping out the " unfair practice " .
care services minister , ivan lewis said : " we are aware of the variation which is exactly why we published the national framework for nhs continuing healthcare only two weeks ago .
" the new framework will help ensure that all the people who are eligible for nhs continuing healthcare or nhs-funded nursing care will receive the care they need . "
he added they would be monitoring the situation closely to make sure that individuals are not missing out .

the guard had been ordered by a spanish judge to seize the vessel as soon as it left the british colony of gibraltar .
gibraltar officials and odyssey marine exploration , which owns the ship , said spain had boarded the ship illegally as it was in international waters .
in may , odyssey said it had found $ 500m -lrb- £ 253m -rrb- in coins from a 17th century wreck somewhere in the atlantic ocean .
madrid suspects the sunken galleon may either have been spanish or have gone down in spanish waters .
the salvaged booty , which included half a million silver coins and hundreds of gold objects , has already been flown back to the us .

a lawyer for odyssey , allen von spiegelfeld , told reuters news agency that spain had not sought permission to board ocean alert from officials in panama , where it is registered .
" the owners of the vessel have contacted the panamanian maritime authorities protesting the seizure on international waters , " mr von spiegelfeld said .

odyssey has kept the location of its find secret , citing security and legal reasons .
