" opening the internal market for defense products will improve the competitiveness of the technological and industrial base of the european defense sector , " commission vice president günter verheugen said in a statement .
verheugen also stressed that he saw the move as " fundamental to establishing europe 's autonomy in this field . "
with the eu lagging far behind the us in defense spending , he said that public opposition to increasing expenditure in this sector meant that the eu had to spend more efficiently .
defense is the exclusive domain of the bloc 's 27 member states .
but verheugen said the policy came under the eu 's single market powers , and was not a defense policy per se .
stopping countries avoiding competition law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen stressed the importance of self-sufficiency the proposals tabled by the commission are designed to discourage countries from using a national defense clause to buy military and spare parts and avoid eu procurement rules .
they would not impact on the purchase of arms , munitions and war materials or other sensitive non-military procurements in areas such as counter-terrorism . the initiative is also intended to co-ordinate different national procurement rules , which have proved a major hurdle .
verheugen , who is also industry commissioner , said the complex mix of national legislation and controls on the transfer of defense equipment currently in place had even helped encourage the mass use of the exemption .
" if you just want a spare tyre , for example , for a defense vehicle , you 've got to go through the same authorization procedure as if you were selling a gun outside the european union , " he explained .
he said the new measures would apply " perhaps not to the whole tank but for example the spare tyre .
not to a mortar or motor for a fighter plane , but for components or spare parts . "
measures to boost transparency and cut red tape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal relates to spares rather than whole tanks internal market and services commissioner charlie mccreevy said : " introducing transparent and competitive procurement rules applicable throughout the eu is crucial for the establishment of a common defense market .
this will lead to greater openness of defense markets between member states to the benefit of all : armed forces , taxpayers and industries . "
he said the commission would have the same powers to fine non-compliant member states as in other areas of eu policy .
the european defense agency , formed in 2004 to help eu member nations improve their military capabilities , welcomed the commission 's plans , even though its own attempts to achieve similar results have borne little fruit .
" the european market for tanks does not operate in the same way as the market for washing machines , " said new eda chief executive alexander weis .
europe 's defense industry accounts for around 30 percent of world production and has more than 300 000 employees , according to commission figures . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these include improving insulation in private homes , stricter standards for both new buildings and refurbishment projects , as well as a targeted sponsorship of renewable heating energy , which all are measures which can help cut millions of tones of greenhouse gases at the same time as reducing budgets for gas , oil and electricity .
the promotion of energy obtained from wind , sun and biomass with the help of cogeneration is designed to secure and stabilize germany 's boom in renewable energy - laying a blueprint for successful climate protection measures .
even so , they wo n't be enough to meet the government 's target of cutting carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2020 .
environment minister sigmar gabriel expects the figure to be closer to 36 percent at most .
that extra 4 percent needs to come from somewhere .
a little bit more courage on berlin 's part in standing up to the industrial lobby is all it needs .
take transport .
introducing a speed limit on freeways could help cut carbon emissions .
but the government has little desire to face off with the car lobby .
take energy production .
the energy companies are allowed to continue building coal-fired power plants .
they might be more efficient than their predecessors , but they will cause serious environmental damage . the government 's climate protection package is ambitious but flawed - the coalition 's excuse is that it has to take too many factors in to consideration .
nonetheless , germany has nothing to be ashamed of at the un climate change conference in bali .
other countries have failed miserably to come up with similarly concrete plans on curbing carbon emissions in the areas of energy production , households , industry and transport . germany is clearly trying to do its bit for the polar bears in the artic .
but their fate is still on thin ice .
other industrialized nations will have to start following germany 's example , and berlin itself also has a long way to go before it 's really pulled out all stops .

these include improving insulation in private homes , stricter standards for both new buildings and refurbishment projects , as well as a targeted sponsorship of renewable heating energy , which all are measures which can help cut millions of tones of greenhouse gases at the same time as reducing budgets for gas , oil and electricity .
the promotion of energy obtained from wind , sun and biomass with the help of cogeneration is designed to secure and stabilize germany 's boom in renewable energy - laying a blueprint for successful climate protection measures .
even so , they wo n't be enough to meet the government 's target of cutting carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2020 .
environment minister sigmar gabriel expects the figure to be closer to 36 percent at most .
that extra 4 percent needs to come from somewhere .
a little bit more courage on berlin 's part in standing up to the industrial lobby is all it needs .
take transport .
introducing a speed limit on freeways could help cut carbon emissions .
but the government has little desire to face off with the car lobby .
take energy production .
the energy companies are allowed to continue building coal-fired power plants .
they might be more efficient than their predecessors , but they will cause serious environmental damage . the government 's climate protection package is ambitious but flawed - the coalition 's excuse is that it has to take too many factors in to consideration .
nonetheless , germany has nothing to be ashamed of at the un climate change conference in bali .
other countries have failed miserably to come up with similarly concrete plans on curbing carbon emissions in the areas of energy production , households , industry and transport . germany is clearly trying to do its bit for the polar bears in the artic .
but their fate is still on thin ice .
other industrialized nations will have to start following germany 's example , and berlin itself also has a long way to go before it 's really pulled out all stops .

but the need to attract skilled foreign workers was widely acknowledged . wolfgang schäuble implicitly criticized frattini 's plans for a blue card by insisting that immigration should remain a competence of individual member states .
eu commission vice-president franco frattini said there had been a " broad consensus " on the benefits of granting work and residency permits to third-country professionals , given labor shortages and europe 's graying population .
and the justice , interior , employment and social policy ministers also agreed with the eu executive on the necessity of cracking down on undeclared workers , many of them exploited illegal immigrants .
portugal , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the so-called " jumbo council " aimed to produce a wide-ranging debate on this highly sensitive issue .
differing national priorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan aims to help reduce the number of illegal migrants and ministers also stressed different priorities and expressed diverging views on the issue .
mediterranean countries such as italy , spain and greece , for instance , emphasized the need to stop thousands of illegal migrants from north africa and asia .
while the czech republic and bulgaria said their workers should be given priority .
frattini has proposed increasing the eu 's attractivity to third- country professionals by offering them similar benefits to those currently enjoyed by their european colleagues .
candidates would be able to apply for a single work and residency permit , valid for a minimum of two years and renewable , and accepted throughout the union .
under the proposal , foreign white-collar workers would also be allowed to be joined by their families in their new country of residency .
germany 's main concern is that the eu might eventually impose quotas on the number of immigrants who can enter individual member states , an eventuality strongly denied by frattini .
" it is not up to brussels to decide how many engineers from third countries are necessary for germany or austria , " frattini said .
observers in brussels said germany could eventually decide not to adopt the blue card , rather than block the project altogether .
the dutch also voiced doubts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration commissioner frattini with commission president barroso the netherlands also expressed reservations over the proposal while austria called for further " clarifications " in the field of social security and minimum wages , saying it already offered higher levels .
britain , which has opted out of eu immigration policies altogether , outlined to ministers its alternative plan for a points- based system .
devised along the lines of a similar system in place in australia , it aims to ensure that only those migrants meeting the needs of the country would be allowed to enter and work .
the british proposal nevertheless reflects a more general shift towards a " pick and choose " approach to migration that is likely to adversely affect the future of lower-skilled third-country nationals seeking a better life in europe .
some 2 million third-country nationals enter the bloc each year , according to eu estimates , and there is little evidence to suggest this figure will drop significantly in the foreseeable future .
the inflow has been at times poorly managed fuelling growing resentment among ordinary citizens , opposition from nationalist parties and calls for stricter controls by government officials . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government of kosovo , which is still formally a part of serbia has been a united nations protectorate since 1999 , has already said they will unilaterally declare independence from serbia .
alliance ministers are expected to announce a continued commitment to keep nato 's 16,000-strong kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo , if this happens . but slovakia , romania , spain and greece have expressed their misgivings to these plans .

in 1999 , a nato bombing campaign stopped serbia 's ethnic cleansing of kosovo , whose 2.2 million people are 90 per cent ethnic albanian .
in recent weeks , alliance commanders have been busy drawing up contingency plans should the situation degenerate once independence is proclaimed .
thousands of extra troops are being held in reserve in case reinforcements are needed quickly .

meanwhile , the us is continuing with its project to set up an anti-iran missile defence shield in central europe , one of the reasons russia gave for suspending the cfe .
russia a factor in all three issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has told the kremlin that us plans pose no threat to russia nato officials insist that the three sticky issues on this week 's agenda should be dealt with separately .
but russia features in all of them .
the meeting , which begins with a dinner on thursday evening attended by eu and nato ministers , will offer an opportunity for officials to discuss us plans to locate missile defence bases in poland and the czech republic .
the plan has divided opinion across europe .
that issue , too , will be discussed during friday 's nato-russia council meeting , which is to be attended by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .
would-be nato members croatia , albania and macedonia are set to be informed that despite making great progress on reforms , they must do more if they are to be invited into the alliance at a summit in bucharest in april 2008 , diplomats said . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these include improving insulation in private homes , stricter standards for both new buildings and refurbishment projects , as well as a targeted sponsorship of renewable heating energy , which all are measures which can help cut millions of tones of greenhouse gases at the same time as reducing budgets for gas , oil and electricity .
the promotion of energy obtained from wind , sun and biomass with the help of cogeneration is designed to secure and stabilize germany 's boom in renewable energy - laying a blueprint for successful climate protection measures .
even so , they wo n't be enough to meet the government 's target of cutting carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2020 .
environment minister sigmar gabriel expects the figure to be closer to 36 percent at most .
that extra 4 percent needs to come from somewhere .
a little bit more courage on berlin 's part in standing up to the industrial lobby is all it needs .
take transport .
introducing a speed limit on freeways could help cut carbon emissions .
but the government has little desire to face off with the car lobby .
take energy production .
the energy companies are allowed to continue building coal-fired power plants .
they might be more efficient than their predecessors , but they will cause serious environmental damage . the government 's climate protection package is ambitious but flawed - the coalition 's excuse is that it has to take too many factors in to consideration .
nonetheless , germany has nothing to be ashamed of at the un climate change conference in bali .
other countries have failed miserably to come up with similarly concrete plans on curbing carbon emissions in the areas of energy production , households , industry and transport . germany is clearly trying to do its bit for the polar bears in the artic .
but their fate is still on thin ice .
other industrialized nations will have to start following germany 's example , and berlin itself also has a long way to go before it 's really pulled out all stops .

" hertha bsc was not infected by national-socialism , " said historian daniel koerfer of berlin 's freie university , who had been hired by the bundesliga club to investigate its past . " there was no resistance against the regime , but also no deeply seated fanatical enthusiasm for the party and its leadership , aside from admiration for hitler until far into the second world war , " koerfer wrote in the 70-page study .
" there was no strongly pronounced anti-semitism either - but there were also no attempts to really take a stand against the state-mandated racist delusion .

" opening the internal market for defense products will improve the competitiveness of the technological and industrial base of the european defense sector , " commission vice president günter verheugen said in a statement .
verheugen also stressed that he saw the move as " fundamental to establishing europe 's autonomy in this field . "
with the eu lagging far behind the us in defense spending , he said that public opposition to increasing expenditure in this sector meant that the eu had to spend more efficiently .
defense is the exclusive domain of the bloc 's 27 member states .
but verheugen said the policy came under the eu 's single market powers , and was not a defense policy per se .
stopping countries avoiding competition law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen stressed the importance of self-sufficiency the proposals tabled by the commission are designed to discourage countries from using a national defense clause to buy military and spare parts and avoid eu procurement rules .
they would not impact on the purchase of arms , munitions and war materials or other sensitive non-military procurements in areas such as counter-terrorism . the initiative is also intended to co-ordinate different national procurement rules , which have proved a major hurdle .
verheugen , who is also industry commissioner , said the complex mix of national legislation and controls on the transfer of defense equipment currently in place had even helped encourage the mass use of the exemption .
" if you just want a spare tyre , for example , for a defense vehicle , you 've got to go through the same authorization procedure as if you were selling a gun outside the european union , " he explained .
he said the new measures would apply " perhaps not to the whole tank but for example the spare tyre .
not to a mortar or motor for a fighter plane , but for components or spare parts . "
measures to boost transparency and cut red tape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal relates to spares rather than whole tanks internal market and services commissioner charlie mccreevy said : " introducing transparent and competitive procurement rules applicable throughout the eu is crucial for the establishment of a common defense market .
this will lead to greater openness of defense markets between member states to the benefit of all : armed forces , taxpayers and industries . "
he said the commission would have the same powers to fine non-compliant member states as in other areas of eu policy .
the european defense agency , formed in 2004 to help eu member nations improve their military capabilities , welcomed the commission 's plans , even though its own attempts to achieve similar results have borne little fruit .
" the european market for tanks does not operate in the same way as the market for washing machines , " said new eda chief executive alexander weis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 06.12.2007 germany suspicious about eu blue card plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue card would allow skilled professionals access to the eu labor market the german interior minister has expressed strong reservations about an eu-wide " blue card " at a meeting of ministers in brussels .
but the need to attract skilled foreign workers was widely acknowledged . wolfgang schäuble implicitly criticized frattini 's plans for a blue card by insisting that immigration should remain a competence of individual member states .
eu commission vice-president franco frattini said there had been a " broad consensus " on the benefits of granting work and residency permits to third-country professionals , given labor shortages and europe 's graying population .
and the justice , interior , employment and social policy ministers also agreed with the eu executive on the necessity of cracking down on undeclared workers , many of them exploited illegal immigrants .
portugal , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the so-called " jumbo council " aimed to produce a wide-ranging debate on this highly sensitive issue .
differing national priorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan aims to help reduce the number of illegal migrants and ministers also stressed different priorities and expressed diverging views on the issue .
mediterranean countries such as italy , spain and greece , for instance , emphasized the need to stop thousands of illegal migrants from north africa and asia .
while the czech republic and bulgaria said their workers should be given priority .
frattini has proposed increasing the eu 's attractivity to third- country professionals by offering them similar benefits to those currently enjoyed by their european colleagues .
candidates would be able to apply for a single work and residency permit , valid for a minimum of two years and renewable , and accepted throughout the union .
under the proposal , foreign white-collar workers would also be allowed to be joined by their families in their new country of residency .
germany 's main concern is that the eu might eventually impose quotas on the number of immigrants who can enter individual member states , an eventuality strongly denied by frattini .
" it is not up to brussels to decide how many engineers from third countries are necessary for germany or austria , " frattini said .
observers in brussels said germany could eventually decide not to adopt the blue card , rather than block the project altogether .
the dutch also voiced doubts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration commissioner frattini with commission president barroso the netherlands also expressed reservations over the proposal while austria called for further " clarifications " in the field of social security and minimum wages , saying it already offered higher levels .
britain , which has opted out of eu immigration policies altogether , outlined to ministers its alternative plan for a points- based system .
devised along the lines of a similar system in place in australia , it aims to ensure that only those migrants meeting the needs of the country would be allowed to enter and work .
the british proposal nevertheless reflects a more general shift towards a " pick and choose " approach to migration that is likely to adversely affect the future of lower-skilled third-country nationals seeking a better life in europe .
some 2 million third-country nationals enter the bloc each year , according to eu estimates , and there is little evidence to suggest this figure will drop significantly in the foreseeable future .
the inflow has been at times poorly managed fuelling growing resentment among ordinary citizens , opposition from nationalist parties and calls for stricter controls by government officials . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical music -pipe- 06.12.2007 german ensemble releases cd of lou reed 's loudest album großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reed 's 1975 feedback experiment is back - in classic black the group zeitkratzer has drawn good reviews with a classical version of metal machine music - the 1975 feedback experiment that almost finished lou reed ’ s career . it 's got no beat , and you definitely ca n't dance to it .
lou reed 's metal machine music - a punishing 50 minutes of guitar feedback looped together and sped up to twice its normal speed - was hated by both critics and fans when it was originally released in the mid-70s .
some drew comparisons with a dentist 's drill boring away at an infected tooth , while others dismissed the double album as a bid by reed to get out of his record contract .
but the berlin-based avant-garde ensemble zeitkratzer has given the composition a new lease on life , scoring it for classical instruments and recasting it as a piece of minimalist new music .
the cd-dvd was recorded live with reed in 2002 but only released this autumn due to copyright issues - an ironic twist since rca recalled the original metal machine music from record stores after three weeks and told reed he 'd never make another album .
zeitkratzer 's version has drawn praise from both the high-brow new york times and hip indie-music websites like pitchfork .
group members say listening habits have caught up with reed 's ideas .
“ noise has long established itself as a standard element in rock music , ” ulrich krieger , the former zeitkratzer saxophonist who transcribed reed 's original record , told dw-world .
“ people are accustomed to pop bands who make the charts like jesus and the mary chain or nirvana building up dissonant walls of feedback . ”
come on , feel the noise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writing out the score for brass , strings , piano and percussion was a massive task in an interview before the performance , which took place as part of berlin 's annual “ march music ” festival , reed stressed the corporeal nature of his work .
“ it 's everything i like about rock music , ” reed said , thumping his chest and his thigh .
“ i like to feel music physically , here and down here .
and i 'm a guitarist .
i like electric guitars . ”
the zeitkratzer performance is also physically strenuous .
the brass players go red in the face sustaining what were originally minute-long hums of feedback , and the string section often looks in danger of cardiac arrest as it frenetically saws its way through oscillating patterns of sound .
and the ten-person ensemble faced other challenges performing a piece with no fixed tempo or time signature .
“ we use three exactly synchronized clocks , ” zeitkratzer pianist and leader reinhold friedl told dw-world .
“ everyone can see them .
we know , for instance , that we have to come together for a transition at 7 minutes , 16 seconds .
we exchange glances and then wham ! ”
do n't expect sweet jane bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original 1975 record was a commercial and critical bomb there 's no shortage of whams and blams , screeches and scratches , hums and hoots on the zeitkratzer cd .
the 4 sides of the original record were in fact shortened into 3 movements because reed felt it would be asking too much of the audience to listen to the whole thing .
and friedl cautioned that anyone purchasing the disc expecting anything like usual lou reed would soon be selling it on ebay .
at the same time , the ensemble version takes away some of the incredible harshness of the original and makes it much easier to hear the individual figures within the music .
occasionally , it even sounds sort of melodic .
“ the instrumental sound is much richer , ” friedl said .
“ and of course , it 's something different when you have ten people playing , instead of just two hard-edged guitar feedbacks that have also been pitched up on octave . ”
but is it classical or rock music ?
“ metal machine music is the translation of both the freedom of free improvisation and the sound structures of new music into a rock aesthetic , ” said krieger .
“ for me it combines two different worlds , which were both important twentieth-century cultural movements , but which ran parallel to one another without ever really overlapping .
it 's a kind of a best-of-all-worlds situation . ”
in other words , it 's a very different way for the musically adventurous to take a walk on the wild side .

6 , - 3 days ahead of international corruption day on dec .
9 - revealed some surprisingly pessimistic attitudes . in germany , 69 percent of those questioned said they expected corruption to get worse in the next three years , 77 percent believe the government is failing to tackle corruption effectively .
only britain -lrb- 72 percent -rrb- and the netherlands -lrb- 73 percent -rrb- have a bleaker outlook . bulgaria -lrb- 32 percent -rrb- and romania -lrb- 36 percent -rrb- were confident that corruption can be dealt with .
both countries , however , have been chastised by the european union in the past for not doing enough to combat corruption . an overall global average of 54 percent of people said they believed corruption would get worse , compared to 43 percent four years ago .
only one in three were convinced that anti-corruption measures actually work . dirty politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no stranger to scandal germany 's gloomy predictions for the future problems could be a result of grand corruption cases and a perceived lack of political commitment to do something about them . this low public faith in government efforts to clamp down on corruption reflects a broad unease triggered by corporate corruption scandals - such as the volkswagen and siemens cases in germany . but it 's not just germany .
the watchdog asks respondents across the globe which institutions they see as most affected by corruption .
like most years , the institutions entrusted to represent the public interest in political decision-making are seen as the dirtiest . " our experience has shown that it is commitment at the top that will make or break efforts to fight corruption , " said cobus de swardt , transparency international 's managing director .
" these troubling numbers show that government faces a crisis of legitimacy , with the potential to undermine democratization , stability and the protection of human rights . " petty bribery rampant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albania has among the world 's highest levels of petty bribery but ultimately , poor families are the hardest hit by demands for bribes in developed as well as developing countries . globally , the police are the institution most frequently reported to demand bribes , but medical services also stand out as a common source of bribery demands in europe .
in latin america , asia-pacific and north america , petty bribery in the judiciary is a serious problem . " the police and the judiciary in many countries around the world are part of a cycle of corruption , demanding bribes from citizens , " de swardt said in a statement .
" this troubling finding means that corruption is interfering with the basic right to equal treatment before the law . " petty bribery is at its most widespread in albania and senegal , where 30 percent of respondents said they had been required to pay bribes to various authorities for access to services .
other countries with similarly high levels include cambodia , cameroon , macedonia , nigeria , pakistan , the philippines and romania . " this year 's global corruption barometer has made it clear that too often , people must part with their hard-earned money to pay for services that should be free , " said transparency international chair huguette labelle .
" and they do not see enough commitment when they look to their governments and leaders . " we are heartened though , that the public is increasingly demanding the accountability of the very institutions that most affect their lives , as this is a powerful driver of change , " she added . between june and september , gallup international on behalf of ti quizzed 63,000 people in 60 countries on their attitudes toward and experience of corruption . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical music -pipe- 06.12.2007 german ensemble releases cd of lou reed 's loudest album großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reed 's 1975 feedback experiment is back - in classic black the group zeitkratzer has drawn good reviews with a classical version of metal machine music - the 1975 feedback experiment that almost finished lou reed ’ s career . it 's got no beat , and you definitely ca n't dance to it .
lou reed 's metal machine music - a punishing 50 minutes of guitar feedback looped together and sped up to twice its normal speed - was hated by both critics and fans when it was originally released in the mid-70s .
some drew comparisons with a dentist 's drill boring away at an infected tooth , while others dismissed the double album as a bid by reed to get out of his record contract .
but the berlin-based avant-garde ensemble zeitkratzer has given the composition a new lease on life , scoring it for classical instruments and recasting it as a piece of minimalist new music .
the cd-dvd was recorded live with reed in 2002 but only released this autumn due to copyright issues - an ironic twist since rca recalled the original metal machine music from record stores after three weeks and told reed he 'd never make another album .
zeitkratzer 's version has drawn praise from both the high-brow new york times and hip indie-music websites like pitchfork .
group members say listening habits have caught up with reed 's ideas .
“ noise has long established itself as a standard element in rock music , ” ulrich krieger , the former zeitkratzer saxophonist who transcribed reed 's original record , told dw-world .
“ people are accustomed to pop bands who make the charts like jesus and the mary chain or nirvana building up dissonant walls of feedback . ”
come on , feel the noise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writing out the score for brass , strings , piano and percussion was a massive task in an interview before the performance , which took place as part of berlin 's annual “ march music ” festival , reed stressed the corporeal nature of his work .
“ it 's everything i like about rock music , ” reed said , thumping his chest and his thigh .
“ i like to feel music physically , here and down here .
and i 'm a guitarist .
i like electric guitars . ”
the zeitkratzer performance is also physically strenuous .
the brass players go red in the face sustaining what were originally minute-long hums of feedback , and the string section often looks in danger of cardiac arrest as it frenetically saws its way through oscillating patterns of sound .
and the ten-person ensemble faced other challenges performing a piece with no fixed tempo or time signature .
“ we use three exactly synchronized clocks , ” zeitkratzer pianist and leader reinhold friedl told dw-world .
“ everyone can see them .
we know , for instance , that we have to come together for a transition at 7 minutes , 16 seconds .
we exchange glances and then wham ! ”
do n't expect sweet jane bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original 1975 record was a commercial and critical bomb there 's no shortage of whams and blams , screeches and scratches , hums and hoots on the zeitkratzer cd .
the 4 sides of the original record were in fact shortened into 3 movements because reed felt it would be asking too much of the audience to listen to the whole thing .
and friedl cautioned that anyone purchasing the disc expecting anything like usual lou reed would soon be selling it on ebay .
at the same time , the ensemble version takes away some of the incredible harshness of the original and makes it much easier to hear the individual figures within the music .
occasionally , it even sounds sort of melodic .
“ the instrumental sound is much richer , ” friedl said .
“ and of course , it 's something different when you have ten people playing , instead of just two hard-edged guitar feedbacks that have also been pitched up on octave . ”
but is it classical or rock music ?
“ metal machine music is the translation of both the freedom of free improvisation and the sound structures of new music into a rock aesthetic , ” said krieger .
“ for me it combines two different worlds , which were both important twentieth-century cultural movements , but which ran parallel to one another without ever really overlapping .
it 's a kind of a best-of-all-worlds situation . ”
in other words , it 's a very different way for the musically adventurous to take a walk on the wild side .

" we do hope for the future presidential elections on march 2 that there will be an invitation to organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- observers in due time and in an appropriate way , " eu foreign affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said on wednesday , dec .
5 . on sunday , russia held parliamentary elections which handed a massive victory to the united russia party backed by president vladimir putin . putin 's constitutional term of office expires next year , but he is widely expected to use the party 's strong position to find some way of keeping power .
sunday 's elections were marred by allegations of systematic media bias , pressure on voters and harassment of opposition politicians . but evidence confirming those allegations was hard to come by , as the osce - the main body which oversees elections in europe - had cancelled a planned large-scale observation mission , claiming that the russian authorities had refused visas to most of its staff . observers lament state media control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united russia 's " our choice is putin " campaign had blanket coverage on monday , those members of the osce who had been able to observe parts of the election said that it had not conformed to international standards of democracy .
russian opposition parties echoed the claims . " television coverage was monopolized by the ruling party , " the osce 's representative for freedom of the media , miklos haraszti , complained in a statement focusing on the media bias . there were " several cases of harassment and violence against the independent media " which " contributed to the intimidating atmosphere , " he said .
" monitoring by the central electoral commission and the -lsb- non-governmental organization -rsb- russian union of journalists showed a clear bias in favor of the ruling party candidates on the main television channels . " combined coverage of russian president vladimir putin , the government and the ruling united russia party amounted to about 80 percent of all political coverage on national channels . haraszti said he had submitted to russian foreign minister sergey lavrov a list of incidents where media freedom had been violated during the election campaign . list of violations sent as warning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers want to see more transparency in may the report should act as a reminder to russia " of its commitment to guarantee a free and fair media coverage during elections , " he said . the findings " are an early warning in view of the march 2008 presidential election , " haraszti said .
" i ask the new state duma to ensure the right of the media to provide balanced and objective information . " the us , eu and germany all joined in criticizing the elections and called on the russian authorities to investigate the allegations of improper conduct . but the kremlin rejected all accusations , insisting that the elections had been free and fair and saying that foreign criticism was part of a us plot to tarnish russia 's image . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical music -pipe- 06.12.2007 german ensemble releases cd of lou reed 's loudest album großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reed 's 1975 feedback experiment is back - in classic black the group zeitkratzer has drawn good reviews with a classical version of metal machine music - the 1975 feedback experiment that almost finished lou reed ’ s career . it 's got no beat , and you definitely ca n't dance to it .
lou reed 's metal machine music - a punishing 50 minutes of guitar feedback looped together and sped up to twice its normal speed - was hated by both critics and fans when it was originally released in the mid-70s .
some drew comparisons with a dentist 's drill boring away at an infected tooth , while others dismissed the double album as a bid by reed to get out of his record contract .
but the berlin-based avant-garde ensemble zeitkratzer has given the composition a new lease on life , scoring it for classical instruments and recasting it as a piece of minimalist new music .
the cd-dvd was recorded live with reed in 2002 but only released this autumn due to copyright issues - an ironic twist since rca recalled the original metal machine music from record stores after three weeks and told reed he 'd never make another album .
zeitkratzer 's version has drawn praise from both the high-brow new york times and hip indie-music websites like pitchfork .
group members say listening habits have caught up with reed 's ideas .
“ noise has long established itself as a standard element in rock music , ” ulrich krieger , the former zeitkratzer saxophonist who transcribed reed 's original record , told dw-world .
“ people are accustomed to pop bands who make the charts like jesus and the mary chain or nirvana building up dissonant walls of feedback . ”
come on , feel the noise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writing out the score for brass , strings , piano and percussion was a massive task in an interview before the performance , which took place as part of berlin 's annual “ march music ” festival , reed stressed the corporeal nature of his work .
“ it 's everything i like about rock music , ” reed said , thumping his chest and his thigh .
“ i like to feel music physically , here and down here .
and i 'm a guitarist .
i like electric guitars . ”
the zeitkratzer performance is also physically strenuous .
the brass players go red in the face sustaining what were originally minute-long hums of feedback , and the string section often looks in danger of cardiac arrest as it frenetically saws its way through oscillating patterns of sound .
and the ten-person ensemble faced other challenges performing a piece with no fixed tempo or time signature .
“ we use three exactly synchronized clocks , ” zeitkratzer pianist and leader reinhold friedl told dw-world .
“ everyone can see them .

do n't expect sweet jane bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original 1975 record was a commercial and critical bomb there 's no shortage of whams and blams , screeches and scratches , hums and hoots on the zeitkratzer cd .
the 4 sides of the original record were in fact shortened into 3 movements because reed felt it would be asking too much of the audience to listen to the whole thing .
and friedl cautioned that anyone purchasing the disc expecting anything like usual lou reed would soon be selling it on ebay .
at the same time , the ensemble version takes away some of the incredible harshness of the original and makes it much easier to hear the individual figures within the music .
occasionally , it even sounds sort of melodic .
“ the instrumental sound is much richer , ” friedl said .
“ and of course , it 's something different when you have ten people playing , instead of just two hard-edged guitar feedbacks that have also been pitched up on octave . ”
but is it classical or rock music ?
“ metal machine music is the translation of both the freedom of free improvisation and the sound structures of new music into a rock aesthetic , ” said krieger .
“ for me it combines two different worlds , which were both important twentieth-century cultural movements , but which ran parallel to one another without ever really overlapping .
it 's a kind of a best-of-all-worlds situation . ”
in other words , it 's a very different way for the musically adventurous to take a walk on the wild side .

6 , - 3 days ahead of international corruption day on dec .
9 - revealed some surprisingly pessimistic attitudes . in germany , 69 percent of those questioned said they expected corruption to get worse in the next three years , 77 percent believe the government is failing to tackle corruption effectively .
only britain -lrb- 72 percent -rrb- and the netherlands -lrb- 73 percent -rrb- have a bleaker outlook . bulgaria -lrb- 32 percent -rrb- and romania -lrb- 36 percent -rrb- were confident that corruption can be dealt with .
both countries , however , have been chastised by the european union in the past for not doing enough to combat corruption . an overall global average of 54 percent of people said they believed corruption would get worse , compared to 43 percent four years ago .
only one in three were convinced that anti-corruption measures actually work . dirty politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no stranger to scandal germany 's gloomy predictions for the future problems could be a result of grand corruption cases and a perceived lack of political commitment to do something about them . this low public faith in government efforts to clamp down on corruption reflects a broad unease triggered by corporate corruption scandals - such as the volkswagen and siemens cases in germany . but it 's not just germany .
the watchdog asks respondents across the globe which institutions they see as most affected by corruption .
like most years , the institutions entrusted to represent the public interest in political decision-making are seen as the dirtiest . " our experience has shown that it is commitment at the top that will make or break efforts to fight corruption , " said cobus de swardt , transparency international 's managing director .
" these troubling numbers show that government faces a crisis of legitimacy , with the potential to undermine democratization , stability and the protection of human rights . " petty bribery rampant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albania has among the world 's highest levels of petty bribery but ultimately , poor families are the hardest hit by demands for bribes in developed as well as developing countries . globally , the police are the institution most frequently reported to demand bribes , but medical services also stand out as a common source of bribery demands in europe .
in latin america , asia-pacific and north america , petty bribery in the judiciary is a serious problem . " the police and the judiciary in many countries around the world are part of a cycle of corruption , demanding bribes from citizens , " de swardt said in a statement .
" this troubling finding means that corruption is interfering with the basic right to equal treatment before the law . " petty bribery is at its most widespread in albania and senegal , where 30 percent of respondents said they had been required to pay bribes to various authorities for access to services .
other countries with similarly high levels include cambodia , cameroon , macedonia , nigeria , pakistan , the philippines and romania . " this year 's global corruption barometer has made it clear that too often , people must part with their hard-earned money to pay for services that should be free , " said transparency international chair huguette labelle .
" and they do not see enough commitment when they look to their governments and leaders . " we are heartened though , that the public is increasingly demanding the accountability of the very institutions that most affect their lives , as this is a powerful driver of change , " she added . between june and september , gallup international on behalf of ti quizzed 63,000 people in 60 countries on their attitudes toward and experience of corruption . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" opening the internal market for defense products will improve the competitiveness of the technological and industrial base of the european defense sector , " commission vice president günter verheugen said in a statement .
verheugen also stressed that he saw the move as " fundamental to establishing europe 's autonomy in this field . "
with the eu lagging far behind the us in defense spending , he said that public opposition to increasing expenditure in this sector meant that the eu had to spend more efficiently .
defense is the exclusive domain of the bloc 's 27 member states .
but verheugen said the policy came under the eu 's single market powers , and was not a defense policy per se .
stopping countries avoiding competition law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen stressed the importance of self-sufficiency the proposals tabled by the commission are designed to discourage countries from using a national defense clause to buy military and spare parts and avoid eu procurement rules .
they would not impact on the purchase of arms , munitions and war materials or other sensitive non-military procurements in areas such as counter-terrorism . the initiative is also intended to co-ordinate different national procurement rules , which have proved a major hurdle .
verheugen , who is also industry commissioner , said the complex mix of national legislation and controls on the transfer of defense equipment currently in place had even helped encourage the mass use of the exemption .
" if you just want a spare tyre , for example , for a defense vehicle , you 've got to go through the same authorization procedure as if you were selling a gun outside the european union , " he explained .
he said the new measures would apply " perhaps not to the whole tank but for example the spare tyre .
not to a mortar or motor for a fighter plane , but for components or spare parts . "
measures to boost transparency and cut red tape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal relates to spares rather than whole tanks internal market and services commissioner charlie mccreevy said : " introducing transparent and competitive procurement rules applicable throughout the eu is crucial for the establishment of a common defense market .
this will lead to greater openness of defense markets between member states to the benefit of all : armed forces , taxpayers and industries . "
he said the commission would have the same powers to fine non-compliant member states as in other areas of eu policy .
the european defense agency , formed in 2004 to help eu member nations improve their military capabilities , welcomed the commission 's plans , even though its own attempts to achieve similar results have borne little fruit .
" the european market for tanks does not operate in the same way as the market for washing machines , " said new eda chief executive alexander weis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 06.12.2007 germany suspicious about eu blue card plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue card would allow skilled professionals access to the eu labor market the german interior minister has expressed strong reservations about an eu-wide " blue card " at a meeting of ministers in brussels .
but the need to attract skilled foreign workers was widely acknowledged . wolfgang schäuble implicitly criticized frattini 's plans for a blue card by insisting that immigration should remain a competence of individual member states .
eu commission vice-president franco frattini said there had been a " broad consensus " on the benefits of granting work and residency permits to third-country professionals , given labor shortages and europe 's graying population .
and the justice , interior , employment and social policy ministers also agreed with the eu executive on the necessity of cracking down on undeclared workers , many of them exploited illegal immigrants .
portugal , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the so-called " jumbo council " aimed to produce a wide-ranging debate on this highly sensitive issue .
differing national priorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan aims to help reduce the number of illegal migrants and ministers also stressed different priorities and expressed diverging views on the issue .
mediterranean countries such as italy , spain and greece , for instance , emphasized the need to stop thousands of illegal migrants from north africa and asia .
while the czech republic and bulgaria said their workers should be given priority .
frattini has proposed increasing the eu 's attractivity to third- country professionals by offering them similar benefits to those currently enjoyed by their european colleagues .
candidates would be able to apply for a single work and residency permit , valid for a minimum of two years and renewable , and accepted throughout the union .
under the proposal , foreign white-collar workers would also be allowed to be joined by their families in their new country of residency .
germany 's main concern is that the eu might eventually impose quotas on the number of immigrants who can enter individual member states , an eventuality strongly denied by frattini .
" it is not up to brussels to decide how many engineers from third countries are necessary for germany or austria , " frattini said .
observers in brussels said germany could eventually decide not to adopt the blue card , rather than block the project altogether .
the dutch also voiced doubts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration commissioner frattini with commission president barroso the netherlands also expressed reservations over the proposal while austria called for further " clarifications " in the field of social security and minimum wages , saying it already offered higher levels .
britain , which has opted out of eu immigration policies altogether , outlined to ministers its alternative plan for a points- based system .
devised along the lines of a similar system in place in australia , it aims to ensure that only those migrants meeting the needs of the country would be allowed to enter and work .
the british proposal nevertheless reflects a more general shift towards a " pick and choose " approach to migration that is likely to adversely affect the future of lower-skilled third-country nationals seeking a better life in europe .
some 2 million third-country nationals enter the bloc each year , according to eu estimates , and there is little evidence to suggest this figure will drop significantly in the foreseeable future .
the inflow has been at times poorly managed fuelling growing resentment among ordinary citizens , opposition from nationalist parties and calls for stricter controls by government officials . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 06.12.2007 germany suspicious about eu blue card plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue card would allow skilled professionals access to the eu labor market the german interior minister has expressed strong reservations about an eu-wide " blue card " at a meeting of ministers in brussels .
but the need to attract skilled foreign workers was widely acknowledged . wolfgang schäuble implicitly criticized frattini 's plans for a blue card by insisting that immigration should remain a competence of individual member states .
eu commission vice-president franco frattini said there had been a " broad consensus " on the benefits of granting work and residency permits to third-country professionals , given labor shortages and europe 's graying population .
and the justice , interior , employment and social policy ministers also agreed with the eu executive on the necessity of cracking down on undeclared workers , many of them exploited illegal immigrants .
portugal , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the so-called " jumbo council " aimed to produce a wide-ranging debate on this highly sensitive issue .
differing national priorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan aims to help reduce the number of illegal migrants and ministers also stressed different priorities and expressed diverging views on the issue .
mediterranean countries such as italy , spain and greece , for instance , emphasized the need to stop thousands of illegal migrants from north africa and asia .
while the czech republic and bulgaria said their workers should be given priority .
frattini has proposed increasing the eu 's attractivity to third- country professionals by offering them similar benefits to those currently enjoyed by their european colleagues .
candidates would be able to apply for a single work and residency permit , valid for a minimum of two years and renewable , and accepted throughout the union .
under the proposal , foreign white-collar workers would also be allowed to be joined by their families in their new country of residency .
germany 's main concern is that the eu might eventually impose quotas on the number of immigrants who can enter individual member states , an eventuality strongly denied by frattini .
" it is not up to brussels to decide how many engineers from third countries are necessary for germany or austria , " frattini said .
observers in brussels said germany could eventually decide not to adopt the blue card , rather than block the project altogether .
the dutch also voiced doubts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration commissioner frattini with commission president barroso the netherlands also expressed reservations over the proposal while austria called for further " clarifications " in the field of social security and minimum wages , saying it already offered higher levels .
britain , which has opted out of eu immigration policies altogether , outlined to ministers its alternative plan for a points- based system .
devised along the lines of a similar system in place in australia , it aims to ensure that only those migrants meeting the needs of the country would be allowed to enter and work .
the british proposal nevertheless reflects a more general shift towards a " pick and choose " approach to migration that is likely to adversely affect the future of lower-skilled third-country nationals seeking a better life in europe .
some 2 million third-country nationals enter the bloc each year , according to eu estimates , and there is little evidence to suggest this figure will drop significantly in the foreseeable future .
the inflow has been at times poorly managed fuelling growing resentment among ordinary citizens , opposition from nationalist parties and calls for stricter controls by government officials . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel reacted by suggesting that such an affiliation of nations could lead to " a corrosion of the eu in its core area " and " could release explosive powers in the eu . "
such a frankly undiplomatic reaction was unusual under the circumstances , and suggested that merkel may have reached a point in her relationship with the french president where she felt it necessary to go public with her discontent .
merkel unhappy with sarkozy 's tactics bildunterschrift : for relations between the two leaders had already begun to sour well before this disagreement , due in no small part to sarkozy 's propensity for unilateral action and self-promotion .
this began as early as the so-called eu mini-treaty , on which merkel - as head of the union when germany held the rotating eu presidency - had been working for months before sarkozy renamed it and claimed it as his own .
later , the french president ruffled german - and european - feathers when he sent his wife cecilia to libya to negotiate the freedom of bulgarian nurses sentenced to death for allegedly infecting children with aids .
the problem was that brussels had been negotiating their freedom for a long time , particularly under german eu presidency , and had apparently been close to a resolution of the crisis .
the subsequent agreement in which france is to supply libya with a nuclear reactor for the desalination of sea water sparked criticism from both parties in germany 's ruling coalition , although government sources claimed it had not caused a rift in bilateral relations .
putin call highlights divisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy strayed from the eu line on the russian elections finally , the recent election triumph of russian president vladimir putin exposed deep rifts in the policies of the two neighbours towards russia .
while the german government called the elections to the russian duma " neither fair , equal nor democratic , " sarkozy was one of the rare world leaders to offer the russian president his unqualified congratulations .
thursday evening 's summit will be primarily devoted to european issues , but the two leaders may use it to ease some of the tension that has begun to afflict relations since sarkozy became french president less than eight months ago . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 , - 3 days ahead of international corruption day on dec .
9 - revealed some surprisingly pessimistic attitudes . in germany , 69 percent of those questioned said they expected corruption to get worse in the next three years , 77 percent believe the government is failing to tackle corruption effectively .
only britain -lrb- 72 percent -rrb- and the netherlands -lrb- 73 percent -rrb- have a bleaker outlook . bulgaria -lrb- 32 percent -rrb- and romania -lrb- 36 percent -rrb- were confident that corruption can be dealt with .
both countries , however , have been chastised by the european union in the past for not doing enough to combat corruption . an overall global average of 54 percent of people said they believed corruption would get worse , compared to 43 percent four years ago .
only one in three were convinced that anti-corruption measures actually work . dirty politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no stranger to scandal germany 's gloomy predictions for the future problems could be a result of grand corruption cases and a perceived lack of political commitment to do something about them . this low public faith in government efforts to clamp down on corruption reflects a broad unease triggered by corporate corruption scandals - such as the volkswagen and siemens cases in germany . but it 's not just germany .
the watchdog asks respondents across the globe which institutions they see as most affected by corruption .
like most years , the institutions entrusted to represent the public interest in political decision-making are seen as the dirtiest . " our experience has shown that it is commitment at the top that will make or break efforts to fight corruption , " said cobus de swardt , transparency international 's managing director .
" these troubling numbers show that government faces a crisis of legitimacy , with the potential to undermine democratization , stability and the protection of human rights . " petty bribery rampant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albania has among the world 's highest levels of petty bribery but ultimately , poor families are the hardest hit by demands for bribes in developed as well as developing countries . globally , the police are the institution most frequently reported to demand bribes , but medical services also stand out as a common source of bribery demands in europe .
in latin america , asia-pacific and north america , petty bribery in the judiciary is a serious problem . " the police and the judiciary in many countries around the world are part of a cycle of corruption , demanding bribes from citizens , " de swardt said in a statement .
" this troubling finding means that corruption is interfering with the basic right to equal treatment before the law . " petty bribery is at its most widespread in albania and senegal , where 30 percent of respondents said they had been required to pay bribes to various authorities for access to services .
other countries with similarly high levels include cambodia , cameroon , macedonia , nigeria , pakistan , the philippines and romania . " this year 's global corruption barometer has made it clear that too often , people must part with their hard-earned money to pay for services that should be free , " said transparency international chair huguette labelle .
" and they do not see enough commitment when they look to their governments and leaders . " we are heartened though , that the public is increasingly demanding the accountability of the very institutions that most affect their lives , as this is a powerful driver of change , " she added . between june and september , gallup international on behalf of ti quizzed 63,000 people in 60 countries on their attitudes toward and experience of corruption . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 , ahead of a united nations deadline for deciding on the province 's future status . on monday , the european union , the united states and russia are due to inform the un secretary-general that attempts to find a negotiated solution to the future status of kosovo have failed .
the government of kosovo , which is still formally a part of serbia has been a united nations protectorate since 1999 , has already said they will unilaterally declare independence from serbia .
alliance ministers are expected to announce a continued commitment to keep nato 's 16,000-strong kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo , if this happens . but slovakia , romania , spain and greece have expressed their misgivings to these plans .
" we are expecting topics a , b and c to be : kosovo , kosovo , kosovo , " a senior us official said .
nato drawing up contingency plans for kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence continues despite the nato and un presence belgrade , which enjoys russian support within the un security council , is strongly opposed to the plans of the kosovar leadership to declare independence .
in 1999 , a nato bombing campaign stopped serbia 's ethnic cleansing of kosovo , whose 2.2 million people are 90 per cent ethnic albanian .
in recent weeks , alliance commanders have been busy drawing up contingency plans should the situation degenerate once independence is proclaimed .
thousands of extra troops are being held in reserve in case reinforcements are needed quickly .
the gathering , which will also include a nato-russia council meeting , means ministers will also have to tackle the issue of growing strains with russia over its withdrawal from the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty and the us missile shield system .
a law signed by russian president vladimir putin suspending russia 's participation in what is frequently described as a cornerstone treaty of european security comes into force on sunday , nov.9.
meanwhile , the us is continuing with its project to set up an anti-iran missile defence shield in central europe , one of the reasons russia gave for suspending the cfe .
russia a factor in all three issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has told the kremlin that us plans pose no threat to russia nato officials insist that the three sticky issues on this week 's agenda should be dealt with separately .
but russia features in all of them .
the meeting , which begins with a dinner on thursday evening attended by eu and nato ministers , will offer an opportunity for officials to discuss us plans to locate missile defence bases in poland and the czech republic .
the plan has divided opinion across europe .
that issue , too , will be discussed during friday 's nato-russia council meeting , which is to be attended by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .
would-be nato members croatia , albania and macedonia are set to be informed that despite making great progress on reforms , they must do more if they are to be invited into the alliance at a summit in bucharest in april 2008 , diplomats said . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" hertha bsc was not infected by national-socialism , " said historian daniel koerfer of berlin 's freie university , who had been hired by the bundesliga club to investigate its past . " there was no resistance against the regime , but also no deeply seated fanatical enthusiasm for the party and its leadership , aside from admiration for hitler until far into the second world war , " koerfer wrote in the 70-page study .
" there was no strongly pronounced anti-semitism either - but there were also no attempts to really take a stand against the state-mandated racist delusion . " the overwhelming majority of hertha 's players did not join the nazi party and most of the club 's 400 members would not have sympathized with the nazis , the study said . however , the club 's leadership , including hans pfeifer - who was installed as president to insure nazi ideology was adhered to - were either already party members or eventually joined the party .
at home in " red wedding " the club was rooted in the northern working class district of wedding , where its stadium was . " that may have protected us from being used more by the nazis , " said club president bernd schiphorst , the initiator of the study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha plays at the stadium where the 1936 olympics took place also known as " red wedding " before world war ii , three-quarters of the population of the district voted for the communist party and the social democrats in the 1932 election . the soccer club is often associated with the nazi era because of its links to the stadium built by hitler 's chief architect , albert speer , schiphorst pointed out .
star player spoke up the club 's most successful historic player , hanne sobeck , with whom hertha won its last two german league titles - in 1930 and 1932 - joined the nazi party in 1940 but kept a distance to it . " as in the course of ever-tightening anti-semitic isolation policies , jewish club members were supposed to be banned from the stands , sobek protested , " koerfer wrote .
" he also continued his contact to jewish club members .

" opening the internal market for defense products will improve the competitiveness of the technological and industrial base of the european defense sector , " commission vice president günter verheugen said in a statement .
verheugen also stressed that he saw the move as " fundamental to establishing europe 's autonomy in this field . "
with the eu lagging far behind the us in defense spending , he said that public opposition to increasing expenditure in this sector meant that the eu had to spend more efficiently .
defense is the exclusive domain of the bloc 's 27 member states .
but verheugen said the policy came under the eu 's single market powers , and was not a defense policy per se .
stopping countries avoiding competition law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen stressed the importance of self-sufficiency the proposals tabled by the commission are designed to discourage countries from using a national defense clause to buy military and spare parts and avoid eu procurement rules .
they would not impact on the purchase of arms , munitions and war materials or other sensitive non-military procurements in areas such as counter-terrorism . the initiative is also intended to co-ordinate different national procurement rules , which have proved a major hurdle .
verheugen , who is also industry commissioner , said the complex mix of national legislation and controls on the transfer of defense equipment currently in place had even helped encourage the mass use of the exemption .
" if you just want a spare tyre , for example , for a defense vehicle , you 've got to go through the same authorization procedure as if you were selling a gun outside the european union , " he explained .
he said the new measures would apply " perhaps not to the whole tank but for example the spare tyre .

measures to boost transparency and cut red tape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal relates to spares rather than whole tanks internal market and services commissioner charlie mccreevy said : " introducing transparent and competitive procurement rules applicable throughout the eu is crucial for the establishment of a common defense market .
this will lead to greater openness of defense markets between member states to the benefit of all : armed forces , taxpayers and industries . "
he said the commission would have the same powers to fine non-compliant member states as in other areas of eu policy .
the european defense agency , formed in 2004 to help eu member nations improve their military capabilities , welcomed the commission 's plans , even though its own attempts to achieve similar results have borne little fruit .
" the european market for tanks does not operate in the same way as the market for washing machines , " said new eda chief executive alexander weis .

" opening the internal market for defense products will improve the competitiveness of the technological and industrial base of the european defense sector , " commission vice president günter verheugen said in a statement .
verheugen also stressed that he saw the move as " fundamental to establishing europe 's autonomy in this field . "
with the eu lagging far behind the us in defense spending , he said that public opposition to increasing expenditure in this sector meant that the eu had to spend more efficiently .
defense is the exclusive domain of the bloc 's 27 member states .
but verheugen said the policy came under the eu 's single market powers , and was not a defense policy per se .
stopping countries avoiding competition law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen stressed the importance of self-sufficiency the proposals tabled by the commission are designed to discourage countries from using a national defense clause to buy military and spare parts and avoid eu procurement rules .
they would not impact on the purchase of arms , munitions and war materials or other sensitive non-military procurements in areas such as counter-terrorism . the initiative is also intended to co-ordinate different national procurement rules , which have proved a major hurdle .
verheugen , who is also industry commissioner , said the complex mix of national legislation and controls on the transfer of defense equipment currently in place had even helped encourage the mass use of the exemption .
" if you just want a spare tyre , for example , for a defense vehicle , you 've got to go through the same authorization procedure as if you were selling a gun outside the european union , " he explained .
he said the new measures would apply " perhaps not to the whole tank but for example the spare tyre .
not to a mortar or motor for a fighter plane , but for components or spare parts . "
measures to boost transparency and cut red tape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal relates to spares rather than whole tanks internal market and services commissioner charlie mccreevy said : " introducing transparent and competitive procurement rules applicable throughout the eu is crucial for the establishment of a common defense market .
this will lead to greater openness of defense markets between member states to the benefit of all : armed forces , taxpayers and industries . "
he said the commission would have the same powers to fine non-compliant member states as in other areas of eu policy .

the government of kosovo , which is still formally a part of serbia has been a united nations protectorate since 1999 , has already said they will unilaterally declare independence from serbia .
alliance ministers are expected to announce a continued commitment to keep nato 's 16,000-strong kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo , if this happens . but slovakia , romania , spain and greece have expressed their misgivings to these plans .

in 1999 , a nato bombing campaign stopped serbia 's ethnic cleansing of kosovo , whose 2.2 million people are 90 per cent ethnic albanian .
in recent weeks , alliance commanders have been busy drawing up contingency plans should the situation degenerate once independence is proclaimed .
thousands of extra troops are being held in reserve in case reinforcements are needed quickly .

russia a factor in all three issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has told the kremlin that us plans pose no threat to russia nato officials insist that the three sticky issues on this week 's agenda should be dealt with separately .
but russia features in all of them .
the meeting , which begins with a dinner on thursday evening attended by eu and nato ministers , will offer an opportunity for officials to discuss us plans to locate missile defence bases in poland and the czech republic .
the plan has divided opinion across europe .
that issue , too , will be discussed during friday 's nato-russia council meeting , which is to be attended by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .

" hertha bsc was not infected by national-socialism , " said historian daniel koerfer of berlin 's freie university , who had been hired by the bundesliga club to investigate its past . " there was no resistance against the regime , but also no deeply seated fanatical enthusiasm for the party and its leadership , aside from admiration for hitler until far into the second world war , " koerfer wrote in the 70-page study .
" there was no strongly pronounced anti-semitism either - but there were also no attempts to really take a stand against the state-mandated racist delusion . " the overwhelming majority of hertha 's players did not join the nazi party and most of the club 's 400 members would not have sympathized with the nazis , the study said . however , the club 's leadership , including hans pfeifer - who was installed as president to insure nazi ideology was adhered to - were either already party members or eventually joined the party .
at home in " red wedding " the club was rooted in the northern working class district of wedding , where its stadium was . " that may have protected us from being used more by the nazis , " said club president bernd schiphorst , the initiator of the study . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha plays at the stadium where the 1936 olympics took place also known as " red wedding " before world war ii , three-quarters of the population of the district voted for the communist party and the social democrats in the 1932 election . the soccer club is often associated with the nazi era because of its links to the stadium built by hitler 's chief architect , albert speer , schiphorst pointed out .
star player spoke up the club 's most successful historic player , hanne sobeck , with whom hertha won its last two german league titles - in 1930 and 1932 - joined the nazi party in 1940 but kept a distance to it . " as in the course of ever-tightening anti-semitic isolation policies , jewish club members were supposed to be banned from the stands , sobek protested , " koerfer wrote .
" he also continued his contact to jewish club members . " hertha 's jewish team doctor was deported to the auschwitz concentration camp in 1943 , where he was eventually murdered . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 , ahead of a united nations deadline for deciding on the province 's future status . on monday , the european union , the united states and russia are due to inform the un secretary-general that attempts to find a negotiated solution to the future status of kosovo have failed .
the government of kosovo , which is still formally a part of serbia has been a united nations protectorate since 1999 , has already said they will unilaterally declare independence from serbia .
alliance ministers are expected to announce a continued commitment to keep nato 's 16,000-strong kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo , if this happens . but slovakia , romania , spain and greece have expressed their misgivings to these plans .
" we are expecting topics a , b and c to be : kosovo , kosovo , kosovo , " a senior us official said .
nato drawing up contingency plans for kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence continues despite the nato and un presence belgrade , which enjoys russian support within the un security council , is strongly opposed to the plans of the kosovar leadership to declare independence .
in 1999 , a nato bombing campaign stopped serbia 's ethnic cleansing of kosovo , whose 2.2 million people are 90 per cent ethnic albanian .
in recent weeks , alliance commanders have been busy drawing up contingency plans should the situation degenerate once independence is proclaimed .
thousands of extra troops are being held in reserve in case reinforcements are needed quickly .
the gathering , which will also include a nato-russia council meeting , means ministers will also have to tackle the issue of growing strains with russia over its withdrawal from the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty and the us missile shield system .
a law signed by russian president vladimir putin suspending russia 's participation in what is frequently described as a cornerstone treaty of european security comes into force on sunday , nov.9.
meanwhile , the us is continuing with its project to set up an anti-iran missile defence shield in central europe , one of the reasons russia gave for suspending the cfe .
russia a factor in all three issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has told the kremlin that us plans pose no threat to russia nato officials insist that the three sticky issues on this week 's agenda should be dealt with separately .
but russia features in all of them .
the meeting , which begins with a dinner on thursday evening attended by eu and nato ministers , will offer an opportunity for officials to discuss us plans to locate missile defence bases in poland and the czech republic .
the plan has divided opinion across europe .
that issue , too , will be discussed during friday 's nato-russia council meeting , which is to be attended by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .

6 , - 3 days ahead of international corruption day on dec .
9 - revealed some surprisingly pessimistic attitudes . in germany , 69 percent of those questioned said they expected corruption to get worse in the next three years , 77 percent believe the government is failing to tackle corruption effectively .
only britain -lrb- 72 percent -rrb- and the netherlands -lrb- 73 percent -rrb- have a bleaker outlook . bulgaria -lrb- 32 percent -rrb- and romania -lrb- 36 percent -rrb- were confident that corruption can be dealt with .
both countries , however , have been chastised by the european union in the past for not doing enough to combat corruption . an overall global average of 54 percent of people said they believed corruption would get worse , compared to 43 percent four years ago .
only one in three were convinced that anti-corruption measures actually work . dirty politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no stranger to scandal germany 's gloomy predictions for the future problems could be a result of grand corruption cases and a perceived lack of political commitment to do something about them . this low public faith in government efforts to clamp down on corruption reflects a broad unease triggered by corporate corruption scandals - such as the volkswagen and siemens cases in germany . but it 's not just germany .
the watchdog asks respondents across the globe which institutions they see as most affected by corruption .
like most years , the institutions entrusted to represent the public interest in political decision-making are seen as the dirtiest . " our experience has shown that it is commitment at the top that will make or break efforts to fight corruption , " said cobus de swardt , transparency international 's managing director .
" these troubling numbers show that government faces a crisis of legitimacy , with the potential to undermine democratization , stability and the protection of human rights . " petty bribery rampant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albania has among the world 's highest levels of petty bribery but ultimately , poor families are the hardest hit by demands for bribes in developed as well as developing countries . globally , the police are the institution most frequently reported to demand bribes , but medical services also stand out as a common source of bribery demands in europe .
in latin america , asia-pacific and north america , petty bribery in the judiciary is a serious problem . " the police and the judiciary in many countries around the world are part of a cycle of corruption , demanding bribes from citizens , " de swardt said in a statement .
" this troubling finding means that corruption is interfering with the basic right to equal treatment before the law . " petty bribery is at its most widespread in albania and senegal , where 30 percent of respondents said they had been required to pay bribes to various authorities for access to services .
other countries with similarly high levels include cambodia , cameroon , macedonia , nigeria , pakistan , the philippines and romania . " this year 's global corruption barometer has made it clear that too often , people must part with their hard-earned money to pay for services that should be free , " said transparency international chair huguette labelle .
" and they do not see enough commitment when they look to their governments and leaders . " we are heartened though , that the public is increasingly demanding the accountability of the very institutions that most affect their lives , as this is a powerful driver of change , " she added . between june and september , gallup international on behalf of ti quizzed 63,000 people in 60 countries on their attitudes toward and experience of corruption . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 , ahead of a united nations deadline for deciding on the province 's future status . on monday , the european union , the united states and russia are due to inform the un secretary-general that attempts to find a negotiated solution to the future status of kosovo have failed .
the government of kosovo , which is still formally a part of serbia has been a united nations protectorate since 1999 , has already said they will unilaterally declare independence from serbia .
alliance ministers are expected to announce a continued commitment to keep nato 's 16,000-strong kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo , if this happens . but slovakia , romania , spain and greece have expressed their misgivings to these plans .
" we are expecting topics a , b and c to be : kosovo , kosovo , kosovo , " a senior us official said .
nato drawing up contingency plans for kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence continues despite the nato and un presence belgrade , which enjoys russian support within the un security council , is strongly opposed to the plans of the kosovar leadership to declare independence .
in 1999 , a nato bombing campaign stopped serbia 's ethnic cleansing of kosovo , whose 2.2 million people are 90 per cent ethnic albanian .
in recent weeks , alliance commanders have been busy drawing up contingency plans should the situation degenerate once independence is proclaimed .
thousands of extra troops are being held in reserve in case reinforcements are needed quickly .
the gathering , which will also include a nato-russia council meeting , means ministers will also have to tackle the issue of growing strains with russia over its withdrawal from the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty and the us missile shield system .
a law signed by russian president vladimir putin suspending russia 's participation in what is frequently described as a cornerstone treaty of european security comes into force on sunday , nov.9.
meanwhile , the us is continuing with its project to set up an anti-iran missile defence shield in central europe , one of the reasons russia gave for suspending the cfe .
russia a factor in all three issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has told the kremlin that us plans pose no threat to russia nato officials insist that the three sticky issues on this week 's agenda should be dealt with separately .
but russia features in all of them .
the meeting , which begins with a dinner on thursday evening attended by eu and nato ministers , will offer an opportunity for officials to discuss us plans to locate missile defence bases in poland and the czech republic .
the plan has divided opinion across europe .
that issue , too , will be discussed during friday 's nato-russia council meeting , which is to be attended by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .
would-be nato members croatia , albania and macedonia are set to be informed that despite making great progress on reforms , they must do more if they are to be invited into the alliance at a summit in bucharest in april 2008 , diplomats said . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel reacted by suggesting that such an affiliation of nations could lead to " a corrosion of the eu in its core area " and " could release explosive powers in the eu . "
such a frankly undiplomatic reaction was unusual under the circumstances , and suggested that merkel may have reached a point in her relationship with the french president where she felt it necessary to go public with her discontent .
merkel unhappy with sarkozy 's tactics bildunterschrift : for relations between the two leaders had already begun to sour well before this disagreement , due in no small part to sarkozy 's propensity for unilateral action and self-promotion .
this began as early as the so-called eu mini-treaty , on which merkel - as head of the union when germany held the rotating eu presidency - had been working for months before sarkozy renamed it and claimed it as his own .
later , the french president ruffled german - and european - feathers when he sent his wife cecilia to libya to negotiate the freedom of bulgarian nurses sentenced to death for allegedly infecting children with aids .
the problem was that brussels had been negotiating their freedom for a long time , particularly under german eu presidency , and had apparently been close to a resolution of the crisis .

but the need to attract skilled foreign workers was widely acknowledged . wolfgang schäuble implicitly criticized frattini 's plans for a blue card by insisting that immigration should remain a competence of individual member states .
eu commission vice-president franco frattini said there had been a " broad consensus " on the benefits of granting work and residency permits to third-country professionals , given labor shortages and europe 's graying population .
and the justice , interior , employment and social policy ministers also agreed with the eu executive on the necessity of cracking down on undeclared workers , many of them exploited illegal immigrants .
portugal , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the so-called " jumbo council " aimed to produce a wide-ranging debate on this highly sensitive issue .
differing national priorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan aims to help reduce the number of illegal migrants and ministers also stressed different priorities and expressed diverging views on the issue .
mediterranean countries such as italy , spain and greece , for instance , emphasized the need to stop thousands of illegal migrants from north africa and asia .
while the czech republic and bulgaria said their workers should be given priority .
frattini has proposed increasing the eu 's attractivity to third- country professionals by offering them similar benefits to those currently enjoyed by their european colleagues .
candidates would be able to apply for a single work and residency permit , valid for a minimum of two years and renewable , and accepted throughout the union .
under the proposal , foreign white-collar workers would also be allowed to be joined by their families in their new country of residency .
germany 's main concern is that the eu might eventually impose quotas on the number of immigrants who can enter individual member states , an eventuality strongly denied by frattini .
" it is not up to brussels to decide how many engineers from third countries are necessary for germany or austria , " frattini said .
observers in brussels said germany could eventually decide not to adopt the blue card , rather than block the project altogether .
the dutch also voiced doubts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration commissioner frattini with commission president barroso the netherlands also expressed reservations over the proposal while austria called for further " clarifications " in the field of social security and minimum wages , saying it already offered higher levels .
britain , which has opted out of eu immigration policies altogether , outlined to ministers its alternative plan for a points- based system .
devised along the lines of a similar system in place in australia , it aims to ensure that only those migrants meeting the needs of the country would be allowed to enter and work .
the british proposal nevertheless reflects a more general shift towards a " pick and choose " approach to migration that is likely to adversely affect the future of lower-skilled third-country nationals seeking a better life in europe .
some 2 million third-country nationals enter the bloc each year , according to eu estimates , and there is little evidence to suggest this figure will drop significantly in the foreseeable future .
the inflow has been at times poorly managed fuelling growing resentment among ordinary citizens , opposition from nationalist parties and calls for stricter controls by government officials . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these include improving insulation in private homes , stricter standards for both new buildings and refurbishment projects , as well as a targeted sponsorship of renewable heating energy , which all are measures which can help cut millions of tones of greenhouse gases at the same time as reducing budgets for gas , oil and electricity .
the promotion of energy obtained from wind , sun and biomass with the help of cogeneration is designed to secure and stabilize germany 's boom in renewable energy - laying a blueprint for successful climate protection measures .
even so , they wo n't be enough to meet the government 's target of cutting carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2020 .
environment minister sigmar gabriel expects the figure to be closer to 36 percent at most .
that extra 4 percent needs to come from somewhere .
a little bit more courage on berlin 's part in standing up to the industrial lobby is all it needs .
take transport .
introducing a speed limit on freeways could help cut carbon emissions .
but the government has little desire to face off with the car lobby .
take energy production .
the energy companies are allowed to continue building coal-fired power plants .
they might be more efficient than their predecessors , but they will cause serious environmental damage . the government 's climate protection package is ambitious but flawed - the coalition 's excuse is that it has to take too many factors in to consideration .
nonetheless , germany has nothing to be ashamed of at the un climate change conference in bali .
other countries have failed miserably to come up with similarly concrete plans on curbing carbon emissions in the areas of energy production , households , industry and transport . germany is clearly trying to do its bit for the polar bears in the artic .
but their fate is still on thin ice .
other industrialized nations will have to start following germany 's example , and berlin itself also has a long way to go before it 's really pulled out all stops .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 06.12.2007 germany suspicious about eu blue card plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue card would allow skilled professionals access to the eu labor market the german interior minister has expressed strong reservations about an eu-wide " blue card " at a meeting of ministers in brussels .
but the need to attract skilled foreign workers was widely acknowledged . wolfgang schäuble implicitly criticized frattini 's plans for a blue card by insisting that immigration should remain a competence of individual member states .
eu commission vice-president franco frattini said there had been a " broad consensus " on the benefits of granting work and residency permits to third-country professionals , given labor shortages and europe 's graying population .
and the justice , interior , employment and social policy ministers also agreed with the eu executive on the necessity of cracking down on undeclared workers , many of them exploited illegal immigrants .
portugal , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the so-called " jumbo council " aimed to produce a wide-ranging debate on this highly sensitive issue .
differing national priorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan aims to help reduce the number of illegal migrants and ministers also stressed different priorities and expressed diverging views on the issue .
mediterranean countries such as italy , spain and greece , for instance , emphasized the need to stop thousands of illegal migrants from north africa and asia .
while the czech republic and bulgaria said their workers should be given priority .
frattini has proposed increasing the eu 's attractivity to third- country professionals by offering them similar benefits to those currently enjoyed by their european colleagues .
candidates would be able to apply for a single work and residency permit , valid for a minimum of two years and renewable , and accepted throughout the union .
under the proposal , foreign white-collar workers would also be allowed to be joined by their families in their new country of residency .
germany 's main concern is that the eu might eventually impose quotas on the number of immigrants who can enter individual member states , an eventuality strongly denied by frattini .
" it is not up to brussels to decide how many engineers from third countries are necessary for germany or austria , " frattini said .
observers in brussels said germany could eventually decide not to adopt the blue card , rather than block the project altogether .
the dutch also voiced doubts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration commissioner frattini with commission president barroso the netherlands also expressed reservations over the proposal while austria called for further " clarifications " in the field of social security and minimum wages , saying it already offered higher levels .
britain , which has opted out of eu immigration policies altogether , outlined to ministers its alternative plan for a points- based system .
devised along the lines of a similar system in place in australia , it aims to ensure that only those migrants meeting the needs of the country would be allowed to enter and work .
the british proposal nevertheless reflects a more general shift towards a " pick and choose " approach to migration that is likely to adversely affect the future of lower-skilled third-country nationals seeking a better life in europe .
some 2 million third-country nationals enter the bloc each year , according to eu estimates , and there is little evidence to suggest this figure will drop significantly in the foreseeable future .
the inflow has been at times poorly managed fuelling growing resentment among ordinary citizens , opposition from nationalist parties and calls for stricter controls by government officials . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these include improving insulation in private homes , stricter standards for both new buildings and refurbishment projects , as well as a targeted sponsorship of renewable heating energy , which all are measures which can help cut millions of tones of greenhouse gases at the same time as reducing budgets for gas , oil and electricity .
the promotion of energy obtained from wind , sun and biomass with the help of cogeneration is designed to secure and stabilize germany 's boom in renewable energy - laying a blueprint for successful climate protection measures .
even so , they wo n't be enough to meet the government 's target of cutting carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2020 .
environment minister sigmar gabriel expects the figure to be closer to 36 percent at most .
that extra 4 percent needs to come from somewhere .
a little bit more courage on berlin 's part in standing up to the industrial lobby is all it needs .
take transport .
introducing a speed limit on freeways could help cut carbon emissions .
but the government has little desire to face off with the car lobby .
take energy production .
the energy companies are allowed to continue building coal-fired power plants .
they might be more efficient than their predecessors , but they will cause serious environmental damage . the government 's climate protection package is ambitious but flawed - the coalition 's excuse is that it has to take too many factors in to consideration .
nonetheless , germany has nothing to be ashamed of at the un climate change conference in bali .
other countries have failed miserably to come up with similarly concrete plans on curbing carbon emissions in the areas of energy production , households , industry and transport . germany is clearly trying to do its bit for the polar bears in the artic .
but their fate is still on thin ice .

these include improving insulation in private homes , stricter standards for both new buildings and refurbishment projects , as well as a targeted sponsorship of renewable heating energy , which all are measures which can help cut millions of tones of greenhouse gases at the same time as reducing budgets for gas , oil and electricity .
the promotion of energy obtained from wind , sun and biomass with the help of cogeneration is designed to secure and stabilize germany 's boom in renewable energy - laying a blueprint for successful climate protection measures .
even so , they wo n't be enough to meet the government 's target of cutting carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2020 .
environment minister sigmar gabriel expects the figure to be closer to 36 percent at most .
that extra 4 percent needs to come from somewhere .
a little bit more courage on berlin 's part in standing up to the industrial lobby is all it needs .
take transport .
introducing a speed limit on freeways could help cut carbon emissions .
but the government has little desire to face off with the car lobby .
take energy production .
the energy companies are allowed to continue building coal-fired power plants .
they might be more efficient than their predecessors , but they will cause serious environmental damage . the government 's climate protection package is ambitious but flawed - the coalition 's excuse is that it has to take too many factors in to consideration .
nonetheless , germany has nothing to be ashamed of at the un climate change conference in bali .
other countries have failed miserably to come up with similarly concrete plans on curbing carbon emissions in the areas of energy production , households , industry and transport . germany is clearly trying to do its bit for the polar bears in the artic .
but their fate is still on thin ice .
other industrialized nations will have to start following germany 's example , and berlin itself also has a long way to go before it 's really pulled out all stops .

5 , found that 55 percent of europeans are concerned about china 's growing role in the global economy compared with 51 percent in the us .
fears were strongest in france , where 64 percent saw china as a threat , and weakest in britain , where nearly 60 percent saw the country 's growth as an opportunity - and only 34 percent as cause for concern . across europe , 57 percent of germans , 59 percent of poles , 60 percent of italians and 62 percent of slovaks admitted to feeling uneasy about china 's growing economic role on the world stage . uneven playing field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european and american companies are facing increasing competition from china with public disquiet about china persistently high , us and eu authorities are currently stepping up pressure on beijing over trade issues on the grounds that the asian country profits from an unlevel playing field . both the eu and the us insist that china 's boom is helped by an artificially low exchange rate controlled by the state , and that their exports run up against unnecessary obstacles as well as copyright violation , the afp news agency reported thursday . a high-level eu delegation aired these concerns to beijing last week , while us treasury secretary henry paulson and other senior us administration officials will be in the chinese capital for high-level trade and investment talks next week . tightening trans-atlantic ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's rise as a world power has environmental repercussions meanwhile , the survey also revealed that some two-thirds of americans and europeans favor closer economic ties across the atlantic , with strong support for an initiative launched this year to tear down barriers to trade and investment between the world 's largest trading partners . " after more than five decades of robust trade and investment integration since world war ii , americans and europeans see even further gains to be made by deepening the trans-atlantic marketplace , " the german marshall fund 's president , craig kennedy , said in a statement . the first meeting of the trans-atlantic economic council took place last month , successfully negotiating regulatory issues ranging from accounting rules to standards for biofuels . only 52 percent in the united states and 53 percent in europe said they supported globalization , with both americans and europeans more likely to blame outsourcing , immigration and currency manipulation for job losses than trade , the poll showed . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 06.12.2007 germany suspicious about eu blue card plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue card would allow skilled professionals access to the eu labor market the german interior minister has expressed strong reservations about an eu-wide " blue card " at a meeting of ministers in brussels .
but the need to attract skilled foreign workers was widely acknowledged . wolfgang schäuble implicitly criticized frattini 's plans for a blue card by insisting that immigration should remain a competence of individual member states .
eu commission vice-president franco frattini said there had been a " broad consensus " on the benefits of granting work and residency permits to third-country professionals , given labor shortages and europe 's graying population .
and the justice , interior , employment and social policy ministers also agreed with the eu executive on the necessity of cracking down on undeclared workers , many of them exploited illegal immigrants .
portugal , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the so-called " jumbo council " aimed to produce a wide-ranging debate on this highly sensitive issue .
differing national priorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan aims to help reduce the number of illegal migrants and ministers also stressed different priorities and expressed diverging views on the issue .
mediterranean countries such as italy , spain and greece , for instance , emphasized the need to stop thousands of illegal migrants from north africa and asia .
while the czech republic and bulgaria said their workers should be given priority .
frattini has proposed increasing the eu 's attractivity to third- country professionals by offering them similar benefits to those currently enjoyed by their european colleagues .
candidates would be able to apply for a single work and residency permit , valid for a minimum of two years and renewable , and accepted throughout the union .
under the proposal , foreign white-collar workers would also be allowed to be joined by their families in their new country of residency .
germany 's main concern is that the eu might eventually impose quotas on the number of immigrants who can enter individual member states , an eventuality strongly denied by frattini .
" it is not up to brussels to decide how many engineers from third countries are necessary for germany or austria , " frattini said .
observers in brussels said germany could eventually decide not to adopt the blue card , rather than block the project altogether .
the dutch also voiced doubts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration commissioner frattini with commission president barroso the netherlands also expressed reservations over the proposal while austria called for further " clarifications " in the field of social security and minimum wages , saying it already offered higher levels .
britain , which has opted out of eu immigration policies altogether , outlined to ministers its alternative plan for a points- based system .
devised along the lines of a similar system in place in australia , it aims to ensure that only those migrants meeting the needs of the country would be allowed to enter and work .
the british proposal nevertheless reflects a more general shift towards a " pick and choose " approach to migration that is likely to adversely affect the future of lower-skilled third-country nationals seeking a better life in europe .
some 2 million third-country nationals enter the bloc each year , according to eu estimates , and there is little evidence to suggest this figure will drop significantly in the foreseeable future .
the inflow has been at times poorly managed fuelling growing resentment among ordinary citizens , opposition from nationalist parties and calls for stricter controls by government officials . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 06.12.2007 germans expect to see increase in corruption großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report reveals the extent of police corruption an annual corruption barometer reveals that germans have little faith in the government 's ability to tackle corruption , while citizens across the globe see politics as the institution most tainted by corruption . the fifth international corruption barometer report presented in berlin thursday , dec .
6 , - 3 days ahead of international corruption day on dec .
9 - revealed some surprisingly pessimistic attitudes . in germany , 69 percent of those questioned said they expected corruption to get worse in the next three years , 77 percent believe the government is failing to tackle corruption effectively .
only britain -lrb- 72 percent -rrb- and the netherlands -lrb- 73 percent -rrb- have a bleaker outlook . bulgaria -lrb- 32 percent -rrb- and romania -lrb- 36 percent -rrb- were confident that corruption can be dealt with .
both countries , however , have been chastised by the european union in the past for not doing enough to combat corruption . an overall global average of 54 percent of people said they believed corruption would get worse , compared to 43 percent four years ago .
only one in three were convinced that anti-corruption measures actually work . dirty politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no stranger to scandal germany 's gloomy predictions for the future problems could be a result of grand corruption cases and a perceived lack of political commitment to do something about them . this low public faith in government efforts to clamp down on corruption reflects a broad unease triggered by corporate corruption scandals - such as the volkswagen and siemens cases in germany . but it 's not just germany .
the watchdog asks respondents across the globe which institutions they see as most affected by corruption .
like most years , the institutions entrusted to represent the public interest in political decision-making are seen as the dirtiest . " our experience has shown that it is commitment at the top that will make or break efforts to fight corruption , " said cobus de swardt , transparency international 's managing director .
" these troubling numbers show that government faces a crisis of legitimacy , with the potential to undermine democratization , stability and the protection of human rights . " petty bribery rampant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albania has among the world 's highest levels of petty bribery but ultimately , poor families are the hardest hit by demands for bribes in developed as well as developing countries . globally , the police are the institution most frequently reported to demand bribes , but medical services also stand out as a common source of bribery demands in europe .
in latin america , asia-pacific and north america , petty bribery in the judiciary is a serious problem . " the police and the judiciary in many countries around the world are part of a cycle of corruption , demanding bribes from citizens , " de swardt said in a statement .
" this troubling finding means that corruption is interfering with the basic right to equal treatment before the law . " petty bribery is at its most widespread in albania and senegal , where 30 percent of respondents said they had been required to pay bribes to various authorities for access to services .
other countries with similarly high levels include cambodia , cameroon , macedonia , nigeria , pakistan , the philippines and romania . " this year 's global corruption barometer has made it clear that too often , people must part with their hard-earned money to pay for services that should be free , " said transparency international chair huguette labelle .
" and they do not see enough commitment when they look to their governments and leaders . " we are heartened though , that the public is increasingly demanding the accountability of the very institutions that most affect their lives , as this is a powerful driver of change , " she added . between june and september , gallup international on behalf of ti quizzed 63,000 people in 60 countries on their attitudes toward and experience of corruption . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 06.12.2007 germany suspicious about eu blue card plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue card would allow skilled professionals access to the eu labor market the german interior minister has expressed strong reservations about an eu-wide " blue card " at a meeting of ministers in brussels .
but the need to attract skilled foreign workers was widely acknowledged . wolfgang schäuble implicitly criticized frattini 's plans for a blue card by insisting that immigration should remain a competence of individual member states .
eu commission vice-president franco frattini said there had been a " broad consensus " on the benefits of granting work and residency permits to third-country professionals , given labor shortages and europe 's graying population .
and the justice , interior , employment and social policy ministers also agreed with the eu executive on the necessity of cracking down on undeclared workers , many of them exploited illegal immigrants .
portugal , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the so-called " jumbo council " aimed to produce a wide-ranging debate on this highly sensitive issue .
differing national priorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan aims to help reduce the number of illegal migrants and ministers also stressed different priorities and expressed diverging views on the issue .
mediterranean countries such as italy , spain and greece , for instance , emphasized the need to stop thousands of illegal migrants from north africa and asia .
while the czech republic and bulgaria said their workers should be given priority .
frattini has proposed increasing the eu 's attractivity to third- country professionals by offering them similar benefits to those currently enjoyed by their european colleagues .
candidates would be able to apply for a single work and residency permit , valid for a minimum of two years and renewable , and accepted throughout the union .
under the proposal , foreign white-collar workers would also be allowed to be joined by their families in their new country of residency .
germany 's main concern is that the eu might eventually impose quotas on the number of immigrants who can enter individual member states , an eventuality strongly denied by frattini .
" it is not up to brussels to decide how many engineers from third countries are necessary for germany or austria , " frattini said .
observers in brussels said germany could eventually decide not to adopt the blue card , rather than block the project altogether .
the dutch also voiced doubts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration commissioner frattini with commission president barroso the netherlands also expressed reservations over the proposal while austria called for further " clarifications " in the field of social security and minimum wages , saying it already offered higher levels .
britain , which has opted out of eu immigration policies altogether , outlined to ministers its alternative plan for a points- based system .
devised along the lines of a similar system in place in australia , it aims to ensure that only those migrants meeting the needs of the country would be allowed to enter and work .
the british proposal nevertheless reflects a more general shift towards a " pick and choose " approach to migration that is likely to adversely affect the future of lower-skilled third-country nationals seeking a better life in europe .
some 2 million third-country nationals enter the bloc each year , according to eu estimates , and there is little evidence to suggest this figure will drop significantly in the foreseeable future .
the inflow has been at times poorly managed fuelling growing resentment among ordinary citizens , opposition from nationalist parties and calls for stricter controls by government officials . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" opening the internal market for defense products will improve the competitiveness of the technological and industrial base of the european defense sector , " commission vice president günter verheugen said in a statement .
verheugen also stressed that he saw the move as " fundamental to establishing europe 's autonomy in this field . "
with the eu lagging far behind the us in defense spending , he said that public opposition to increasing expenditure in this sector meant that the eu had to spend more efficiently .
defense is the exclusive domain of the bloc 's 27 member states .
but verheugen said the policy came under the eu 's single market powers , and was not a defense policy per se .
stopping countries avoiding competition law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen stressed the importance of self-sufficiency the proposals tabled by the commission are designed to discourage countries from using a national defense clause to buy military and spare parts and avoid eu procurement rules .
they would not impact on the purchase of arms , munitions and war materials or other sensitive non-military procurements in areas such as counter-terrorism . the initiative is also intended to co-ordinate different national procurement rules , which have proved a major hurdle .
verheugen , who is also industry commissioner , said the complex mix of national legislation and controls on the transfer of defense equipment currently in place had even helped encourage the mass use of the exemption .
" if you just want a spare tyre , for example , for a defense vehicle , you 've got to go through the same authorization procedure as if you were selling a gun outside the european union , " he explained .
he said the new measures would apply " perhaps not to the whole tank but for example the spare tyre .
not to a mortar or motor for a fighter plane , but for components or spare parts . "
measures to boost transparency and cut red tape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal relates to spares rather than whole tanks internal market and services commissioner charlie mccreevy said : " introducing transparent and competitive procurement rules applicable throughout the eu is crucial for the establishment of a common defense market .
this will lead to greater openness of defense markets between member states to the benefit of all : armed forces , taxpayers and industries . "
he said the commission would have the same powers to fine non-compliant member states as in other areas of eu policy .
the european defense agency , formed in 2004 to help eu member nations improve their military capabilities , welcomed the commission 's plans , even though its own attempts to achieve similar results have borne little fruit .
" the european market for tanks does not operate in the same way as the market for washing machines , " said new eda chief executive alexander weis .

" opening the internal market for defense products will improve the competitiveness of the technological and industrial base of the european defense sector , " commission vice president günter verheugen said in a statement .
verheugen also stressed that he saw the move as " fundamental to establishing europe 's autonomy in this field . "
with the eu lagging far behind the us in defense spending , he said that public opposition to increasing expenditure in this sector meant that the eu had to spend more efficiently .
defense is the exclusive domain of the bloc 's 27 member states .
but verheugen said the policy came under the eu 's single market powers , and was not a defense policy per se .
stopping countries avoiding competition law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen stressed the importance of self-sufficiency the proposals tabled by the commission are designed to discourage countries from using a national defense clause to buy military and spare parts and avoid eu procurement rules .
they would not impact on the purchase of arms , munitions and war materials or other sensitive non-military procurements in areas such as counter-terrorism . the initiative is also intended to co-ordinate different national procurement rules , which have proved a major hurdle .
verheugen , who is also industry commissioner , said the complex mix of national legislation and controls on the transfer of defense equipment currently in place had even helped encourage the mass use of the exemption .
" if you just want a spare tyre , for example , for a defense vehicle , you 've got to go through the same authorization procedure as if you were selling a gun outside the european union , " he explained .
he said the new measures would apply " perhaps not to the whole tank but for example the spare tyre .
not to a mortar or motor for a fighter plane , but for components or spare parts . "
measures to boost transparency and cut red tape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal relates to spares rather than whole tanks internal market and services commissioner charlie mccreevy said : " introducing transparent and competitive procurement rules applicable throughout the eu is crucial for the establishment of a common defense market .
this will lead to greater openness of defense markets between member states to the benefit of all : armed forces , taxpayers and industries . "
he said the commission would have the same powers to fine non-compliant member states as in other areas of eu policy .
the european defense agency , formed in 2004 to help eu member nations improve their military capabilities , welcomed the commission 's plans , even though its own attempts to achieve similar results have borne little fruit .
" the european market for tanks does not operate in the same way as the market for washing machines , " said new eda chief executive alexander weis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 06.12.2007 eu seeks to open up defense market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu sees defense as an industry which should be open to competition like many others the european commission has proposed a bundle of new measures to promote innovation and competitiveness and stop national protectionism in europe 's defense industry . " opening the internal market for defense products will improve the competitiveness of the technological and industrial base of the european defense sector , " commission vice president günter verheugen said in a statement .
verheugen also stressed that he saw the move as " fundamental to establishing europe 's autonomy in this field . "
with the eu lagging far behind the us in defense spending , he said that public opposition to increasing expenditure in this sector meant that the eu had to spend more efficiently .
defense is the exclusive domain of the bloc 's 27 member states .
but verheugen said the policy came under the eu 's single market powers , and was not a defense policy per se .
stopping countries avoiding competition law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen stressed the importance of self-sufficiency the proposals tabled by the commission are designed to discourage countries from using a national defense clause to buy military and spare parts and avoid eu procurement rules .
they would not impact on the purchase of arms , munitions and war materials or other sensitive non-military procurements in areas such as counter-terrorism . the initiative is also intended to co-ordinate different national procurement rules , which have proved a major hurdle .
verheugen , who is also industry commissioner , said the complex mix of national legislation and controls on the transfer of defense equipment currently in place had even helped encourage the mass use of the exemption .
" if you just want a spare tyre , for example , for a defense vehicle , you 've got to go through the same authorization procedure as if you were selling a gun outside the european union , " he explained .
he said the new measures would apply " perhaps not to the whole tank but for example the spare tyre .
not to a mortar or motor for a fighter plane , but for components or spare parts . "
measures to boost transparency and cut red tape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal relates to spares rather than whole tanks internal market and services commissioner charlie mccreevy said : " introducing transparent and competitive procurement rules applicable throughout the eu is crucial for the establishment of a common defense market .
this will lead to greater openness of defense markets between member states to the benefit of all : armed forces , taxpayers and industries . "
he said the commission would have the same powers to fine non-compliant member states as in other areas of eu policy .
the european defense agency , formed in 2004 to help eu member nations improve their military capabilities , welcomed the commission 's plans , even though its own attempts to achieve similar results have borne little fruit .
" the european market for tanks does not operate in the same way as the market for washing machines , " said new eda chief executive alexander weis .
europe 's defense industry accounts for around 30 percent of world production and has more than 300 000 employees , according to commission figures . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 06.12.2007 germany suspicious about eu blue card plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue card would allow skilled professionals access to the eu labor market the german interior minister has expressed strong reservations about an eu-wide " blue card " at a meeting of ministers in brussels .
but the need to attract skilled foreign workers was widely acknowledged . wolfgang schäuble implicitly criticized frattini 's plans for a blue card by insisting that immigration should remain a competence of individual member states .
eu commission vice-president franco frattini said there had been a " broad consensus " on the benefits of granting work and residency permits to third-country professionals , given labor shortages and europe 's graying population .
and the justice , interior , employment and social policy ministers also agreed with the eu executive on the necessity of cracking down on undeclared workers , many of them exploited illegal immigrants .
portugal , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the so-called " jumbo council " aimed to produce a wide-ranging debate on this highly sensitive issue .
differing national priorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan aims to help reduce the number of illegal migrants and ministers also stressed different priorities and expressed diverging views on the issue .
mediterranean countries such as italy , spain and greece , for instance , emphasized the need to stop thousands of illegal migrants from north africa and asia .
while the czech republic and bulgaria said their workers should be given priority .
frattini has proposed increasing the eu 's attractivity to third- country professionals by offering them similar benefits to those currently enjoyed by their european colleagues .
candidates would be able to apply for a single work and residency permit , valid for a minimum of two years and renewable , and accepted throughout the union .
under the proposal , foreign white-collar workers would also be allowed to be joined by their families in their new country of residency .
germany 's main concern is that the eu might eventually impose quotas on the number of immigrants who can enter individual member states , an eventuality strongly denied by frattini .
" it is not up to brussels to decide how many engineers from third countries are necessary for germany or austria , " frattini said .
observers in brussels said germany could eventually decide not to adopt the blue card , rather than block the project altogether .
the dutch also voiced doubts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration commissioner frattini with commission president barroso the netherlands also expressed reservations over the proposal while austria called for further " clarifications " in the field of social security and minimum wages , saying it already offered higher levels .
britain , which has opted out of eu immigration policies altogether , outlined to ministers its alternative plan for a points- based system .
devised along the lines of a similar system in place in australia , it aims to ensure that only those migrants meeting the needs of the country would be allowed to enter and work .
the british proposal nevertheless reflects a more general shift towards a " pick and choose " approach to migration that is likely to adversely affect the future of lower-skilled third-country nationals seeking a better life in europe .
some 2 million third-country nationals enter the bloc each year , according to eu estimates , and there is little evidence to suggest this figure will drop significantly in the foreseeable future .
the inflow has been at times poorly managed fuelling growing resentment among ordinary citizens , opposition from nationalist parties and calls for stricter controls by government officials . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the need to attract skilled foreign workers was widely acknowledged . wolfgang schäuble implicitly criticized frattini 's plans for a blue card by insisting that immigration should remain a competence of individual member states .
eu commission vice-president franco frattini said there had been a " broad consensus " on the benefits of granting work and residency permits to third-country professionals , given labor shortages and europe 's graying population .
and the justice , interior , employment and social policy ministers also agreed with the eu executive on the necessity of cracking down on undeclared workers , many of them exploited illegal immigrants .
portugal , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the so-called " jumbo council " aimed to produce a wide-ranging debate on this highly sensitive issue .
differing national priorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan aims to help reduce the number of illegal migrants and ministers also stressed different priorities and expressed diverging views on the issue .
mediterranean countries such as italy , spain and greece , for instance , emphasized the need to stop thousands of illegal migrants from north africa and asia .
while the czech republic and bulgaria said their workers should be given priority .
frattini has proposed increasing the eu 's attractivity to third- country professionals by offering them similar benefits to those currently enjoyed by their european colleagues .
candidates would be able to apply for a single work and residency permit , valid for a minimum of two years and renewable , and accepted throughout the union .
under the proposal , foreign white-collar workers would also be allowed to be joined by their families in their new country of residency .
germany 's main concern is that the eu might eventually impose quotas on the number of immigrants who can enter individual member states , an eventuality strongly denied by frattini .
" it is not up to brussels to decide how many engineers from third countries are necessary for germany or austria , " frattini said .
observers in brussels said germany could eventually decide not to adopt the blue card , rather than block the project altogether .
the dutch also voiced doubts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration commissioner frattini with commission president barroso the netherlands also expressed reservations over the proposal while austria called for further " clarifications " in the field of social security and minimum wages , saying it already offered higher levels .
britain , which has opted out of eu immigration policies altogether , outlined to ministers its alternative plan for a points- based system .
devised along the lines of a similar system in place in australia , it aims to ensure that only those migrants meeting the needs of the country would be allowed to enter and work .
the british proposal nevertheless reflects a more general shift towards a " pick and choose " approach to migration that is likely to adversely affect the future of lower-skilled third-country nationals seeking a better life in europe .
some 2 million third-country nationals enter the bloc each year , according to eu estimates , and there is little evidence to suggest this figure will drop significantly in the foreseeable future .

but the need to attract skilled foreign workers was widely acknowledged . wolfgang schäuble implicitly criticized frattini 's plans for a blue card by insisting that immigration should remain a competence of individual member states .
eu commission vice-president franco frattini said there had been a " broad consensus " on the benefits of granting work and residency permits to third-country professionals , given labor shortages and europe 's graying population .
and the justice , interior , employment and social policy ministers also agreed with the eu executive on the necessity of cracking down on undeclared workers , many of them exploited illegal immigrants .
portugal , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the so-called " jumbo council " aimed to produce a wide-ranging debate on this highly sensitive issue .
differing national priorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan aims to help reduce the number of illegal migrants and ministers also stressed different priorities and expressed diverging views on the issue .
mediterranean countries such as italy , spain and greece , for instance , emphasized the need to stop thousands of illegal migrants from north africa and asia .
while the czech republic and bulgaria said their workers should be given priority .
frattini has proposed increasing the eu 's attractivity to third- country professionals by offering them similar benefits to those currently enjoyed by their european colleagues .
candidates would be able to apply for a single work and residency permit , valid for a minimum of two years and renewable , and accepted throughout the union .
under the proposal , foreign white-collar workers would also be allowed to be joined by their families in their new country of residency .
germany 's main concern is that the eu might eventually impose quotas on the number of immigrants who can enter individual member states , an eventuality strongly denied by frattini .
" it is not up to brussels to decide how many engineers from third countries are necessary for germany or austria , " frattini said .
observers in brussels said germany could eventually decide not to adopt the blue card , rather than block the project altogether .
the dutch also voiced doubts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration commissioner frattini with commission president barroso the netherlands also expressed reservations over the proposal while austria called for further " clarifications " in the field of social security and minimum wages , saying it already offered higher levels .
britain , which has opted out of eu immigration policies altogether , outlined to ministers its alternative plan for a points- based system .
devised along the lines of a similar system in place in australia , it aims to ensure that only those migrants meeting the needs of the country would be allowed to enter and work .
the british proposal nevertheless reflects a more general shift towards a " pick and choose " approach to migration that is likely to adversely affect the future of lower-skilled third-country nationals seeking a better life in europe .
some 2 million third-country nationals enter the bloc each year , according to eu estimates , and there is little evidence to suggest this figure will drop significantly in the foreseeable future .
the inflow has been at times poorly managed fuelling growing resentment among ordinary citizens , opposition from nationalist parties and calls for stricter controls by government officials . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they would not impact on the purchase of arms , munitions and war materials or other sensitive non-military procurements in areas such as counter-terrorism . the initiative is also intended to co-ordinate different national procurement rules , which have proved a major hurdle .
verheugen , who is also industry commissioner , said the complex mix of national legislation and controls on the transfer of defense equipment currently in place had even helped encourage the mass use of the exemption .
" if you just want a spare tyre , for example , for a defense vehicle , you 've got to go through the same authorization procedure as if you were selling a gun outside the european union , " he explained .
he said the new measures would apply " perhaps not to the whole tank but for example the spare tyre .

" opening the internal market for defense products will improve the competitiveness of the technological and industrial base of the european defense sector , " commission vice president günter verheugen said in a statement .
verheugen also stressed that he saw the move as " fundamental to establishing europe 's autonomy in this field . "
with the eu lagging far behind the us in defense spending , he said that public opposition to increasing expenditure in this sector meant that the eu had to spend more efficiently .
defense is the exclusive domain of the bloc 's 27 member states .
but verheugen said the policy came under the eu 's single market powers , and was not a defense policy per se .
stopping countries avoiding competition law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen stressed the importance of self-sufficiency the proposals tabled by the commission are designed to discourage countries from using a national defense clause to buy military and spare parts and avoid eu procurement rules .
they would not impact on the purchase of arms , munitions and war materials or other sensitive non-military procurements in areas such as counter-terrorism . the initiative is also intended to co-ordinate different national procurement rules , which have proved a major hurdle .
verheugen , who is also industry commissioner , said the complex mix of national legislation and controls on the transfer of defense equipment currently in place had even helped encourage the mass use of the exemption .
" if you just want a spare tyre , for example , for a defense vehicle , you 've got to go through the same authorization procedure as if you were selling a gun outside the european union , " he explained .
he said the new measures would apply " perhaps not to the whole tank but for example the spare tyre .
not to a mortar or motor for a fighter plane , but for components or spare parts . "
measures to boost transparency and cut red tape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal relates to spares rather than whole tanks internal market and services commissioner charlie mccreevy said : " introducing transparent and competitive procurement rules applicable throughout the eu is crucial for the establishment of a common defense market .
this will lead to greater openness of defense markets between member states to the benefit of all : armed forces , taxpayers and industries . "
he said the commission would have the same powers to fine non-compliant member states as in other areas of eu policy .
the european defense agency , formed in 2004 to help eu member nations improve their military capabilities , welcomed the commission 's plans , even though its own attempts to achieve similar results have borne little fruit .

merkel reacted by suggesting that such an affiliation of nations could lead to " a corrosion of the eu in its core area " and " could release explosive powers in the eu . "
such a frankly undiplomatic reaction was unusual under the circumstances , and suggested that merkel may have reached a point in her relationship with the french president where she felt it necessary to go public with her discontent .
merkel unhappy with sarkozy 's tactics bildunterschrift : for relations between the two leaders had already begun to sour well before this disagreement , due in no small part to sarkozy 's propensity for unilateral action and self-promotion .
this began as early as the so-called eu mini-treaty , on which merkel - as head of the union when germany held the rotating eu presidency - had been working for months before sarkozy renamed it and claimed it as his own .

merkel reacted by suggesting that such an affiliation of nations could lead to " a corrosion of the eu in its core area " and " could release explosive powers in the eu . "
such a frankly undiplomatic reaction was unusual under the circumstances , and suggested that merkel may have reached a point in her relationship with the french president where she felt it necessary to go public with her discontent .
merkel unhappy with sarkozy 's tactics bildunterschrift : for relations between the two leaders had already begun to sour well before this disagreement , due in no small part to sarkozy 's propensity for unilateral action and self-promotion .
this began as early as the so-called eu mini-treaty , on which merkel - as head of the union when germany held the rotating eu presidency - had been working for months before sarkozy renamed it and claimed it as his own .
later , the french president ruffled german - and european - feathers when he sent his wife cecilia to libya to negotiate the freedom of bulgarian nurses sentenced to death for allegedly infecting children with aids .
the problem was that brussels had been negotiating their freedom for a long time , particularly under german eu presidency , and had apparently been close to a resolution of the crisis .
the subsequent agreement in which france is to supply libya with a nuclear reactor for the desalination of sea water sparked criticism from both parties in germany 's ruling coalition , although government sources claimed it had not caused a rift in bilateral relations .
putin call highlights divisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy strayed from the eu line on the russian elections finally , the recent election triumph of russian president vladimir putin exposed deep rifts in the policies of the two neighbours towards russia .
while the german government called the elections to the russian duma " neither fair , equal nor democratic , " sarkozy was one of the rare world leaders to offer the russian president his unqualified congratulations .
thursday evening 's summit will be primarily devoted to european issues , but the two leaders may use it to ease some of the tension that has begun to afflict relations since sarkozy became french president less than eight months ago . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical -pipe- 06.12.2007 german ensemble releases cd of lou reed 's loudest album großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reed 's 1975 feedback experiment is back - in classic black the group zeitkratzer has drawn good reviews with a classical version of metal machine music - the 1975 feedback experiment that almost finished lou reed ’ s career . it 's got no beat , and you definitely ca n't dance to it .
lou reed 's metal machine music - a punishing 50 minutes of guitar feedback looped together and sped up to twice its normal speed - was hated by both critics and fans when it was originally released in the mid-70s .
some drew comparisons with a dentist 's drill boring away at an infected tooth , while others dismissed the double album as a bid by reed to get out of his record contract .
but the berlin-based avant-garde ensemble zeitkratzer has given the composition a new lease on life , scoring it for classical instruments and recasting it as a piece of minimalist new music .
the cd-dvd was recorded live with reed in 2002 but only released this autumn due to copyright issues - an ironic twist since rca recalled the original metal machine music from record stores after three weeks and told reed he 'd never make another album .
zeitkratzer 's version has drawn praise from both the high-brow new york times and hip indie-music websites like pitchfork .
group members say listening habits have caught up with reed 's ideas .
“ noise has long established itself as a standard element in rock music , ” ulrich krieger , the former zeitkratzer saxophonist who transcribed reed 's original record , told dw-world .
“ people are accustomed to pop bands who make the charts like jesus and the mary chain or nirvana building up dissonant walls of feedback . ”
come on , feel the noise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writing out the score for brass , strings , piano and percussion was a massive task in an interview before the performance , which took place as part of berlin 's annual “ march music ” festival , reed stressed the corporeal nature of his work .
“ it 's everything i like about rock music , ” reed said , thumping his chest and his thigh .
“ i like to feel music physically , here and down here .
and i 'm a guitarist .
i like electric guitars . ”
the zeitkratzer performance is also physically strenuous .
the brass players go red in the face sustaining what were originally minute-long hums of feedback , and the string section often looks in danger of cardiac arrest as it frenetically saws its way through oscillating patterns of sound .
and the ten-person ensemble faced other challenges performing a piece with no fixed tempo or time signature .
“ we use three exactly synchronized clocks , ” zeitkratzer pianist and leader reinhold friedl told dw-world .
“ everyone can see them .
we know , for instance , that we have to come together for a transition at 7 minutes , 16 seconds .
we exchange glances and then wham ! ”

the 4 sides of the original record were in fact shortened into 3 movements because reed felt it would be asking too much of the audience to listen to the whole thing .
and friedl cautioned that anyone purchasing the disc expecting anything like usual lou reed would soon be selling it on ebay .
at the same time , the ensemble version takes away some of the incredible harshness of the original and makes it much easier to hear the individual figures within the music .
occasionally , it even sounds sort of melodic .
“ the instrumental sound is much richer , ” friedl said .
“ and of course , it 's something different when you have ten people playing , instead of just two hard-edged guitar feedbacks that have also been pitched up on octave . ”
but is it classical or rock music ?
“ metal machine music is the translation of both the freedom of free improvisation and the sound structures of new music into a rock aesthetic , ” said krieger .
“ for me it combines two different worlds , which were both important twentieth-century cultural movements , but which ran parallel to one another without ever really overlapping .
it 's a kind of a best-of-all-worlds situation . ”
in other words , it 's a very different way for the musically adventurous to take a walk on the wild side .

lou reed 's metal machine music - a punishing 50 minutes of guitar feedback looped together and sped up to twice its normal speed - was hated by both critics and fans when it was originally released in the mid-70s .
some drew comparisons with a dentist 's drill boring away at an infected tooth , while others dismissed the double album as a bid by reed to get out of his record contract .
but the berlin-based avant-garde ensemble zeitkratzer has given the composition a new lease on life , scoring it for classical instruments and recasting it as a piece of minimalist new music .
the cd-dvd was recorded live with reed in 2002 but only released this autumn due to copyright issues - an ironic twist since rca recalled the original metal machine music from record stores after three weeks and told reed he 'd never make another album .
zeitkratzer 's version has drawn praise from both the high-brow new york times and hip indie-music websites like pitchfork .
group members say listening habits have caught up with reed 's ideas .
“ noise has long established itself as a standard element in rock music , ” ulrich krieger , the former zeitkratzer saxophonist who transcribed reed 's original record , told dw-world .
“ people are accustomed to pop bands who make the charts like jesus and the mary chain or nirvana building up dissonant walls of feedback . ”
come on , feel the noise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writing out the score for brass , strings , piano and percussion was a massive task in an interview before the performance , which took place as part of berlin 's annual “ march music ” festival , reed stressed the corporeal nature of his work .
“ it 's everything i like about rock music , ” reed said , thumping his chest and his thigh .
“ i like to feel music physically , here and down here .
and i 'm a guitarist .
i like electric guitars . ”
the zeitkratzer performance is also physically strenuous .
the brass players go red in the face sustaining what were originally minute-long hums of feedback , and the string section often looks in danger of cardiac arrest as it frenetically saws its way through oscillating patterns of sound .
and the ten-person ensemble faced other challenges performing a piece with no fixed tempo or time signature .
“ we use three exactly synchronized clocks , ” zeitkratzer pianist and leader reinhold friedl told dw-world .
“ everyone can see them .
we know , for instance , that we have to come together for a transition at 7 minutes , 16 seconds .
we exchange glances and then wham ! ”

the 4 sides of the original record were in fact shortened into 3 movements because reed felt it would be asking too much of the audience to listen to the whole thing .
and friedl cautioned that anyone purchasing the disc expecting anything like usual lou reed would soon be selling it on ebay .
at the same time , the ensemble version takes away some of the incredible harshness of the original and makes it much easier to hear the individual figures within the music .
occasionally , it even sounds sort of melodic .
“ the instrumental sound is much richer , ” friedl said .
“ and of course , it 's something different when you have ten people playing , instead of just two hard-edged guitar feedbacks that have also been pitched up on octave . ”
but is it classical or rock music ?
“ metal machine music is the translation of both the freedom of free improvisation and the sound structures of new music into a rock aesthetic , ” said krieger .
“ for me it combines two different worlds , which were both important twentieth-century cultural movements , but which ran parallel to one another without ever really overlapping .
it 's a kind of a best-of-all-worlds situation . ”
in other words , it 's a very different way for the musically adventurous to take a walk on the wild side .

the energy companies are allowed to continue building coal-fired power plants .

nonetheless , germany has nothing to be ashamed of at the un climate change conference in bali .
other countries have failed miserably to come up with similarly concrete plans on curbing carbon emissions in the areas of energy production , households , industry and transport . germany is clearly trying to do its bit for the polar bears in the artic .
but their fate is still on thin ice .

" hertha bsc was not infected by national-socialism , " said historian daniel koerfer of berlin 's freie university , who had been hired by the bundesliga club to investigate its past . " there was no resistance against the regime , but also no deeply seated fanatical enthusiasm for the party and its leadership , aside from admiration for hitler until far into the second world war , " koerfer wrote in the 70-page study .
" there was no strongly pronounced anti-semitism either - but there were also no attempts to really take a stand against the state-mandated racist delusion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 06.12.2007 eu hopes observers monitor russian presidential poll großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president putin 's manipulation and domination of the media was criticized the eu hopes that russia will invite international observers to its presidential elections , despite blocking a similar mission to recent parliamentary elections , the bloc 's foreign affairs commissioner said . " we do hope for the future presidential elections on march 2 that there will be an invitation to organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- observers in due time and in an appropriate way , " eu foreign affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said on wednesday , dec .
5 . on sunday , russia held parliamentary elections which handed a massive victory to the united russia party backed by president vladimir putin . putin 's constitutional term of office expires next year , but he is widely expected to use the party 's strong position to find some way of keeping power .
sunday 's elections were marred by allegations of systematic media bias , pressure on voters and harassment of opposition politicians . but evidence confirming those allegations was hard to come by , as the osce - the main body which oversees elections in europe - had cancelled a planned large-scale observation mission , claiming that the russian authorities had refused visas to most of its staff . observers lament state media control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united russia 's " our choice is putin " campaign had blanket coverage on monday , those members of the osce who had been able to observe parts of the election said that it had not conformed to international standards of democracy .
russian opposition parties echoed the claims . " television coverage was monopolized by the ruling party , " the osce 's representative for freedom of the media , miklos haraszti , complained in a statement focusing on the media bias . there were " several cases of harassment and violence against the independent media " which " contributed to the intimidating atmosphere , " he said .
" monitoring by the central electoral commission and the -lsb- non-governmental organization -rsb- russian union of journalists showed a clear bias in favor of the ruling party candidates on the main television channels .

lou reed 's metal machine music - a punishing 50 minutes of guitar feedback looped together and sped up to twice its normal speed - was hated by both critics and fans when it was originally released in the mid-70s .
some drew comparisons with a dentist 's drill boring away at an infected tooth , while others dismissed the double album as a bid by reed to get out of his record contract .
but the berlin-based avant-garde ensemble zeitkratzer has given the composition a new lease on life , scoring it for classical instruments and recasting it as a piece of minimalist new music .
the cd-dvd was recorded live with reed in 2002 but only released this autumn due to copyright issues - an ironic twist since rca recalled the original metal machine music from record stores after three weeks and told reed he 'd never make another album .
zeitkratzer 's version has drawn praise from both the high-brow new york times and hip indie-music websites like pitchfork .
group members say listening habits have caught up with reed 's ideas .
“ noise has long established itself as a standard element in rock music , ” ulrich krieger , the former zeitkratzer saxophonist who transcribed reed 's original record , told dw-world .
“ people are accustomed to pop bands who make the charts like jesus and the mary chain or nirvana building up dissonant walls of feedback . ”
come on , feel the noise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writing out the score for brass , strings , piano and percussion was a massive task in an interview before the performance , which took place as part of berlin 's annual “ march music ” festival , reed stressed the corporeal nature of his work .
“ it 's everything i like about rock music , ” reed said , thumping his chest and his thigh .
“ i like to feel music physically , here and down here .
and i 'm a guitarist .
i like electric guitars . ”
the zeitkratzer performance is also physically strenuous .
the brass players go red in the face sustaining what were originally minute-long hums of feedback , and the string section often looks in danger of cardiac arrest as it frenetically saws its way through oscillating patterns of sound .
and the ten-person ensemble faced other challenges performing a piece with no fixed tempo or time signature .
“ we use three exactly synchronized clocks , ” zeitkratzer pianist and leader reinhold friedl told dw-world .
“ everyone can see them .
we know , for instance , that we have to come together for a transition at 7 minutes , 16 seconds .
we exchange glances and then wham ! ”

the 4 sides of the original record were in fact shortened into 3 movements because reed felt it would be asking too much of the audience to listen to the whole thing .
and friedl cautioned that anyone purchasing the disc expecting anything like usual lou reed would soon be selling it on ebay .
at the same time , the ensemble version takes away some of the incredible harshness of the original and makes it much easier to hear the individual figures within the music .
occasionally , it even sounds sort of melodic .
“ the instrumental sound is much richer , ” friedl said .
“ and of course , it 's something different when you have ten people playing , instead of just two hard-edged guitar feedbacks that have also been pitched up on octave . ”
but is it classical or rock music ?
“ metal machine music is the translation of both the freedom of free improvisation and the sound structures of new music into a rock aesthetic , ” said krieger .
“ for me it combines two different worlds , which were both important twentieth-century cultural movements , but which ran parallel to one another without ever really overlapping .
it 's a kind of a best-of-all-worlds situation . ”
in other words , it 's a very different way for the musically adventurous to take a walk on the wild side .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical -pipe- 06.12.2007 german ensemble releases cd of lou reed 's loudest album großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reed 's 1975 feedback experiment is back - in classic black the group zeitkratzer has drawn good reviews with a classical version of metal machine music - the 1975 feedback experiment that almost finished lou reed ’ s career . it 's got no beat , and you definitely ca n't dance to it .
lou reed 's metal machine music - a punishing 50 minutes of guitar feedback looped together and sped up to twice its normal speed - was hated by both critics and fans when it was originally released in the mid-70s .
some drew comparisons with a dentist 's drill boring away at an infected tooth , while others dismissed the double album as a bid by reed to get out of his record contract .
but the berlin-based avant-garde ensemble zeitkratzer has given the composition a new lease on life , scoring it for classical instruments and recasting it as a piece of minimalist new music .
the cd-dvd was recorded live with reed in 2002 but only released this autumn due to copyright issues - an ironic twist since rca recalled the original metal machine music from record stores after three weeks and told reed he 'd never make another album .
zeitkratzer 's version has drawn praise from both the high-brow new york times and hip indie-music websites like pitchfork .
group members say listening habits have caught up with reed 's ideas .
“ noise has long established itself as a standard element in rock music , ” ulrich krieger , the former zeitkratzer saxophonist who transcribed reed 's original record , told dw-world .
“ people are accustomed to pop bands who make the charts like jesus and the mary chain or nirvana building up dissonant walls of feedback . ”
come on , feel the noise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writing out the score for brass , strings , piano and percussion was a massive task in an interview before the performance , which took place as part of berlin 's annual “ march music ” festival , reed stressed the corporeal nature of his work .
“ it 's everything i like about rock music , ” reed said , thumping his chest and his thigh .
“ i like to feel music physically , here and down here .
and i 'm a guitarist .
i like electric guitars . ”
the zeitkratzer performance is also physically strenuous .
the brass players go red in the face sustaining what were originally minute-long hums of feedback , and the string section often looks in danger of cardiac arrest as it frenetically saws its way through oscillating patterns of sound .
and the ten-person ensemble faced other challenges performing a piece with no fixed tempo or time signature .
“ we use three exactly synchronized clocks , ” zeitkratzer pianist and leader reinhold friedl told dw-world .
“ everyone can see them .
we know , for instance , that we have to come together for a transition at 7 minutes , 16 seconds .
we exchange glances and then wham ! ”
do n't expect sweet jane bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original 1975 record was a commercial and critical bomb there 's no shortage of whams and blams , screeches and scratches , hums and hoots on the zeitkratzer cd .
the 4 sides of the original record were in fact shortened into 3 movements because reed felt it would be asking too much of the audience to listen to the whole thing .
and friedl cautioned that anyone purchasing the disc expecting anything like usual lou reed would soon be selling it on ebay .
at the same time , the ensemble version takes away some of the incredible harshness of the original and makes it much easier to hear the individual figures within the music .
occasionally , it even sounds sort of melodic .
“ the instrumental sound is much richer , ” friedl said .
“ and of course , it 's something different when you have ten people playing , instead of just two hard-edged guitar feedbacks that have also been pitched up on octave . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 06.12.2007 eu hopes observers monitor russian presidential poll großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president putin 's manipulation and domination of the media was criticized the eu hopes that russia will invite international observers to its presidential elections , despite blocking a similar mission to recent parliamentary elections , the bloc 's foreign affairs commissioner said . " we do hope for the future presidential elections on march 2 that there will be an invitation to organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- observers in due time and in an appropriate way , " eu foreign affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said on wednesday , dec .
5 . on sunday , russia held parliamentary elections which handed a massive victory to the united russia party backed by president vladimir putin . putin 's constitutional term of office expires next year , but he is widely expected to use the party 's strong position to find some way of keeping power .
sunday 's elections were marred by allegations of systematic media bias , pressure on voters and harassment of opposition politicians . but evidence confirming those allegations was hard to come by , as the osce - the main body which oversees elections in europe - had cancelled a planned large-scale observation mission , claiming that the russian authorities had refused visas to most of its staff . observers lament state media control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united russia 's " our choice is putin " campaign had blanket coverage on monday , those members of the osce who had been able to observe parts of the election said that it had not conformed to international standards of democracy .
russian opposition parties echoed the claims . " television coverage was monopolized by the ruling party , " the osce 's representative for freedom of the media , miklos haraszti , complained in a statement focusing on the media bias . there were " several cases of harassment and violence against the independent media " which " contributed to the intimidating atmosphere , " he said .
" monitoring by the central electoral commission and the -lsb- non-governmental organization -rsb- russian union of journalists showed a clear bias in favor of the ruling party candidates on the main television channels . " combined coverage of russian president vladimir putin , the government and the ruling united russia party amounted to about 80 percent of all political coverage on national channels . haraszti said he had submitted to russian foreign minister sergey lavrov a list of incidents where media freedom had been violated during the election campaign . list of violations sent as warning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers want to see more transparency in may the report should act as a reminder to russia " of its commitment to guarantee a free and fair media coverage during elections , " he said . the findings " are an early warning in view of the march 2008 presidential election , " haraszti said .
" i ask the new state duma to ensure the right of the media to provide balanced and objective information . " the us , eu and germany all joined in criticizing the elections and called on the russian authorities to investigate the allegations of improper conduct . but the kremlin rejected all accusations , insisting that the elections had been free and fair and saying that foreign criticism was part of a us plot to tarnish russia 's image . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do hope for the future presidential elections on march 2 that there will be an invitation to organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- observers in due time and in an appropriate way , " eu foreign affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said on wednesday , dec .
5 . on sunday , russia held parliamentary elections which handed a massive victory to the united russia party backed by president vladimir putin . putin 's constitutional term of office expires next year , but he is widely expected to use the party 's strong position to find some way of keeping power .
sunday 's elections were marred by allegations of systematic media bias , pressure on voters and harassment of opposition politicians . but evidence confirming those allegations was hard to come by , as the osce - the main body which oversees elections in europe - had cancelled a planned large-scale observation mission , claiming that the russian authorities had refused visas to most of its staff . observers lament state media control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united russia 's " our choice is putin " campaign had blanket coverage on monday , those members of the osce who had been able to observe parts of the election said that it had not conformed to international standards of democracy .
russian opposition parties echoed the claims . " television coverage was monopolized by the ruling party , " the osce 's representative for freedom of the media , miklos haraszti , complained in a statement focusing on the media bias . there were " several cases of harassment and violence against the independent media " which " contributed to the intimidating atmosphere , " he said .
" monitoring by the central electoral commission and the -lsb- non-governmental organization -rsb- russian union of journalists showed a clear bias in favor of the ruling party candidates on the main television channels . " combined coverage of russian president vladimir putin , the government and the ruling united russia party amounted to about 80 percent of all political coverage on national channels . haraszti said he had submitted to russian foreign minister sergey lavrov a list of incidents where media freedom had been violated during the election campaign . list of violations sent as warning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers want to see more transparency in may the report should act as a reminder to russia " of its commitment to guarantee a free and fair media coverage during elections , " he said . the findings " are an early warning in view of the march 2008 presidential election , " haraszti said .
" i ask the new state duma to ensure the right of the media to provide balanced and objective information . " the us , eu and germany all joined in criticizing the elections and called on the russian authorities to investigate the allegations of improper conduct . but the kremlin rejected all accusations , insisting that the elections had been free and fair and saying that foreign criticism was part of a us plot to tarnish russia 's image . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do hope for the future presidential elections on march 2 that there will be an invitation to organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- observers in due time and in an appropriate way , " eu foreign affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said on wednesday , dec .
5 . on sunday , russia held parliamentary elections which handed a massive victory to the united russia party backed by president vladimir putin . putin 's constitutional term of office expires next year , but he is widely expected to use the party 's strong position to find some way of keeping power .
sunday 's elections were marred by allegations of systematic media bias , pressure on voters and harassment of opposition politicians . but evidence confirming those allegations was hard to come by , as the osce - the main body which oversees elections in europe - had cancelled a planned large-scale observation mission , claiming that the russian authorities had refused visas to most of its staff . observers lament state media control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united russia 's " our choice is putin " campaign had blanket coverage on monday , those members of the osce who had been able to observe parts of the election said that it had not conformed to international standards of democracy .
russian opposition parties echoed the claims . " television coverage was monopolized by the ruling party , " the osce 's representative for freedom of the media , miklos haraszti , complained in a statement focusing on the media bias . there were " several cases of harassment and violence against the independent media " which " contributed to the intimidating atmosphere , " he said .
" monitoring by the central electoral commission and the -lsb- non-governmental organization -rsb- russian union of journalists showed a clear bias in favor of the ruling party candidates on the main television channels . " combined coverage of russian president vladimir putin , the government and the ruling united russia party amounted to about 80 percent of all political coverage on national channels . haraszti said he had submitted to russian foreign minister sergey lavrov a list of incidents where media freedom had been violated during the election campaign . list of violations sent as warning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers want to see more transparency in may the report should act as a reminder to russia " of its commitment to guarantee a free and fair media coverage during elections , " he said . the findings " are an early warning in view of the march 2008 presidential election , " haraszti said .
" i ask the new state duma to ensure the right of the media to provide balanced and objective information . " the us , eu and germany all joined in criticizing the elections and called on the russian authorities to investigate the allegations of improper conduct . but the kremlin rejected all accusations , insisting that the elections had been free and fair and saying that foreign criticism was part of a us plot to tarnish russia 's image . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical -pipe- 06.12.2007 german ensemble releases cd of lou reed 's loudest album großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reed 's 1975 feedback experiment is back - in classic black the group zeitkratzer has drawn good reviews with a classical version of metal machine music - the 1975 feedback experiment that almost finished lou reed ’ s career . it 's got no beat , and you definitely ca n't dance to it .
lou reed 's metal machine music - a punishing 50 minutes of guitar feedback looped together and sped up to twice its normal speed - was hated by both critics and fans when it was originally released in the mid-70s .
some drew comparisons with a dentist 's drill boring away at an infected tooth , while others dismissed the double album as a bid by reed to get out of his record contract .
but the berlin-based avant-garde ensemble zeitkratzer has given the composition a new lease on life , scoring it for classical instruments and recasting it as a piece of minimalist new music .
the cd-dvd was recorded live with reed in 2002 but only released this autumn due to copyright issues - an ironic twist since rca recalled the original metal machine music from record stores after three weeks and told reed he 'd never make another album .
zeitkratzer 's version has drawn praise from both the high-brow new york times and hip indie-music websites like pitchfork .
group members say listening habits have caught up with reed 's ideas .
“ noise has long established itself as a standard element in rock music , ” ulrich krieger , the former zeitkratzer saxophonist who transcribed reed 's original record , told dw-world .
“ people are accustomed to pop bands who make the charts like jesus and the mary chain or nirvana building up dissonant walls of feedback . ”
come on , feel the noise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writing out the score for brass , strings , piano and percussion was a massive task in an interview before the performance , which took place as part of berlin 's annual “ march music ” festival , reed stressed the corporeal nature of his work .
“ it 's everything i like about rock music , ” reed said , thumping his chest and his thigh .
“ i like to feel music physically , here and down here .
and i 'm a guitarist .
i like electric guitars . ”
the zeitkratzer performance is also physically strenuous .
the brass players go red in the face sustaining what were originally minute-long hums of feedback , and the string section often looks in danger of cardiac arrest as it frenetically saws its way through oscillating patterns of sound .
and the ten-person ensemble faced other challenges performing a piece with no fixed tempo or time signature .
“ we use three exactly synchronized clocks , ” zeitkratzer pianist and leader reinhold friedl told dw-world .
“ everyone can see them .
we know , for instance , that we have to come together for a transition at 7 minutes , 16 seconds .
we exchange glances and then wham ! ”
do n't expect sweet jane bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original 1975 record was a commercial and critical bomb there 's no shortage of whams and blams , screeches and scratches , hums and hoots on the zeitkratzer cd .
the 4 sides of the original record were in fact shortened into 3 movements because reed felt it would be asking too much of the audience to listen to the whole thing .
and friedl cautioned that anyone purchasing the disc expecting anything like usual lou reed would soon be selling it on ebay .
at the same time , the ensemble version takes away some of the incredible harshness of the original and makes it much easier to hear the individual figures within the music .
occasionally , it even sounds sort of melodic .
“ the instrumental sound is much richer , ” friedl said .
“ and of course , it 's something different when you have ten people playing , instead of just two hard-edged guitar feedbacks that have also been pitched up on octave . ”
but is it classical or rock music ?
“ metal machine music is the translation of both the freedom of free improvisation and the sound structures of new music into a rock aesthetic , ” said krieger .
“ for me it combines two different worlds , which were both important twentieth-century cultural movements , but which ran parallel to one another without ever really overlapping .
it 's a kind of a best-of-all-worlds situation . ”
in other words , it 's a very different way for the musically adventurous to take a walk on the wild side .

group members say listening habits have caught up with reed 's ideas .
“ noise has long established itself as a standard element in rock music , ” ulrich krieger , the former zeitkratzer saxophonist who transcribed reed 's original record , told dw-world .
“ people are accustomed to pop bands who make the charts like jesus and the mary chain or nirvana building up dissonant walls of feedback . ”
come on , feel the noise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writing out the score for brass , strings , piano and percussion was a massive task in an interview before the performance , which took place as part of berlin 's annual “ march music ” festival , reed stressed the corporeal nature of his work .
“ it 's everything i like about rock music , ” reed said , thumping his chest and his thigh .
“ i like to feel music physically , here and down here .
and i 'm a guitarist .
i like electric guitars . ”
the zeitkratzer performance is also physically strenuous .
the brass players go red in the face sustaining what were originally minute-long hums of feedback , and the string section often looks in danger of cardiac arrest as it frenetically saws its way through oscillating patterns of sound .
and the ten-person ensemble faced other challenges performing a piece with no fixed tempo or time signature .
“ we use three exactly synchronized clocks , ” zeitkratzer pianist and leader reinhold friedl told dw-world .
“ everyone can see them .
we know , for instance , that we have to come together for a transition at 7 minutes , 16 seconds .
we exchange glances and then wham ! ”

the 4 sides of the original record were in fact shortened into 3 movements because reed felt it would be asking too much of the audience to listen to the whole thing .
and friedl cautioned that anyone purchasing the disc expecting anything like usual lou reed would soon be selling it on ebay .
at the same time , the ensemble version takes away some of the incredible harshness of the original and makes it much easier to hear the individual figures within the music .

“ the instrumental sound is much richer , ” friedl said .
“ and of course , it 's something different when you have ten people playing , instead of just two hard-edged guitar feedbacks that have also been pitched up on octave . ”
but is it classical or rock music ?
“ metal machine music is the translation of both the freedom of free improvisation and the sound structures of new music into a rock aesthetic , ” said krieger .
“ for me it combines two different worlds , which were both important twentieth-century cultural movements , but which ran parallel to one another without ever really overlapping .
it 's a kind of a best-of-all-worlds situation . ”
in other words , it 's a very different way for the musically adventurous to take a walk on the wild side .

lou reed 's metal machine music - a punishing 50 minutes of guitar feedback looped together and sped up to twice its normal speed - was hated by both critics and fans when it was originally released in the mid-70s .
some drew comparisons with a dentist 's drill boring away at an infected tooth , while others dismissed the double album as a bid by reed to get out of his record contract .
but the berlin-based avant-garde ensemble zeitkratzer has given the composition a new lease on life , scoring it for classical instruments and recasting it as a piece of minimalist new music .
the cd-dvd was recorded live with reed in 2002 but only released this autumn due to copyright issues - an ironic twist since rca recalled the original metal machine music from record stores after three weeks and told reed he 'd never make another album .
zeitkratzer 's version has drawn praise from both the high-brow new york times and hip indie-music websites like pitchfork .
group members say listening habits have caught up with reed 's ideas .
“ noise has long established itself as a standard element in rock music , ” ulrich krieger , the former zeitkratzer saxophonist who transcribed reed 's original record , told dw-world .
“ people are accustomed to pop bands who make the charts like jesus and the mary chain or nirvana building up dissonant walls of feedback . ”

and the ten-person ensemble faced other challenges performing a piece with no fixed tempo or time signature .
“ we use three exactly synchronized clocks , ” zeitkratzer pianist and leader reinhold friedl told dw-world .
“ everyone can see them .
we know , for instance , that we have to come together for a transition at 7 minutes , 16 seconds .
we exchange glances and then wham ! ”
do n't expect sweet jane bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original 1975 record was a commercial and critical bomb there 's no shortage of whams and blams , screeches and scratches , hums and hoots on the zeitkratzer cd .
the 4 sides of the original record were in fact shortened into 3 movements because reed felt it would be asking too much of the audience to listen to the whole thing .
and friedl cautioned that anyone purchasing the disc expecting anything like usual lou reed would soon be selling it on ebay .
at the same time , the ensemble version takes away some of the incredible harshness of the original and makes it much easier to hear the individual figures within the music .
occasionally , it even sounds sort of melodic .
“ the instrumental sound is much richer , ” friedl said .
“ and of course , it 's something different when you have ten people playing , instead of just two hard-edged guitar feedbacks that have also been pitched up on octave . ”
but is it classical or rock music ?
“ metal machine music is the translation of both the freedom of free improvisation and the sound structures of new music into a rock aesthetic , ” said krieger .
“ for me it combines two different worlds , which were both important twentieth-century cultural movements , but which ran parallel to one another without ever really overlapping .
it 's a kind of a best-of-all-worlds situation . ”
in other words , it 's a very different way for the musically adventurous to take a walk on the wild side .

but the need to attract skilled foreign workers was widely acknowledged . wolfgang schäuble implicitly criticized frattini 's plans for a blue card by insisting that immigration should remain a competence of individual member states .
eu commission vice-president franco frattini said there had been a " broad consensus " on the benefits of granting work and residency permits to third-country professionals , given labor shortages and europe 's graying population .
and the justice , interior , employment and social policy ministers also agreed with the eu executive on the necessity of cracking down on undeclared workers , many of them exploited illegal immigrants .
portugal , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the so-called " jumbo council " aimed to produce a wide-ranging debate on this highly sensitive issue .
differing national priorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan aims to help reduce the number of illegal migrants and ministers also stressed different priorities and expressed diverging views on the issue .
mediterranean countries such as italy , spain and greece , for instance , emphasized the need to stop thousands of illegal migrants from north africa and asia .
while the czech republic and bulgaria said their workers should be given priority .
frattini has proposed increasing the eu 's attractivity to third- country professionals by offering them similar benefits to those currently enjoyed by their european colleagues .
candidates would be able to apply for a single work and residency permit , valid for a minimum of two years and renewable , and accepted throughout the union .
under the proposal , foreign white-collar workers would also be allowed to be joined by their families in their new country of residency .
germany 's main concern is that the eu might eventually impose quotas on the number of immigrants who can enter individual member states , an eventuality strongly denied by frattini .
" it is not up to brussels to decide how many engineers from third countries are necessary for germany or austria , " frattini said .
observers in brussels said germany could eventually decide not to adopt the blue card , rather than block the project altogether .
the dutch also voiced doubts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration commissioner frattini with commission president barroso the netherlands also expressed reservations over the proposal while austria called for further " clarifications " in the field of social security and minimum wages , saying it already offered higher levels .
britain , which has opted out of eu immigration policies altogether , outlined to ministers its alternative plan for a points- based system .
devised along the lines of a similar system in place in australia , it aims to ensure that only those migrants meeting the needs of the country would be allowed to enter and work .
the british proposal nevertheless reflects a more general shift towards a " pick and choose " approach to migration that is likely to adversely affect the future of lower-skilled third-country nationals seeking a better life in europe .
some 2 million third-country nationals enter the bloc each year , according to eu estimates , and there is little evidence to suggest this figure will drop significantly in the foreseeable future .

lou reed 's metal machine music - a punishing 50 minutes of guitar feedback looped together and sped up to twice its normal speed - was hated by both critics and fans when it was originally released in the mid-70s .
some drew comparisons with a dentist 's drill boring away at an infected tooth , while others dismissed the double album as a bid by reed to get out of his record contract .
but the berlin-based avant-garde ensemble zeitkratzer has given the composition a new lease on life , scoring it for classical instruments and recasting it as a piece of minimalist new music .
the cd-dvd was recorded live with reed in 2002 but only released this autumn due to copyright issues - an ironic twist since rca recalled the original metal machine music from record stores after three weeks and told reed he 'd never make another album .
zeitkratzer 's version has drawn praise from both the high-brow new york times and hip indie-music websites like pitchfork .
group members say listening habits have caught up with reed 's ideas .
“ noise has long established itself as a standard element in rock music , ” ulrich krieger , the former zeitkratzer saxophonist who transcribed reed 's original record , told dw-world .
“ people are accustomed to pop bands who make the charts like jesus and the mary chain or nirvana building up dissonant walls of feedback . ”
come on , feel the noise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writing out the score for brass , strings , piano and percussion was a massive task in an interview before the performance , which took place as part of berlin 's annual “ march music ” festival , reed stressed the corporeal nature of his work .
“ it 's everything i like about rock music , ” reed said , thumping his chest and his thigh .
“ i like to feel music physically , here and down here .
and i 'm a guitarist .
i like electric guitars . ”
the zeitkratzer performance is also physically strenuous .
the brass players go red in the face sustaining what were originally minute-long hums of feedback , and the string section often looks in danger of cardiac arrest as it frenetically saws its way through oscillating patterns of sound .
and the ten-person ensemble faced other challenges performing a piece with no fixed tempo or time signature .
“ we use three exactly synchronized clocks , ” zeitkratzer pianist and leader reinhold friedl told dw-world .
“ everyone can see them .
we know , for instance , that we have to come together for a transition at 7 minutes , 16 seconds .
we exchange glances and then wham ! ”

the 4 sides of the original record were in fact shortened into 3 movements because reed felt it would be asking too much of the audience to listen to the whole thing .
and friedl cautioned that anyone purchasing the disc expecting anything like usual lou reed would soon be selling it on ebay .
at the same time , the ensemble version takes away some of the incredible harshness of the original and makes it much easier to hear the individual figures within the music .
occasionally , it even sounds sort of melodic .
“ the instrumental sound is much richer , ” friedl said .
“ and of course , it 's something different when you have ten people playing , instead of just two hard-edged guitar feedbacks that have also been pitched up on octave . ”
but is it classical or rock music ?
“ metal machine music is the translation of both the freedom of free improvisation and the sound structures of new music into a rock aesthetic , ” said krieger .
“ for me it combines two different worlds , which were both important twentieth-century cultural movements , but which ran parallel to one another without ever really overlapping .
it 's a kind of a best-of-all-worlds situation . ”
in other words , it 's a very different way for the musically adventurous to take a walk on the wild side .

lou reed 's metal machine music - a punishing 50 minutes of guitar feedback looped together and sped up to twice its normal speed - was hated by both critics and fans when it was originally released in the mid-70s .
some drew comparisons with a dentist 's drill boring away at an infected tooth , while others dismissed the double album as a bid by reed to get out of his record contract .
but the berlin-based avant-garde ensemble zeitkratzer has given the composition a new lease on life , scoring it for classical instruments and recasting it as a piece of minimalist new music .
the cd-dvd was recorded live with reed in 2002 but only released this autumn due to copyright issues - an ironic twist since rca recalled the original metal machine music from record stores after three weeks and told reed he 'd never make another album .
zeitkratzer 's version has drawn praise from both the high-brow new york times and hip indie-music websites like pitchfork .
group members say listening habits have caught up with reed 's ideas .
“ noise has long established itself as a standard element in rock music , ” ulrich krieger , the former zeitkratzer saxophonist who transcribed reed 's original record , told dw-world .
“ people are accustomed to pop bands who make the charts like jesus and the mary chain or nirvana building up dissonant walls of feedback . ”
come on , feel the noise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writing out the score for brass , strings , piano and percussion was a massive task in an interview before the performance , which took place as part of berlin 's annual “ march music ” festival , reed stressed the corporeal nature of his work .
“ it 's everything i like about rock music , ” reed said , thumping his chest and his thigh .
“ i like to feel music physically , here and down here .
and i 'm a guitarist .
i like electric guitars . ”
the zeitkratzer performance is also physically strenuous .
the brass players go red in the face sustaining what were originally minute-long hums of feedback , and the string section often looks in danger of cardiac arrest as it frenetically saws its way through oscillating patterns of sound .
and the ten-person ensemble faced other challenges performing a piece with no fixed tempo or time signature .
“ we use three exactly synchronized clocks , ” zeitkratzer pianist and leader reinhold friedl told dw-world .
“ everyone can see them .
we know , for instance , that we have to come together for a transition at 7 minutes , 16 seconds .
we exchange glances and then wham ! ”

the 4 sides of the original record were in fact shortened into 3 movements because reed felt it would be asking too much of the audience to listen to the whole thing .
and friedl cautioned that anyone purchasing the disc expecting anything like usual lou reed would soon be selling it on ebay .
at the same time , the ensemble version takes away some of the incredible harshness of the original and makes it much easier to hear the individual figures within the music .
occasionally , it even sounds sort of melodic .
“ the instrumental sound is much richer , ” friedl said .
“ and of course , it 's something different when you have ten people playing , instead of just two hard-edged guitar feedbacks that have also been pitched up on octave . ”
but is it classical or rock music ?
“ metal machine music is the translation of both the freedom of free improvisation and the sound structures of new music into a rock aesthetic , ” said krieger .
“ for me it combines two different worlds , which were both important twentieth-century cultural movements , but which ran parallel to one another without ever really overlapping .
it 's a kind of a best-of-all-worlds situation . ”
in other words , it 's a very different way for the musically adventurous to take a walk on the wild side .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 06.12.2007 germany suspicious about eu blue card plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue card would allow skilled professionals access to the eu labor market the german interior minister has expressed strong reservations about an eu-wide " blue card " at a meeting of ministers in brussels .
but the need to attract skilled foreign workers was widely acknowledged . wolfgang schäuble implicitly criticized frattini 's plans for a blue card by insisting that immigration should remain a competence of individual member states .
eu commission vice-president franco frattini said there had been a " broad consensus " on the benefits of granting work and residency permits to third-country professionals , given labor shortages and europe 's graying population .
and the justice , interior , employment and social policy ministers also agreed with the eu executive on the necessity of cracking down on undeclared workers , many of them exploited illegal immigrants .
portugal , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the so-called " jumbo council " aimed to produce a wide-ranging debate on this highly sensitive issue .
differing national priorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan aims to help reduce the number of illegal migrants and ministers also stressed different priorities and expressed diverging views on the issue .
mediterranean countries such as italy , spain and greece , for instance , emphasized the need to stop thousands of illegal migrants from north africa and asia .
while the czech republic and bulgaria said their workers should be given priority .
frattini has proposed increasing the eu 's attractivity to third- country professionals by offering them similar benefits to those currently enjoyed by their european colleagues .
candidates would be able to apply for a single work and residency permit , valid for a minimum of two years and renewable , and accepted throughout the union .
under the proposal , foreign white-collar workers would also be allowed to be joined by their families in their new country of residency .
germany 's main concern is that the eu might eventually impose quotas on the number of immigrants who can enter individual member states , an eventuality strongly denied by frattini .
" it is not up to brussels to decide how many engineers from third countries are necessary for germany or austria , " frattini said .
observers in brussels said germany could eventually decide not to adopt the blue card , rather than block the project altogether .
the dutch also voiced doubts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration commissioner frattini with commission president barroso the netherlands also expressed reservations over the proposal while austria called for further " clarifications " in the field of social security and minimum wages , saying it already offered higher levels .
britain , which has opted out of eu immigration policies altogether , outlined to ministers its alternative plan for a points- based system .
devised along the lines of a similar system in place in australia , it aims to ensure that only those migrants meeting the needs of the country would be allowed to enter and work .
the british proposal nevertheless reflects a more general shift towards a " pick and choose " approach to migration that is likely to adversely affect the future of lower-skilled third-country nationals seeking a better life in europe .
some 2 million third-country nationals enter the bloc each year , according to eu estimates , and there is little evidence to suggest this figure will drop significantly in the foreseeable future .
the inflow has been at times poorly managed fuelling growing resentment among ordinary citizens , opposition from nationalist parties and calls for stricter controls by government officials . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the need to attract skilled foreign workers was widely acknowledged . wolfgang schäuble implicitly criticized frattini 's plans for a blue card by insisting that immigration should remain a competence of individual member states .
eu commission vice-president franco frattini said there had been a " broad consensus " on the benefits of granting work and residency permits to third-country professionals , given labor shortages and europe 's graying population .
and the justice , interior , employment and social policy ministers also agreed with the eu executive on the necessity of cracking down on undeclared workers , many of them exploited illegal immigrants .
portugal , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the so-called " jumbo council " aimed to produce a wide-ranging debate on this highly sensitive issue .
differing national priorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan aims to help reduce the number of illegal migrants and ministers also stressed different priorities and expressed diverging views on the issue .
mediterranean countries such as italy , spain and greece , for instance , emphasized the need to stop thousands of illegal migrants from north africa and asia .
while the czech republic and bulgaria said their workers should be given priority .
frattini has proposed increasing the eu 's attractivity to third- country professionals by offering them similar benefits to those currently enjoyed by their european colleagues .
candidates would be able to apply for a single work and residency permit , valid for a minimum of two years and renewable , and accepted throughout the union .
under the proposal , foreign white-collar workers would also be allowed to be joined by their families in their new country of residency .
germany 's main concern is that the eu might eventually impose quotas on the number of immigrants who can enter individual member states , an eventuality strongly denied by frattini .
" it is not up to brussels to decide how many engineers from third countries are necessary for germany or austria , " frattini said .

verheugen , who is also industry commissioner , said the complex mix of national legislation and controls on the transfer of defense equipment currently in place had even helped encourage the mass use of the exemption .
" if you just want a spare tyre , for example , for a defense vehicle , you 've got to go through the same authorization procedure as if you were selling a gun outside the european union , " he explained .

" opening the internal market for defense products will improve the competitiveness of the technological and industrial base of the european defense sector , " commission vice president günter verheugen said in a statement .
verheugen also stressed that he saw the move as " fundamental to establishing europe 's autonomy in this field . "
with the eu lagging far behind the us in defense spending , he said that public opposition to increasing expenditure in this sector meant that the eu had to spend more efficiently .
defense is the exclusive domain of the bloc 's 27 member states .
but verheugen said the policy came under the eu 's single market powers , and was not a defense policy per se .
stopping countries avoiding competition law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen stressed the importance of self-sufficiency the proposals tabled by the commission are designed to discourage countries from using a national defense clause to buy military and spare parts and avoid eu procurement rules .
they would not impact on the purchase of arms , munitions and war materials or other sensitive non-military procurements in areas such as counter-terrorism . the initiative is also intended to co-ordinate different national procurement rules , which have proved a major hurdle .
verheugen , who is also industry commissioner , said the complex mix of national legislation and controls on the transfer of defense equipment currently in place had even helped encourage the mass use of the exemption .
" if you just want a spare tyre , for example , for a defense vehicle , you 've got to go through the same authorization procedure as if you were selling a gun outside the european union , " he explained .
he said the new measures would apply " perhaps not to the whole tank but for example the spare tyre .
not to a mortar or motor for a fighter plane , but for components or spare parts . "
measures to boost transparency and cut red tape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal relates to spares rather than whole tanks internal market and services commissioner charlie mccreevy said : " introducing transparent and competitive procurement rules applicable throughout the eu is crucial for the establishment of a common defense market .

" we do hope for the future presidential elections on march 2 that there will be an invitation to organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- observers in due time and in an appropriate way , " eu foreign affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said on wednesday , dec .
5 . on sunday , russia held parliamentary elections which handed a massive victory to the united russia party backed by president vladimir putin . putin 's constitutional term of office expires next year , but he is widely expected to use the party 's strong position to find some way of keeping power .
sunday 's elections were marred by allegations of systematic media bias , pressure on voters and harassment of opposition politicians . but evidence confirming those allegations was hard to come by , as the osce - the main body which oversees elections in europe - had cancelled a planned large-scale observation mission , claiming that the russian authorities had refused visas to most of its staff . observers lament state media control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united russia 's " our choice is putin " campaign had blanket coverage on monday , those members of the osce who had been able to observe parts of the election said that it had not conformed to international standards of democracy .
russian opposition parties echoed the claims . " television coverage was monopolized by the ruling party , " the osce 's representative for freedom of the media , miklos haraszti , complained in a statement focusing on the media bias . there were " several cases of harassment and violence against the independent media " which " contributed to the intimidating atmosphere , " he said .
" monitoring by the central electoral commission and the -lsb- non-governmental organization -rsb- russian union of journalists showed a clear bias in favor of the ruling party candidates on the main television channels . " combined coverage of russian president vladimir putin , the government and the ruling united russia party amounted to about 80 percent of all political coverage on national channels . haraszti said he had submitted to russian foreign minister sergey lavrov a list of incidents where media freedom had been violated during the election campaign . list of violations sent as warning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers want to see more transparency in may the report should act as a reminder to russia " of its commitment to guarantee a free and fair media coverage during elections , " he said . the findings " are an early warning in view of the march 2008 presidential election , " haraszti said .
" i ask the new state duma to ensure the right of the media to provide balanced and objective information . " the us , eu and germany all joined in criticizing the elections and called on the russian authorities to investigate the allegations of improper conduct . but the kremlin rejected all accusations , insisting that the elections had been free and fair and saying that foreign criticism was part of a us plot to tarnish russia 's image . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel reacted by suggesting that such an affiliation of nations could lead to " a corrosion of the eu in its core area " and " could release explosive powers in the eu . "
such a frankly undiplomatic reaction was unusual under the circumstances , and suggested that merkel may have reached a point in her relationship with the french president where she felt it necessary to go public with her discontent .
merkel unhappy with sarkozy 's tactics bildunterschrift : for relations between the two leaders had already begun to sour well before this disagreement , due in no small part to sarkozy 's propensity for unilateral action and self-promotion .

fears were strongest in france , where 64 percent saw china as a threat , and weakest in britain , where nearly 60 percent saw the country 's growth as an opportunity - and only 34 percent as cause for concern . across europe , 57 percent of germans , 59 percent of poles , 60 percent of italians and 62 percent of slovaks admitted to feeling uneasy about china 's growing economic role on the world stage . uneven playing field bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european and american companies are facing increasing competition from china with public disquiet about china persistently high , us and eu authorities are currently stepping up pressure on beijing over trade issues on the grounds that the asian country profits from an unlevel playing field . both the eu and the us insist that china 's boom is helped by an artificially low exchange rate controlled by the state , and that their exports run up against unnecessary obstacles as well as copyright violation , the afp news agency reported thursday . a high-level eu delegation aired these concerns to beijing last week , while us treasury secretary henry paulson and other senior us administration officials will be in the chinese capital for high-level trade and investment talks next week . tightening trans-atlantic ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's rise as a world power has environmental repercussions meanwhile , the survey also revealed that some two-thirds of americans and europeans favor closer economic ties across the atlantic , with strong support for an initiative launched this year to tear down barriers to trade and investment between the world 's largest trading partners . " after more than five decades of robust trade and investment integration since world war ii , americans and europeans see even further gains to be made by deepening the trans-atlantic marketplace , " the german marshall fund 's president , craig kennedy , said in a statement . the first meeting of the trans-atlantic economic council took place last month , successfully negotiating regulatory issues ranging from accounting rules to standards for biofuels . only 52 percent in the united states and 53 percent in europe said they supported globalization , with both americans and europeans more likely to blame outsourcing , immigration and currency manipulation for job losses than trade , the poll showed . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

star player spoke up the club 's most successful historic player , hanne sobeck , with whom hertha won its last two german league titles - in 1930 and 1932 - joined the nazi party in 1940 but kept a distance to it .

these include improving insulation in private homes , stricter standards for both new buildings and refurbishment projects , as well as a targeted sponsorship of renewable heating energy , which all are measures which can help cut millions of tones of greenhouse gases at the same time as reducing budgets for gas , oil and electricity .
the promotion of energy obtained from wind , sun and biomass with the help of cogeneration is designed to secure and stabilize germany 's boom in renewable energy - laying a blueprint for successful climate protection measures .
even so , they wo n't be enough to meet the government 's target of cutting carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2020 .
environment minister sigmar gabriel expects the figure to be closer to 36 percent at most .
that extra 4 percent needs to come from somewhere .
a little bit more courage on berlin 's part in standing up to the industrial lobby is all it needs .
take transport .
introducing a speed limit on freeways could help cut carbon emissions .
but the government has little desire to face off with the car lobby .
take energy production .
the energy companies are allowed to continue building coal-fired power plants .
they might be more efficient than their predecessors , but they will cause serious environmental damage . the government 's climate protection package is ambitious but flawed - the coalition 's excuse is that it has to take too many factors in to consideration .
nonetheless , germany has nothing to be ashamed of at the un climate change conference in bali .
other countries have failed miserably to come up with similarly concrete plans on curbing carbon emissions in the areas of energy production , households , industry and transport . germany is clearly trying to do its bit for the polar bears in the artic .
but their fate is still on thin ice .
other industrialized nations will have to start following germany 's example , and berlin itself also has a long way to go before it 's really pulled out all stops .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 06.12.2007 germany suspicious about eu blue card plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue card would allow skilled professionals access to the eu labor market the german interior minister has expressed strong reservations about an eu-wide " blue card " at a meeting of ministers in brussels .
but the need to attract skilled foreign workers was widely acknowledged . wolfgang schäuble implicitly criticized frattini 's plans for a blue card by insisting that immigration should remain a competence of individual member states .
eu commission vice-president franco frattini said there had been a " broad consensus " on the benefits of granting work and residency permits to third-country professionals , given labor shortages and europe 's graying population .
and the justice , interior , employment and social policy ministers also agreed with the eu executive on the necessity of cracking down on undeclared workers , many of them exploited illegal immigrants .
portugal , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the so-called " jumbo council " aimed to produce a wide-ranging debate on this highly sensitive issue .
differing national priorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan aims to help reduce the number of illegal migrants and ministers also stressed different priorities and expressed diverging views on the issue .
mediterranean countries such as italy , spain and greece , for instance , emphasized the need to stop thousands of illegal migrants from north africa and asia .
while the czech republic and bulgaria said their workers should be given priority .
frattini has proposed increasing the eu 's attractivity to third- country professionals by offering them similar benefits to those currently enjoyed by their european colleagues .
candidates would be able to apply for a single work and residency permit , valid for a minimum of two years and renewable , and accepted throughout the union .
under the proposal , foreign white-collar workers would also be allowed to be joined by their families in their new country of residency .
germany 's main concern is that the eu might eventually impose quotas on the number of immigrants who can enter individual member states , an eventuality strongly denied by frattini .
" it is not up to brussels to decide how many engineers from third countries are necessary for germany or austria , " frattini said .
observers in brussels said germany could eventually decide not to adopt the blue card , rather than block the project altogether .
the dutch also voiced doubts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration commissioner frattini with commission president barroso the netherlands also expressed reservations over the proposal while austria called for further " clarifications " in the field of social security and minimum wages , saying it already offered higher levels .
britain , which has opted out of eu immigration policies altogether , outlined to ministers its alternative plan for a points- based system .
devised along the lines of a similar system in place in australia , it aims to ensure that only those migrants meeting the needs of the country would be allowed to enter and work .
the british proposal nevertheless reflects a more general shift towards a " pick and choose " approach to migration that is likely to adversely affect the future of lower-skilled third-country nationals seeking a better life in europe .
some 2 million third-country nationals enter the bloc each year , according to eu estimates , and there is little evidence to suggest this figure will drop significantly in the foreseeable future .
the inflow has been at times poorly managed fuelling growing resentment among ordinary citizens , opposition from nationalist parties and calls for stricter controls by government officials . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 , ahead of a united nations deadline for deciding on the province 's future status . on monday , the european union , the united states and russia are due to inform the un secretary-general that attempts to find a negotiated solution to the future status of kosovo have failed .
the government of kosovo , which is still formally a part of serbia has been a united nations protectorate since 1999 , has already said they will unilaterally declare independence from serbia .
alliance ministers are expected to announce a continued commitment to keep nato 's 16,000-strong kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo , if this happens . but slovakia , romania , spain and greece have expressed their misgivings to these plans .
" we are expecting topics a , b and c to be : kosovo , kosovo , kosovo , " a senior us official said .
nato drawing up contingency plans for kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence continues despite the nato and un presence belgrade , which enjoys russian support within the un security council , is strongly opposed to the plans of the kosovar leadership to declare independence .
in 1999 , a nato bombing campaign stopped serbia 's ethnic cleansing of kosovo , whose 2.2 million people are 90 per cent ethnic albanian .
in recent weeks , alliance commanders have been busy drawing up contingency plans should the situation degenerate once independence is proclaimed .
thousands of extra troops are being held in reserve in case reinforcements are needed quickly .
the gathering , which will also include a nato-russia council meeting , means ministers will also have to tackle the issue of growing strains with russia over its withdrawal from the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty and the us missile shield system .
a law signed by russian president vladimir putin suspending russia 's participation in what is frequently described as a cornerstone treaty of european security comes into force on sunday , nov.9.
meanwhile , the us is continuing with its project to set up an anti-iran missile defence shield in central europe , one of the reasons russia gave for suspending the cfe .
russia a factor in all three issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has told the kremlin that us plans pose no threat to russia nato officials insist that the three sticky issues on this week 's agenda should be dealt with separately .
but russia features in all of them .
the meeting , which begins with a dinner on thursday evening attended by eu and nato ministers , will offer an opportunity for officials to discuss us plans to locate missile defence bases in poland and the czech republic .
the plan has divided opinion across europe .
that issue , too , will be discussed during friday 's nato-russia council meeting , which is to be attended by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .
would-be nato members croatia , albania and macedonia are set to be informed that despite making great progress on reforms , they must do more if they are to be invited into the alliance at a summit in bucharest in april 2008 , diplomats said . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these include improving insulation in private homes , stricter standards for both new buildings and refurbishment projects , as well as a targeted sponsorship of renewable heating energy , which all are measures which can help cut millions of tones of greenhouse gases at the same time as reducing budgets for gas , oil and electricity .
the promotion of energy obtained from wind , sun and biomass with the help of cogeneration is designed to secure and stabilize germany 's boom in renewable energy - laying a blueprint for successful climate protection measures .
even so , they wo n't be enough to meet the government 's target of cutting carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2020 .
environment minister sigmar gabriel expects the figure to be closer to 36 percent at most .
that extra 4 percent needs to come from somewhere .
a little bit more courage on berlin 's part in standing up to the industrial lobby is all it needs .
take transport .
introducing a speed limit on freeways could help cut carbon emissions .
but the government has little desire to face off with the car lobby .
take energy production .
the energy companies are allowed to continue building coal-fired power plants .
they might be more efficient than their predecessors , but they will cause serious environmental damage . the government 's climate protection package is ambitious but flawed - the coalition 's excuse is that it has to take too many factors in to consideration .
nonetheless , germany has nothing to be ashamed of at the un climate change conference in bali .
other countries have failed miserably to come up with similarly concrete plans on curbing carbon emissions in the areas of energy production , households , industry and transport . germany is clearly trying to do its bit for the polar bears in the artic .
but their fate is still on thin ice .
other industrialized nations will have to start following germany 's example , and berlin itself also has a long way to go before it 's really pulled out all stops .

the watchdog asks respondents across the globe which institutions they see as most affected by corruption .
like most years , the institutions entrusted to represent the public interest in political decision-making are seen as the dirtiest . " our experience has shown that it is commitment at the top that will make or break efforts to fight corruption , " said cobus de swardt , transparency international 's managing director .

in latin america , asia-pacific and north america , petty bribery in the judiciary is a serious problem . " the police and the judiciary in many countries around the world are part of a cycle of corruption , demanding bribes from citizens , " de swardt said in a statement .
" this troubling finding means that corruption is interfering with the basic right to equal treatment before the law . " petty bribery is at its most widespread in albania and senegal , where 30 percent of respondents said they had been required to pay bribes to various authorities for access to services .
other countries with similarly high levels include cambodia , cameroon , macedonia , nigeria , pakistan , the philippines and romania . " this year 's global corruption barometer has made it clear that too often , people must part with their hard-earned money to pay for services that should be free , " said transparency international chair huguette labelle .
" and they do not see enough commitment when they look to their governments and leaders . " we are heartened though , that the public is increasingly demanding the accountability of the very institutions that most affect their lives , as this is a powerful driver of change , " she added . between june and september , gallup international on behalf of ti quizzed 63,000 people in 60 countries on their attitudes toward and experience of corruption . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 , ahead of a united nations deadline for deciding on the province 's future status . on monday , the european union , the united states and russia are due to inform the un secretary-general that attempts to find a negotiated solution to the future status of kosovo have failed .
the government of kosovo , which is still formally a part of serbia has been a united nations protectorate since 1999 , has already said they will unilaterally declare independence from serbia .
alliance ministers are expected to announce a continued commitment to keep nato 's 16,000-strong kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo , if this happens . but slovakia , romania , spain and greece have expressed their misgivings to these plans .
" we are expecting topics a , b and c to be : kosovo , kosovo , kosovo , " a senior us official said .
nato drawing up contingency plans for kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence continues despite the nato and un presence belgrade , which enjoys russian support within the un security council , is strongly opposed to the plans of the kosovar leadership to declare independence .
in 1999 , a nato bombing campaign stopped serbia 's ethnic cleansing of kosovo , whose 2.2 million people are 90 per cent ethnic albanian .
in recent weeks , alliance commanders have been busy drawing up contingency plans should the situation degenerate once independence is proclaimed .
thousands of extra troops are being held in reserve in case reinforcements are needed quickly .
the gathering , which will also include a nato-russia council meeting , means ministers will also have to tackle the issue of growing strains with russia over its withdrawal from the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty and the us missile shield system .
a law signed by russian president vladimir putin suspending russia 's participation in what is frequently described as a cornerstone treaty of european security comes into force on sunday , nov.9.
meanwhile , the us is continuing with its project to set up an anti-iran missile defence shield in central europe , one of the reasons russia gave for suspending the cfe .
russia a factor in all three issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has told the kremlin that us plans pose no threat to russia nato officials insist that the three sticky issues on this week 's agenda should be dealt with separately .
but russia features in all of them .
the meeting , which begins with a dinner on thursday evening attended by eu and nato ministers , will offer an opportunity for officials to discuss us plans to locate missile defence bases in poland and the czech republic .
the plan has divided opinion across europe .
that issue , too , will be discussed during friday 's nato-russia council meeting , which is to be attended by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .
would-be nato members croatia , albania and macedonia are set to be informed that despite making great progress on reforms , they must do more if they are to be invited into the alliance at a summit in bucharest in april 2008 , diplomats said . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 , - 3 days ahead of international corruption day on dec .
9 - revealed some surprisingly pessimistic attitudes . in germany , 69 percent of those questioned said they expected corruption to get worse in the next three years , 77 percent believe the government is failing to tackle corruption effectively .

both countries , however , have been chastised by the european union in the past for not doing enough to combat corruption . an overall global average of 54 percent of people said they believed corruption would get worse , compared to 43 percent four years ago .
only one in three were convinced that anti-corruption measures actually work . dirty politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no stranger to scandal germany 's gloomy predictions for the future problems could be a result of grand corruption cases and a perceived lack of political commitment to do something about them . this low public faith in government efforts to clamp down on corruption reflects a broad unease triggered by corporate corruption scandals - such as the volkswagen and siemens cases in germany . but it 's not just germany .
the watchdog asks respondents across the globe which institutions they see as most affected by corruption .
like most years , the institutions entrusted to represent the public interest in political decision-making are seen as the dirtiest . " our experience has shown that it is commitment at the top that will make or break efforts to fight corruption , " said cobus de swardt , transparency international 's managing director .
" these troubling numbers show that government faces a crisis of legitimacy , with the potential to undermine democratization , stability and the protection of human rights . " petty bribery rampant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albania has among the world 's highest levels of petty bribery but ultimately , poor families are the hardest hit by demands for bribes in developed as well as developing countries . globally , the police are the institution most frequently reported to demand bribes , but medical services also stand out as a common source of bribery demands in europe .
in latin america , asia-pacific and north america , petty bribery in the judiciary is a serious problem . " the police and the judiciary in many countries around the world are part of a cycle of corruption , demanding bribes from citizens , " de swardt said in a statement .
" this troubling finding means that corruption is interfering with the basic right to equal treatment before the law . " petty bribery is at its most widespread in albania and senegal , where 30 percent of respondents said they had been required to pay bribes to various authorities for access to services .
other countries with similarly high levels include cambodia , cameroon , macedonia , nigeria , pakistan , the philippines and romania . " this year 's global corruption barometer has made it clear that too often , people must part with their hard-earned money to pay for services that should be free , " said transparency international chair huguette labelle .
" and they do not see enough commitment when they look to their governments and leaders . " we are heartened though , that the public is increasingly demanding the accountability of the very institutions that most affect their lives , as this is a powerful driver of change , " she added . between june and september , gallup international on behalf of ti quizzed 63,000 people in 60 countries on their attitudes toward and experience of corruption . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the need to attract skilled foreign workers was widely acknowledged . wolfgang schäuble implicitly criticized frattini 's plans for a blue card by insisting that immigration should remain a competence of individual member states .
eu commission vice-president franco frattini said there had been a " broad consensus " on the benefits of granting work and residency permits to third-country professionals , given labor shortages and europe 's graying population .
and the justice , interior , employment and social policy ministers also agreed with the eu executive on the necessity of cracking down on undeclared workers , many of them exploited illegal immigrants .
portugal , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the so-called " jumbo council " aimed to produce a wide-ranging debate on this highly sensitive issue .
differing national priorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan aims to help reduce the number of illegal migrants and ministers also stressed different priorities and expressed diverging views on the issue .
mediterranean countries such as italy , spain and greece , for instance , emphasized the need to stop thousands of illegal migrants from north africa and asia .
while the czech republic and bulgaria said their workers should be given priority .
frattini has proposed increasing the eu 's attractivity to third- country professionals by offering them similar benefits to those currently enjoyed by their european colleagues .
candidates would be able to apply for a single work and residency permit , valid for a minimum of two years and renewable , and accepted throughout the union .
under the proposal , foreign white-collar workers would also be allowed to be joined by their families in their new country of residency .
germany 's main concern is that the eu might eventually impose quotas on the number of immigrants who can enter individual member states , an eventuality strongly denied by frattini .
" it is not up to brussels to decide how many engineers from third countries are necessary for germany or austria , " frattini said .
observers in brussels said germany could eventually decide not to adopt the blue card , rather than block the project altogether .
the dutch also voiced doubts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration commissioner frattini with commission president barroso the netherlands also expressed reservations over the proposal while austria called for further " clarifications " in the field of social security and minimum wages , saying it already offered higher levels .
britain , which has opted out of eu immigration policies altogether , outlined to ministers its alternative plan for a points- based system .
devised along the lines of a similar system in place in australia , it aims to ensure that only those migrants meeting the needs of the country would be allowed to enter and work .
the british proposal nevertheless reflects a more general shift towards a " pick and choose " approach to migration that is likely to adversely affect the future of lower-skilled third-country nationals seeking a better life in europe .
some 2 million third-country nationals enter the bloc each year , according to eu estimates , and there is little evidence to suggest this figure will drop significantly in the foreseeable future .
the inflow has been at times poorly managed fuelling growing resentment among ordinary citizens , opposition from nationalist parties and calls for stricter controls by government officials . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

verheugen also stressed that he saw the move as " fundamental to establishing europe 's autonomy in this field . "
with the eu lagging far behind the us in defense spending , he said that public opposition to increasing expenditure in this sector meant that the eu had to spend more efficiently .

they would not impact on the purchase of arms , munitions and war materials or other sensitive non-military procurements in areas such as counter-terrorism . the initiative is also intended to co-ordinate different national procurement rules , which have proved a major hurdle .
verheugen , who is also industry commissioner , said the complex mix of national legislation and controls on the transfer of defense equipment currently in place had even helped encourage the mass use of the exemption .
" if you just want a spare tyre , for example , for a defense vehicle , you 've got to go through the same authorization procedure as if you were selling a gun outside the european union , " he explained .
he said the new measures would apply " perhaps not to the whole tank but for example the spare tyre .
not to a mortar or motor for a fighter plane , but for components or spare parts . "

this will lead to greater openness of defense markets between member states to the benefit of all : armed forces , taxpayers and industries . "
he said the commission would have the same powers to fine non-compliant member states as in other areas of eu policy .
the european defense agency , formed in 2004 to help eu member nations improve their military capabilities , welcomed the commission 's plans , even though its own attempts to achieve similar results have borne little fruit .
" the european market for tanks does not operate in the same way as the market for washing machines , " said new eda chief executive alexander weis .

merkel reacted by suggesting that such an affiliation of nations could lead to " a corrosion of the eu in its core area " and " could release explosive powers in the eu . "
such a frankly undiplomatic reaction was unusual under the circumstances , and suggested that merkel may have reached a point in her relationship with the french president where she felt it necessary to go public with her discontent .
merkel unhappy with sarkozy 's tactics bildunterschrift : for relations between the two leaders had already begun to sour well before this disagreement , due in no small part to sarkozy 's propensity for unilateral action and self-promotion .
this began as early as the so-called eu mini-treaty , on which merkel - as head of the union when germany held the rotating eu presidency - had been working for months before sarkozy renamed it and claimed it as his own .
later , the french president ruffled german - and european - feathers when he sent his wife cecilia to libya to negotiate the freedom of bulgarian nurses sentenced to death for allegedly infecting children with aids .
the problem was that brussels had been negotiating their freedom for a long time , particularly under german eu presidency , and had apparently been close to a resolution of the crisis .
the subsequent agreement in which france is to supply libya with a nuclear reactor for the desalination of sea water sparked criticism from both parties in germany 's ruling coalition , although government sources claimed it had not caused a rift in bilateral relations .
putin call highlights divisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy strayed from the eu line on the russian elections finally , the recent election triumph of russian president vladimir putin exposed deep rifts in the policies of the two neighbours towards russia .
while the german government called the elections to the russian duma " neither fair , equal nor democratic , " sarkozy was one of the rare world leaders to offer the russian president his unqualified congratulations .
thursday evening 's summit will be primarily devoted to european issues , but the two leaders may use it to ease some of the tension that has begun to afflict relations since sarkozy became french president less than eight months ago . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 06.12.2007 germany suspicious about eu blue card plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue card would allow skilled professionals access to the eu labor market the german interior minister has expressed strong reservations about an eu-wide " blue card " at a meeting of ministers in brussels .
but the need to attract skilled foreign workers was widely acknowledged . wolfgang schäuble implicitly criticized frattini 's plans for a blue card by insisting that immigration should remain a competence of individual member states .
eu commission vice-president franco frattini said there had been a " broad consensus " on the benefits of granting work and residency permits to third-country professionals , given labor shortages and europe 's graying population .
and the justice , interior , employment and social policy ministers also agreed with the eu executive on the necessity of cracking down on undeclared workers , many of them exploited illegal immigrants .
portugal , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said the so-called " jumbo council " aimed to produce a wide-ranging debate on this highly sensitive issue .
differing national priorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan aims to help reduce the number of illegal migrants and ministers also stressed different priorities and expressed diverging views on the issue .
mediterranean countries such as italy , spain and greece , for instance , emphasized the need to stop thousands of illegal migrants from north africa and asia .
while the czech republic and bulgaria said their workers should be given priority .
frattini has proposed increasing the eu 's attractivity to third- country professionals by offering them similar benefits to those currently enjoyed by their european colleagues .
candidates would be able to apply for a single work and residency permit , valid for a minimum of two years and renewable , and accepted throughout the union .
under the proposal , foreign white-collar workers would also be allowed to be joined by their families in their new country of residency .
germany 's main concern is that the eu might eventually impose quotas on the number of immigrants who can enter individual member states , an eventuality strongly denied by frattini .
" it is not up to brussels to decide how many engineers from third countries are necessary for germany or austria , " frattini said .
observers in brussels said germany could eventually decide not to adopt the blue card , rather than block the project altogether .
the dutch also voiced doubts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration commissioner frattini with commission president barroso the netherlands also expressed reservations over the proposal while austria called for further " clarifications " in the field of social security and minimum wages , saying it already offered higher levels .
britain , which has opted out of eu immigration policies altogether , outlined to ministers its alternative plan for a points- based system .
devised along the lines of a similar system in place in australia , it aims to ensure that only those migrants meeting the needs of the country would be allowed to enter and work .
the british proposal nevertheless reflects a more general shift towards a " pick and choose " approach to migration that is likely to adversely affect the future of lower-skilled third-country nationals seeking a better life in europe .
some 2 million third-country nationals enter the bloc each year , according to eu estimates , and there is little evidence to suggest this figure will drop significantly in the foreseeable future .
the inflow has been at times poorly managed fuelling growing resentment among ordinary citizens , opposition from nationalist parties and calls for stricter controls by government officials . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do hope for the future presidential elections on march 2 that there will be an invitation to organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- observers in due time and in an appropriate way , " eu foreign affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said on wednesday , dec .
5 . on sunday , russia held parliamentary elections which handed a massive victory to the united russia party backed by president vladimir putin . putin 's constitutional term of office expires next year , but he is widely expected to use the party 's strong position to find some way of keeping power .
sunday 's elections were marred by allegations of systematic media bias , pressure on voters and harassment of opposition politicians . but evidence confirming those allegations was hard to come by , as the osce - the main body which oversees elections in europe - had cancelled a planned large-scale observation mission , claiming that the russian authorities had refused visas to most of its staff . observers lament state media control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united russia 's " our choice is putin " campaign had blanket coverage on monday , those members of the osce who had been able to observe parts of the election said that it had not conformed to international standards of democracy .
russian opposition parties echoed the claims . " television coverage was monopolized by the ruling party , " the osce 's representative for freedom of the media , miklos haraszti , complained in a statement focusing on the media bias . there were " several cases of harassment and violence against the independent media " which " contributed to the intimidating atmosphere , " he said .
" monitoring by the central electoral commission and the -lsb- non-governmental organization -rsb- russian union of journalists showed a clear bias in favor of the ruling party candidates on the main television channels . " combined coverage of russian president vladimir putin , the government and the ruling united russia party amounted to about 80 percent of all political coverage on national channels . haraszti said he had submitted to russian foreign minister sergey lavrov a list of incidents where media freedom had been violated during the election campaign . list of violations sent as warning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers want to see more transparency in may the report should act as a reminder to russia " of its commitment to guarantee a free and fair media coverage during elections , " he said . the findings " are an early warning in view of the march 2008 presidential election , " haraszti said .
" i ask the new state duma to ensure the right of the media to provide balanced and objective information . " the us , eu and germany all joined in criticizing the elections and called on the russian authorities to investigate the allegations of improper conduct . but the kremlin rejected all accusations , insisting that the elections had been free and fair and saying that foreign criticism was part of a us plot to tarnish russia 's image . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

h20 networks has been in negotiations with water firms for the last five years and began rolling out its fibre-via-sewers network - known as focus -lrb- fibre optical cable underground sewer -rrb- in 2003 .
universities in aberdeen , edinburgh and bournemouth are enjoying high-speed fibre connections with speeds of up to 20gbps -lrb- gigabits per second -rrb- , while council offices around the uk are also benefiting from super-fast broadband .
next month it plans to move to a new phase of its roll-out which could see it provide fibre networks to businesses and consumers around the uk .
much cheaper managing director elfed thomas came up with the idea of using sewer ducts for fibre some years ago .
" we had this big infrastructure problem in the uk and we had this existing ducting and i just thought why ca n't we use the sewers , " he explained .
now , some years from that initial thought , he has high hopes for his sewer-based network .
mr thomas had a eureka moment about using the sewers to lay fibre " there is no reason why this ca n't be deployed throughout the uk , " he told the bbc news website .
according to him there are some big benefits to using the sewers to deploy a fibre network .
the alternative way of laying fibre involves digging up the road which can be extremely disruptive , expensive and slow .
" to roll out a network deploying fibre over a 2km area would be six to 12 months in the planning .
we can do it physically in four hours , " said mr thomas .
there is also a huge disparity in the costs as well .
" it costs between £ 150 and £ 200 per metre to dig up the roads and our costs are nowhere near that , " he said .
it cost napier university in the order of £ 80,000 to have a 1.2km fibre network .
with a traditional fibre network these costs would have been in the region of £ 400,000 to £ 1.2m , said mr thomas .
environmentally-friendly the other major advantage over competing systems , for instance the leased lines that bt supplies to businesses , is that the costs are not dependent on how much capacity is required .
" you can have 10mbps or 20gbps and it costs the same , " said mr thomas .
with over 13,500 students , the need for fast and robust networks at napier university was obvious .
and with methods of teaching changing , the network is playing an ever-more important role as a learning tool .
no road digging is required to lay the cable in the sewers " students require access to the network 24 hours a day , and some of the teaching material that they are downloading , including video , can consist of quite large files , " commented iain russell , the network systems manager at napier university .
bournemouth borough council regarded the system as a more environmentally-friendly way of providing fast net access .
it found that it was able to get its network in just over a week .
" the fact that it only took one week to implement is incredible , " said bob rhodes , it project manager for bournemouth borough council .
" bournemouth is a town with a lot of tourism and architectural heritage , so it 's great that we are using the local sewer network , " he said .
in march of this year , ask4 became the first internet service provider to hook up with h2o .
closing the divide with the cost savings and the apparent ease to deploy it is perhaps surprising that more firms are not offering the same service .
" in principle it sounds great and i 'm sure that it will play a role in the deployment of fibre , " said tim johnson , an analyst with research firm point topic .
" but there are questions about its usage in a domestic environment , such as how do you get the cable from the sewer into the house .
would you , for instance , do it via the toilet ?
there are also questions about leakage , " he said .
for h20 , the most difficult part of the process came in persuading the water companies to allow their real-estate to be used for untested purposes .
" the hardest thing was getting the water companies to agree to this .
it has taken a long time , " said mr thomas .
it meant h20 had to come up with a system that did not interfere with the hydraulic flow .
part of the solution lay in making sure that the cables were not connected in the sewer itself .
using the sewers for fibre is not new .
japan has a fairly widespread sewer-based fibre network and in paris , a similar system is being used .
some experts think that the uk 's archaic sewer system is not up to the job but mr thomas disputes this .
" the sewer network is more than capable of handling cable , " he said .
there are around 360,000 miles of sewers in the uk .
because of the nature of the infrastructure it does not extend to remoter areas but will , according to mr thomas , also play a part in helping bring fibre to the remoter parts of the uk .
" we can bring the nearest fibre to within ten miles of villages , " he said .

h20 networks has been in negotiations with water firms for the last five years and began rolling out its fibre-via-sewers network - known as focus -lrb- fibre optical cable underground sewer -rrb- in 2003 .
universities in aberdeen , edinburgh and bournemouth are enjoying high-speed fibre connections with speeds of up to 20gbps -lrb- gigabits per second -rrb- , while council offices around the uk are also benefiting from super-fast broadband .
next month it plans to move to a new phase of its roll-out which could see it provide fibre networks to businesses and consumers around the uk .
much cheaper managing director elfed thomas came up with the idea of using sewer ducts for fibre some years ago .
" we had this big infrastructure problem in the uk and we had this existing ducting and i just thought why ca n't we use the sewers , " he explained .
now , some years from that initial thought , he has high hopes for his sewer-based network .
mr thomas had a eureka moment about using the sewers to lay fibre ' super-speed homes ' " there is no reason why this ca n't be deployed throughout the uk , " he told the bbc news website .
according to him there are some big benefits to using the sewers to deploy a fibre network .
the alternative way of laying fibre involves digging up the road which can be extremely disruptive , expensive and slow .
" to roll out a network deploying fibre over a 2km area would be six to 12 months in the planning .
we can do it physically in four hours , " said mr thomas .
there is also a huge disparity in the costs as well .
" it costs between £ 150 and £ 200 per metre to dig up the roads and our costs are nowhere near that , " he said .
it cost napier university in the order of £ 80,000 to have a 1.2km fibre network .
with a traditional fibre network these costs would have been in the region of £ 400,000 to £ 1.2m , said mr thomas .
environmentally-friendly the other major advantage over competing systems , for instance the leased lines that bt supplies to businesses , is that the costs are not dependent on how much capacity is required .
" you can have 10mbps or 20gbps and it costs the same , " said mr thomas .
with over 13,500 students , the need for fast and robust networks at napier university was obvious .
and with methods of teaching changing , the network is playing an ever-more important role as a learning tool .
no road digging is required to lay the cable in the sewers net speed warning " students require access to the network 24 hours a day , and some of the teaching material that they are downloading , including video , can consist of quite large files , " commented iain russell , the network systems manager at napier university .
bournemouth borough council regarded the system as a more environmentally-friendly way of providing fast net access .
it found that it was able to get its network in just over a week .
" the fact that it only took one week to implement is incredible , " said bob rhodes , it project manager for bournemouth borough council .
" bournemouth is a town with a lot of tourism and architectural heritage , so it 's great that we are using the local sewer network , " he said .
in march of this year , ask4 became the first internet service provider to hook up with h2o .
closing the divide with the cost savings and the apparent ease to deploy it is perhaps surprising that more firms are not offering the same service .
" in principle it sounds great and i 'm sure that it will play a role in the deployment of fibre , " said tim johnson , an analyst with research firm point topic .
" but there are questions about its usage in a domestic environment , such as how do you get the cable from the sewer into the house .
would you , for instance , do it via the toilet ?

the alternative way of laying fibre involves digging up the road which can be extremely disruptive , expensive and slow .

it found that it was able to get its network in just over a week .
" the fact that it only took one week to implement is incredible , " said bob rhodes , it project manager for bournemouth borough council .

speaking to the financial times , mr paulson said that people have been wrong to worry that china 's growth was going to hurt the rest of the world .
however , he added that the growth needed to become " more balanced " .
critics of china have complained that it keeps its currency weak in order to boost exports and drive the economy .
beijing talks many in the us have bemoaned the weakness of china 's yuan , which they say has given the asian tiger an unfair trade advantage .
chinese exports to the us and europe have rocketed in the past year , helped by the weak yuan .
the yuan has appreciated slightly faster in the past year , though not enough to ease concerns .
mr paulson is heading to china for talks next week , and trade and currency issues will feature high on the agenda .
liberalisation of the financial services sector , and the issue of food and product safety are also expected to be discussed at the beijing talks .
" american consumers need to have confidence in the safety of the products they purchase , whether produced at home or abroad , " mr paulson said in a speech to the asia society .
despite pressure in the us for concrete results from the talks , scepticism remains as to what the talks will actually deliver .
some observers say that the chinese administration is weary of america 's list of complaints , hopes and requests .
" we see a dialogue fatigue on the chinese side , " said james zimmerman , president of the american chamber of commerce in china .

precision dating of a lunar rock that fell to earth shows our satellite must have had lava erupting across its vast plains 4.35 billion years ago .
this is hundreds of millions of years earlier than had been indicated by the rocks collected by apollo astronauts .
scientists say the information will help us better understand the beginnings of the solar system .
and they urge future moon missions to try to obtain more of these most ancient rocks .
" we want to understand how the solar system formed , how the planets formed , " said mahesh anand from the uk 's open university .
" the moon is the only place where you can go to find the first 500 million years of geological history , because these old rocks have been lost on earth , " he told bbc news .
botswana fortune according to the favoured theory , the moon was created some 4.5 billion years ago in a smash-up between the earth and a mars-sized body .
material thrown into space is believed to have coalesced to become our satellite .
volcanism on this new object would not have started until its surface had cooled to form a crust and its insides had become separated into a mantle and a core .
quite when this might have happened has been hard to pin down .
virtually none of the basaltic rocks collected by moonwalkers are older than 3.9 billion years ; but with less than 400kg of lunar material returned to earth , many scientists suspected apollo would not be the last word on the subject .
now , dr anand - working with dr kentaro terada , from hiroshima university , japan , and other colleagues - has put a new date on a lunar meteorite known as kalahari 009 .
sometime in the past , this 13.5kg volcanic rock was blasted off the moon by the impact of an asteroid or comet and fell to earth in what is now botswana .
moon knowledge scientists know it comes from the moon because of the type of oxygen atoms it contains .
and by looking closely at the ratio of uranium and lead atoms in the rock 's phosphate minerals , the team has also been able to say when the basalt was ejected - 4.35 billion years ago , give or take 150 million years .
in pictures : moon missions " the age of the phosphate is the age of the rock , " said dr anand , " because the rock solidifies when the magma cools , and when the magma cools the mineral forms .
" volcanic activity is a secondary process .
a planet has first to form , solidify , and separate into layers ; and then there is melting of that solidified mantle to produce volcanism .
" so we are pushing all of this further back in time ; and -lsb- our research -rsb- suggests these processes took place over a much shorter timescale than had previously been thought . "
new interest space agencies have renewed their interest in the moon three decades after the apollo landings .
europe 's recent smart-1 orbiter has been swiftly followed by japanese and chinese spacecraft .
india will be next ; and in the coming decade we should see robots land on the lunar surface , with astronauts set to return by 2020 .
scientists say the moon has much to tell us about the early earth .
the surface rocks on our planet are relatively young because they are constantly recycled into the interior .
the not-so-dynamic moon , on the other hand , has an abundance of early material on its surface .
researchers think it should even harbour ancient earth meteorites - rocks that travelled in the opposite direction to kalahari 009 .

precision dating of a lunar rock that fell to earth shows our satellite must have had lava erupting across its vast plains 4.35 billion years ago .
this is hundreds of millions of years earlier than had been indicated by the rocks collected by apollo astronauts .
scientists say the information will help us better understand the beginnings of the solar system .
and they urge future moon missions to try to obtain more of these most ancient rocks .
" we want to understand how the solar system formed , how the planets formed , " said mahesh anand from the uk 's open university .
" the moon is the only place where you can go to find the first 500 million years of geological history , because these old rocks have been lost on earth , " he told bbc news .
botswana fortune according to the favoured theory , the moon was created some 4.5 billion years ago in a smash-up between the earth and a mars-sized body .
material thrown into space is believed to have coalesced to become our satellite .
kalahari 009 is the biggest of all the known lunar meteorites volcanism on this new object would not have started until its surface had cooled to form a crust and its insides had become separated into a mantle and a core .
quite when this might have happened has been hard to pin down .
virtually none of the basaltic rocks collected by moonwalkers are older than 3.9 billion years ; but with less than 400kg of lunar material returned to earth , many scientists suspected apollo would not be the last word on the subject .
now , dr anand - working with dr kentaro terada , from hiroshima university , japan , and other colleagues - has put a new date on a lunar meteorite known as kalahari 009 .
sometime in the past , this 13.5kg volcanic rock was blasted off the moon by the impact of an asteroid or comet and fell to earth in what is now botswana .
moon knowledge scientists know it comes from the moon because of the type of oxygen atoms it contains .
and by looking closely at the ratio of uranium and lead atoms in the rock 's phosphate minerals , the team has also been able to say when the basalt was ejected - 4.35 billion years ago , give or take 150 million years .
in pictures : moon missions " the age of the phosphate is the age of the rock , " said dr anand , " because the rock solidifies when the magma cools , and when the magma cools the mineral forms .
" volcanic activity is a secondary process .
a planet has first to form , solidify , and separate into layers ; and then there is melting of that solidified mantle to produce volcanism .
" so we are pushing all of this further back in time ; and -lsb- our research -rsb- suggests these processes took place over a much shorter timescale than had previously been thought . "
new interest space agencies have renewed their interest in the moon three decades after the apollo landings .
europe 's recent smart-1 orbiter has been swiftly followed by japanese and chinese spacecraft .
india will be next ; and in the coming decade we should see robots land on the lunar surface , with astronauts set to return by 2020 .
scientists say the moon has much to tell us about the early earth .
the surface rocks on our planet are relatively young because they are constantly recycled into the interior .
the not-so-dynamic moon , on the other hand , has an abundance of early material on its surface .
researchers think it should even harbour ancient earth meteorites - rocks that travelled in the opposite direction to kalahari 009 .

iran 's natanz enrichment plant the national intelligence estimate -lrb- nie -rrb- on iran this week concluded that iran probably did once have a plan to develop a nuclear bomb but halted this in 2003 and had not restarted by mid-2007 .
there was an important proviso : " we do not know whether it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons . "
the assessment is based on a wide range of intelligence sources .
these include interceptions of communications , possibly information from defectors , technical information from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- the un body inspecting iran 's declared nuclear facilities -rrb- and even an analysis of tv footage from inside iran 's enrichment plant .
update : according to the new york times , a key element was the acquisition of notes about meetings between iranian officials during which military officers complained at the programme being shut down .
this resulted in a detailed exercise to decide whether the information was genuine .
the examination took place in a new atmosphere of scepticism .
this differed from the attitude during the iraq days which tended to think the worst of iraq 's intentions .
new procedures the nie is drawn up by the national intelligence council -lrb- nic -rrb- , formed in 1973 .
it consults all the us intelligence agencies , which number no fewer than 16 , ranging from the cia to the treasury department .
-lsb- intelligence agencies are -rsb- are now required to submit formal assessments that highlight the strengths , weaknesses , and overall credibility of their sources used in developing critical judgments national intelligence estimate introduction in its introduction to the report on iran , the nic says that in the last 18 months it has created new procedures under which the intelligence agencies " are now required to submit formal assessments that highlight the strengths , weaknesses , and overall credibility of their sources used in developing the critical judgments of the nie " .
in addition , it says it has " applied more rigorous standards ...
we have made a concerted effort to not only highlight differences among agencies but to explain the reasons for such differences and to prominently display them . "
the weakness of consensus the aim is to avoid the weakness of all systems where co-ordination is the requirement .
co-ordination can lead to consensus and consensus can hide doubts and flaws .
the same weakness was evident in the british system of having a joint intelligence committee , which came to a similarly wrong conclusion over iraq despite doubts in the system lower down .
one example from iraq concerned the source known as curveball , who was given undue prominence , especially in the assessment of so-called mobile chemical weapons vehicles .
the system has also been strengthened by the creation of an overarching director of national intelligence -lrb- dni -rrb- , to whom the nic reports .
it was created after the failures to predict and interdict the attacks of 9/11 .
again the danger of creating yet another post is that intelligence gets reduced in a longer and longer process of examination into the lowest common denominator .
new people at the top the new thinking is partly due to the two people at the top of these offices .
the dni is admiral mike mcconnell , who once directed the national security agency , the american electronic eavesdropper and who came out of retirement to do this job .
read the findings national intelligence estimate on iran -lsb- 25kb -rsb- most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need adobe reader download the reader here he told the new york times in an interview in august : " my job is to speak truth to power . "
the other key figure is the head of the nic thomas fingar , who has held a number of senior posts in intelligence in the state department .
the critics have their doubts not that everyone is impressed .
president bush himself picked up the doubts inherent in the nie and said that iran remained a danger .
the israelis have already rejected the nie finding , claiming that iran has re-started its nuclear weapons effort .
and critics in the united states are attacking the authors of the report , mr fingar among them .
the wall street journal said he was one of three " hyper-partisan anti-bush officials " behind the nie .
the carnegie endowment 's vice president george perkovich also points out : " the nie does not say that there should be any confidence that iran 's nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes , as required under the npt -lrb- the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -rrb- . "
and of course there is no guarantee that this report will be any more accurate than the 2005 one .
the history of intelligence is signposted by mistakes .

iran 's natanz enrichment plant the national intelligence estimate -lrb- nie -rrb- on iran this week concluded that iran probably did once have a plan to develop a nuclear bomb but halted this in 2003 and had not restarted by mid-2007 .
there was an important proviso : " we do not know whether it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons . "
the assessment is based on a wide range of intelligence sources .
these include interceptions of communications , possibly information from defectors , technical information from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- the un body inspecting iran 's declared nuclear facilities -rrb- and even an analysis of tv footage from inside iran 's enrichment plant .
update : according to the new york times , a key element was the acquisition of notes about meetings between iranian officials during which military officers complained at the programme being shut down .
this resulted in a detailed exercise to decide whether the information was genuine .
the examination took place in a new atmosphere of scepticism .
this differed from the attitude during the iraq days which tended to think the worst of iraq 's intentions .
new procedures the nie is drawn up by the national intelligence council -lrb- nic -rrb- , formed in 1973 .
it consults all the us intelligence agencies , which number no fewer than 16 , ranging from the cia to the treasury department .
-lsb- intelligence agencies are -rsb- are now required to submit formal assessments that highlight the strengths , weaknesses , and overall credibility of their sources used in developing critical judgments national intelligence estimate introduction in its introduction to the report on iran , the nic says that in the last 18 months it has created new procedures under which the intelligence agencies " are now required to submit formal assessments that highlight the strengths , weaknesses , and overall credibility of their sources used in developing the critical judgments of the nie " .
in addition , it says it has " applied more rigorous standards ...
we have made a concerted effort to not only highlight differences among agencies but to explain the reasons for such differences and to prominently display them . "
the weakness of consensus the aim is to avoid the weakness of all systems where co-ordination is the requirement .
co-ordination can lead to consensus and consensus can hide doubts and flaws .
the same weakness was evident in the british system of having a joint intelligence committee , which came to a similarly wrong conclusion over iraq despite doubts in the system lower down .
one example from iraq concerned the source known as curveball , who was given undue prominence , especially in the assessment of so-called mobile chemical weapons vehicles .
the system has also been strengthened by the creation of an overarching director of national intelligence -lrb- dni -rrb- , to whom the nic reports .
it was created after the failures to predict and interdict the attacks of 9/11 .
again the danger of creating yet another post is that intelligence gets reduced in a longer and longer process of examination into the lowest common denominator .
new people at the top the new thinking is partly due to the two people at the top of these offices .
the dni is admiral mike mcconnell , who once directed the national security agency , the american electronic eavesdropper and who came out of retirement to do this job .
read the findings national intelligence estimate on iran -lsb- 25kb -rsb- most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need adobe reader download the reader here he told the new york times in an interview in august : " my job is to speak truth to power . "
the other key figure is the head of the nic thomas fingar , who has held a number of senior posts in intelligence in the state department .
the critics have their doubts not that everyone is impressed .
president bush himself picked up the doubts inherent in the nie and said that iran remained a danger .
the israelis have already rejected the nie finding , claiming that iran has re-started its nuclear weapons effort .
and critics in the united states are attacking the authors of the report , mr fingar among them .
the wall street journal said he was one of three " hyper-partisan anti-bush officials " behind the nie .
the carnegie endowment 's vice president george perkovich also points out : " the nie does not say that there should be any confidence that iran 's nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes , as required under the npt -lrb- the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -rrb- . "
and of course there is no guarantee that this report will be any more accurate than the 2005 one .

siemens was found guilty of paying bribes to nigerian officials and fined 201m euros -lrb- $ 248m ; £ 122.3m -rrb- by a munich court on 4 october .
a nigerian anti-corruption agency has since begun investigating former ministers alleged to have taken bribes .
nigeria has often been ranked as one of the world 's most corrupt countries .
president umaru yar 'adua took office in may this year , pledging to fight corruption .
mr yar 'adua ordered the investigation into allegations that siemens paid 10m euros in bribes to officials , including ministers , in nigeria between 2001 and 2004 .
the ministers and officials named have denied the allegations .
the nigerian government cancelled a 128.4m naira -lrb- $ 1.1m ; £ 532,683 -rrb- contract with siemens for the supply of circuit breakers and other power generation accessories on wednesday .
president yar 'adua came to power promising to combat corruption " council cancelled the contract bid won by siemens nigeria because of the current investigation against the company relating to corrupt practices , " information and communications minister john odey said .
" government will not have any dealings with siemens nigeria in terms of contracts until the investigation is concluded and the company is exonerated or otherwise , " mr odey said .
siemen 's chairman and chief executive both quit over the scandal .
at least two employees were given suspended sentences for bribery and breach of trust .
siemens has accepted the munich court judgement and has also agreed to pay 179m euros to the tax authorities .

the 12.8-tonne , 1.3bn euro -lrb- $ 1.8bn ; £ 0.9bn -rrb- columbus module will carry out studies that would be impossible in the gravity experienced at the earth 's surface .
after years of delay , the european module is scheduled to lift off from kennedy space center this week aboard the us space shuttle atlantis .
" it is the end of the beginning , " says alan thirkettle , international space station -lrb- iss -rrb- programme manager at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- .
columbus ' arrival at the station two days after launch will mark the end of an arduous , 12-year campaign to establish an outpost for europe on the final frontier .
the majority of scientific research that will be done on columbus is dedicated to fields that are of interest to our life here on earth thomas reiter , astronaut " the phase of the space station so far has been one of engineering and the development of hardware , " relates esa director-general , jean-jacques dordain .
but once columbus is operational and the space station crew has been increased from three to six , he explains , europe can truly begin reaping the benefits of its investment in the iss .
" to make scientific progress you have to repeat and repeat an experiment .
and the only way to repeat experiments over and over is to have continuous access to these capabilities .
" with columbus , we will have continuous access . "
the 7m-long -lrb- 24ft -rrb- , 4.5m-wide -lrb- 14ft -rrb- lab will be lifted out of the shuttle 's cargo bay by the space station 's robotic arm and attached to the harmony node 2 module on the iss .
" when we 're on orbit , the first thing we will do is commission the module and make sure that it works okay , " says alan thirkettle .
installing columbus " this wo n't take more than three or four weeks .
from that moment onwards , we acquire rights and we acquire obligations . "
the obligations are that esa carries out flights of its new logistics spacecraft , the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- , to the iss roughly once every 12 months .
as rights , esa gets a percentage of space station crew time and also flight opportunities .
european astronauts currently get one six-month flight every two years , but esa is negotiating to acquire flights currently allocated to the italian space agency -lrb- asi -rrb- , which would give it access to the iss once a year .
inside columbus the orbital lab is equipped with 10 experiment racks , each about the size of a telephone booth .
eight of these are situated in the side walls and two in the ceiling .
in addition , columbus will carry two experiment payloads on the outside of its pressurised hull .
payloads are partly geared towards investigating the problems humans would face on missions to mars .
but , explains thomas reiter , a european astronaut and executive at the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- : " the majority of scientific research that will be done on columbus is dedicated to fields that are of interest to our life here on earth .
the columbus laboratory certainly does n't address any fundamental questions in science steven weinberg " that is especially true for materials science , for biology , physics , chemistry and human physiology , " he tells bbc news .
" there are many human diseases which are not yet fully understood , and research in microgravity could make a contribution in understanding the roots of some diseases rather than just the symptoms . "
one such investigation planned for columbus will examine the effects of weightlessness on the immune system , which plays important roles in numerous diseases , including cancers and aids .
certain effects of the immune system are activated or deactivated in different gravity environments .
understanding how weightlessness affects the immune system might help researchers to develop new strategies for tackling disease .
addressing fundamentals other experiments could help advance understanding of osteoporosis , lead to improvements in the aluminium casting process - which is crucial in the motor industry - and result in food crops that are more resistant to disease and drought .
internal payload biolab - supports experiments on microbes , cell and tissue cultures , small plants and insects .
european physiology modules facility -lrb- epm -rrb- - a set of experiments to investigate the effects of long-duration spaceflight on the human body fluid science laboratory -lrb- fsl -rrb- - will be used to study how fluids behave in microgravity european drawer rack -lrb- edr -rrb- - a carrier system designed to house experimental modules in drawers and lockers european transport carrier -lrb- etc -rrb- - will serve as a workbench and stowage facility however , some researchers are less than enthusiastic about the scientific value of investigations carried out on columbus .
" the columbus laboratory certainly does n't address any fundamental questions in science - in astronomy or fundamental physics , for instance , " says nobel laureate steven weinberg , a theoretical physicist from the university of texas , austin .
" it is really an exercise in technology .
-lsb- and -rsb- i think a lot of the work is aimed at improving our knowledge of microgravity , which does n't seem to me very important unless you 're going to be spending a lot of time in space for some other reason .
" since i think manned spaceflight is not a cost-effective way of doing science , i 'm not impressed by that sort of research . "
professor weinberg said an experiment originally designated for the space station called the alpha magnetic spectrometer -lrb- ams -rrb- , which carries a price tag above $ 1bn , might now be mothballed due to limited space on the few remaining shuttle flights before nasa retires the orbiter in 2010 .
many in the physics community regarded this cosmic ray detection experiment as capable of providing important new insights into the universe .
external payload european technology exposure facility -lrb- eutef -rrb- - carries experiments requiring exposure to the space environment solar - a platform with three scientific instruments to study sun-related phenomena the columbus project was hit by several hold-ups in space station construction which allowed its costs to rise .
the first of these occurred between 1996 and 2000 and was due to russian delays in launching the space station 's main control and habitation module , zvezda .
further delay resulted from the destruction of space shuttle columbia in 2003 , which claimed the lives of seven astronauts .
the us space agency spent two years and more than $ 1bn fixing the shuttle for a return to flight in 2005 .
however , the shuttle fleet was swiftly grounded again for a further year after the same problem responsible for dooming columbia - foam shedding from the external fuel tank - re-emerged on the 2005 mission .
according to alan thirkettle , a cost overrun of just 4 % in these circumstances was acceptable and displayed good management of the project .
michael menking , senior vice-president at eads astrium , the prime contractor on columbus , said the delays had an upside .
" they gave us the opportunity to prepare for installing an additional communications terminal inside columbus at some point in the future .
we were also able to carry out extra tests on the internal and external payloads , " he told bbc news .
esa will use a dedicated centre in southern germany to control activities on columbus .

the 12.8-tonne , 1.3bn euro -lrb- $ 1.8bn ; £ 0.9bn -rrb- columbus module will carry out studies that would be impossible in the gravity experienced at the earth 's surface .
after years of delay , the european module is scheduled to lift off from kennedy space center this week aboard the us space shuttle atlantis .
" it is the end of the beginning , " says alan thirkettle , international space station -lrb- iss -rrb- programme manager at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- .
columbus ' arrival at the station two days after launch will mark the end of an arduous , 12-year campaign to establish an outpost for europe on the final frontier .
the majority of scientific research that will be done on columbus is dedicated to fields that are of interest to our life here on earth thomas reiter , astronaut " the phase of the space station so far has been one of engineering and the development of hardware , " relates esa director-general , jean-jacques dordain .
but once columbus is operational and the space station crew has been increased from three to six , he explains , europe can truly begin reaping the benefits of its investment in the iss .
" to make scientific progress you have to repeat and repeat an experiment .
and the only way to repeat experiments over and over is to have continuous access to these capabilities .
" with columbus , we will have continuous access . "
the 7m-long -lrb- 24ft -rrb- , 4.5m-wide -lrb- 14ft -rrb- lab will be lifted out of the shuttle 's cargo bay by the space station 's robotic arm and attached to the harmony node 2 module on the iss .
" when we 're on orbit , the first thing we will do is commission the module and make sure that it works okay , " says alan thirkettle .
installing columbus " this wo n't take more than three or four weeks .
from that moment onwards , we acquire rights and we acquire obligations . "
the obligations are that esa carries out flights of its new logistics spacecraft , the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- , to the iss roughly once every 12 months .
as rights , esa gets a percentage of space station crew time and also flight opportunities .
european astronauts currently get one six-month flight every two years , but esa is negotiating to acquire flights currently allocated to the italian space agency -lrb- asi -rrb- , which would give it access to the iss once a year .
inside columbus the orbital lab is equipped with 10 experiment racks , each about the size of a telephone booth .
eight of these are situated in the side walls and two in the ceiling .
in addition , columbus will carry two experiment payloads on the outside of its pressurised hull .
payloads are partly geared towards investigating the problems humans would face on missions to mars .
but , explains thomas reiter , a european astronaut and executive at the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- : " the majority of scientific research that will be done on columbus is dedicated to fields that are of interest to our life here on earth .
the columbus laboratory certainly does n't address any fundamental questions in science steven weinberg " that is especially true for materials science , for biology , physics , chemistry and human physiology , " he tells bbc news .
" there are many human diseases which are not yet fully understood , and research in microgravity could make a contribution in understanding the roots of some diseases rather than just the symptoms . "
one such investigation planned for columbus will examine the effects of weightlessness on the immune system , which plays important roles in numerous diseases , including cancers and aids .
certain effects of the immune system are activated or deactivated in different gravity environments .
understanding how weightlessness affects the immune system might help researchers to develop new strategies for tackling disease .
addressing fundamentals other experiments could help advance understanding of osteoporosis , lead to improvements in the aluminium casting process - which is crucial in the motor industry - and result in food crops that are more resistant to disease and drought .
internal payload biolab - supports experiments on microbes , cell and tissue cultures , small plants and insects .
european physiology modules facility -lrb- epm -rrb- - a set of experiments to investigate the effects of long-duration spaceflight on the human body fluid science laboratory -lrb- fsl -rrb- - will be used to study how fluids behave in microgravity european drawer rack -lrb- edr -rrb- - a carrier system designed to house experimental modules in drawers and lockers european transport carrier -lrb- etc -rrb- - will serve as a workbench and stowage facility however , some researchers are less than enthusiastic about the scientific value of investigations carried out on columbus .
" the columbus laboratory certainly does n't address any fundamental questions in science - in astronomy or fundamental physics , for instance , " says nobel laureate steven weinberg , a theoretical physicist from the university of texas , austin .
" it is really an exercise in technology .
-lsb- and -rsb- i think a lot of the work is aimed at improving our knowledge of microgravity , which does n't seem to me very important unless you 're going to be spending a lot of time in space for some other reason .
" since i think manned spaceflight is not a cost-effective way of doing science , i 'm not impressed by that sort of research . "
professor weinberg said an experiment originally designated for the space station called the alpha magnetic spectrometer -lrb- ams -rrb- , which carries a price tag above $ 1bn , might now be mothballed due to limited space on the few remaining shuttle flights before nasa retires the orbiter in 2010 .
many in the physics community regarded this cosmic ray detection experiment as capable of providing important new insights into the universe .

many retailers are bracing themselves for a tough christmas , especially in the us , where the housing slump is expected to hit consumer spending .
but tiffany has raised its sales forecast for the whole of 2007 .
the jeweller has also announced a deal with swatch group , which will make all of its watches in future .
the new watch company will be owned by swatch group tiffany watches currently make up between 2 % and 3 % of its total sales and it hopes that the partnership with the world 's biggest watchmaker will help to boost that figure .

a lack of physical activity leads to depression and dementia , evidence presented at the british nutrition foundation conference shows .
it comes as new research from the university of bristol found that being active cuts the risk of alzheimer 's disease by around a third .
currently only 35 % of men and 24 % of women reach the recommended weekly amount of physical activity .
professor nanette mutrie , an expert in exercise and sport psychology at the university of strathclyde , told the conference that mental health was not a trivial issue . "
it 's only recently that people have begun to see the link between physical activity and mental health " professor nanette mutrie " it 's only recently that people have begun to see the link between physical activity and mental health .
" it 's important for increasing people 's self esteem , general mood , coping with stress and even sleeping better .
" and we now have very strong evidence that physical activity can prevent depression . "
she said inactive people had twice the risk of becoming depressed and there was also very good evidence that exercise is a useful treatment for depression .
dementia risk researchers at the university of bristol carried out an analysis of 17 trials looking at the effects of physical activity on dementia and alzheimer 's disease .
they found that in both men and women physical activity was associated with a 30-40 % drop in the risk of alzheimer 's .
it is unclear why there is such a great effect but it could be associated with benefits to the vascular system as well as release of chemicals in the brain .
professor mutrie added : " it could be a simple case of use it or lose it .
" it is estimated that over 700,000 people in the uk currently suffer from dementia and more research is needed to determine how this condition can be prevented . "
professor judy buttriss , director general at the bnf , said with people living longer the implications of such studies were " enormous " .
" there has already , justifiably , been a lot of emphasis on good nutrition but we must also find ways of helping people to be more physically active to ensure that they maintain health and quality of life in later years . "
department of health figures show the majority of adults do not do the recommended 30 minutes of moderate activity at least five times a week .
children are also leading increasingly inactive lives .
around 30 % of boys and almost 40 % of girls fail to reach the recommended hour of moderate intensity activity per day .
professor chris riddoch , expert in sport and exercise science at the university of bath , said : " we have half a century of evidence showing active people have lower levels of disease .
" we also have a very good handle on how much exercise people should take . "
but he added efforts to get people to be more active had not been very successful to date .

" and we now have very strong evidence that physical activity can prevent depression . "
she said inactive people had twice the risk of becoming depressed and there was also very good evidence that exercise is a useful treatment for depression .
dementia risk researchers at the university of bristol carried out an analysis of 17 trials looking at the effects of physical activity on dementia and alzheimer 's disease .
they found that in both men and women physical activity was associated with a 30-40 % drop in the risk of alzheimer 's .
it is unclear why there is such a great effect but it could be associated with benefits to the vascular system as well as release of chemicals in the brain .
professor mutrie added : " it could be a simple case of use it or lose it .
" it is estimated that over 700,000 people in the uk currently suffer from dementia and more research is needed to determine how this condition can be prevented . "
professor judy buttriss , director general at the bnf , said with people living longer the implications of such studies were " enormous " .
" there has already , justifiably , been a lot of emphasis on good nutrition but we must also find ways of helping people to be more physically active to ensure that they maintain health and quality of life in later years . "
department of health figures show the majority of adults do not do the recommended 30 minutes of moderate activity at least five times a week .
children are also leading increasingly inactive lives .
around 30 % of boys and almost 40 % of girls fail to reach the recommended hour of moderate intensity activity per day .
professor chris riddoch , expert in sport and exercise science at the university of bath , said : " we have half a century of evidence showing active people have lower levels of disease .
" we also have a very good handle on how much exercise people should take . "
but he added efforts to get people to be more active had not been very successful to date .

wine buckets , a cauldron , dishes and handled shallow bowls were among the items found during a nine-month dig near throgmorton avenue this year .
archaeologists have hailed the find as the most significant in 30 years of excavations in the upper walbrook valley area .
the artefacts will go on display at the museum of london on friday .
experts say the bronzes , found in a wood-lined well , are exceptionally well preserved and offer a rare glimpse into the last days of londinium , the roman name for london .
symbolic closure they say the bronzes may mark the symbolic closure of the well or could have been left by departing roman londoners anticipating a return to the city .
coins discovered in the well date its construction to ad330 and its closure to about ad380 , a time when significant parts of the city had been deserted .
in size and scale they are simply unprecedented jenny hall , museum of london curator most of the items are made of copper alloy but some , a flagon and a dish , are made of lead alloy .
archaeologists say that while they appear to be household items it is possible the hoard may have been used for religious purposes .
jenny hall , curator of roman london at museum of london said : " these finds are amazing .
" in size and scale they are simply unprecedented .
nothing like this has ever been found from london before , or anywhere else in britain . '
