his successor , angela merkel has a different approach , which she will make clear to putin when they meet sunday , according to dw 's cornelia rabitz . since his exit from the political stage and his new role as supervisory board chairman of the consortium that plans to build a baltic sea pipeline from russia to germany , former chancellor gerhard schröder has become something of a lobbyist . he seems to be inspired by his mission .
some people even suspect his consistent praise for russia 's policies has become something of a replacement for his politics drug . in a berlin hotel recently , schröder once more gave a packed house a taste of his stance .
but in the meantime his strident defense of russia causes a rather bad aftertaste .
it 's an embarrassment when a former chancellor is said to behave like the russian president 's spokesman .
it 's an embarrassment when schröder patronizingly charges that public discussion of russia here in germany is " marked by anti-russia reflexes . " of course schröder can call for closer german-russian cooperation .
it 's certainly legitimate to defend energy exporter russia when it 's accused of hypocrisy or becomes the subject of unfair criticism : criticizing russia while assiduously overlooking the political situation in other oil states , such as saudi arabia , iran , nigeria , libya or algeria is reckless . and no one seriously denies moscow 's right to demand market prices for energy from its onetime allies either . sure enough , for schröder , russia 's questionable actions in the most recent natural gas and oil disputes are n't an issue .
why does n't " gerd " recommend more sovereignty in foreign and economic policy matters to his dear friend " volodya " ?
why does n't he warn him of behavior that brings russia a massive loss in esteem and only feeds skepticism toward greater energy dependency ?
it 's an embarrassment when friendship on the political stage is confused with one-sided partisanship . it 's downright improper to willfully and deliberately ignore other aspects .
for supervisory board head schröder , issues of democracy , civil society , human rights , the murders of journalists and other kremlin critics and the lack of rule of law are all negligible and hardly worth mentioning .
it 's no wonder then that he gets top marks from the russian side ; the kremlin could hardly hope for a better - and such a prominent - propagandist . it must be a nuisance to chancellor angela merkel , who travels to sochi on sunday .
as president of the eu council , she is striving for a pragmatic , a good relationship to russia .
in contrast to her predecessor , she addresses problems in bilateral relations and beyond . that 's why in sochi she will again tell president vladimir putin that the recent unannounced russian halt to gas deliveries via belarus annoyed the eu and has nothing to do with normal business behavior .
merkel will once more demand moscow be reliable .
she will remind him of the not yet negotiated partnership deal between the european union and russia .
she will stress how important russia is - also for the resolution of international conflicts . merkel apparently does n't think much of absolution : calling putin a " flawless democrat , " as schröder did during his chancellorship , is something she still wo n't do .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.01.2007 renaming of berlin street reopens old ideological rifts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight goes on a referendum on sunday in berlin will decide whether to name a street after a famous student protest leader of the 1960s .
the issue has polarized opinion and rekindled memories of a turbulent chapter in german history . on sunday , residents of berlin 's friedrichshain-kreuzberg district will go to the polls to settle a simmering controversy over the renaming of a street after rudi dutschke , a protest leader of the 1960s .
the emotive issue has polarized public opinion and brought into focus old political animosities . " germany and berlin need a rudi-dutschke-strasse , because it 's a very important symbol of what we are today and which political stream has made things happen in postwar germany , " said peter unfried , deputy editor-in-chief of left-leaning daily t az who has spearheaded a campaign to rename the street . " what we are today - a freer , more liberal society - is partly due to 1968 and rudi dutschke , " he said . charismatic leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutschke in 1968 during a protest in berlin born in 1940 , dutschke emerged as one of the most charismatic personalities of west germany 's student movement , which pitted children against their parents and anti-communists against leftists in the 1960s . a student of sociology at west berlin 's free university , dutschke was an influential theoretician in left-wing circles and active in organizing street protests - that shook up west german society - against the so-called " establishment . "
the high-profile dutschke was shot and seriously injured in 1968 and moved to london to recover .
years later , he returned to west germany - and life on the political stage .
shortly before his unexpected death in a bathtub in december 1979 - which was thought to have been related to injuries sustained during his shooting - he became actively involved with the ecologically minded greens , who established themselves as a political party three weeks later . right vs. left during the cold war , the greens and the left-wing taz manned the one side of west germany 's ideological battles and the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the right-wing axel springer publishing house the other . axel springer and the taz were n't just political enemies .
they were and still are close neighbors , too .
their offices are located just doors away from each other on kochstrasse -lrb- koch street -rrb- , the street at the center of the renaming fight . it was on this street that angry student protests erupted in 1968 after dutschke was shot and seriously wounded .
students blamed springer 's papers for inflaming public opinion against them and said the man who shot dutschke was influenced by views expressed by springer tabloid bild .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer built the tower block next to the wall as a " beacon of democracy " kochstrasse is something of a showcase of 20th century germany history .
himmler 's gestapo headquarters on wilhelmstrasse was just meters away from the street , at its far western end .
a few blocks to the east , it bisects friedrichstrasse next to what became checkpoint charlie , the us-controlled border crossing to communist east berlin , and remnants of the wall .
the taz is located a few buildings further east . another couple blocks down the road , at the intersection to axel-springer-strasse , stands the tower block the eponymous and powerful publisher built for the berlin office of his hamburg-based company . after naming its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 , the taz started a campaign to rename kochstrasse .
what 's in a name ?
in 2005 , the local assembly in friedrichhain-kreuzberg , dominated by the social democrats and the green party , decided to rename kochstrasse as rudi-dutschke-strasse - to the conservatives ' horror .
" the state should n't honor a person who was in favor of the dissolution of the state , " said timo husein , 26 , head of the cdu 's youth organization in the district .
" he was n't a democrat in a legal sense .
he propagated violence against property .
someone who uses violence to reach his aims is n't an appropriate person to be honored . "
husein said the renaming would mean that the street 's 1,000 residents would have to have their personal id cards changed .
in addition , the area 's estimated 700 businesses , from snack bars to a national insurance company , would have to shell out around 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 450,000 -rrb- to reprint signs , stationary and business cards .
backed by the local cdu , husein 's youth group collected the 10,000 signatures necessary to take the question of renaming the street to the ballot box .
fifteen percent of friedrichshain-kreuzberg 's voters , around 25,000 people , must vote in the referendum sunday to put a stop to the name change .
" a sort of poetic justice " it was a no-brainer for husein 's conservative youth group to take up the fight against dutschke .
" dutschke is naturally an opponent , " he said .
it 's not about changing a law on sales tax , which is rather boring .
it 's really about ideology , about left and right , and the left sees it that way , too . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taz named its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 husein was hopeful dutschke would lose in the referendum , though he admitted it was hard for conservatives to have an effect in the only electoral precinct in germany ever to have directly elected a green candidate to the federal parliament , in 2005 .
" but that 's no reason not to try , " he said .
meanwhile , the taz 's unfried was fairly certain friedrichshain-kreuzberg would go for dutschke .
but whatever the outcome of the poll , he was pleased that the campaign seemed to have raised consciousness of dutschke , a symbol , he said , for fighting for a better society . " not many people know that they changed lindenstrasse to axel-springer-strasse , which not everyone appreciates , especially people on the liberal , progressive side of the spectrum , " unfried said .
" it 'll be a sort of poetic justice to have dutschke boulevard with axel springer street .

its initial strategy of encouraging car companies to enforce their own self-regulated levels of co2 output in their newest vehicles has been inefficient .
few new vehicles on european roads achieve the 140 grams / km limit . germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel told the german parliament this week that the eu must do all it can to bring down the level of carbon dioxide emissions .
he said it was obvious that the policy of self-regulation within the auto industry was not working .
in short , gabriel apparently seemed to support the idea of a regulated and enforced limit . verheugen touts trading scheme bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen is in favor a carbon trading scheme for cars however günter verheugen , gabriel 's compatriot in the eu parliament , was not of the same mind .
the eu industry commissioner rejected the call for a strict limitation on co2 emissions in the car industry and argued that a system similar to that employed by industry where emission credits can be bought and sold . under the bloc 's emissions trading scheme , industries can buy and sell emissions quotas .
if they exceed their limit , they have to buy credits from other companies .
verheugen argued that for some car manufacturers , this would be less expensive than developing emission reduction technologies for their new vehicles by 2012 . " for a manufacturer like porsche , this would always be cheaper than to demand that its cars are developed to reach the emission level of 120 grams , " said verheugen . gabriel skeptical of alternative plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel wants auto firms to cut co2 to eu levels but sigmar gabriel is skeptical as to whether an expansion of the emissions trading scheme to the auto industry was practical . " it is already difficult enough to apply the trading scheme , " he said , and referred to the ongoing disarray within industry itself and the problems experienced while planning a similar scheme in the aviation business . gabriel added that the argument over automotive co2 emissions should be discussed through germany 's eu presidency but added that an agreement should not be rushed to be completed by the end of the six-month role . " this is very ambitious , " he said , adding that the topic required a lot of thought and discussion to find a compromise . he said that consultations with colleagues from the other 26 eu states would begin soon but that finding a common agreement by june would only happen " if things go really well .

" on another important eu-russia trade matter , germany is hoping to clear the way for talks on a russian-eu strategic partnership , which have been blocked by a polish veto linked to a dispute over polish meat imports into russia . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , however , said friday that he was confident poland and russia would find an acceptable compromise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.01.2007 renaming of berlin street reopens old ideological rifts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight goes on a referendum on sunday in berlin will decide whether to name a street after a famous student protest leader of the 1960s .
the issue has polarized opinion and rekindled memories of a turbulent chapter in german history . on sunday , residents of berlin 's friedrichshain-kreuzberg district will go to the polls to settle a simmering controversy over the renaming of a street after rudi dutschke , a protest leader of the 1960s .
the emotive issue has polarized public opinion and brought into focus old political animosities . " germany and berlin need a rudi-dutschke-strasse , because it 's a very important symbol of what we are today and which political stream has made things happen in postwar germany , " said peter unfried , deputy editor-in-chief of left-leaning daily t az who has spearheaded a campaign to rename the street . " what we are today - a freer , more liberal society - is partly due to 1968 and rudi dutschke , " he said . charismatic leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutschke in 1968 during a protest in berlin born in 1940 , dutschke emerged as one of the most charismatic personalities of west germany 's student movement , which pitted children against their parents and anti-communists against leftists in the 1960s . a student of sociology at west berlin 's free university , dutschke was an influential theoretician in left-wing circles and active in organizing street protests - that shook up west german society - against the so-called " establishment . "
the high-profile dutschke was shot and seriously injured in 1968 and moved to london to recover .
years later , he returned to west germany - and life on the political stage .
shortly before his unexpected death in a bathtub in december 1979 - which was thought to have been related to injuries sustained during his shooting - he became actively involved with the ecologically minded greens , who established themselves as a political party three weeks later . right vs. left during the cold war , the greens and the left-wing taz manned the one side of west germany 's ideological battles and the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the right-wing axel springer publishing house the other . axel springer and the taz were n't just political enemies .
they were and still are close neighbors , too .
their offices are located just doors away from each other on kochstrasse -lrb- koch street -rrb- , the street at the center of the renaming fight . it was on this street that angry student protests erupted in 1968 after dutschke was shot and seriously wounded .
students blamed springer 's papers for inflaming public opinion against them and said the man who shot dutschke was influenced by views expressed by springer tabloid bild .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer built the tower block next to the wall as a " beacon of democracy " kochstrasse is something of a showcase of 20th century germany history .
himmler 's gestapo headquarters on wilhelmstrasse was just meters away from the street , at its far western end .
a few blocks to the east , it bisects friedrichstrasse next to what became checkpoint charlie , the us-controlled border crossing to communist east berlin , and remnants of the wall .
the taz is located a few buildings further east . another couple blocks down the road , at the intersection to axel-springer-strasse , stands the tower block the eponymous and powerful publisher built for the berlin office of his hamburg-based company . after naming its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 , the taz started a campaign to rename kochstrasse .
what 's in a name ?
in 2005 , the local assembly in friedrichhain-kreuzberg , dominated by the social democrats and the green party , decided to rename kochstrasse as rudi-dutschke-strasse - to the conservatives ' horror .
" the state should n't honor a person who was in favor of the dissolution of the state , " said timo husein , 26 , head of the cdu 's youth organization in the district .
" he was n't a democrat in a legal sense .
he propagated violence against property .
someone who uses violence to reach his aims is n't an appropriate person to be honored . "
husein said the renaming would mean that the street 's 1,000 residents would have to have their personal id cards changed .
in addition , the area 's estimated 700 businesses , from snack bars to a national insurance company , would have to shell out around 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 450,000 -rrb- to reprint signs , stationary and business cards .
backed by the local cdu , husein 's youth group collected the 10,000 signatures necessary to take the question of renaming the street to the ballot box .
fifteen percent of friedrichshain-kreuzberg 's voters , around 25,000 people , must vote in the referendum sunday to put a stop to the name change .
" a sort of poetic justice " it was a no-brainer for husein 's conservative youth group to take up the fight against dutschke .
" dutschke is naturally an opponent , " he said .
it 's not about changing a law on sales tax , which is rather boring .
it 's really about ideology , about left and right , and the left sees it that way , too . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taz named its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 husein was hopeful dutschke would lose in the referendum , though he admitted it was hard for conservatives to have an effect in the only electoral precinct in germany ever to have directly elected a green candidate to the federal parliament , in 2005 .
" but that 's no reason not to try , " he said .
meanwhile , the taz 's unfried was fairly certain friedrichshain-kreuzberg would go for dutschke .
but whatever the outcome of the poll , he was pleased that the campaign seemed to have raised consciousness of dutschke , a symbol , he said , for fighting for a better society . " not many people know that they changed lindenstrasse to axel-springer-strasse , which not everyone appreciates , especially people on the liberal , progressive side of the spectrum , " unfried said .
" it 'll be a sort of poetic justice to have dutschke boulevard with axel springer street .

his successor , angela merkel has a different approach , which she will make clear to putin when they meet sunday , according to dw 's cornelia rabitz . since his exit from the political stage and his new role as supervisory board chairman of the consortium that plans to build a baltic sea pipeline from russia to germany , former chancellor gerhard schröder has become something of a lobbyist . he seems to be inspired by his mission .
some people even suspect his consistent praise for russia 's policies has become something of a replacement for his politics drug . in a berlin hotel recently , schröder once more gave a packed house a taste of his stance .
but in the meantime his strident defense of russia causes a rather bad aftertaste .
it 's an embarrassment when a former chancellor is said to behave like the russian president 's spokesman .
it 's an embarrassment when schröder patronizingly charges that public discussion of russia here in germany is " marked by anti-russia reflexes . " of course schröder can call for closer german-russian cooperation .
it 's certainly legitimate to defend energy exporter russia when it 's accused of hypocrisy or becomes the subject of unfair criticism : criticizing russia while assiduously overlooking the political situation in other oil states , such as saudi arabia , iran , nigeria , libya or algeria is reckless . and no one seriously denies moscow 's right to demand market prices for energy from its onetime allies either . sure enough , for schröder , russia 's questionable actions in the most recent natural gas and oil disputes are n't an issue .
why does n't " gerd " recommend more sovereignty in foreign and economic policy matters to his dear friend " volodya " ?
why does n't he warn him of behavior that brings russia a massive loss in esteem and only feeds skepticism toward greater energy dependency ?
it 's an embarrassment when friendship on the political stage is confused with one-sided partisanship . it 's downright improper to willfully and deliberately ignore other aspects .
for supervisory board head schröder , issues of democracy , civil society , human rights , the murders of journalists and other kremlin critics and the lack of rule of law are all negligible and hardly worth mentioning .
it 's no wonder then that he gets top marks from the russian side ; the kremlin could hardly hope for a better - and such a prominent - propagandist . it must be a nuisance to chancellor angela merkel , who travels to sochi on sunday .
as president of the eu council , she is striving for a pragmatic , a good relationship to russia .
in contrast to her predecessor , she addresses problems in bilateral relations and beyond . that 's why in sochi she will again tell president vladimir putin that the recent unannounced russian halt to gas deliveries via belarus annoyed the eu and has nothing to do with normal business behavior .
merkel will once more demand moscow be reliable .
she will remind him of the not yet negotiated partnership deal between the european union and russia .
she will stress how important russia is - also for the resolution of international conflicts . merkel apparently does n't think much of absolution : calling putin a " flawless democrat , " as schröder did during his chancellorship , is something she still wo n't do .
the russian president is , after all , far from passing the test . cornelia rabitz is the head of dw-radio 's russian service -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's criticism of russia over energy marks shift in ties chancellor angela merkel 's rebuke of russia over it halting oil supplies to europe has revealed a possible shift in ties between the two countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.01.2007 renaming of berlin street reopens old ideological rifts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight goes on a referendum on sunday in berlin will decide whether to name a street after a famous student protest leader of the 1960s .
the issue has polarized opinion and rekindled memories of a turbulent chapter in german history . on sunday , residents of berlin 's friedrichshain-kreuzberg district will go to the polls to settle a simmering controversy over the renaming of a street after rudi dutschke , a protest leader of the 1960s .
the emotive issue has polarized public opinion and brought into focus old political animosities . " germany and berlin need a rudi-dutschke-strasse , because it 's a very important symbol of what we are today and which political stream has made things happen in postwar germany , " said peter unfried , deputy editor-in-chief of left-leaning daily t az who has spearheaded a campaign to rename the street . " what we are today - a freer , more liberal society - is partly due to 1968 and rudi dutschke , " he said . charismatic leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutschke in 1968 during a protest in berlin born in 1940 , dutschke emerged as one of the most charismatic personalities of west germany 's student movement , which pitted children against their parents and anti-communists against leftists in the 1960s . a student of sociology at west berlin 's free university , dutschke was an influential theoretician in left-wing circles and active in organizing street protests - that shook up west german society - against the so-called " establishment . "
the high-profile dutschke was shot and seriously injured in 1968 and moved to london to recover .
years later , he returned to west germany - and life on the political stage .
shortly before his unexpected death in a bathtub in december 1979 - which was thought to have been related to injuries sustained during his shooting - he became actively involved with the ecologically minded greens , who established themselves as a political party three weeks later . right vs. left during the cold war , the greens and the left-wing taz manned the one side of west germany 's ideological battles and the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the right-wing axel springer publishing house the other . axel springer and the taz were n't just political enemies .
they were and still are close neighbors , too .
their offices are located just doors away from each other on kochstrasse -lrb- koch street -rrb- , the street at the center of the renaming fight . it was on this street that angry student protests erupted in 1968 after dutschke was shot and seriously wounded .
students blamed springer 's papers for inflaming public opinion against them and said the man who shot dutschke was influenced by views expressed by springer tabloid bild .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer built the tower block next to the wall as a " beacon of democracy " kochstrasse is something of a showcase of 20th century germany history .
himmler 's gestapo headquarters on wilhelmstrasse was just meters away from the street , at its far western end .
a few blocks to the east , it bisects friedrichstrasse next to what became checkpoint charlie , the us-controlled border crossing to communist east berlin , and remnants of the wall .
the taz is located a few buildings further east . another couple blocks down the road , at the intersection to axel-springer-strasse , stands the tower block the eponymous and powerful publisher built for the berlin office of his hamburg-based company . after naming its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 , the taz started a campaign to rename kochstrasse .
what 's in a name ?
in 2005 , the local assembly in friedrichhain-kreuzberg , dominated by the social democrats and the green party , decided to rename kochstrasse as rudi-dutschke-strasse - to the conservatives ' horror .
" the state should n't honor a person who was in favor of the dissolution of the state , " said timo husein , 26 , head of the cdu 's youth organization in the district .
" he was n't a democrat in a legal sense .
he propagated violence against property .
someone who uses violence to reach his aims is n't an appropriate person to be honored . "
husein said the renaming would mean that the street 's 1,000 residents would have to have their personal id cards changed .
in addition , the area 's estimated 700 businesses , from snack bars to a national insurance company , would have to shell out around 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 450,000 -rrb- to reprint signs , stationary and business cards .
backed by the local cdu , husein 's youth group collected the 10,000 signatures necessary to take the question of renaming the street to the ballot box .
fifteen percent of friedrichshain-kreuzberg 's voters , around 25,000 people , must vote in the referendum sunday to put a stop to the name change .
" a sort of poetic justice " it was a no-brainer for husein 's conservative youth group to take up the fight against dutschke .
" dutschke is naturally an opponent , " he said .
it 's not about changing a law on sales tax , which is rather boring .
it 's really about ideology , about left and right , and the left sees it that way , too . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taz named its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 husein was hopeful dutschke would lose in the referendum , though he admitted it was hard for conservatives to have an effect in the only electoral precinct in germany ever to have directly elected a green candidate to the federal parliament , in 2005 .
" but that 's no reason not to try , " he said .
meanwhile , the taz 's unfried was fairly certain friedrichshain-kreuzberg would go for dutschke .
but whatever the outcome of the poll , he was pleased that the campaign seemed to have raised consciousness of dutschke , a symbol , he said , for fighting for a better society . " not many people know that they changed lindenstrasse to axel-springer-strasse , which not everyone appreciates , especially people on the liberal , progressive side of the spectrum , " unfried said .

it added that in 2005 the government also hoped to received further information about kurnaz from the american side that would " strengthen the case -lrb- against kurnaz -rrb- for his support of international terrorism . " the allegations have created pressure on german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who at the time was gerhard schröder 's chief of staff and hence in charge of intelligence . does schröder 's government bear responsibility ? the newspaper reported that the german government was informed in 2002 that kurnaz had been physically and psychologically abused in guantanamo .
it added that officials of germany 's bnd federal intelligence service who interrogated kurnaz in cuba in september 2002 had found no evidence linking him to any terrorist activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz during his appearance before a parliamentary investigation committee this week faced with this information , schröder 's social democrat-green party government still tried to block kurnaz ' return to germany after the 2005 federal elections , the paper said . the paper 's allegations were given further weight this week when kurnaz ' lawyer , bernhard docke , told a parliamentary inquiry in berlin that the german foreign ministry only administered kurnaz ' case and was n't proactive in freeing him . docke said he suspected that the government under then-chancellor schröder refused kurnaz entry into germany in the fall of 2002 , when the us originally offered to release him from the prison camp . " until this day i see no real reason why germany , if it had the offer from the us , did n't take it up , " after both sides had established that kurnaz was n't a terror suspect , " docke said .
" if kurnaz would have been german , he would already have been free in fall 2002 , " he said . docke told the parliamentary inquiry that former foreign minister joschka fischer told kurnaz 's mother in a letter that german help was limited because kurnaz had turkish citizenship and the us was only negotiating with the home nations of inmates . foreign minister under pressure the accusations against the former government and in particular the focus on steinmeier 's role sparked a heated debate among german politicians on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has some questions to answers in the kurnaz affair wolfgang neskovic of the opposition left party accused the previous government and steinmeier of " merciless , inhuman cold-bloodedness " in dealing with kurnaz .
neskovic slammed the government 's attempt to block kurnaz 's return to germany as " deeply cynical . " " i do n't think steinmeier will survive this politically , " he added . volker beck , head of the opposition green party which was a coalition partner in the previous government , said that if steinmeier had indeed sanctioned kurnaz spending long unnecessary years at guantanamo bay , the minister " could no longer credibly represent the german government 's human rights and foreign policy . " steinmeier 's spokesman jens plötner however rejected the allegations , pointing out that the parliamentary investigation into the kurnaz case had just begun its work and that it had still to collect much information before conclusions could be drawn from the affair . on friday , two german newspapers reported that the us offer to release kurnaz in 2002 - which was refused by germany - came with several conditions . for one , the us demanded that kurnaz be monitored round the clock in germany so that he would take up any terrorist activity , the bild and stuttgarter nachrichten reported . kurnaz alleges abuse at german and us hands apart from the previous german government 's role in the affair , kurnaz 's case is also being investigated for intelligence and security lapses on the part of german authorities . the inquiry is also investigating whether the questioning of kurnaz in guantanamo by german officials in feb .
2002 was appropriate .
the government at the time condemned the prison camp , yet was unprepared to question kurnaz over indications he may have been involved in a possible islamist terrorist cell in bremen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz has said he was abused by german special-forces soldiers kurnaz this week testified he was arrested on a trip to pakistan in october 2001 and handed over by the authorities to the americans who transferred him to a us prison in kandahar , in afghanistan .
from there he was later moved to guantanamo . kurnaz has alleged that two german special-forces soldiers beat him up while he was detained in kandahar , in afghanistan in 2002 .

its initial strategy of encouraging car companies to enforce their own self-regulated levels of co2 output in their newest vehicles has been inefficient .
few new vehicles on european roads achieve the 140 grams / km limit . germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel told the german parliament this week that the eu must do all it can to bring down the level of carbon dioxide emissions .
he said it was obvious that the policy of self-regulation within the auto industry was not working .
in short , gabriel apparently seemed to support the idea of a regulated and enforced limit . verheugen touts trading scheme bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen is in favor a carbon trading scheme for cars however günter verheugen , gabriel 's compatriot in the eu parliament , was not of the same mind .
the eu industry commissioner rejected the call for a strict limitation on co2 emissions in the car industry and argued that a system similar to that employed by industry where emission credits can be bought and sold . under the bloc 's emissions trading scheme , industries can buy and sell emissions quotas .
if they exceed their limit , they have to buy credits from other companies .
verheugen argued that for some car manufacturers , this would be less expensive than developing emission reduction technologies for their new vehicles by 2012 . " for a manufacturer like porsche , this would always be cheaper than to demand that its cars are developed to reach the emission level of 120 grams , " said verheugen . gabriel skeptical of alternative plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel wants auto firms to cut co2 to eu levels but sigmar gabriel is skeptical as to whether an expansion of the emissions trading scheme to the auto industry was practical . " it is already difficult enough to apply the trading scheme , " he said , and referred to the ongoing disarray within industry itself and the problems experienced while planning a similar scheme in the aviation business . gabriel added that the argument over automotive co2 emissions should be discussed through germany 's eu presidency but added that an agreement should not be rushed to be completed by the end of the six-month role . " this is very ambitious , " he said , adding that the topic required a lot of thought and discussion to find a compromise . he said that consultations with colleagues from the other 26 eu states would begin soon but that finding a common agreement by june would only happen " if things go really well .

his successor , angela merkel has a different approach , which she will make clear to putin when they meet sunday , according to dw 's cornelia rabitz . since his exit from the political stage and his new role as supervisory board chairman of the consortium that plans to build a baltic sea pipeline from russia to germany , former chancellor gerhard schröder has become something of a lobbyist . he seems to be inspired by his mission .
some people even suspect his consistent praise for russia 's policies has become something of a replacement for his politics drug . in a berlin hotel recently , schröder once more gave a packed house a taste of his stance .
but in the meantime his strident defense of russia causes a rather bad aftertaste .
it 's an embarrassment when a former chancellor is said to behave like the russian president 's spokesman .
it 's an embarrassment when schröder patronizingly charges that public discussion of russia here in germany is " marked by anti-russia reflexes . " of course schröder can call for closer german-russian cooperation .
it 's certainly legitimate to defend energy exporter russia when it 's accused of hypocrisy or becomes the subject of unfair criticism : criticizing russia while assiduously overlooking the political situation in other oil states , such as saudi arabia , iran , nigeria , libya or algeria is reckless . and no one seriously denies moscow 's right to demand market prices for energy from its onetime allies either . sure enough , for schröder , russia 's questionable actions in the most recent natural gas and oil disputes are n't an issue .
why does n't " gerd " recommend more sovereignty in foreign and economic policy matters to his dear friend " volodya " ?
why does n't he warn him of behavior that brings russia a massive loss in esteem and only feeds skepticism toward greater energy dependency ?
it 's an embarrassment when friendship on the political stage is confused with one-sided partisanship . it 's downright improper to willfully and deliberately ignore other aspects .
for supervisory board head schröder , issues of democracy , civil society , human rights , the murders of journalists and other kremlin critics and the lack of rule of law are all negligible and hardly worth mentioning .
it 's no wonder then that he gets top marks from the russian side ; the kremlin could hardly hope for a better - and such a prominent - propagandist . it must be a nuisance to chancellor angela merkel , who travels to sochi on sunday .
as president of the eu council , she is striving for a pragmatic , a good relationship to russia .
in contrast to her predecessor , she addresses problems in bilateral relations and beyond . that 's why in sochi she will again tell president vladimir putin that the recent unannounced russian halt to gas deliveries via belarus annoyed the eu and has nothing to do with normal business behavior .
merkel will once more demand moscow be reliable .
she will remind him of the not yet negotiated partnership deal between the european union and russia .
she will stress how important russia is - also for the resolution of international conflicts . merkel apparently does n't think much of absolution : calling putin a " flawless democrat , " as schröder did during his chancellorship , is something she still wo n't do .
the russian president is , after all , far from passing the test . cornelia rabitz is the head of dw-radio 's russian service -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's criticism of russia over energy marks shift in ties chancellor angela merkel 's rebuke of russia over it halting oil supplies to europe has revealed a possible shift in ties between the two countries .

" they will definitely talk " about energy , merkel 's g8 advisor bernd pfaffenbach , said in an interview with russian daily vedomosti , adding that the row had " damaged russia 's authority . " " we will insist more firmly on the need for russia to be a reliable partner in the long term , " pfaffenbach said .

" damaged reputation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's decision to stop oil deliveries concerned many across europe last week , merkel , herself , also said russia had damaged its image as a reliable partner by stopping oil deliveries through a main pipeline that runs crosses belarus on the way to eu countries . the german-russian relationship has become less cozy since merkel took over from her predecessor gerhard schröder .
last friday , she stressed she could not describe putin as " a flawless democrat , " as schröder once did . " i have n't said that yet and i 'm not saying that now , " merkel said . merkel has also put a stronger emphasis than schröder on the need for strong european ties to the united states . eu still needs russian energy but eu dependency on russian energy means that links remain pragmatic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in germany prefer nuclear energy to depending on russian gas and oil " this does not mean the german chancellor is negative about russia , " german foreign policy expert alexander rahr wrote in the russian government newspaper rossiiskaya gazeta .
" she still tries to build pragmatic and reliable relations with moscow . " on another important eu-russia trade matter , germany is hoping to clear the way for talks on a russian-eu strategic partnership , which have been blocked by a polish veto linked to a dispute over polish meat imports into russia . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , however , said friday that he was confident poland and russia would find an acceptable compromise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.01.2007 renaming of berlin street reopens old ideological rifts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight goes on a referendum on sunday in berlin will decide whether to name a street after a famous student protest leader of the 1960s .
the issue has polarized opinion and rekindled memories of a turbulent chapter in german history . on sunday , residents of berlin 's friedrichshain-kreuzberg district will go to the polls to settle a simmering controversy over the renaming of a street after rudi dutschke , a protest leader of the 1960s .
the emotive issue has polarized public opinion and brought into focus old political animosities . " germany and berlin need a rudi-dutschke-strasse , because it 's a very important symbol of what we are today and which political stream has made things happen in postwar germany , " said peter unfried , deputy editor-in-chief of left-leaning daily t az who has spearheaded a campaign to rename the street . " what we are today - a freer , more liberal society - is partly due to 1968 and rudi dutschke , " he said . charismatic leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutschke in 1968 during a protest in berlin born in 1940 , dutschke emerged as one of the most charismatic personalities of west germany 's student movement , which pitted children against their parents and anti-communists against leftists in the 1960s . a student of sociology at west berlin 's free university , dutschke was an influential theoretician in left-wing circles and active in organizing street protests - that shook up west german society - against the so-called " establishment . "
the high-profile dutschke was shot and seriously injured in 1968 and moved to london to recover .
years later , he returned to west germany - and life on the political stage .
shortly before his unexpected death in a bathtub in december 1979 - which was thought to have been related to injuries sustained during his shooting - he became actively involved with the ecologically minded greens , who established themselves as a political party three weeks later . right vs. left during the cold war , the greens and the left-wing taz manned the one side of west germany 's ideological battles and the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the right-wing axel springer publishing house the other . axel springer and the taz were n't just political enemies .
they were and still are close neighbors , too .
their offices are located just doors away from each other on kochstrasse -lrb- koch street -rrb- , the street at the center of the renaming fight . it was on this street that angry student protests erupted in 1968 after dutschke was shot and seriously wounded .
students blamed springer 's papers for inflaming public opinion against them and said the man who shot dutschke was influenced by views expressed by springer tabloid bild .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer built the tower block next to the wall as a " beacon of democracy " kochstrasse is something of a showcase of 20th century germany history .
himmler 's gestapo headquarters on wilhelmstrasse was just meters away from the street , at its far western end .
a few blocks to the east , it bisects friedrichstrasse next to what became checkpoint charlie , the us-controlled border crossing to communist east berlin , and remnants of the wall .
the taz is located a few buildings further east . another couple blocks down the road , at the intersection to axel-springer-strasse , stands the tower block the eponymous and powerful publisher built for the berlin office of his hamburg-based company . after naming its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 , the taz started a campaign to rename kochstrasse .
what 's in a name ?
in 2005 , the local assembly in friedrichhain-kreuzberg , dominated by the social democrats and the green party , decided to rename kochstrasse as rudi-dutschke-strasse - to the conservatives ' horror .
" the state should n't honor a person who was in favor of the dissolution of the state , " said timo husein , 26 , head of the cdu 's youth organization in the district .
" he was n't a democrat in a legal sense .
he propagated violence against property .
someone who uses violence to reach his aims is n't an appropriate person to be honored . "
husein said the renaming would mean that the street 's 1,000 residents would have to have their personal id cards changed .
in addition , the area 's estimated 700 businesses , from snack bars to a national insurance company , would have to shell out around 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 450,000 -rrb- to reprint signs , stationary and business cards .
backed by the local cdu , husein 's youth group collected the 10,000 signatures necessary to take the question of renaming the street to the ballot box .
fifteen percent of friedrichshain-kreuzberg 's voters , around 25,000 people , must vote in the referendum sunday to put a stop to the name change .
" a sort of poetic justice " it was a no-brainer for husein 's conservative youth group to take up the fight against dutschke .
" dutschke is naturally an opponent , " he said .
it 's not about changing a law on sales tax , which is rather boring .
it 's really about ideology , about left and right , and the left sees it that way , too . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taz named its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 husein was hopeful dutschke would lose in the referendum , though he admitted it was hard for conservatives to have an effect in the only electoral precinct in germany ever to have directly elected a green candidate to the federal parliament , in 2005 .
" but that 's no reason not to try , " he said .
meanwhile , the taz 's unfried was fairly certain friedrichshain-kreuzberg would go for dutschke .
but whatever the outcome of the poll , he was pleased that the campaign seemed to have raised consciousness of dutschke , a symbol , he said , for fighting for a better society . " not many people know that they changed lindenstrasse to axel-springer-strasse , which not everyone appreciates , especially people on the liberal , progressive side of the spectrum , " unfried said .
" it 'll be a sort of poetic justice to have dutschke boulevard with axel springer street .

it added that in 2005 the government also hoped to received further information about kurnaz from the american side that would " strengthen the case -lrb- against kurnaz -rrb- for his support of international terrorism . " the allegations have created pressure on german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who at the time was gerhard schröder 's chief of staff and hence in charge of intelligence . does schröder 's government bear responsibility ? the newspaper reported that the german government was informed in 2002 that kurnaz had been physically and psychologically abused in guantanamo .
it added that officials of germany 's bnd federal intelligence service who interrogated kurnaz in cuba in september 2002 had found no evidence linking him to any terrorist activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz during his appearance before a parliamentary investigation committee this week faced with this information , schröder 's social democrat-green party government still tried to block kurnaz ' return to germany after the 2005 federal elections , the paper said . the paper 's allegations were given further weight this week when kurnaz ' lawyer , bernhard docke , told a parliamentary inquiry in berlin that the german foreign ministry only administered kurnaz ' case and was n't proactive in freeing him . docke said he suspected that the government under then-chancellor schröder refused kurnaz entry into germany in the fall of 2002 , when the us originally offered to release him from the prison camp . " until this day i see no real reason why germany , if it had the offer from the us , did n't take it up , " after both sides had established that kurnaz was n't a terror suspect , " docke said .
" if kurnaz would have been german , he would already have been free in fall 2002 , " he said . docke told the parliamentary inquiry that former foreign minister joschka fischer told kurnaz 's mother in a letter that german help was limited because kurnaz had turkish citizenship and the us was only negotiating with the home nations of inmates . foreign minister under pressure the accusations against the former government and in particular the focus on steinmeier 's role sparked a heated debate among german politicians on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has some questions to answers in the kurnaz affair wolfgang neskovic of the opposition left party accused the previous government and steinmeier of " merciless , inhuman cold-bloodedness " in dealing with kurnaz .
neskovic slammed the government 's attempt to block kurnaz 's return to germany as " deeply cynical . " " i do n't think steinmeier will survive this politically , " he added . volker beck , head of the opposition green party which was a coalition partner in the previous government , said that if steinmeier had indeed sanctioned kurnaz spending long unnecessary years at guantanamo bay , the minister " could no longer credibly represent the german government 's human rights and foreign policy . " steinmeier 's spokesman jens plötner however rejected the allegations , pointing out that the parliamentary investigation into the kurnaz case had just begun its work and that it had still to collect much information before conclusions could be drawn from the affair . on friday , two german newspapers reported that the us offer to release kurnaz in 2002 - which was refused by germany - came with several conditions . for one , the us demanded that kurnaz be monitored round the clock in germany so that he would take up any terrorist activity , the bild and stuttgarter nachrichten reported . kurnaz alleges abuse at german and us hands apart from the previous german government 's role in the affair , kurnaz 's case is also being investigated for intelligence and security lapses on the part of german authorities . the inquiry is also investigating whether the questioning of kurnaz in guantanamo by german officials in feb .
2002 was appropriate .
the government at the time condemned the prison camp , yet was unprepared to question kurnaz over indications he may have been involved in a possible islamist terrorist cell in bremen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz has said he was abused by german special-forces soldiers kurnaz this week testified he was arrested on a trip to pakistan in october 2001 and handed over by the authorities to the americans who transferred him to a us prison in kandahar , in afghanistan .
from there he was later moved to guantanamo . kurnaz has alleged that two german special-forces soldiers beat him up while he was detained in kandahar , in afghanistan in 2002 .
prosecutors in germany are already considering filing charges against the two soldiers after kurnaz identified them from photographers . kurnaz , who returned to germany last year , has also testified he was tortured in guantanamo bay . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-born ex-prisoner describes torture at guantanamo bay former guantanamo bay prisoner , german-born turk murat kurnaz told a parliamentary committee he faced torture and other abuse during his four years spent at the us prison in cuba .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.01.2007 renaming of berlin street reopens old ideological rifts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight goes on a referendum on sunday in berlin will decide whether to name a street after a famous student protest leader of the 1960s .
the issue has polarized opinion and rekindled memories of a turbulent chapter in german history . on sunday , residents of berlin 's friedrichshain-kreuzberg district will go to the polls to settle a simmering controversy over the renaming of a street after rudi dutschke , a protest leader of the 1960s .
the emotive issue has polarized public opinion and brought into focus old political animosities . " germany and berlin need a rudi-dutschke-strasse , because it 's a very important symbol of what we are today and which political stream has made things happen in postwar germany , " said peter unfried , deputy editor-in-chief of left-leaning daily t az who has spearheaded a campaign to rename the street . " what we are today - a freer , more liberal society - is partly due to 1968 and rudi dutschke , " he said . charismatic leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutschke in 1968 during a protest in berlin born in 1940 , dutschke emerged as one of the most charismatic personalities of west germany 's student movement , which pitted children against their parents and anti-communists against leftists in the 1960s . a student of sociology at west berlin 's free university , dutschke was an influential theoretician in left-wing circles and active in organizing street protests - that shook up west german society - against the so-called " establishment . "
the high-profile dutschke was shot and seriously injured in 1968 and moved to london to recover .
years later , he returned to west germany - and life on the political stage .
shortly before his unexpected death in a bathtub in december 1979 - which was thought to have been related to injuries sustained during his shooting - he became actively involved with the ecologically minded greens , who established themselves as a political party three weeks later . right vs. left during the cold war , the greens and the left-wing taz manned the one side of west germany 's ideological battles and the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the right-wing axel springer publishing house the other . axel springer and the taz were n't just political enemies .
they were and still are close neighbors , too .
their offices are located just doors away from each other on kochstrasse -lrb- koch street -rrb- , the street at the center of the renaming fight . it was on this street that angry student protests erupted in 1968 after dutschke was shot and seriously wounded .
students blamed springer 's papers for inflaming public opinion against them and said the man who shot dutschke was influenced by views expressed by springer tabloid bild .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer built the tower block next to the wall as a " beacon of democracy " kochstrasse is something of a showcase of 20th century germany history .
himmler 's gestapo headquarters on wilhelmstrasse was just meters away from the street , at its far western end .
a few blocks to the east , it bisects friedrichstrasse next to what became checkpoint charlie , the us-controlled border crossing to communist east berlin , and remnants of the wall .
the taz is located a few buildings further east . another couple blocks down the road , at the intersection to axel-springer-strasse , stands the tower block the eponymous and powerful publisher built for the berlin office of his hamburg-based company . after naming its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 , the taz started a campaign to rename kochstrasse .
what 's in a name ?
in 2005 , the local assembly in friedrichhain-kreuzberg , dominated by the social democrats and the green party , decided to rename kochstrasse as rudi-dutschke-strasse - to the conservatives ' horror .
" the state should n't honor a person who was in favor of the dissolution of the state , " said timo husein , 26 , head of the cdu 's youth organization in the district .
" he was n't a democrat in a legal sense .
he propagated violence against property .
someone who uses violence to reach his aims is n't an appropriate person to be honored . "
husein said the renaming would mean that the street 's 1,000 residents would have to have their personal id cards changed .
in addition , the area 's estimated 700 businesses , from snack bars to a national insurance company , would have to shell out around 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 450,000 -rrb- to reprint signs , stationary and business cards .
backed by the local cdu , husein 's youth group collected the 10,000 signatures necessary to take the question of renaming the street to the ballot box .
fifteen percent of friedrichshain-kreuzberg 's voters , around 25,000 people , must vote in the referendum sunday to put a stop to the name change .
" a sort of poetic justice " it was a no-brainer for husein 's conservative youth group to take up the fight against dutschke .
" dutschke is naturally an opponent , " he said .
it 's not about changing a law on sales tax , which is rather boring .
it 's really about ideology , about left and right , and the left sees it that way , too . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taz named its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 husein was hopeful dutschke would lose in the referendum , though he admitted it was hard for conservatives to have an effect in the only electoral precinct in germany ever to have directly elected a green candidate to the federal parliament , in 2005 .
" but that 's no reason not to try , " he said .
meanwhile , the taz 's unfried was fairly certain friedrichshain-kreuzberg would go for dutschke .
but whatever the outcome of the poll , he was pleased that the campaign seemed to have raised consciousness of dutschke , a symbol , he said , for fighting for a better society . " not many people know that they changed lindenstrasse to axel-springer-strasse , which not everyone appreciates , especially people on the liberal , progressive side of the spectrum , " unfried said .
" it 'll be a sort of poetic justice to have dutschke boulevard with axel springer street .

his successor , angela merkel has a different approach , which she will make clear to putin when they meet sunday , according to dw 's cornelia rabitz . since his exit from the political stage and his new role as supervisory board chairman of the consortium that plans to build a baltic sea pipeline from russia to germany , former chancellor gerhard schröder has become something of a lobbyist . he seems to be inspired by his mission .
some people even suspect his consistent praise for russia 's policies has become something of a replacement for his politics drug . in a berlin hotel recently , schröder once more gave a packed house a taste of his stance .
but in the meantime his strident defense of russia causes a rather bad aftertaste .
it 's an embarrassment when a former chancellor is said to behave like the russian president 's spokesman .
it 's an embarrassment when schröder patronizingly charges that public discussion of russia here in germany is " marked by anti-russia reflexes . " of course schröder can call for closer german-russian cooperation .
it 's certainly legitimate to defend energy exporter russia when it 's accused of hypocrisy or becomes the subject of unfair criticism : criticizing russia while assiduously overlooking the political situation in other oil states , such as saudi arabia , iran , nigeria , libya or algeria is reckless . and no one seriously denies moscow 's right to demand market prices for energy from its onetime allies either . sure enough , for schröder , russia 's questionable actions in the most recent natural gas and oil disputes are n't an issue .
why does n't " gerd " recommend more sovereignty in foreign and economic policy matters to his dear friend " volodya " ?
why does n't he warn him of behavior that brings russia a massive loss in esteem and only feeds skepticism toward greater energy dependency ?
it 's an embarrassment when friendship on the political stage is confused with one-sided partisanship . it 's downright improper to willfully and deliberately ignore other aspects .
for supervisory board head schröder , issues of democracy , civil society , human rights , the murders of journalists and other kremlin critics and the lack of rule of law are all negligible and hardly worth mentioning .
it 's no wonder then that he gets top marks from the russian side ; the kremlin could hardly hope for a better - and such a prominent - propagandist . it must be a nuisance to chancellor angela merkel , who travels to sochi on sunday .
as president of the eu council , she is striving for a pragmatic , a good relationship to russia .
in contrast to her predecessor , she addresses problems in bilateral relations and beyond . that 's why in sochi she will again tell president vladimir putin that the recent unannounced russian halt to gas deliveries via belarus annoyed the eu and has nothing to do with normal business behavior .

experts say political parties are largely to blame for the situation . germany 's first female chancellor angela merkel arguably became the most influential political figure in europe a few weeks ago as her country took over the presidency of both the eu and the g8 .
merkel was also voted the world 's most powerful woman by forbes magazine in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : segolene royal would be france 's first female president , if elected the german head of government is a high-profile example of the success of women in european politics and could soon be followed by segolene royal , who is hoping to become france 's first female president in may . but unlike merkel and other female leaders , many women in european parliaments still owe their mandate to gender quotas .
similar to equal employment quotas , they are designed to boost the number of women in politics and balance out the number of male and female representatives . do quotas work ? the use of gender quotas has been criticized as giving women an unfair advantage over male candidates and can take away a woman 's sense of empowerment that they had earned the position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ratio that 's still reality in some legislatures " this legislation -lrb- gender quotas -rrb- would mean that people would not deserve to be there , but that they are forced there , " said godfrey bloom , a european parliamentarian and member of uk independence party .
" it debases the currency for these poor ladies who can not prove that have earned the position . " but drude dahlerup , a professor of political science at stockholm university and an expert on gender quotas , said measures like quotas are a way to compensate for discrimination against women . " if everything was fair in society , i would n't argue for quotas , but you do n't have equal opportunity in society , " she added . resistance to change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some french parties would rather pay fines than adhere to gender quotas for the national assembly .
dahlerup attributed the unpopularity of quotas in europe to the " notion of liberal democracy . "
she said the quotas are often seen as interfering with the democratic system . she cited france as an example : there must be an equal number of men and women political candidates for national parliamentary elections , or parties must pay a fine .
most of the parties that can afford to pay the fine are choosing to do so rather than have the required number of female candidates . there has also been resistance to have a quota system in italy , where a vote on a so-called " pink quota " was rejected by the italian parliament in april 2006 .
this bill would have meant that one-third of all national election candidates would have to be women , to boost the current 11.5 percent female representation , the forth lowest in the european union . political parties hold the power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to parties to put more women on their ballots dahlerup said the political parties are the " gatekeepers " to the parliament , who have the power to change the gender balances .
this applies to a parliamentary system , not direct democracy which operates in the us and switzerland , which only require one-off majority votes for most of the time . " they -lrb- political parties -rrb- could change political representation tomorrow if they wanted because they control the nomination process , " dahlerup said .

similar to equal employment quotas , they are designed to boost the number of women in politics and balance out the number of male and female representatives . do quotas work ? the use of gender quotas has been criticized as giving women an unfair advantage over male candidates and can take away a woman 's sense of empowerment that they had earned the position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ratio that 's still reality in some legislatures " this legislation -lrb- gender quotas -rrb- would mean that people would not deserve to be there , but that they are forced there , " said godfrey bloom , a european parliamentarian and member of uk independence party .
" it debases the currency for these poor ladies who can not prove that have earned the position . " but drude dahlerup , a professor of political science at stockholm university and an expert on gender quotas , said measures like quotas are a way to compensate for discrimination against women . " if everything was fair in society , i would n't argue for quotas , but you do n't have equal opportunity in society , " she added . resistance to change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some french parties would rather pay fines than adhere to gender quotas for the national assembly .
dahlerup attributed the unpopularity of quotas in europe to the " notion of liberal democracy . "
she said the quotas are often seen as interfering with the democratic system . she cited france as an example : there must be an equal number of men and women political candidates for national parliamentary elections , or parties must pay a fine .
most of the parties that can afford to pay the fine are choosing to do so rather than have the required number of female candidates . there has also been resistance to have a quota system in italy , where a vote on a so-called " pink quota " was rejected by the italian parliament in april 2006 .
this bill would have meant that one-third of all national election candidates would have to be women , to boost the current 11.5 percent female representation , the forth lowest in the european union . political parties hold the power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to parties to put more women on their ballots dahlerup said the political parties are the " gatekeepers " to the parliament , who have the power to change the gender balances .
this applies to a parliamentary system , not direct democracy which operates in the us and switzerland , which only require one-off majority votes for most of the time .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist hrant dink was a critic of turkey 's official line on the massacre of armenians it also said dink , who was gunned down outside the offices of the newspaper he edited in istanbul on friday , was prepared to take great personal risks for his work . " he always strove to present a balanced picture and avoided provoking confrontations .
he staunchly supported the democratic reforms in turkey , " the eu presidency statement said . " as a result , hrant dink was held in high esteem in various sections of turkish society , as well as in europe . " turkey promises to find murderer the turkish government vowed saturday that it would do " whatever it takes " to find and punish the murderer as it came under fire for failing to protect dink despite nationalist threats . " the perpetrators will not escape justice , " prime minister recep tayyip erdogan said at a political function in kizilcahamam , near ankara . " the authorities will do whatever it takes to bring to justice the perpetrator , those who planned the murder or instigated it , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of demonstrators in istanbul protested the killing interior minister abdulkadir aksu , personally overseeing the investigation in istanbul , said all three people detained in connection with friday 's murder had been released , anatolia news agency reported .
the agency had earlier said that a total of eight people were questioned . dink , the editor of the bilingual turkish-armenian weekly agos , was shot three times in the head and neck outside the newspaper 's office in downtown istanbul , sending shock waves throughout the country . " we are very close to solving the case .
we have definitive evidence , " istanbul governor muammer guler told reporters late friday . journalist had received threats dink was one of the taboo-breaking critics of the official line on the mass massacres of armenians under the ottoman empire during world war i and was last year given a suspended six-month jail sentence for insulting " turkishness . " dink was convicted under the infamous article 301 of the penal code , which has served as a ground to prosecute a series of other intellectuals , including 2006 nobel literature laureate orhan pamuk , and which the eu has denounced a threat to free speech in the eu-hopeful country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous turkish writer orhan pamuk also faced charges for insulting " turkishness " nationalists had labeled him a " traitor " and dink had spoken of receiving threats and hate mail . despite the controversies , the soft-spoken and often emotional dink had won many hearts in turkey as a sincere activist for turkish-armenian dialogue , who denounced also armenian radicalism and most recently , a french bill in october to jail those who deny that the 1915-17 killings of armenians constituted genocide . he will be laid to rest on tuesday , his colleagues said . " murderer is a traitor " the turkish press piled pressure on the government to solve the murder , condemning it as a " national shame " and lashing out at the authorities for having failed to ensure protection for a man who openly wrote in his articles in agos that he was receiving threats . " not protecting people who are under threat amounts to paving the way for those who want to kill them , " liberal daily radikal wrote . " the murderer is a traitor , " declared mass-circulation hurriyet on its front page saturday , while the popular sabah headlined : " the greatest treason . " the police , reportedly looking for a young man , wearing a denim jacket and a white cap who was seen running from the scene , were examining footage from security cameras of nearby shops . damage to turkey 's image some commentators saw serious implications for turkish foreign policy , with the popular vatan newspaper stressing that armenian campaigns for an international recognition of the 1915-17 massacres as genocide would gain strength .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 20.01.2007 germans at odds over eu 's emissons plans for car industry germans are divided over european union 's plan to impose new limits on carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions for the entire car industry in the 27-member bloc . the 27-member bloc 's environmental commissioner stavros dimas is floating plans for a new industry-wide co2 limit on new vehicles from 2012 , cutting the current voluntary limit of 140 grams per kilometer to an enforced 120 grams . the plans are part of the eu 's strategy to reduce the levels of greenhouse gases created by automotive vehicles on european highways .
its initial strategy of encouraging car companies to enforce their own self-regulated levels of co2 output in their newest vehicles has been inefficient .
few new vehicles on european roads achieve the 140 grams / km limit . germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel told the german parliament this week that the eu must do all it can to bring down the level of carbon dioxide emissions .
he said it was obvious that the policy of self-regulation within the auto industry was not working .
in short , gabriel apparently seemed to support the idea of a regulated and enforced limit . verheugen touts trading scheme bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen is in favor a carbon trading scheme for cars however günter verheugen , gabriel 's compatriot in the eu parliament , was not of the same mind .
the eu industry commissioner rejected the call for a strict limitation on co2 emissions in the car industry and argued that a system similar to that employed by industry where emission credits can be bought and sold . under the bloc 's emissions trading scheme , industries can buy and sell emissions quotas .
if they exceed their limit , they have to buy credits from other companies .
verheugen argued that for some car manufacturers , this would be less expensive than developing emission reduction technologies for their new vehicles by 2012 . " for a manufacturer like porsche , this would always be cheaper than to demand that its cars are developed to reach the emission level of 120 grams , " said verheugen . gabriel skeptical of alternative plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel wants auto firms to cut co2 to eu levels but sigmar gabriel is skeptical as to whether an expansion of the emissions trading scheme to the auto industry was practical . " it is already difficult enough to apply the trading scheme , " he said , and referred to the ongoing disarray within industry itself and the problems experienced while planning a similar scheme in the aviation business . gabriel added that the argument over automotive co2 emissions should be discussed through germany 's eu presidency but added that an agreement should not be rushed to be completed by the end of the six-month role . " this is very ambitious , " he said , adding that the topic required a lot of thought and discussion to find a compromise . he said that consultations with colleagues from the other 26 eu states would begin soon but that finding a common agreement by june would only happen " if things go really well .

it added that in 2005 the government also hoped to received further information about kurnaz from the american side that would " strengthen the case -lrb- against kurnaz -rrb- for his support of international terrorism . " the allegations have created pressure on german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who at the time was gerhard schröder 's chief of staff and hence in charge of intelligence . does schröder 's government bear responsibility ? the newspaper reported that the german government was informed in 2002 that kurnaz had been physically and psychologically abused in guantanamo .

" steinmeier 's spokesman jens plötner however rejected the allegations , pointing out that the parliamentary investigation into the kurnaz case had just begun its work and that it had still to collect much information before conclusions could be drawn from the affair . on friday , two german newspapers reported that the us offer to release kurnaz in 2002 - which was refused by germany - came with several conditions . for one , the us demanded that kurnaz be monitored round the clock in germany so that he would take up any terrorist activity , the bild and stuttgarter nachrichten reported . kurnaz alleges abuse at german and us hands apart from the previous german government 's role in the affair , kurnaz 's case is also being investigated for intelligence and security lapses on the part of german authorities . the inquiry is also investigating whether the questioning of kurnaz in guantanamo by german officials in feb .

its initial strategy of encouraging car companies to enforce their own self-regulated levels of co2 output in their newest vehicles has been inefficient .
few new vehicles on european roads achieve the 140 grams / km limit . germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel told the german parliament this week that the eu must do all it can to bring down the level of carbon dioxide emissions .

verheugen argued that for some car manufacturers , this would be less expensive than developing emission reduction technologies for their new vehicles by 2012 .

its initial strategy of encouraging car companies to enforce their own self-regulated levels of co2 output in their newest vehicles has been inefficient .
few new vehicles on european roads achieve the 140 grams / km limit . germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel told the german parliament this week that the eu must do all it can to bring down the level of carbon dioxide emissions .
he said it was obvious that the policy of self-regulation within the auto industry was not working .
in short , gabriel apparently seemed to support the idea of a regulated and enforced limit . verheugen touts trading scheme bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen is in favor a carbon trading scheme for cars however günter verheugen , gabriel 's compatriot in the eu parliament , was not of the same mind .
the eu industry commissioner rejected the call for a strict limitation on co2 emissions in the car industry and argued that a system similar to that employed by industry where emission credits can be bought and sold . under the bloc 's emissions trading scheme , industries can buy and sell emissions quotas .
if they exceed their limit , they have to buy credits from other companies .
verheugen argued that for some car manufacturers , this would be less expensive than developing emission reduction technologies for their new vehicles by 2012 . " for a manufacturer like porsche , this would always be cheaper than to demand that its cars are developed to reach the emission level of 120 grams , " said verheugen . gabriel skeptical of alternative plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel wants auto firms to cut co2 to eu levels but sigmar gabriel is skeptical as to whether an expansion of the emissions trading scheme to the auto industry was practical . " it is already difficult enough to apply the trading scheme , " he said , and referred to the ongoing disarray within industry itself and the problems experienced while planning a similar scheme in the aviation business . gabriel added that the argument over automotive co2 emissions should be discussed through germany 's eu presidency but added that an agreement should not be rushed to be completed by the end of the six-month role . " this is very ambitious , " he said , adding that the topic required a lot of thought and discussion to find a compromise . he said that consultations with colleagues from the other 26 eu states would begin soon but that finding a common agreement by june would only happen " if things go really well .

his successor , angela merkel has a different approach , which she will make clear to putin when they meet sunday , according to dw 's cornelia rabitz . since his exit from the political stage and his new role as supervisory board chairman of the consortium that plans to build a baltic sea pipeline from russia to germany , former chancellor gerhard schröder has become something of a lobbyist . he seems to be inspired by his mission .
some people even suspect his consistent praise for russia 's policies has become something of a replacement for his politics drug . in a berlin hotel recently , schröder once more gave a packed house a taste of his stance .
but in the meantime his strident defense of russia causes a rather bad aftertaste .
it 's an embarrassment when a former chancellor is said to behave like the russian president 's spokesman .
it 's an embarrassment when schröder patronizingly charges that public discussion of russia here in germany is " marked by anti-russia reflexes . " of course schröder can call for closer german-russian cooperation .
it 's certainly legitimate to defend energy exporter russia when it 's accused of hypocrisy or becomes the subject of unfair criticism : criticizing russia while assiduously overlooking the political situation in other oil states , such as saudi arabia , iran , nigeria , libya or algeria is reckless . and no one seriously denies moscow 's right to demand market prices for energy from its onetime allies either . sure enough , for schröder , russia 's questionable actions in the most recent natural gas and oil disputes are n't an issue .
why does n't " gerd " recommend more sovereignty in foreign and economic policy matters to his dear friend " volodya " ?
why does n't he warn him of behavior that brings russia a massive loss in esteem and only feeds skepticism toward greater energy dependency ?
it 's an embarrassment when friendship on the political stage is confused with one-sided partisanship . it 's downright improper to willfully and deliberately ignore other aspects .
for supervisory board head schröder , issues of democracy , civil society , human rights , the murders of journalists and other kremlin critics and the lack of rule of law are all negligible and hardly worth mentioning .
it 's no wonder then that he gets top marks from the russian side ; the kremlin could hardly hope for a better - and such a prominent - propagandist . it must be a nuisance to chancellor angela merkel , who travels to sochi on sunday .
as president of the eu council , she is striving for a pragmatic , a good relationship to russia .
in contrast to her predecessor , she addresses problems in bilateral relations and beyond . that 's why in sochi she will again tell president vladimir putin that the recent unannounced russian halt to gas deliveries via belarus annoyed the eu and has nothing to do with normal business behavior .
merkel will once more demand moscow be reliable .
she will remind him of the not yet negotiated partnership deal between the european union and russia .
she will stress how important russia is - also for the resolution of international conflicts . merkel apparently does n't think much of absolution : calling putin a " flawless democrat , " as schröder did during his chancellorship , is something she still wo n't do .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 20.01.2007 germans at odds over eu 's emissons plans for car industry germans are divided over european union 's plan to impose new limits on carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions for the entire car industry in the 27-member bloc . the 27-member bloc 's environmental commissioner stavros dimas is floating plans for a new industry-wide co2 limit on new vehicles from 2012 , cutting the current voluntary limit of 140 grams per kilometer to an enforced 120 grams . the plans are part of the eu 's strategy to reduce the levels of greenhouse gases created by automotive vehicles on european highways .
its initial strategy of encouraging car companies to enforce their own self-regulated levels of co2 output in their newest vehicles has been inefficient .
few new vehicles on european roads achieve the 140 grams / km limit . germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel told the german parliament this week that the eu must do all it can to bring down the level of carbon dioxide emissions .
he said it was obvious that the policy of self-regulation within the auto industry was not working .
in short , gabriel apparently seemed to support the idea of a regulated and enforced limit . verheugen touts trading scheme bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen is in favor a carbon trading scheme for cars however günter verheugen , gabriel 's compatriot in the eu parliament , was not of the same mind .
the eu industry commissioner rejected the call for a strict limitation on co2 emissions in the car industry and argued that a system similar to that employed by industry where emission credits can be bought and sold . under the bloc 's emissions trading scheme , industries can buy and sell emissions quotas .
if they exceed their limit , they have to buy credits from other companies .
verheugen argued that for some car manufacturers , this would be less expensive than developing emission reduction technologies for their new vehicles by 2012 . " for a manufacturer like porsche , this would always be cheaper than to demand that its cars are developed to reach the emission level of 120 grams , " said verheugen . gabriel skeptical of alternative plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel wants auto firms to cut co2 to eu levels but sigmar gabriel is skeptical as to whether an expansion of the emissions trading scheme to the auto industry was practical . " it is already difficult enough to apply the trading scheme , " he said , and referred to the ongoing disarray within industry itself and the problems experienced while planning a similar scheme in the aviation business . gabriel added that the argument over automotive co2 emissions should be discussed through germany 's eu presidency but added that an agreement should not be rushed to be completed by the end of the six-month role . " this is very ambitious , " he said , adding that the topic required a lot of thought and discussion to find a compromise . he said that consultations with colleagues from the other 26 eu states would begin soon but that finding a common agreement by june would only happen " if things go really well .

-lrb- 10.01.2007 -rrb- german government under pressure over co2 policy the german government is under intense pressure from the eu over what it calls inadequate plans for cutting greenhouse gases , while warnings from four of germany 's largest energy firms hint at domestic unrest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.01.2007 renaming of berlin street reopens old ideological rifts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight goes on a referendum on sunday in berlin will decide whether to name a street after a famous student protest leader of the 1960s .
the issue has polarized opinion and rekindled memories of a turbulent chapter in german history . on sunday , residents of berlin 's friedrichshain-kreuzberg district will go to the polls to settle a simmering controversy over the renaming of a street after rudi dutschke , a protest leader of the 1960s .
the emotive issue has polarized public opinion and brought into focus old political animosities . " germany and berlin need a rudi-dutschke-strasse , because it 's a very important symbol of what we are today and which political stream has made things happen in postwar germany , " said peter unfried , deputy editor-in-chief of left-leaning daily t az who has spearheaded a campaign to rename the street . " what we are today - a freer , more liberal society - is partly due to 1968 and rudi dutschke , " he said . charismatic leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutschke in 1968 during a protest in berlin born in 1940 , dutschke emerged as one of the most charismatic personalities of west germany 's student movement , which pitted children against their parents and anti-communists against leftists in the 1960s . a student of sociology at west berlin 's free university , dutschke was an influential theoretician in left-wing circles and active in organizing street protests - that shook up west german society - against the so-called " establishment . "
the high-profile dutschke was shot and seriously injured in 1968 and moved to london to recover .
years later , he returned to west germany - and life on the political stage .
shortly before his unexpected death in a bathtub in december 1979 - which was thought to have been related to injuries sustained during his shooting - he became actively involved with the ecologically minded greens , who established themselves as a political party three weeks later . right vs. left during the cold war , the greens and the left-wing taz manned the one side of west germany 's ideological battles and the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the right-wing axel springer publishing house the other . axel springer and the taz were n't just political enemies .
they were and still are close neighbors , too .
their offices are located just doors away from each other on kochstrasse -lrb- koch street -rrb- , the street at the center of the renaming fight . it was on this street that angry student protests erupted in 1968 after dutschke was shot and seriously wounded .
students blamed springer 's papers for inflaming public opinion against them and said the man who shot dutschke was influenced by views expressed by springer tabloid bild .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer built the tower block next to the wall as a " beacon of democracy " kochstrasse is something of a showcase of 20th century germany history .
himmler 's gestapo headquarters on wilhelmstrasse was just meters away from the street , at its far western end .
a few blocks to the east , it bisects friedrichstrasse next to what became checkpoint charlie , the us-controlled border crossing to communist east berlin , and remnants of the wall .
the taz is located a few buildings further east . another couple blocks down the road , at the intersection to axel-springer-strasse , stands the tower block the eponymous and powerful publisher built for the berlin office of his hamburg-based company . after naming its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 , the taz started a campaign to rename kochstrasse .
what 's in a name ?
in 2005 , the local assembly in friedrichhain-kreuzberg , dominated by the social democrats and the green party , decided to rename kochstrasse as rudi-dutschke-strasse - to the conservatives ' horror .
" the state should n't honor a person who was in favor of the dissolution of the state , " said timo husein , 26 , head of the cdu 's youth organization in the district .
" he was n't a democrat in a legal sense .
he propagated violence against property .
someone who uses violence to reach his aims is n't an appropriate person to be honored . "
husein said the renaming would mean that the street 's 1,000 residents would have to have their personal id cards changed .
in addition , the area 's estimated 700 businesses , from snack bars to a national insurance company , would have to shell out around 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 450,000 -rrb- to reprint signs , stationary and business cards .
backed by the local cdu , husein 's youth group collected the 10,000 signatures necessary to take the question of renaming the street to the ballot box .
fifteen percent of friedrichshain-kreuzberg 's voters , around 25,000 people , must vote in the referendum sunday to put a stop to the name change .
" a sort of poetic justice " it was a no-brainer for husein 's conservative youth group to take up the fight against dutschke .
" dutschke is naturally an opponent , " he said .
it 's not about changing a law on sales tax , which is rather boring .
it 's really about ideology , about left and right , and the left sees it that way , too . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taz named its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 husein was hopeful dutschke would lose in the referendum , though he admitted it was hard for conservatives to have an effect in the only electoral precinct in germany ever to have directly elected a green candidate to the federal parliament , in 2005 .
" but that 's no reason not to try , " he said .
meanwhile , the taz 's unfried was fairly certain friedrichshain-kreuzberg would go for dutschke .
but whatever the outcome of the poll , he was pleased that the campaign seemed to have raised consciousness of dutschke , a symbol , he said , for fighting for a better society . " not many people know that they changed lindenstrasse to axel-springer-strasse , which not everyone appreciates , especially people on the liberal , progressive side of the spectrum , " unfried said .

the issue has polarized opinion and rekindled memories of a turbulent chapter in german history . on sunday , residents of berlin 's friedrichshain-kreuzberg district will go to the polls to settle a simmering controversy over the renaming of a street after rudi dutschke , a protest leader of the 1960s .
the emotive issue has polarized public opinion and brought into focus old political animosities . " germany and berlin need a rudi-dutschke-strasse , because it 's a very important symbol of what we are today and which political stream has made things happen in postwar germany , " said peter unfried , deputy editor-in-chief of left-leaning daily t az who has spearheaded a campaign to rename the street . " what we are today - a freer , more liberal society - is partly due to 1968 and rudi dutschke , " he said . charismatic leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutschke in 1968 during a protest in berlin born in 1940 , dutschke emerged as one of the most charismatic personalities of west germany 's student movement , which pitted children against their parents and anti-communists against leftists in the 1960s . a student of sociology at west berlin 's free university , dutschke was an influential theoretician in left-wing circles and active in organizing street protests - that shook up west german society - against the so-called " establishment . "
the high-profile dutschke was shot and seriously injured in 1968 and moved to london to recover .
years later , he returned to west germany - and life on the political stage .
shortly before his unexpected death in a bathtub in december 1979 - which was thought to have been related to injuries sustained during his shooting - he became actively involved with the ecologically minded greens , who established themselves as a political party three weeks later . right vs. left during the cold war , the greens and the left-wing taz manned the one side of west germany 's ideological battles and the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the right-wing axel springer publishing house the other . axel springer and the taz were n't just political enemies .
they were and still are close neighbors , too .
their offices are located just doors away from each other on kochstrasse -lrb- koch street -rrb- , the street at the center of the renaming fight . it was on this street that angry student protests erupted in 1968 after dutschke was shot and seriously wounded .
students blamed springer 's papers for inflaming public opinion against them and said the man who shot dutschke was influenced by views expressed by springer tabloid bild .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer built the tower block next to the wall as a " beacon of democracy " kochstrasse is something of a showcase of 20th century germany history .
himmler 's gestapo headquarters on wilhelmstrasse was just meters away from the street , at its far western end .
a few blocks to the east , it bisects friedrichstrasse next to what became checkpoint charlie , the us-controlled border crossing to communist east berlin , and remnants of the wall .
the taz is located a few buildings further east . another couple blocks down the road , at the intersection to axel-springer-strasse , stands the tower block the eponymous and powerful publisher built for the berlin office of his hamburg-based company . after naming its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 , the taz started a campaign to rename kochstrasse .
what 's in a name ?
in 2005 , the local assembly in friedrichhain-kreuzberg , dominated by the social democrats and the green party , decided to rename kochstrasse as rudi-dutschke-strasse - to the conservatives ' horror .
" the state should n't honor a person who was in favor of the dissolution of the state , " said timo husein , 26 , head of the cdu 's youth organization in the district .
" he was n't a democrat in a legal sense .
he propagated violence against property .
someone who uses violence to reach his aims is n't an appropriate person to be honored . "
husein said the renaming would mean that the street 's 1,000 residents would have to have their personal id cards changed .
in addition , the area 's estimated 700 businesses , from snack bars to a national insurance company , would have to shell out around 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 450,000 -rrb- to reprint signs , stationary and business cards .
backed by the local cdu , husein 's youth group collected the 10,000 signatures necessary to take the question of renaming the street to the ballot box .
fifteen percent of friedrichshain-kreuzberg 's voters , around 25,000 people , must vote in the referendum sunday to put a stop to the name change .
" a sort of poetic justice " it was a no-brainer for husein 's conservative youth group to take up the fight against dutschke .
" dutschke is naturally an opponent , " he said .
it 's not about changing a law on sales tax , which is rather boring .
it 's really about ideology , about left and right , and the left sees it that way , too . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taz named its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 husein was hopeful dutschke would lose in the referendum , though he admitted it was hard for conservatives to have an effect in the only electoral precinct in germany ever to have directly elected a green candidate to the federal parliament , in 2005 .
" but that 's no reason not to try , " he said .
meanwhile , the taz 's unfried was fairly certain friedrichshain-kreuzberg would go for dutschke .
but whatever the outcome of the poll , he was pleased that the campaign seemed to have raised consciousness of dutschke , a symbol , he said , for fighting for a better society . " not many people know that they changed lindenstrasse to axel-springer-strasse , which not everyone appreciates , especially people on the liberal , progressive side of the spectrum , " unfried said .

a few blocks to the east , it bisects friedrichstrasse next to what became checkpoint charlie , the us-controlled border crossing to communist east berlin , and remnants of the wall .
the taz is located a few buildings further east . another couple blocks down the road , at the intersection to axel-springer-strasse , stands the tower block the eponymous and powerful publisher built for the berlin office of his hamburg-based company . after naming its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 , the taz started a campaign to rename kochstrasse .
what 's in a name ?
in 2005 , the local assembly in friedrichhain-kreuzberg , dominated by the social democrats and the green party , decided to rename kochstrasse as rudi-dutschke-strasse - to the conservatives ' horror .
" the state should n't honor a person who was in favor of the dissolution of the state , " said timo husein , 26 , head of the cdu 's youth organization in the district .
" he was n't a democrat in a legal sense .
he propagated violence against property .
someone who uses violence to reach his aims is n't an appropriate person to be honored . "
husein said the renaming would mean that the street 's 1,000 residents would have to have their personal id cards changed .
in addition , the area 's estimated 700 businesses , from snack bars to a national insurance company , would have to shell out around 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 450,000 -rrb- to reprint signs , stationary and business cards .
backed by the local cdu , husein 's youth group collected the 10,000 signatures necessary to take the question of renaming the street to the ballot box .
fifteen percent of friedrichshain-kreuzberg 's voters , around 25,000 people , must vote in the referendum sunday to put a stop to the name change .
" a sort of poetic justice " it was a no-brainer for husein 's conservative youth group to take up the fight against dutschke .
" dutschke is naturally an opponent , " he said .
it 's not about changing a law on sales tax , which is rather boring .
it 's really about ideology , about left and right , and the left sees it that way , too . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taz named its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 husein was hopeful dutschke would lose in the referendum , though he admitted it was hard for conservatives to have an effect in the only electoral precinct in germany ever to have directly elected a green candidate to the federal parliament , in 2005 .
" but that 's no reason not to try , " he said .
meanwhile , the taz 's unfried was fairly certain friedrichshain-kreuzberg would go for dutschke .
but whatever the outcome of the poll , he was pleased that the campaign seemed to have raised consciousness of dutschke , a symbol , he said , for fighting for a better society . " not many people know that they changed lindenstrasse to axel-springer-strasse , which not everyone appreciates , especially people on the liberal , progressive side of the spectrum , " unfried said .

the issue has polarized opinion and rekindled memories of a turbulent chapter in german history . on sunday , residents of berlin 's friedrichshain-kreuzberg district will go to the polls to settle a simmering controversy over the renaming of a street after rudi dutschke , a protest leader of the 1960s .
the emotive issue has polarized public opinion and brought into focus old political animosities . " germany and berlin need a rudi-dutschke-strasse , because it 's a very important symbol of what we are today and which political stream has made things happen in postwar germany , " said peter unfried , deputy editor-in-chief of left-leaning daily t az who has spearheaded a campaign to rename the street . " what we are today - a freer , more liberal society - is partly due to 1968 and rudi dutschke , " he said . charismatic leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutschke in 1968 during a protest in berlin born in 1940 , dutschke emerged as one of the most charismatic personalities of west germany 's student movement , which pitted children against their parents and anti-communists against leftists in the 1960s . a student of sociology at west berlin 's free university , dutschke was an influential theoretician in left-wing circles and active in organizing street protests - that shook up west german society - against the so-called " establishment . "
the high-profile dutschke was shot and seriously injured in 1968 and moved to london to recover .
years later , he returned to west germany - and life on the political stage .
shortly before his unexpected death in a bathtub in december 1979 - which was thought to have been related to injuries sustained during his shooting - he became actively involved with the ecologically minded greens , who established themselves as a political party three weeks later . right vs. left during the cold war , the greens and the left-wing taz manned the one side of west germany 's ideological battles and the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the right-wing axel springer publishing house the other . axel springer and the taz were n't just political enemies .
they were and still are close neighbors , too .
their offices are located just doors away from each other on kochstrasse -lrb- koch street -rrb- , the street at the center of the renaming fight . it was on this street that angry student protests erupted in 1968 after dutschke was shot and seriously wounded .
students blamed springer 's papers for inflaming public opinion against them and said the man who shot dutschke was influenced by views expressed by springer tabloid bild .

" as a result , hrant dink was held in high esteem in various sections of turkish society , as well as in europe .

his successor , angela merkel has a different approach , which she will make clear to putin when they meet sunday , according to dw 's cornelia rabitz . since his exit from the political stage and his new role as supervisory board chairman of the consortium that plans to build a baltic sea pipeline from russia to germany , former chancellor gerhard schröder has become something of a lobbyist . he seems to be inspired by his mission .
some people even suspect his consistent praise for russia 's policies has become something of a replacement for his politics drug . in a berlin hotel recently , schröder once more gave a packed house a taste of his stance .
but in the meantime his strident defense of russia causes a rather bad aftertaste .
it 's an embarrassment when a former chancellor is said to behave like the russian president 's spokesman .
it 's an embarrassment when schröder patronizingly charges that public discussion of russia here in germany is " marked by anti-russia reflexes . " of course schröder can call for closer german-russian cooperation .
it 's certainly legitimate to defend energy exporter russia when it 's accused of hypocrisy or becomes the subject of unfair criticism : criticizing russia while assiduously overlooking the political situation in other oil states , such as saudi arabia , iran , nigeria , libya or algeria is reckless . and no one seriously denies moscow 's right to demand market prices for energy from its onetime allies either . sure enough , for schröder , russia 's questionable actions in the most recent natural gas and oil disputes are n't an issue .
why does n't " gerd " recommend more sovereignty in foreign and economic policy matters to his dear friend " volodya " ?
why does n't he warn him of behavior that brings russia a massive loss in esteem and only feeds skepticism toward greater energy dependency ?
it 's an embarrassment when friendship on the political stage is confused with one-sided partisanship . it 's downright improper to willfully and deliberately ignore other aspects .
for supervisory board head schröder , issues of democracy , civil society , human rights , the murders of journalists and other kremlin critics and the lack of rule of law are all negligible and hardly worth mentioning .
it 's no wonder then that he gets top marks from the russian side ; the kremlin could hardly hope for a better - and such a prominent - propagandist . it must be a nuisance to chancellor angela merkel , who travels to sochi on sunday .
as president of the eu council , she is striving for a pragmatic , a good relationship to russia .
in contrast to her predecessor , she addresses problems in bilateral relations and beyond . that 's why in sochi she will again tell president vladimir putin that the recent unannounced russian halt to gas deliveries via belarus annoyed the eu and has nothing to do with normal business behavior .
merkel will once more demand moscow be reliable .
she will remind him of the not yet negotiated partnership deal between the european union and russia .
she will stress how important russia is - also for the resolution of international conflicts . merkel apparently does n't think much of absolution : calling putin a " flawless democrat , " as schröder did during his chancellorship , is something she still wo n't do .

in contrast to her predecessor , she addresses problems in bilateral relations and beyond . that 's why in sochi she will again tell president vladimir putin that the recent unannounced russian halt to gas deliveries via belarus annoyed the eu and has nothing to do with normal business behavior .
merkel will once more demand moscow be reliable .
she will remind him of the not yet negotiated partnership deal between the european union and russia .
she will stress how important russia is - also for the resolution of international conflicts . merkel apparently does n't think much of absolution : calling putin a " flawless democrat , " as schröder did during his chancellorship , is something she still wo n't do .

it added that in 2005 the government also hoped to received further information about kurnaz from the american side that would " strengthen the case -lrb- against kurnaz -rrb- for his support of international terrorism . " the allegations have created pressure on german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who at the time was gerhard schröder 's chief of staff and hence in charge of intelligence . does schröder 's government bear responsibility ? the newspaper reported that the german government was informed in 2002 that kurnaz had been physically and psychologically abused in guantanamo .
it added that officials of germany 's bnd federal intelligence service who interrogated kurnaz in cuba in september 2002 had found no evidence linking him to any terrorist activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz during his appearance before a parliamentary investigation committee this week faced with this information , schröder 's social democrat-green party government still tried to block kurnaz ' return to germany after the 2005 federal elections , the paper said . the paper 's allegations were given further weight this week when kurnaz ' lawyer , bernhard docke , told a parliamentary inquiry in berlin that the german foreign ministry only administered kurnaz ' case and was n't proactive in freeing him . docke said he suspected that the government under then-chancellor schröder refused kurnaz entry into germany in the fall of 2002 , when the us originally offered to release him from the prison camp . " until this day i see no real reason why germany , if it had the offer from the us , did n't take it up , " after both sides had established that kurnaz was n't a terror suspect , " docke said .
" if kurnaz would have been german , he would already have been free in fall 2002 , " he said . docke told the parliamentary inquiry that former foreign minister joschka fischer told kurnaz 's mother in a letter that german help was limited because kurnaz had turkish citizenship and the us was only negotiating with the home nations of inmates . foreign minister under pressure the accusations against the former government and in particular the focus on steinmeier 's role sparked a heated debate among german politicians on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has some questions to answers in the kurnaz affair wolfgang neskovic of the opposition left party accused the previous government and steinmeier of " merciless , inhuman cold-bloodedness " in dealing with kurnaz .
neskovic slammed the government 's attempt to block kurnaz 's return to germany as " deeply cynical . " " i do n't think steinmeier will survive this politically , " he added . volker beck , head of the opposition green party which was a coalition partner in the previous government , said that if steinmeier had indeed sanctioned kurnaz spending long unnecessary years at guantanamo bay , the minister " could no longer credibly represent the german government 's human rights and foreign policy . " steinmeier 's spokesman jens plötner however rejected the allegations , pointing out that the parliamentary investigation into the kurnaz case had just begun its work and that it had still to collect much information before conclusions could be drawn from the affair . on friday , two german newspapers reported that the us offer to release kurnaz in 2002 - which was refused by germany - came with several conditions . for one , the us demanded that kurnaz be monitored round the clock in germany so that he would take up any terrorist activity , the bild and stuttgarter nachrichten reported . kurnaz alleges abuse at german and us hands apart from the previous german government 's role in the affair , kurnaz 's case is also being investigated for intelligence and security lapses on the part of german authorities . the inquiry is also investigating whether the questioning of kurnaz in guantanamo by german officials in feb .
2002 was appropriate .
the government at the time condemned the prison camp , yet was unprepared to question kurnaz over indications he may have been involved in a possible islamist terrorist cell in bremen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz has said he was abused by german special-forces soldiers kurnaz this week testified he was arrested on a trip to pakistan in october 2001 and handed over by the authorities to the americans who transferred him to a us prison in kandahar , in afghanistan .

experts say political parties are largely to blame for the situation . germany 's first female chancellor angela merkel arguably became the most influential political figure in europe a few weeks ago as her country took over the presidency of both the eu and the g8 .
merkel was also voted the world 's most powerful woman by forbes magazine in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : segolene royal would be france 's first female president , if elected the german head of government is a high-profile example of the success of women in european politics and could soon be followed by segolene royal , who is hoping to become france 's first female president in may . but unlike merkel and other female leaders , many women in european parliaments still owe their mandate to gender quotas .
similar to equal employment quotas , they are designed to boost the number of women in politics and balance out the number of male and female representatives . do quotas work ? the use of gender quotas has been criticized as giving women an unfair advantage over male candidates and can take away a woman 's sense of empowerment that they had earned the position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ratio that 's still reality in some legislatures " this legislation -lrb- gender quotas -rrb- would mean that people would not deserve to be there , but that they are forced there , " said godfrey bloom , a european parliamentarian and member of uk independence party .
" it debases the currency for these poor ladies who can not prove that have earned the position . " but drude dahlerup , a professor of political science at stockholm university and an expert on gender quotas , said measures like quotas are a way to compensate for discrimination against women . " if everything was fair in society , i would n't argue for quotas , but you do n't have equal opportunity in society , " she added . resistance to change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some french parties would rather pay fines than adhere to gender quotas for the national assembly .
dahlerup attributed the unpopularity of quotas in europe to the " notion of liberal democracy . "
she said the quotas are often seen as interfering with the democratic system . she cited france as an example : there must be an equal number of men and women political candidates for national parliamentary elections , or parties must pay a fine .
most of the parties that can afford to pay the fine are choosing to do so rather than have the required number of female candidates . there has also been resistance to have a quota system in italy , where a vote on a so-called " pink quota " was rejected by the italian parliament in april 2006 .
this bill would have meant that one-third of all national election candidates would have to be women , to boost the current 11.5 percent female representation , the forth lowest in the european union . political parties hold the power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to parties to put more women on their ballots dahlerup said the political parties are the " gatekeepers " to the parliament , who have the power to change the gender balances .
this applies to a parliamentary system , not direct democracy which operates in the us and switzerland , which only require one-off majority votes for most of the time . " they -lrb- political parties -rrb- could change political representation tomorrow if they wanted because they control the nomination process , " dahlerup said .

experts say political parties are largely to blame for the situation . germany 's first female chancellor angela merkel arguably became the most influential political figure in europe a few weeks ago as her country took over the presidency of both the eu and the g8 .
merkel was also voted the world 's most powerful woman by forbes magazine in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : segolene royal would be france 's first female president , if elected the german head of government is a high-profile example of the success of women in european politics and could soon be followed by segolene royal , who is hoping to become france 's first female president in may . but unlike merkel and other female leaders , many women in european parliaments still owe their mandate to gender quotas .
similar to equal employment quotas , they are designed to boost the number of women in politics and balance out the number of male and female representatives . do quotas work ? the use of gender quotas has been criticized as giving women an unfair advantage over male candidates and can take away a woman 's sense of empowerment that they had earned the position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ratio that 's still reality in some legislatures " this legislation -lrb- gender quotas -rrb- would mean that people would not deserve to be there , but that they are forced there , " said godfrey bloom , a european parliamentarian and member of uk independence party .

dahlerup attributed the unpopularity of quotas in europe to the " notion of liberal democracy . "
she said the quotas are often seen as interfering with the democratic system . she cited france as an example : there must be an equal number of men and women political candidates for national parliamentary elections , or parties must pay a fine .
most of the parties that can afford to pay the fine are choosing to do so rather than have the required number of female candidates . there has also been resistance to have a quota system in italy , where a vote on a so-called " pink quota " was rejected by the italian parliament in april 2006 .

similar to equal employment quotas , they are designed to boost the number of women in politics and balance out the number of male and female representatives . do quotas work ? the use of gender quotas has been criticized as giving women an unfair advantage over male candidates and can take away a woman 's sense of empowerment that they had earned the position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ratio that 's still reality in some legislatures " this legislation -lrb- gender quotas -rrb- would mean that people would not deserve to be there , but that they are forced there , " said godfrey bloom , a european parliamentarian and member of uk independence party .

" but drude dahlerup , a professor of political science at stockholm university and an expert on gender quotas , said measures like quotas are a way to compensate for discrimination against women .

dahlerup attributed the unpopularity of quotas in europe to the " notion of liberal democracy . "
she said the quotas are often seen as interfering with the democratic system . she cited france as an example : there must be an equal number of men and women political candidates for national parliamentary elections , or parties must pay a fine .
most of the parties that can afford to pay the fine are choosing to do so rather than have the required number of female candidates . there has also been resistance to have a quota system in italy , where a vote on a so-called " pink quota " was rejected by the italian parliament in april 2006 .
this bill would have meant that one-third of all national election candidates would have to be women , to boost the current 11.5 percent female representation , the forth lowest in the european union . political parties hold the power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to parties to put more women on their ballots dahlerup said the political parties are the " gatekeepers " to the parliament , who have the power to change the gender balances .

experts say political parties are largely to blame for the situation . germany 's first female chancellor angela merkel arguably became the most influential political figure in europe a few weeks ago as her country took over the presidency of both the eu and the g8 .

most of the parties that can afford to pay the fine are choosing to do so rather than have the required number of female candidates . there has also been resistance to have a quota system in italy , where a vote on a so-called " pink quota " was rejected by the italian parliament in april 2006 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.01.2007 renaming of berlin street reopens old ideological rifts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight goes on a referendum on sunday in berlin will decide whether to name a street after a famous student protest leader of the 1960s .
the issue has polarized opinion and rekindled memories of a turbulent chapter in german history . on sunday , residents of berlin 's friedrichshain-kreuzberg district will go to the polls to settle a simmering controversy over the renaming of a street after rudi dutschke , a protest leader of the 1960s .
the emotive issue has polarized public opinion and brought into focus old political animosities . " germany and berlin need a rudi-dutschke-strasse , because it 's a very important symbol of what we are today and which political stream has made things happen in postwar germany , " said peter unfried , deputy editor-in-chief of left-leaning daily t az who has spearheaded a campaign to rename the street . " what we are today - a freer , more liberal society - is partly due to 1968 and rudi dutschke , " he said . charismatic leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutschke in 1968 during a protest in berlin born in 1940 , dutschke emerged as one of the most charismatic personalities of west germany 's student movement , which pitted children against their parents and anti-communists against leftists in the 1960s . a student of sociology at west berlin 's free university , dutschke was an influential theoretician in left-wing circles and active in organizing street protests - that shook up west german society - against the so-called " establishment . "
the high-profile dutschke was shot and seriously injured in 1968 and moved to london to recover .
years later , he returned to west germany - and life on the political stage .
shortly before his unexpected death in a bathtub in december 1979 - which was thought to have been related to injuries sustained during his shooting - he became actively involved with the ecologically minded greens , who established themselves as a political party three weeks later . right vs. left during the cold war , the greens and the left-wing taz manned the one side of west germany 's ideological battles and the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the right-wing axel springer publishing house the other . axel springer and the taz were n't just political enemies .
they were and still are close neighbors , too .
their offices are located just doors away from each other on kochstrasse -lrb- koch street -rrb- , the street at the center of the renaming fight . it was on this street that angry student protests erupted in 1968 after dutschke was shot and seriously wounded .
students blamed springer 's papers for inflaming public opinion against them and said the man who shot dutschke was influenced by views expressed by springer tabloid bild .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer built the tower block next to the wall as a " beacon of democracy " kochstrasse is something of a showcase of 20th century germany history .
himmler 's gestapo headquarters on wilhelmstrasse was just meters away from the street , at its far western end .
a few blocks to the east , it bisects friedrichstrasse next to what became checkpoint charlie , the us-controlled border crossing to communist east berlin , and remnants of the wall .
the taz is located a few buildings further east . another couple blocks down the road , at the intersection to axel-springer-strasse , stands the tower block the eponymous and powerful publisher built for the berlin office of his hamburg-based company . after naming its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 , the taz started a campaign to rename kochstrasse .
what 's in a name ?
in 2005 , the local assembly in friedrichhain-kreuzberg , dominated by the social democrats and the green party , decided to rename kochstrasse as rudi-dutschke-strasse - to the conservatives ' horror .
" the state should n't honor a person who was in favor of the dissolution of the state , " said timo husein , 26 , head of the cdu 's youth organization in the district .
" he was n't a democrat in a legal sense .
he propagated violence against property .
someone who uses violence to reach his aims is n't an appropriate person to be honored . "
husein said the renaming would mean that the street 's 1,000 residents would have to have their personal id cards changed .
in addition , the area 's estimated 700 businesses , from snack bars to a national insurance company , would have to shell out around 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 450,000 -rrb- to reprint signs , stationary and business cards .
backed by the local cdu , husein 's youth group collected the 10,000 signatures necessary to take the question of renaming the street to the ballot box .
fifteen percent of friedrichshain-kreuzberg 's voters , around 25,000 people , must vote in the referendum sunday to put a stop to the name change .
" a sort of poetic justice " it was a no-brainer for husein 's conservative youth group to take up the fight against dutschke .
" dutschke is naturally an opponent , " he said .
it 's not about changing a law on sales tax , which is rather boring .
it 's really about ideology , about left and right , and the left sees it that way , too . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taz named its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 husein was hopeful dutschke would lose in the referendum , though he admitted it was hard for conservatives to have an effect in the only electoral precinct in germany ever to have directly elected a green candidate to the federal parliament , in 2005 .
" but that 's no reason not to try , " he said .
meanwhile , the taz 's unfried was fairly certain friedrichshain-kreuzberg would go for dutschke .
but whatever the outcome of the poll , he was pleased that the campaign seemed to have raised consciousness of dutschke , a symbol , he said , for fighting for a better society . " not many people know that they changed lindenstrasse to axel-springer-strasse , which not everyone appreciates , especially people on the liberal , progressive side of the spectrum , " unfried said .
" it 'll be a sort of poetic justice to have dutschke boulevard with axel springer street .

" they will definitely talk " about energy , merkel 's g8 advisor bernd pfaffenbach , said in an interview with russian daily vedomosti , adding that the row had " damaged russia 's authority . " " we will insist more firmly on the need for russia to be a reliable partner in the long term , " pfaffenbach said .
" we have a particular responsibility on this as president of the european union . " damaged reputation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's decision to stop oil deliveries concerned many across europe last week , merkel , herself , also said russia had damaged its image as a reliable partner by stopping oil deliveries through a main pipeline that runs crosses belarus on the way to eu countries . the german-russian relationship has become less cozy since merkel took over from her predecessor gerhard schröder .
last friday , she stressed she could not describe putin as " a flawless democrat , " as schröder once did . " i have n't said that yet and i 'm not saying that now , " merkel said . merkel has also put a stronger emphasis than schröder on the need for strong european ties to the united states . eu still needs russian energy but eu dependency on russian energy means that links remain pragmatic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in germany prefer nuclear energy to depending on russian gas and oil " this does not mean the german chancellor is negative about russia , " german foreign policy expert alexander rahr wrote in the russian government newspaper rossiiskaya gazeta .
" she still tries to build pragmatic and reliable relations with moscow . " on another important eu-russia trade matter , germany is hoping to clear the way for talks on a russian-eu strategic partnership , which have been blocked by a polish veto linked to a dispute over polish meat imports into russia . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , however , said friday that he was confident poland and russia would find an acceptable compromise . " i am actually very optimistic that we will find a solution , " he said .
" i am very hopeful that the new negotiations -lrb- between the eu and russia -rrb- can begin soon . " mideast , eastern europe also on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian elections are scheduled for sunday talks on the middle east are also likely , with the so-called " quartet " - the european union , russia , the united nations and united states - planning a new attempt to kick-start stalled israeli-palestinian peace talks . merkel has made this a priority of germany 's eu presidency , while putin is keen for moscow to play a bigger diplomatic role in the middle east . ahead of elections sunday in serbia , the two leaders will likewise have plenty to discuss on kosovo , the mostly ethnic-albanian province of the former yugoslavia that is pressing for independence from serbia . merkel told news agency reuters in an interview friday that a decision on the fate of kosovo must bring " maximum " satisfaction to the citizens of the province without stirring turbulence in serbia . russia is a strong ally of serbia , which opposes allowing kosovo to break away , and has suggested that if kosovo becomes independent then the status of moscow-backed separatist regions in georgia , a pro-western ex-soviet republic , should also be reconsidered . on thursday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he favored measures that ensured autonomy for the ethnic-serb minority in kosovo . he also underlined that kosovo 's case could not be compared to those in the caucasus . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel strikes right note with russia former chancellor gerhard schröder is known as a defender of russia .

his successor , angela merkel has a different approach , which she will make clear to putin when they meet sunday , according to dw 's cornelia rabitz . since his exit from the political stage and his new role as supervisory board chairman of the consortium that plans to build a baltic sea pipeline from russia to germany , former chancellor gerhard schröder has become something of a lobbyist . he seems to be inspired by his mission .
some people even suspect his consistent praise for russia 's policies has become something of a replacement for his politics drug . in a berlin hotel recently , schröder once more gave a packed house a taste of his stance .
but in the meantime his strident defense of russia causes a rather bad aftertaste .
it 's an embarrassment when a former chancellor is said to behave like the russian president 's spokesman .
it 's an embarrassment when schröder patronizingly charges that public discussion of russia here in germany is " marked by anti-russia reflexes . " of course schröder can call for closer german-russian cooperation .
it 's certainly legitimate to defend energy exporter russia when it 's accused of hypocrisy or becomes the subject of unfair criticism : criticizing russia while assiduously overlooking the political situation in other oil states , such as saudi arabia , iran , nigeria , libya or algeria is reckless . and no one seriously denies moscow 's right to demand market prices for energy from its onetime allies either . sure enough , for schröder , russia 's questionable actions in the most recent natural gas and oil disputes are n't an issue .
why does n't " gerd " recommend more sovereignty in foreign and economic policy matters to his dear friend " volodya " ?
why does n't he warn him of behavior that brings russia a massive loss in esteem and only feeds skepticism toward greater energy dependency ?
it 's an embarrassment when friendship on the political stage is confused with one-sided partisanship . it 's downright improper to willfully and deliberately ignore other aspects .
for supervisory board head schröder , issues of democracy , civil society , human rights , the murders of journalists and other kremlin critics and the lack of rule of law are all negligible and hardly worth mentioning .
it 's no wonder then that he gets top marks from the russian side ; the kremlin could hardly hope for a better - and such a prominent - propagandist . it must be a nuisance to chancellor angela merkel , who travels to sochi on sunday .
as president of the eu council , she is striving for a pragmatic , a good relationship to russia .
in contrast to her predecessor , she addresses problems in bilateral relations and beyond . that 's why in sochi she will again tell president vladimir putin that the recent unannounced russian halt to gas deliveries via belarus annoyed the eu and has nothing to do with normal business behavior .
merkel will once more demand moscow be reliable .
she will remind him of the not yet negotiated partnership deal between the european union and russia .
she will stress how important russia is - also for the resolution of international conflicts . merkel apparently does n't think much of absolution : calling putin a " flawless democrat , " as schröder did during his chancellorship , is something she still wo n't do .

his successor , angela merkel has a different approach , which she will make clear to putin when they meet sunday , according to dw 's cornelia rabitz . since his exit from the political stage and his new role as supervisory board chairman of the consortium that plans to build a baltic sea pipeline from russia to germany , former chancellor gerhard schröder has become something of a lobbyist . he seems to be inspired by his mission .
some people even suspect his consistent praise for russia 's policies has become something of a replacement for his politics drug . in a berlin hotel recently , schröder once more gave a packed house a taste of his stance .
but in the meantime his strident defense of russia causes a rather bad aftertaste .
it 's an embarrassment when a former chancellor is said to behave like the russian president 's spokesman .
it 's an embarrassment when schröder patronizingly charges that public discussion of russia here in germany is " marked by anti-russia reflexes . " of course schröder can call for closer german-russian cooperation .
it 's certainly legitimate to defend energy exporter russia when it 's accused of hypocrisy or becomes the subject of unfair criticism : criticizing russia while assiduously overlooking the political situation in other oil states , such as saudi arabia , iran , nigeria , libya or algeria is reckless . and no one seriously denies moscow 's right to demand market prices for energy from its onetime allies either . sure enough , for schröder , russia 's questionable actions in the most recent natural gas and oil disputes are n't an issue .
why does n't " gerd " recommend more sovereignty in foreign and economic policy matters to his dear friend " volodya " ?
why does n't he warn him of behavior that brings russia a massive loss in esteem and only feeds skepticism toward greater energy dependency ?
it 's an embarrassment when friendship on the political stage is confused with one-sided partisanship . it 's downright improper to willfully and deliberately ignore other aspects .
for supervisory board head schröder , issues of democracy , civil society , human rights , the murders of journalists and other kremlin critics and the lack of rule of law are all negligible and hardly worth mentioning .
it 's no wonder then that he gets top marks from the russian side ; the kremlin could hardly hope for a better - and such a prominent - propagandist . it must be a nuisance to chancellor angela merkel , who travels to sochi on sunday .

his successor , angela merkel has a different approach , which she will make clear to putin when they meet sunday , according to dw 's cornelia rabitz . since his exit from the political stage and his new role as supervisory board chairman of the consortium that plans to build a baltic sea pipeline from russia to germany , former chancellor gerhard schröder has become something of a lobbyist . he seems to be inspired by his mission .
some people even suspect his consistent praise for russia 's policies has become something of a replacement for his politics drug . in a berlin hotel recently , schröder once more gave a packed house a taste of his stance .
but in the meantime his strident defense of russia causes a rather bad aftertaste .
it 's an embarrassment when a former chancellor is said to behave like the russian president 's spokesman .
it 's an embarrassment when schröder patronizingly charges that public discussion of russia here in germany is " marked by anti-russia reflexes . " of course schröder can call for closer german-russian cooperation .
it 's certainly legitimate to defend energy exporter russia when it 's accused of hypocrisy or becomes the subject of unfair criticism : criticizing russia while assiduously overlooking the political situation in other oil states , such as saudi arabia , iran , nigeria , libya or algeria is reckless . and no one seriously denies moscow 's right to demand market prices for energy from its onetime allies either . sure enough , for schröder , russia 's questionable actions in the most recent natural gas and oil disputes are n't an issue .
why does n't " gerd " recommend more sovereignty in foreign and economic policy matters to his dear friend " volodya " ?
why does n't he warn him of behavior that brings russia a massive loss in esteem and only feeds skepticism toward greater energy dependency ?
it 's an embarrassment when friendship on the political stage is confused with one-sided partisanship . it 's downright improper to willfully and deliberately ignore other aspects .
for supervisory board head schröder , issues of democracy , civil society , human rights , the murders of journalists and other kremlin critics and the lack of rule of law are all negligible and hardly worth mentioning .
it 's no wonder then that he gets top marks from the russian side ; the kremlin could hardly hope for a better - and such a prominent - propagandist . it must be a nuisance to chancellor angela merkel , who travels to sochi on sunday .
as president of the eu council , she is striving for a pragmatic , a good relationship to russia .
in contrast to her predecessor , she addresses problems in bilateral relations and beyond . that 's why in sochi she will again tell president vladimir putin that the recent unannounced russian halt to gas deliveries via belarus annoyed the eu and has nothing to do with normal business behavior .
merkel will once more demand moscow be reliable .
she will remind him of the not yet negotiated partnership deal between the european union and russia .
she will stress how important russia is - also for the resolution of international conflicts . merkel apparently does n't think much of absolution : calling putin a " flawless democrat , " as schröder did during his chancellorship , is something she still wo n't do .
the russian president is , after all , far from passing the test . cornelia rabitz is the head of dw-radio 's russian service -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's criticism of russia over energy marks shift in ties chancellor angela merkel 's rebuke of russia over it halting oil supplies to europe has revealed a possible shift in ties between the two countries .

it added that in 2005 the government also hoped to received further information about kurnaz from the american side that would " strengthen the case -lrb- against kurnaz -rrb- for his support of international terrorism . " the allegations have created pressure on german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who at the time was gerhard schröder 's chief of staff and hence in charge of intelligence . does schröder 's government bear responsibility ? the newspaper reported that the german government was informed in 2002 that kurnaz had been physically and psychologically abused in guantanamo .
it added that officials of germany 's bnd federal intelligence service who interrogated kurnaz in cuba in september 2002 had found no evidence linking him to any terrorist activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz during his appearance before a parliamentary investigation committee this week faced with this information , schröder 's social democrat-green party government still tried to block kurnaz ' return to germany after the 2005 federal elections , the paper said . the paper 's allegations were given further weight this week when kurnaz ' lawyer , bernhard docke , told a parliamentary inquiry in berlin that the german foreign ministry only administered kurnaz ' case and was n't proactive in freeing him . docke said he suspected that the government under then-chancellor schröder refused kurnaz entry into germany in the fall of 2002 , when the us originally offered to release him from the prison camp . " until this day i see no real reason why germany , if it had the offer from the us , did n't take it up , " after both sides had established that kurnaz was n't a terror suspect , " docke said .
" if kurnaz would have been german , he would already have been free in fall 2002 , " he said . docke told the parliamentary inquiry that former foreign minister joschka fischer told kurnaz 's mother in a letter that german help was limited because kurnaz had turkish citizenship and the us was only negotiating with the home nations of inmates . foreign minister under pressure the accusations against the former government and in particular the focus on steinmeier 's role sparked a heated debate among german politicians on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has some questions to answers in the kurnaz affair wolfgang neskovic of the opposition left party accused the previous government and steinmeier of " merciless , inhuman cold-bloodedness " in dealing with kurnaz .
neskovic slammed the government 's attempt to block kurnaz 's return to germany as " deeply cynical . " " i do n't think steinmeier will survive this politically , " he added . volker beck , head of the opposition green party which was a coalition partner in the previous government , said that if steinmeier had indeed sanctioned kurnaz spending long unnecessary years at guantanamo bay , the minister " could no longer credibly represent the german government 's human rights and foreign policy . " steinmeier 's spokesman jens plötner however rejected the allegations , pointing out that the parliamentary investigation into the kurnaz case had just begun its work and that it had still to collect much information before conclusions could be drawn from the affair . on friday , two german newspapers reported that the us offer to release kurnaz in 2002 - which was refused by germany - came with several conditions . for one , the us demanded that kurnaz be monitored round the clock in germany so that he would take up any terrorist activity , the bild and stuttgarter nachrichten reported . kurnaz alleges abuse at german and us hands apart from the previous german government 's role in the affair , kurnaz 's case is also being investigated for intelligence and security lapses on the part of german authorities . the inquiry is also investigating whether the questioning of kurnaz in guantanamo by german officials in feb .
2002 was appropriate .
the government at the time condemned the prison camp , yet was unprepared to question kurnaz over indications he may have been involved in a possible islamist terrorist cell in bremen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz has said he was abused by german special-forces soldiers kurnaz this week testified he was arrested on a trip to pakistan in october 2001 and handed over by the authorities to the americans who transferred him to a us prison in kandahar , in afghanistan .
from there he was later moved to guantanamo . kurnaz has alleged that two german special-forces soldiers beat him up while he was detained in kandahar , in afghanistan in 2002 .

the issue has polarized opinion and rekindled memories of a turbulent chapter in german history . on sunday , residents of berlin 's friedrichshain-kreuzberg district will go to the polls to settle a simmering controversy over the renaming of a street after rudi dutschke , a protest leader of the 1960s .
the emotive issue has polarized public opinion and brought into focus old political animosities . " germany and berlin need a rudi-dutschke-strasse , because it 's a very important symbol of what we are today and which political stream has made things happen in postwar germany , " said peter unfried , deputy editor-in-chief of left-leaning daily t az who has spearheaded a campaign to rename the street . " what we are today - a freer , more liberal society - is partly due to 1968 and rudi dutschke , " he said . charismatic leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutschke in 1968 during a protest in berlin born in 1940 , dutschke emerged as one of the most charismatic personalities of west germany 's student movement , which pitted children against their parents and anti-communists against leftists in the 1960s . a student of sociology at west berlin 's free university , dutschke was an influential theoretician in left-wing circles and active in organizing street protests - that shook up west german society - against the so-called " establishment . "
the high-profile dutschke was shot and seriously injured in 1968 and moved to london to recover .
years later , he returned to west germany - and life on the political stage .
shortly before his unexpected death in a bathtub in december 1979 - which was thought to have been related to injuries sustained during his shooting - he became actively involved with the ecologically minded greens , who established themselves as a political party three weeks later . right vs. left during the cold war , the greens and the left-wing taz manned the one side of west germany 's ideological battles and the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the right-wing axel springer publishing house the other . axel springer and the taz were n't just political enemies .
they were and still are close neighbors , too .
their offices are located just doors away from each other on kochstrasse -lrb- koch street -rrb- , the street at the center of the renaming fight . it was on this street that angry student protests erupted in 1968 after dutschke was shot and seriously wounded .
students blamed springer 's papers for inflaming public opinion against them and said the man who shot dutschke was influenced by views expressed by springer tabloid bild .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer built the tower block next to the wall as a " beacon of democracy " kochstrasse is something of a showcase of 20th century germany history .
himmler 's gestapo headquarters on wilhelmstrasse was just meters away from the street , at its far western end .
a few blocks to the east , it bisects friedrichstrasse next to what became checkpoint charlie , the us-controlled border crossing to communist east berlin , and remnants of the wall .
the taz is located a few buildings further east . another couple blocks down the road , at the intersection to axel-springer-strasse , stands the tower block the eponymous and powerful publisher built for the berlin office of his hamburg-based company . after naming its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 , the taz started a campaign to rename kochstrasse .
what 's in a name ?
in 2005 , the local assembly in friedrichhain-kreuzberg , dominated by the social democrats and the green party , decided to rename kochstrasse as rudi-dutschke-strasse - to the conservatives ' horror .
" the state should n't honor a person who was in favor of the dissolution of the state , " said timo husein , 26 , head of the cdu 's youth organization in the district .
" he was n't a democrat in a legal sense .
he propagated violence against property .
someone who uses violence to reach his aims is n't an appropriate person to be honored . "
husein said the renaming would mean that the street 's 1,000 residents would have to have their personal id cards changed .
in addition , the area 's estimated 700 businesses , from snack bars to a national insurance company , would have to shell out around 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 450,000 -rrb- to reprint signs , stationary and business cards .
backed by the local cdu , husein 's youth group collected the 10,000 signatures necessary to take the question of renaming the street to the ballot box .
fifteen percent of friedrichshain-kreuzberg 's voters , around 25,000 people , must vote in the referendum sunday to put a stop to the name change .
" a sort of poetic justice " it was a no-brainer for husein 's conservative youth group to take up the fight against dutschke .
" dutschke is naturally an opponent , " he said .
it 's not about changing a law on sales tax , which is rather boring .
it 's really about ideology , about left and right , and the left sees it that way , too . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taz named its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 husein was hopeful dutschke would lose in the referendum , though he admitted it was hard for conservatives to have an effect in the only electoral precinct in germany ever to have directly elected a green candidate to the federal parliament , in 2005 .
" but that 's no reason not to try , " he said .
meanwhile , the taz 's unfried was fairly certain friedrichshain-kreuzberg would go for dutschke .
but whatever the outcome of the poll , he was pleased that the campaign seemed to have raised consciousness of dutschke , a symbol , he said , for fighting for a better society . " not many people know that they changed lindenstrasse to axel-springer-strasse , which not everyone appreciates , especially people on the liberal , progressive side of the spectrum , " unfried said .

the issue has polarized opinion and rekindled memories of a turbulent chapter in german history . on sunday , residents of berlin 's friedrichshain-kreuzberg district will go to the polls to settle a simmering controversy over the renaming of a street after rudi dutschke , a protest leader of the 1960s .
the emotive issue has polarized public opinion and brought into focus old political animosities . " germany and berlin need a rudi-dutschke-strasse , because it 's a very important symbol of what we are today and which political stream has made things happen in postwar germany , " said peter unfried , deputy editor-in-chief of left-leaning daily t az who has spearheaded a campaign to rename the street .

experts say political parties are largely to blame for the situation . germany 's first female chancellor angela merkel arguably became the most influential political figure in europe a few weeks ago as her country took over the presidency of both the eu and the g8 .
merkel was also voted the world 's most powerful woman by forbes magazine in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : segolene royal would be france 's first female president , if elected the german head of government is a high-profile example of the success of women in european politics and could soon be followed by segolene royal , who is hoping to become france 's first female president in may . but unlike merkel and other female leaders , many women in european parliaments still owe their mandate to gender quotas .
similar to equal employment quotas , they are designed to boost the number of women in politics and balance out the number of male and female representatives . do quotas work ? the use of gender quotas has been criticized as giving women an unfair advantage over male candidates and can take away a woman 's sense of empowerment that they had earned the position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ratio that 's still reality in some legislatures " this legislation -lrb- gender quotas -rrb- would mean that people would not deserve to be there , but that they are forced there , " said godfrey bloom , a european parliamentarian and member of uk independence party .

dahlerup attributed the unpopularity of quotas in europe to the " notion of liberal democracy . "
she said the quotas are often seen as interfering with the democratic system . she cited france as an example : there must be an equal number of men and women political candidates for national parliamentary elections , or parties must pay a fine .
most of the parties that can afford to pay the fine are choosing to do so rather than have the required number of female candidates . there has also been resistance to have a quota system in italy , where a vote on a so-called " pink quota " was rejected by the italian parliament in april 2006 .
this bill would have meant that one-third of all national election candidates would have to be women , to boost the current 11.5 percent female representation , the forth lowest in the european union . political parties hold the power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to parties to put more women on their ballots dahlerup said the political parties are the " gatekeepers " to the parliament , who have the power to change the gender balances .
this applies to a parliamentary system , not direct democracy which operates in the us and switzerland , which only require one-off majority votes for most of the time . " they -lrb- political parties -rrb- could change political representation tomorrow if they wanted because they control the nomination process , " dahlerup said .

most of the parties that can afford to pay the fine are choosing to do so rather than have the required number of female candidates . there has also been resistance to have a quota system in italy , where a vote on a so-called " pink quota " was rejected by the italian parliament in april 2006 .
this bill would have meant that one-third of all national election candidates would have to be women , to boost the current 11.5 percent female representation , the forth lowest in the european union . political parties hold the power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to parties to put more women on their ballots dahlerup said the political parties are the " gatekeepers " to the parliament , who have the power to change the gender balances .

" they will definitely talk " about energy , merkel 's g8 advisor bernd pfaffenbach , said in an interview with russian daily vedomosti , adding that the row had " damaged russia 's authority . " " we will insist more firmly on the need for russia to be a reliable partner in the long term , " pfaffenbach said .
" we have a particular responsibility on this as president of the european union .

last friday , she stressed she could not describe putin as " a flawless democrat , " as schröder once did . " i have n't said that yet and i 'm not saying that now , " merkel said . merkel has also put a stronger emphasis than schröder on the need for strong european ties to the united states . eu still needs russian energy but eu dependency on russian energy means that links remain pragmatic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in germany prefer nuclear energy to depending on russian gas and oil " this does not mean the german chancellor is negative about russia , " german foreign policy expert alexander rahr wrote in the russian government newspaper rossiiskaya gazeta .
" she still tries to build pragmatic and reliable relations with moscow . " on another important eu-russia trade matter , germany is hoping to clear the way for talks on a russian-eu strategic partnership , which have been blocked by a polish veto linked to a dispute over polish meat imports into russia . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , however , said friday that he was confident poland and russia would find an acceptable compromise .

his successor , angela merkel has a different approach , which she will make clear to putin when they meet sunday , according to dw 's cornelia rabitz . since his exit from the political stage and his new role as supervisory board chairman of the consortium that plans to build a baltic sea pipeline from russia to germany , former chancellor gerhard schröder has become something of a lobbyist . he seems to be inspired by his mission .
some people even suspect his consistent praise for russia 's policies has become something of a replacement for his politics drug . in a berlin hotel recently , schröder once more gave a packed house a taste of his stance .
but in the meantime his strident defense of russia causes a rather bad aftertaste .
it 's an embarrassment when a former chancellor is said to behave like the russian president 's spokesman .
it 's an embarrassment when schröder patronizingly charges that public discussion of russia here in germany is " marked by anti-russia reflexes . " of course schröder can call for closer german-russian cooperation .
it 's certainly legitimate to defend energy exporter russia when it 's accused of hypocrisy or becomes the subject of unfair criticism : criticizing russia while assiduously overlooking the political situation in other oil states , such as saudi arabia , iran , nigeria , libya or algeria is reckless . and no one seriously denies moscow 's right to demand market prices for energy from its onetime allies either . sure enough , for schröder , russia 's questionable actions in the most recent natural gas and oil disputes are n't an issue .
why does n't " gerd " recommend more sovereignty in foreign and economic policy matters to his dear friend " volodya " ?
why does n't he warn him of behavior that brings russia a massive loss in esteem and only feeds skepticism toward greater energy dependency ?
it 's an embarrassment when friendship on the political stage is confused with one-sided partisanship . it 's downright improper to willfully and deliberately ignore other aspects .
for supervisory board head schröder , issues of democracy , civil society , human rights , the murders of journalists and other kremlin critics and the lack of rule of law are all negligible and hardly worth mentioning .
it 's no wonder then that he gets top marks from the russian side ; the kremlin could hardly hope for a better - and such a prominent - propagandist . it must be a nuisance to chancellor angela merkel , who travels to sochi on sunday .
as president of the eu council , she is striving for a pragmatic , a good relationship to russia .
in contrast to her predecessor , she addresses problems in bilateral relations and beyond . that 's why in sochi she will again tell president vladimir putin that the recent unannounced russian halt to gas deliveries via belarus annoyed the eu and has nothing to do with normal business behavior .
merkel will once more demand moscow be reliable .
she will remind him of the not yet negotiated partnership deal between the european union and russia .
she will stress how important russia is - also for the resolution of international conflicts . merkel apparently does n't think much of absolution : calling putin a " flawless democrat , " as schröder did during his chancellorship , is something she still wo n't do .
the russian president is , after all , far from passing the test . cornelia rabitz is the head of dw-radio 's russian service -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's criticism of russia over energy marks shift in ties chancellor angela merkel 's rebuke of russia over it halting oil supplies to europe has revealed a possible shift in ties between the two countries .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist hrant dink was a critic of turkey 's official line on the massacre of armenians it also said dink , who was gunned down outside the offices of the newspaper he edited in istanbul on friday , was prepared to take great personal risks for his work . " he always strove to present a balanced picture and avoided provoking confrontations .
he staunchly supported the democratic reforms in turkey , " the eu presidency statement said . " as a result , hrant dink was held in high esteem in various sections of turkish society , as well as in europe . " turkey promises to find murderer the turkish government vowed saturday that it would do " whatever it takes " to find and punish the murderer as it came under fire for failing to protect dink despite nationalist threats . " the perpetrators will not escape justice , " prime minister recep tayyip erdogan said at a political function in kizilcahamam , near ankara .

the agency had earlier said that a total of eight people were questioned . dink , the editor of the bilingual turkish-armenian weekly agos , was shot three times in the head and neck outside the newspaper 's office in downtown istanbul , sending shock waves throughout the country . " we are very close to solving the case .
we have definitive evidence , " istanbul governor muammer guler told reporters late friday . journalist had received threats dink was one of the taboo-breaking critics of the official line on the mass massacres of armenians under the ottoman empire during world war i and was last year given a suspended six-month jail sentence for insulting " turkishness . " dink was convicted under the infamous article 301 of the penal code , which has served as a ground to prosecute a series of other intellectuals , including 2006 nobel literature laureate orhan pamuk , and which the eu has denounced a threat to free speech in the eu-hopeful country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous turkish writer orhan pamuk also faced charges for insulting " turkishness " nationalists had labeled him a " traitor " and dink had spoken of receiving threats and hate mail . despite the controversies , the soft-spoken and often emotional dink had won many hearts in turkey as a sincere activist for turkish-armenian dialogue , who denounced also armenian radicalism and most recently , a french bill in october to jail those who deny that the 1915-17 killings of armenians constituted genocide . he will be laid to rest on tuesday , his colleagues said . " murderer is a traitor " the turkish press piled pressure on the government to solve the murder , condemning it as a " national shame " and lashing out at the authorities for having failed to ensure protection for a man who openly wrote in his articles in agos that he was receiving threats . " not protecting people who are under threat amounts to paving the way for those who want to kill them , " liberal daily radikal wrote . " the murderer is a traitor , " declared mass-circulation hurriyet on its front page saturday , while the popular sabah headlined : " the greatest treason . " the police , reportedly looking for a young man , wearing a denim jacket and a white cap who was seen running from the scene , were examining footage from security cameras of nearby shops . damage to turkey 's image some commentators saw serious implications for turkish foreign policy , with the popular vatan newspaper stressing that armenian campaigns for an international recognition of the 1915-17 massacres as genocide would gain strength .

last friday , she stressed she could not describe putin as " a flawless democrat , " as schröder once did . " i have n't said that yet and i 'm not saying that now , " merkel said . merkel has also put a stronger emphasis than schröder on the need for strong european ties to the united states . eu still needs russian energy but eu dependency on russian energy means that links remain pragmatic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in germany prefer nuclear energy to depending on russian gas and oil " this does not mean the german chancellor is negative about russia , " german foreign policy expert alexander rahr wrote in the russian government newspaper rossiiskaya gazeta .

" on another important eu-russia trade matter , germany is hoping to clear the way for talks on a russian-eu strategic partnership , which have been blocked by a polish veto linked to a dispute over polish meat imports into russia . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , however , said friday that he was confident poland and russia would find an acceptable compromise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 20.01.2007 germans at odds over eu 's emissons plans for car industry germans are divided over european union 's plan to impose new limits on carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions for the entire car industry in the 27-member bloc . the 27-member bloc 's environmental commissioner stavros dimas is floating plans for a new industry-wide co2 limit on new vehicles from 2012 , cutting the current voluntary limit of 140 grams per kilometer to an enforced 120 grams . the plans are part of the eu 's strategy to reduce the levels of greenhouse gases created by automotive vehicles on european highways .
its initial strategy of encouraging car companies to enforce their own self-regulated levels of co2 output in their newest vehicles has been inefficient .
few new vehicles on european roads achieve the 140 grams / km limit . germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel told the german parliament this week that the eu must do all it can to bring down the level of carbon dioxide emissions .
he said it was obvious that the policy of self-regulation within the auto industry was not working .
in short , gabriel apparently seemed to support the idea of a regulated and enforced limit . verheugen touts trading scheme bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen is in favor a carbon trading scheme for cars however günter verheugen , gabriel 's compatriot in the eu parliament , was not of the same mind .
the eu industry commissioner rejected the call for a strict limitation on co2 emissions in the car industry and argued that a system similar to that employed by industry where emission credits can be bought and sold . under the bloc 's emissions trading scheme , industries can buy and sell emissions quotas .
if they exceed their limit , they have to buy credits from other companies .
verheugen argued that for some car manufacturers , this would be less expensive than developing emission reduction technologies for their new vehicles by 2012 . " for a manufacturer like porsche , this would always be cheaper than to demand that its cars are developed to reach the emission level of 120 grams , " said verheugen . gabriel skeptical of alternative plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel wants auto firms to cut co2 to eu levels but sigmar gabriel is skeptical as to whether an expansion of the emissions trading scheme to the auto industry was practical . " it is already difficult enough to apply the trading scheme , " he said , and referred to the ongoing disarray within industry itself and the problems experienced while planning a similar scheme in the aviation business . gabriel added that the argument over automotive co2 emissions should be discussed through germany 's eu presidency but added that an agreement should not be rushed to be completed by the end of the six-month role . " this is very ambitious , " he said , adding that the topic required a lot of thought and discussion to find a compromise . he said that consultations with colleagues from the other 26 eu states would begin soon but that finding a common agreement by june would only happen " if things go really well .

it added that in 2005 the government also hoped to received further information about kurnaz from the american side that would " strengthen the case -lrb- against kurnaz -rrb- for his support of international terrorism . " the allegations have created pressure on german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who at the time was gerhard schröder 's chief of staff and hence in charge of intelligence . does schröder 's government bear responsibility ? the newspaper reported that the german government was informed in 2002 that kurnaz had been physically and psychologically abused in guantanamo .
it added that officials of germany 's bnd federal intelligence service who interrogated kurnaz in cuba in september 2002 had found no evidence linking him to any terrorist activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz during his appearance before a parliamentary investigation committee this week faced with this information , schröder 's social democrat-green party government still tried to block kurnaz ' return to germany after the 2005 federal elections , the paper said . the paper 's allegations were given further weight this week when kurnaz ' lawyer , bernhard docke , told a parliamentary inquiry in berlin that the german foreign ministry only administered kurnaz ' case and was n't proactive in freeing him . docke said he suspected that the government under then-chancellor schröder refused kurnaz entry into germany in the fall of 2002 , when the us originally offered to release him from the prison camp . " until this day i see no real reason why germany , if it had the offer from the us , did n't take it up , " after both sides had established that kurnaz was n't a terror suspect , " docke said .
" if kurnaz would have been german , he would already have been free in fall 2002 , " he said . docke told the parliamentary inquiry that former foreign minister joschka fischer told kurnaz 's mother in a letter that german help was limited because kurnaz had turkish citizenship and the us was only negotiating with the home nations of inmates . foreign minister under pressure the accusations against the former government and in particular the focus on steinmeier 's role sparked a heated debate among german politicians on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has some questions to answers in the kurnaz affair wolfgang neskovic of the opposition left party accused the previous government and steinmeier of " merciless , inhuman cold-bloodedness " in dealing with kurnaz .
neskovic slammed the government 's attempt to block kurnaz 's return to germany as " deeply cynical . " " i do n't think steinmeier will survive this politically , " he added . volker beck , head of the opposition green party which was a coalition partner in the previous government , said that if steinmeier had indeed sanctioned kurnaz spending long unnecessary years at guantanamo bay , the minister " could no longer credibly represent the german government 's human rights and foreign policy . " steinmeier 's spokesman jens plötner however rejected the allegations , pointing out that the parliamentary investigation into the kurnaz case had just begun its work and that it had still to collect much information before conclusions could be drawn from the affair . on friday , two german newspapers reported that the us offer to release kurnaz in 2002 - which was refused by germany - came with several conditions . for one , the us demanded that kurnaz be monitored round the clock in germany so that he would take up any terrorist activity , the bild and stuttgarter nachrichten reported . kurnaz alleges abuse at german and us hands apart from the previous german government 's role in the affair , kurnaz 's case is also being investigated for intelligence and security lapses on the part of german authorities . the inquiry is also investigating whether the questioning of kurnaz in guantanamo by german officials in feb .
2002 was appropriate .
the government at the time condemned the prison camp , yet was unprepared to question kurnaz over indications he may have been involved in a possible islamist terrorist cell in bremen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz has said he was abused by german special-forces soldiers kurnaz this week testified he was arrested on a trip to pakistan in october 2001 and handed over by the authorities to the americans who transferred him to a us prison in kandahar , in afghanistan .
from there he was later moved to guantanamo . kurnaz has alleged that two german special-forces soldiers beat him up while he was detained in kandahar , in afghanistan in 2002 .
prosecutors in germany are already considering filing charges against the two soldiers after kurnaz identified them from photographers . kurnaz , who returned to germany last year , has also testified he was tortured in guantanamo bay . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-born ex-prisoner describes torture at guantanamo bay former guantanamo bay prisoner , german-born turk murat kurnaz told a parliamentary committee he faced torture and other abuse during his four years spent at the us prison in cuba .

" i have n't said that yet and i 'm not saying that now , " merkel said . merkel has also put a stronger emphasis than schröder on the need for strong european ties to the united states . eu still needs russian energy but eu dependency on russian energy means that links remain pragmatic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in germany prefer nuclear energy to depending on russian gas and oil " this does not mean the german chancellor is negative about russia , " german foreign policy expert alexander rahr wrote in the russian government newspaper rossiiskaya gazeta .
" she still tries to build pragmatic and reliable relations with moscow . " on another important eu-russia trade matter , germany is hoping to clear the way for talks on a russian-eu strategic partnership , which have been blocked by a polish veto linked to a dispute over polish meat imports into russia . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , however , said friday that he was confident poland and russia would find an acceptable compromise . " i am actually very optimistic that we will find a solution , " he said .
" i am very hopeful that the new negotiations -lrb- between the eu and russia -rrb- can begin soon . " mideast , eastern europe also on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian elections are scheduled for sunday talks on the middle east are also likely , with the so-called " quartet " - the european union , russia , the united nations and united states - planning a new attempt to kick-start stalled israeli-palestinian peace talks . merkel has made this a priority of germany 's eu presidency , while putin is keen for moscow to play a bigger diplomatic role in the middle east . ahead of elections sunday in serbia , the two leaders will likewise have plenty to discuss on kosovo , the mostly ethnic-albanian province of the former yugoslavia that is pressing for independence from serbia . merkel told news agency reuters in an interview friday that a decision on the fate of kosovo must bring " maximum " satisfaction to the citizens of the province without stirring turbulence in serbia . russia is a strong ally of serbia , which opposes allowing kosovo to break away , and has suggested that if kosovo becomes independent then the status of moscow-backed separatist regions in georgia , a pro-western ex-soviet republic , should also be reconsidered . on thursday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he favored measures that ensured autonomy for the ethnic-serb minority in kosovo . he also underlined that kosovo 's case could not be compared to those in the caucasus . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel strikes right note with russia former chancellor gerhard schröder is known as a defender of russia .

his successor , angela merkel has a different approach , which she will make clear to putin when they meet sunday , according to dw 's cornelia rabitz . since his exit from the political stage and his new role as supervisory board chairman of the consortium that plans to build a baltic sea pipeline from russia to germany , former chancellor gerhard schröder has become something of a lobbyist . he seems to be inspired by his mission .
some people even suspect his consistent praise for russia 's policies has become something of a replacement for his politics drug . in a berlin hotel recently , schröder once more gave a packed house a taste of his stance .
but in the meantime his strident defense of russia causes a rather bad aftertaste .
it 's an embarrassment when a former chancellor is said to behave like the russian president 's spokesman .
it 's an embarrassment when schröder patronizingly charges that public discussion of russia here in germany is " marked by anti-russia reflexes . " of course schröder can call for closer german-russian cooperation .
it 's certainly legitimate to defend energy exporter russia when it 's accused of hypocrisy or becomes the subject of unfair criticism : criticizing russia while assiduously overlooking the political situation in other oil states , such as saudi arabia , iran , nigeria , libya or algeria is reckless . and no one seriously denies moscow 's right to demand market prices for energy from its onetime allies either . sure enough , for schröder , russia 's questionable actions in the most recent natural gas and oil disputes are n't an issue .
why does n't " gerd " recommend more sovereignty in foreign and economic policy matters to his dear friend " volodya " ?
why does n't he warn him of behavior that brings russia a massive loss in esteem and only feeds skepticism toward greater energy dependency ?
it 's an embarrassment when friendship on the political stage is confused with one-sided partisanship . it 's downright improper to willfully and deliberately ignore other aspects .
for supervisory board head schröder , issues of democracy , civil society , human rights , the murders of journalists and other kremlin critics and the lack of rule of law are all negligible and hardly worth mentioning .
it 's no wonder then that he gets top marks from the russian side ; the kremlin could hardly hope for a better - and such a prominent - propagandist . it must be a nuisance to chancellor angela merkel , who travels to sochi on sunday .
as president of the eu council , she is striving for a pragmatic , a good relationship to russia .
in contrast to her predecessor , she addresses problems in bilateral relations and beyond . that 's why in sochi she will again tell president vladimir putin that the recent unannounced russian halt to gas deliveries via belarus annoyed the eu and has nothing to do with normal business behavior .
merkel will once more demand moscow be reliable .
she will remind him of the not yet negotiated partnership deal between the european union and russia .
she will stress how important russia is - also for the resolution of international conflicts . merkel apparently does n't think much of absolution : calling putin a " flawless democrat , " as schröder did during his chancellorship , is something she still wo n't do .

the issue has polarized opinion and rekindled memories of a turbulent chapter in german history . on sunday , residents of berlin 's friedrichshain-kreuzberg district will go to the polls to settle a simmering controversy over the renaming of a street after rudi dutschke , a protest leader of the 1960s .
the emotive issue has polarized public opinion and brought into focus old political animosities . " germany and berlin need a rudi-dutschke-strasse , because it 's a very important symbol of what we are today and which political stream has made things happen in postwar germany , " said peter unfried , deputy editor-in-chief of left-leaning daily t az who has spearheaded a campaign to rename the street . " what we are today - a freer , more liberal society - is partly due to 1968 and rudi dutschke , " he said . charismatic leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutschke in 1968 during a protest in berlin born in 1940 , dutschke emerged as one of the most charismatic personalities of west germany 's student movement , which pitted children against their parents and anti-communists against leftists in the 1960s . a student of sociology at west berlin 's free university , dutschke was an influential theoretician in left-wing circles and active in organizing street protests - that shook up west german society - against the so-called " establishment . "
the high-profile dutschke was shot and seriously injured in 1968 and moved to london to recover .
years later , he returned to west germany - and life on the political stage .
shortly before his unexpected death in a bathtub in december 1979 - which was thought to have been related to injuries sustained during his shooting - he became actively involved with the ecologically minded greens , who established themselves as a political party three weeks later . right vs. left during the cold war , the greens and the left-wing taz manned the one side of west germany 's ideological battles and the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the right-wing axel springer publishing house the other . axel springer and the taz were n't just political enemies .
they were and still are close neighbors , too .
their offices are located just doors away from each other on kochstrasse -lrb- koch street -rrb- , the street at the center of the renaming fight . it was on this street that angry student protests erupted in 1968 after dutschke was shot and seriously wounded .
students blamed springer 's papers for inflaming public opinion against them and said the man who shot dutschke was influenced by views expressed by springer tabloid bild .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer built the tower block next to the wall as a " beacon of democracy " kochstrasse is something of a showcase of 20th century germany history .
himmler 's gestapo headquarters on wilhelmstrasse was just meters away from the street , at its far western end .
a few blocks to the east , it bisects friedrichstrasse next to what became checkpoint charlie , the us-controlled border crossing to communist east berlin , and remnants of the wall .
the taz is located a few buildings further east . another couple blocks down the road , at the intersection to axel-springer-strasse , stands the tower block the eponymous and powerful publisher built for the berlin office of his hamburg-based company . after naming its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 , the taz started a campaign to rename kochstrasse .
what 's in a name ?
in 2005 , the local assembly in friedrichhain-kreuzberg , dominated by the social democrats and the green party , decided to rename kochstrasse as rudi-dutschke-strasse - to the conservatives ' horror .
" the state should n't honor a person who was in favor of the dissolution of the state , " said timo husein , 26 , head of the cdu 's youth organization in the district .
" he was n't a democrat in a legal sense .
he propagated violence against property .
someone who uses violence to reach his aims is n't an appropriate person to be honored . "
husein said the renaming would mean that the street 's 1,000 residents would have to have their personal id cards changed .
in addition , the area 's estimated 700 businesses , from snack bars to a national insurance company , would have to shell out around 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 450,000 -rrb- to reprint signs , stationary and business cards .
backed by the local cdu , husein 's youth group collected the 10,000 signatures necessary to take the question of renaming the street to the ballot box .
fifteen percent of friedrichshain-kreuzberg 's voters , around 25,000 people , must vote in the referendum sunday to put a stop to the name change .
" a sort of poetic justice " it was a no-brainer for husein 's conservative youth group to take up the fight against dutschke .
" dutschke is naturally an opponent , " he said .
it 's not about changing a law on sales tax , which is rather boring .
it 's really about ideology , about left and right , and the left sees it that way , too . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taz named its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 husein was hopeful dutschke would lose in the referendum , though he admitted it was hard for conservatives to have an effect in the only electoral precinct in germany ever to have directly elected a green candidate to the federal parliament , in 2005 .
" but that 's no reason not to try , " he said .
meanwhile , the taz 's unfried was fairly certain friedrichshain-kreuzberg would go for dutschke .
but whatever the outcome of the poll , he was pleased that the campaign seemed to have raised consciousness of dutschke , a symbol , he said , for fighting for a better society . " not many people know that they changed lindenstrasse to axel-springer-strasse , which not everyone appreciates , especially people on the liberal , progressive side of the spectrum , " unfried said .
" it 'll be a sort of poetic justice to have dutschke boulevard with axel springer street .

" he always strove to present a balanced picture and avoided provoking confrontations .
he staunchly supported the democratic reforms in turkey , " the eu presidency statement said . " as a result , hrant dink was held in high esteem in various sections of turkish society , as well as in europe . " turkey promises to find murderer the turkish government vowed saturday that it would do " whatever it takes " to find and punish the murderer as it came under fire for failing to protect dink despite nationalist threats . " the perpetrators will not escape justice , " prime minister recep tayyip erdogan said at a political function in kizilcahamam , near ankara .

" we are very close to solving the case .

" dink was convicted under the infamous article 301 of the penal code , which has served as a ground to prosecute a series of other intellectuals , including 2006 nobel literature laureate orhan pamuk , and which the eu has denounced a threat to free speech in the eu-hopeful country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous turkish writer orhan pamuk also faced charges for insulting " turkishness " nationalists had labeled him a " traitor " and dink had spoken of receiving threats and hate mail . despite the controversies , the soft-spoken and often emotional dink had won many hearts in turkey as a sincere activist for turkish-armenian dialogue , who denounced also armenian radicalism and most recently , a french bill in october to jail those who deny that the 1915-17 killings of armenians constituted genocide . he will be laid to rest on tuesday , his colleagues said . " murderer is a traitor " the turkish press piled pressure on the government to solve the murder , condemning it as a " national shame " and lashing out at the authorities for having failed to ensure protection for a man who openly wrote in his articles in agos that he was receiving threats .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.01.2007 renaming of berlin street reopens old ideological rifts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight goes on a referendum on sunday in berlin will decide whether to name a street after a famous student protest leader of the 1960s .
the issue has polarized opinion and rekindled memories of a turbulent chapter in german history . on sunday , residents of berlin 's friedrichshain-kreuzberg district will go to the polls to settle a simmering controversy over the renaming of a street after rudi dutschke , a protest leader of the 1960s .
the emotive issue has polarized public opinion and brought into focus old political animosities . " germany and berlin need a rudi-dutschke-strasse , because it 's a very important symbol of what we are today and which political stream has made things happen in postwar germany , " said peter unfried , deputy editor-in-chief of left-leaning daily t az who has spearheaded a campaign to rename the street . " what we are today - a freer , more liberal society - is partly due to 1968 and rudi dutschke , " he said . charismatic leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutschke in 1968 during a protest in berlin born in 1940 , dutschke emerged as one of the most charismatic personalities of west germany 's student movement , which pitted children against their parents and anti-communists against leftists in the 1960s . a student of sociology at west berlin 's free university , dutschke was an influential theoretician in left-wing circles and active in organizing street protests - that shook up west german society - against the so-called " establishment . "
the high-profile dutschke was shot and seriously injured in 1968 and moved to london to recover .
years later , he returned to west germany - and life on the political stage .
shortly before his unexpected death in a bathtub in december 1979 - which was thought to have been related to injuries sustained during his shooting - he became actively involved with the ecologically minded greens , who established themselves as a political party three weeks later . right vs. left during the cold war , the greens and the left-wing taz manned the one side of west germany 's ideological battles and the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the right-wing axel springer publishing house the other . axel springer and the taz were n't just political enemies .
they were and still are close neighbors , too .
their offices are located just doors away from each other on kochstrasse -lrb- koch street -rrb- , the street at the center of the renaming fight . it was on this street that angry student protests erupted in 1968 after dutschke was shot and seriously wounded .
students blamed springer 's papers for inflaming public opinion against them and said the man who shot dutschke was influenced by views expressed by springer tabloid bild .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer built the tower block next to the wall as a " beacon of democracy " kochstrasse is something of a showcase of 20th century germany history .
himmler 's gestapo headquarters on wilhelmstrasse was just meters away from the street , at its far western end .
a few blocks to the east , it bisects friedrichstrasse next to what became checkpoint charlie , the us-controlled border crossing to communist east berlin , and remnants of the wall .
the taz is located a few buildings further east . another couple blocks down the road , at the intersection to axel-springer-strasse , stands the tower block the eponymous and powerful publisher built for the berlin office of his hamburg-based company . after naming its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 , the taz started a campaign to rename kochstrasse .
what 's in a name ?
in 2005 , the local assembly in friedrichhain-kreuzberg , dominated by the social democrats and the green party , decided to rename kochstrasse as rudi-dutschke-strasse - to the conservatives ' horror .
" the state should n't honor a person who was in favor of the dissolution of the state , " said timo husein , 26 , head of the cdu 's youth organization in the district .
" he was n't a democrat in a legal sense .
he propagated violence against property .
someone who uses violence to reach his aims is n't an appropriate person to be honored . "
husein said the renaming would mean that the street 's 1,000 residents would have to have their personal id cards changed .
in addition , the area 's estimated 700 businesses , from snack bars to a national insurance company , would have to shell out around 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 450,000 -rrb- to reprint signs , stationary and business cards .
backed by the local cdu , husein 's youth group collected the 10,000 signatures necessary to take the question of renaming the street to the ballot box .
fifteen percent of friedrichshain-kreuzberg 's voters , around 25,000 people , must vote in the referendum sunday to put a stop to the name change .
" a sort of poetic justice " it was a no-brainer for husein 's conservative youth group to take up the fight against dutschke .
" dutschke is naturally an opponent , " he said .
it 's not about changing a law on sales tax , which is rather boring .
it 's really about ideology , about left and right , and the left sees it that way , too . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taz named its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 husein was hopeful dutschke would lose in the referendum , though he admitted it was hard for conservatives to have an effect in the only electoral precinct in germany ever to have directly elected a green candidate to the federal parliament , in 2005 .
" but that 's no reason not to try , " he said .
meanwhile , the taz 's unfried was fairly certain friedrichshain-kreuzberg would go for dutschke .
but whatever the outcome of the poll , he was pleased that the campaign seemed to have raised consciousness of dutschke , a symbol , he said , for fighting for a better society . " not many people know that they changed lindenstrasse to axel-springer-strasse , which not everyone appreciates , especially people on the liberal , progressive side of the spectrum , " unfried said .
" it 'll be a sort of poetic justice to have dutschke boulevard with axel springer street .

it added that in 2005 the government also hoped to received further information about kurnaz from the american side that would " strengthen the case -lrb- against kurnaz -rrb- for his support of international terrorism . " the allegations have created pressure on german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who at the time was gerhard schröder 's chief of staff and hence in charge of intelligence . does schröder 's government bear responsibility ? the newspaper reported that the german government was informed in 2002 that kurnaz had been physically and psychologically abused in guantanamo .
it added that officials of germany 's bnd federal intelligence service who interrogated kurnaz in cuba in september 2002 had found no evidence linking him to any terrorist activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz during his appearance before a parliamentary investigation committee this week faced with this information , schröder 's social democrat-green party government still tried to block kurnaz ' return to germany after the 2005 federal elections , the paper said . the paper 's allegations were given further weight this week when kurnaz ' lawyer , bernhard docke , told a parliamentary inquiry in berlin that the german foreign ministry only administered kurnaz ' case and was n't proactive in freeing him . docke said he suspected that the government under then-chancellor schröder refused kurnaz entry into germany in the fall of 2002 , when the us originally offered to release him from the prison camp . " until this day i see no real reason why germany , if it had the offer from the us , did n't take it up , " after both sides had established that kurnaz was n't a terror suspect , " docke said .
" if kurnaz would have been german , he would already have been free in fall 2002 , " he said . docke told the parliamentary inquiry that former foreign minister joschka fischer told kurnaz 's mother in a letter that german help was limited because kurnaz had turkish citizenship and the us was only negotiating with the home nations of inmates . foreign minister under pressure the accusations against the former government and in particular the focus on steinmeier 's role sparked a heated debate among german politicians on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has some questions to answers in the kurnaz affair wolfgang neskovic of the opposition left party accused the previous government and steinmeier of " merciless , inhuman cold-bloodedness " in dealing with kurnaz .
neskovic slammed the government 's attempt to block kurnaz 's return to germany as " deeply cynical . " " i do n't think steinmeier will survive this politically , " he added . volker beck , head of the opposition green party which was a coalition partner in the previous government , said that if steinmeier had indeed sanctioned kurnaz spending long unnecessary years at guantanamo bay , the minister " could no longer credibly represent the german government 's human rights and foreign policy . " steinmeier 's spokesman jens plötner however rejected the allegations , pointing out that the parliamentary investigation into the kurnaz case had just begun its work and that it had still to collect much information before conclusions could be drawn from the affair . on friday , two german newspapers reported that the us offer to release kurnaz in 2002 - which was refused by germany - came with several conditions . for one , the us demanded that kurnaz be monitored round the clock in germany so that he would take up any terrorist activity , the bild and stuttgarter nachrichten reported . kurnaz alleges abuse at german and us hands apart from the previous german government 's role in the affair , kurnaz 's case is also being investigated for intelligence and security lapses on the part of german authorities . the inquiry is also investigating whether the questioning of kurnaz in guantanamo by german officials in feb .
2002 was appropriate .
the government at the time condemned the prison camp , yet was unprepared to question kurnaz over indications he may have been involved in a possible islamist terrorist cell in bremen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz has said he was abused by german special-forces soldiers kurnaz this week testified he was arrested on a trip to pakistan in october 2001 and handed over by the authorities to the americans who transferred him to a us prison in kandahar , in afghanistan .

it added that in 2005 the government also hoped to received further information about kurnaz from the american side that would " strengthen the case -lrb- against kurnaz -rrb- for his support of international terrorism . " the allegations have created pressure on german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who at the time was gerhard schröder 's chief of staff and hence in charge of intelligence . does schröder 's government bear responsibility ? the newspaper reported that the german government was informed in 2002 that kurnaz had been physically and psychologically abused in guantanamo .
it added that officials of germany 's bnd federal intelligence service who interrogated kurnaz in cuba in september 2002 had found no evidence linking him to any terrorist activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz during his appearance before a parliamentary investigation committee this week faced with this information , schröder 's social democrat-green party government still tried to block kurnaz ' return to germany after the 2005 federal elections , the paper said . the paper 's allegations were given further weight this week when kurnaz ' lawyer , bernhard docke , told a parliamentary inquiry in berlin that the german foreign ministry only administered kurnaz ' case and was n't proactive in freeing him . docke said he suspected that the government under then-chancellor schröder refused kurnaz entry into germany in the fall of 2002 , when the us originally offered to release him from the prison camp . " until this day i see no real reason why germany , if it had the offer from the us , did n't take it up , " after both sides had established that kurnaz was n't a terror suspect , " docke said .
" if kurnaz would have been german , he would already have been free in fall 2002 , " he said . docke told the parliamentary inquiry that former foreign minister joschka fischer told kurnaz 's mother in a letter that german help was limited because kurnaz had turkish citizenship and the us was only negotiating with the home nations of inmates . foreign minister under pressure the accusations against the former government and in particular the focus on steinmeier 's role sparked a heated debate among german politicians on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has some questions to answers in the kurnaz affair wolfgang neskovic of the opposition left party accused the previous government and steinmeier of " merciless , inhuman cold-bloodedness " in dealing with kurnaz .

his successor , angela merkel has a different approach , which she will make clear to putin when they meet sunday , according to dw 's cornelia rabitz . since his exit from the political stage and his new role as supervisory board chairman of the consortium that plans to build a baltic sea pipeline from russia to germany , former chancellor gerhard schröder has become something of a lobbyist . he seems to be inspired by his mission .
some people even suspect his consistent praise for russia 's policies has become something of a replacement for his politics drug . in a berlin hotel recently , schröder once more gave a packed house a taste of his stance .
but in the meantime his strident defense of russia causes a rather bad aftertaste .
it 's an embarrassment when a former chancellor is said to behave like the russian president 's spokesman .
it 's an embarrassment when schröder patronizingly charges that public discussion of russia here in germany is " marked by anti-russia reflexes . " of course schröder can call for closer german-russian cooperation .
it 's certainly legitimate to defend energy exporter russia when it 's accused of hypocrisy or becomes the subject of unfair criticism : criticizing russia while assiduously overlooking the political situation in other oil states , such as saudi arabia , iran , nigeria , libya or algeria is reckless . and no one seriously denies moscow 's right to demand market prices for energy from its onetime allies either . sure enough , for schröder , russia 's questionable actions in the most recent natural gas and oil disputes are n't an issue .
why does n't " gerd " recommend more sovereignty in foreign and economic policy matters to his dear friend " volodya " ?
why does n't he warn him of behavior that brings russia a massive loss in esteem and only feeds skepticism toward greater energy dependency ?
it 's an embarrassment when friendship on the political stage is confused with one-sided partisanship . it 's downright improper to willfully and deliberately ignore other aspects .
for supervisory board head schröder , issues of democracy , civil society , human rights , the murders of journalists and other kremlin critics and the lack of rule of law are all negligible and hardly worth mentioning .
it 's no wonder then that he gets top marks from the russian side ; the kremlin could hardly hope for a better - and such a prominent - propagandist . it must be a nuisance to chancellor angela merkel , who travels to sochi on sunday .
as president of the eu council , she is striving for a pragmatic , a good relationship to russia .
in contrast to her predecessor , she addresses problems in bilateral relations and beyond . that 's why in sochi she will again tell president vladimir putin that the recent unannounced russian halt to gas deliveries via belarus annoyed the eu and has nothing to do with normal business behavior .
merkel will once more demand moscow be reliable .
she will remind him of the not yet negotiated partnership deal between the european union and russia .
she will stress how important russia is - also for the resolution of international conflicts . merkel apparently does n't think much of absolution : calling putin a " flawless democrat , " as schröder did during his chancellorship , is something she still wo n't do .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.01.2007 renaming of berlin street reopens old ideological rifts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight goes on a referendum on sunday in berlin will decide whether to name a street after a famous student protest leader of the 1960s .
the issue has polarized opinion and rekindled memories of a turbulent chapter in german history . on sunday , residents of berlin 's friedrichshain-kreuzberg district will go to the polls to settle a simmering controversy over the renaming of a street after rudi dutschke , a protest leader of the 1960s .
the emotive issue has polarized public opinion and brought into focus old political animosities . " germany and berlin need a rudi-dutschke-strasse , because it 's a very important symbol of what we are today and which political stream has made things happen in postwar germany , " said peter unfried , deputy editor-in-chief of left-leaning daily t az who has spearheaded a campaign to rename the street . " what we are today - a freer , more liberal society - is partly due to 1968 and rudi dutschke , " he said . charismatic leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutschke in 1968 during a protest in berlin born in 1940 , dutschke emerged as one of the most charismatic personalities of west germany 's student movement , which pitted children against their parents and anti-communists against leftists in the 1960s . a student of sociology at west berlin 's free university , dutschke was an influential theoretician in left-wing circles and active in organizing street protests - that shook up west german society - against the so-called " establishment . "
the high-profile dutschke was shot and seriously injured in 1968 and moved to london to recover .
years later , he returned to west germany - and life on the political stage .
shortly before his unexpected death in a bathtub in december 1979 - which was thought to have been related to injuries sustained during his shooting - he became actively involved with the ecologically minded greens , who established themselves as a political party three weeks later . right vs. left during the cold war , the greens and the left-wing taz manned the one side of west germany 's ideological battles and the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the right-wing axel springer publishing house the other . axel springer and the taz were n't just political enemies .
they were and still are close neighbors , too .
their offices are located just doors away from each other on kochstrasse -lrb- koch street -rrb- , the street at the center of the renaming fight . it was on this street that angry student protests erupted in 1968 after dutschke was shot and seriously wounded .
students blamed springer 's papers for inflaming public opinion against them and said the man who shot dutschke was influenced by views expressed by springer tabloid bild .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer built the tower block next to the wall as a " beacon of democracy " kochstrasse is something of a showcase of 20th century germany history .
himmler 's gestapo headquarters on wilhelmstrasse was just meters away from the street , at its far western end .
a few blocks to the east , it bisects friedrichstrasse next to what became checkpoint charlie , the us-controlled border crossing to communist east berlin , and remnants of the wall .
the taz is located a few buildings further east . another couple blocks down the road , at the intersection to axel-springer-strasse , stands the tower block the eponymous and powerful publisher built for the berlin office of his hamburg-based company . after naming its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 , the taz started a campaign to rename kochstrasse .
what 's in a name ?
in 2005 , the local assembly in friedrichhain-kreuzberg , dominated by the social democrats and the green party , decided to rename kochstrasse as rudi-dutschke-strasse - to the conservatives ' horror .
" the state should n't honor a person who was in favor of the dissolution of the state , " said timo husein , 26 , head of the cdu 's youth organization in the district .
" he was n't a democrat in a legal sense .
he propagated violence against property .
someone who uses violence to reach his aims is n't an appropriate person to be honored . "
husein said the renaming would mean that the street 's 1,000 residents would have to have their personal id cards changed .
in addition , the area 's estimated 700 businesses , from snack bars to a national insurance company , would have to shell out around 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 450,000 -rrb- to reprint signs , stationary and business cards .
backed by the local cdu , husein 's youth group collected the 10,000 signatures necessary to take the question of renaming the street to the ballot box .
fifteen percent of friedrichshain-kreuzberg 's voters , around 25,000 people , must vote in the referendum sunday to put a stop to the name change .
" a sort of poetic justice " it was a no-brainer for husein 's conservative youth group to take up the fight against dutschke .
" dutschke is naturally an opponent , " he said .
it 's not about changing a law on sales tax , which is rather boring .
it 's really about ideology , about left and right , and the left sees it that way , too . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taz named its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 husein was hopeful dutschke would lose in the referendum , though he admitted it was hard for conservatives to have an effect in the only electoral precinct in germany ever to have directly elected a green candidate to the federal parliament , in 2005 .
" but that 's no reason not to try , " he said .
meanwhile , the taz 's unfried was fairly certain friedrichshain-kreuzberg would go for dutschke .
but whatever the outcome of the poll , he was pleased that the campaign seemed to have raised consciousness of dutschke , a symbol , he said , for fighting for a better society . " not many people know that they changed lindenstrasse to axel-springer-strasse , which not everyone appreciates , especially people on the liberal , progressive side of the spectrum , " unfried said .
" it 'll be a sort of poetic justice to have dutschke boulevard with axel springer street .

it 's no wonder then that he gets top marks from the russian side ; the kremlin could hardly hope for a better - and such a prominent - propagandist . it must be a nuisance to chancellor angela merkel , who travels to sochi on sunday .
as president of the eu council , she is striving for a pragmatic , a good relationship to russia .
in contrast to her predecessor , she addresses problems in bilateral relations and beyond . that 's why in sochi she will again tell president vladimir putin that the recent unannounced russian halt to gas deliveries via belarus annoyed the eu and has nothing to do with normal business behavior .
merkel will once more demand moscow be reliable .
she will remind him of the not yet negotiated partnership deal between the european union and russia .
she will stress how important russia is - also for the resolution of international conflicts . merkel apparently does n't think much of absolution : calling putin a " flawless democrat , " as schröder did during his chancellorship , is something she still wo n't do .

it added that in 2005 the government also hoped to received further information about kurnaz from the american side that would " strengthen the case -lrb- against kurnaz -rrb- for his support of international terrorism . " the allegations have created pressure on german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who at the time was gerhard schröder 's chief of staff and hence in charge of intelligence . does schröder 's government bear responsibility ? the newspaper reported that the german government was informed in 2002 that kurnaz had been physically and psychologically abused in guantanamo .
it added that officials of germany 's bnd federal intelligence service who interrogated kurnaz in cuba in september 2002 had found no evidence linking him to any terrorist activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz during his appearance before a parliamentary investigation committee this week faced with this information , schröder 's social democrat-green party government still tried to block kurnaz ' return to germany after the 2005 federal elections , the paper said . the paper 's allegations were given further weight this week when kurnaz ' lawyer , bernhard docke , told a parliamentary inquiry in berlin that the german foreign ministry only administered kurnaz ' case and was n't proactive in freeing him . docke said he suspected that the government under then-chancellor schröder refused kurnaz entry into germany in the fall of 2002 , when the us originally offered to release him from the prison camp . " until this day i see no real reason why germany , if it had the offer from the us , did n't take it up , " after both sides had established that kurnaz was n't a terror suspect , " docke said .
" if kurnaz would have been german , he would already have been free in fall 2002 , " he said . docke told the parliamentary inquiry that former foreign minister joschka fischer told kurnaz 's mother in a letter that german help was limited because kurnaz had turkish citizenship and the us was only negotiating with the home nations of inmates . foreign minister under pressure the accusations against the former government and in particular the focus on steinmeier 's role sparked a heated debate among german politicians on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has some questions to answers in the kurnaz affair wolfgang neskovic of the opposition left party accused the previous government and steinmeier of " merciless , inhuman cold-bloodedness " in dealing with kurnaz .
neskovic slammed the government 's attempt to block kurnaz 's return to germany as " deeply cynical . " " i do n't think steinmeier will survive this politically , " he added . volker beck , head of the opposition green party which was a coalition partner in the previous government , said that if steinmeier had indeed sanctioned kurnaz spending long unnecessary years at guantanamo bay , the minister " could no longer credibly represent the german government 's human rights and foreign policy . " steinmeier 's spokesman jens plötner however rejected the allegations , pointing out that the parliamentary investigation into the kurnaz case had just begun its work and that it had still to collect much information before conclusions could be drawn from the affair . on friday , two german newspapers reported that the us offer to release kurnaz in 2002 - which was refused by germany - came with several conditions . for one , the us demanded that kurnaz be monitored round the clock in germany so that he would take up any terrorist activity , the bild and stuttgarter nachrichten reported . kurnaz alleges abuse at german and us hands apart from the previous german government 's role in the affair , kurnaz 's case is also being investigated for intelligence and security lapses on the part of german authorities . the inquiry is also investigating whether the questioning of kurnaz in guantanamo by german officials in feb .
2002 was appropriate .
the government at the time condemned the prison camp , yet was unprepared to question kurnaz over indications he may have been involved in a possible islamist terrorist cell in bremen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz has said he was abused by german special-forces soldiers kurnaz this week testified he was arrested on a trip to pakistan in october 2001 and handed over by the authorities to the americans who transferred him to a us prison in kandahar , in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.01.2007 renaming of berlin street reopens old ideological rifts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight goes on a referendum on sunday in berlin will decide whether to name a street after a famous student protest leader of the 1960s .
the issue has polarized opinion and rekindled memories of a turbulent chapter in german history . on sunday , residents of berlin 's friedrichshain-kreuzberg district will go to the polls to settle a simmering controversy over the renaming of a street after rudi dutschke , a protest leader of the 1960s .
the emotive issue has polarized public opinion and brought into focus old political animosities . " germany and berlin need a rudi-dutschke-strasse , because it 's a very important symbol of what we are today and which political stream has made things happen in postwar germany , " said peter unfried , deputy editor-in-chief of left-leaning daily t az who has spearheaded a campaign to rename the street . " what we are today - a freer , more liberal society - is partly due to 1968 and rudi dutschke , " he said . charismatic leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutschke in 1968 during a protest in berlin born in 1940 , dutschke emerged as one of the most charismatic personalities of west germany 's student movement , which pitted children against their parents and anti-communists against leftists in the 1960s . a student of sociology at west berlin 's free university , dutschke was an influential theoretician in left-wing circles and active in organizing street protests - that shook up west german society - against the so-called " establishment . "
the high-profile dutschke was shot and seriously injured in 1968 and moved to london to recover .
years later , he returned to west germany - and life on the political stage .
shortly before his unexpected death in a bathtub in december 1979 - which was thought to have been related to injuries sustained during his shooting - he became actively involved with the ecologically minded greens , who established themselves as a political party three weeks later . right vs. left during the cold war , the greens and the left-wing taz manned the one side of west germany 's ideological battles and the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the right-wing axel springer publishing house the other . axel springer and the taz were n't just political enemies .
they were and still are close neighbors , too .
their offices are located just doors away from each other on kochstrasse -lrb- koch street -rrb- , the street at the center of the renaming fight . it was on this street that angry student protests erupted in 1968 after dutschke was shot and seriously wounded .
students blamed springer 's papers for inflaming public opinion against them and said the man who shot dutschke was influenced by views expressed by springer tabloid bild .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer built the tower block next to the wall as a " beacon of democracy " kochstrasse is something of a showcase of 20th century germany history .
himmler 's gestapo headquarters on wilhelmstrasse was just meters away from the street , at its far western end .
a few blocks to the east , it bisects friedrichstrasse next to what became checkpoint charlie , the us-controlled border crossing to communist east berlin , and remnants of the wall .
the taz is located a few buildings further east . another couple blocks down the road , at the intersection to axel-springer-strasse , stands the tower block the eponymous and powerful publisher built for the berlin office of his hamburg-based company . after naming its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 , the taz started a campaign to rename kochstrasse .
what 's in a name ?
in 2005 , the local assembly in friedrichhain-kreuzberg , dominated by the social democrats and the green party , decided to rename kochstrasse as rudi-dutschke-strasse - to the conservatives ' horror .
" the state should n't honor a person who was in favor of the dissolution of the state , " said timo husein , 26 , head of the cdu 's youth organization in the district .
" he was n't a democrat in a legal sense .
he propagated violence against property .
someone who uses violence to reach his aims is n't an appropriate person to be honored . "
husein said the renaming would mean that the street 's 1,000 residents would have to have their personal id cards changed .
in addition , the area 's estimated 700 businesses , from snack bars to a national insurance company , would have to shell out around 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 450,000 -rrb- to reprint signs , stationary and business cards .
backed by the local cdu , husein 's youth group collected the 10,000 signatures necessary to take the question of renaming the street to the ballot box .
fifteen percent of friedrichshain-kreuzberg 's voters , around 25,000 people , must vote in the referendum sunday to put a stop to the name change .
" a sort of poetic justice " it was a no-brainer for husein 's conservative youth group to take up the fight against dutschke .
" dutschke is naturally an opponent , " he said .
it 's not about changing a law on sales tax , which is rather boring .
it 's really about ideology , about left and right , and the left sees it that way , too . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taz named its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 husein was hopeful dutschke would lose in the referendum , though he admitted it was hard for conservatives to have an effect in the only electoral precinct in germany ever to have directly elected a green candidate to the federal parliament , in 2005 .
" but that 's no reason not to try , " he said .
meanwhile , the taz 's unfried was fairly certain friedrichshain-kreuzberg would go for dutschke .
but whatever the outcome of the poll , he was pleased that the campaign seemed to have raised consciousness of dutschke , a symbol , he said , for fighting for a better society . " not many people know that they changed lindenstrasse to axel-springer-strasse , which not everyone appreciates , especially people on the liberal , progressive side of the spectrum , " unfried said .
" it 'll be a sort of poetic justice to have dutschke boulevard with axel springer street .

its initial strategy of encouraging car companies to enforce their own self-regulated levels of co2 output in their newest vehicles has been inefficient .
few new vehicles on european roads achieve the 140 grams / km limit . germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel told the german parliament this week that the eu must do all it can to bring down the level of carbon dioxide emissions .
he said it was obvious that the policy of self-regulation within the auto industry was not working .
in short , gabriel apparently seemed to support the idea of a regulated and enforced limit . verheugen touts trading scheme bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen is in favor a carbon trading scheme for cars however günter verheugen , gabriel 's compatriot in the eu parliament , was not of the same mind .
the eu industry commissioner rejected the call for a strict limitation on co2 emissions in the car industry and argued that a system similar to that employed by industry where emission credits can be bought and sold . under the bloc 's emissions trading scheme , industries can buy and sell emissions quotas .
if they exceed their limit , they have to buy credits from other companies .
verheugen argued that for some car manufacturers , this would be less expensive than developing emission reduction technologies for their new vehicles by 2012 . " for a manufacturer like porsche , this would always be cheaper than to demand that its cars are developed to reach the emission level of 120 grams , " said verheugen . gabriel skeptical of alternative plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel wants auto firms to cut co2 to eu levels but sigmar gabriel is skeptical as to whether an expansion of the emissions trading scheme to the auto industry was practical . " it is already difficult enough to apply the trading scheme , " he said , and referred to the ongoing disarray within industry itself and the problems experienced while planning a similar scheme in the aviation business . gabriel added that the argument over automotive co2 emissions should be discussed through germany 's eu presidency but added that an agreement should not be rushed to be completed by the end of the six-month role . " this is very ambitious , " he said , adding that the topic required a lot of thought and discussion to find a compromise . he said that consultations with colleagues from the other 26 eu states would begin soon but that finding a common agreement by june would only happen " if things go really well .

" they will definitely talk " about energy , merkel 's g8 advisor bernd pfaffenbach , said in an interview with russian daily vedomosti , adding that the row had " damaged russia 's authority . " " we will insist more firmly on the need for russia to be a reliable partner in the long term , " pfaffenbach said .

last friday , she stressed she could not describe putin as " a flawless democrat , " as schröder once did . " i have n't said that yet and i 'm not saying that now , " merkel said . merkel has also put a stronger emphasis than schröder on the need for strong european ties to the united states . eu still needs russian energy but eu dependency on russian energy means that links remain pragmatic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in germany prefer nuclear energy to depending on russian gas and oil " this does not mean the german chancellor is negative about russia , " german foreign policy expert alexander rahr wrote in the russian government newspaper rossiiskaya gazeta .
" she still tries to build pragmatic and reliable relations with moscow . " on another important eu-russia trade matter , germany is hoping to clear the way for talks on a russian-eu strategic partnership , which have been blocked by a polish veto linked to a dispute over polish meat imports into russia . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , however , said friday that he was confident poland and russia would find an acceptable compromise .

his successor , angela merkel has a different approach , which she will make clear to putin when they meet sunday , according to dw 's cornelia rabitz . since his exit from the political stage and his new role as supervisory board chairman of the consortium that plans to build a baltic sea pipeline from russia to germany , former chancellor gerhard schröder has become something of a lobbyist . he seems to be inspired by his mission .
some people even suspect his consistent praise for russia 's policies has become something of a replacement for his politics drug . in a berlin hotel recently , schröder once more gave a packed house a taste of his stance .
but in the meantime his strident defense of russia causes a rather bad aftertaste .
it 's an embarrassment when a former chancellor is said to behave like the russian president 's spokesman .
it 's an embarrassment when schröder patronizingly charges that public discussion of russia here in germany is " marked by anti-russia reflexes . " of course schröder can call for closer german-russian cooperation .
it 's certainly legitimate to defend energy exporter russia when it 's accused of hypocrisy or becomes the subject of unfair criticism : criticizing russia while assiduously overlooking the political situation in other oil states , such as saudi arabia , iran , nigeria , libya or algeria is reckless . and no one seriously denies moscow 's right to demand market prices for energy from its onetime allies either . sure enough , for schröder , russia 's questionable actions in the most recent natural gas and oil disputes are n't an issue .
why does n't " gerd " recommend more sovereignty in foreign and economic policy matters to his dear friend " volodya " ?
why does n't he warn him of behavior that brings russia a massive loss in esteem and only feeds skepticism toward greater energy dependency ?
it 's an embarrassment when friendship on the political stage is confused with one-sided partisanship . it 's downright improper to willfully and deliberately ignore other aspects .
for supervisory board head schröder , issues of democracy , civil society , human rights , the murders of journalists and other kremlin critics and the lack of rule of law are all negligible and hardly worth mentioning .
it 's no wonder then that he gets top marks from the russian side ; the kremlin could hardly hope for a better - and such a prominent - propagandist . it must be a nuisance to chancellor angela merkel , who travels to sochi on sunday .
as president of the eu council , she is striving for a pragmatic , a good relationship to russia .
in contrast to her predecessor , she addresses problems in bilateral relations and beyond . that 's why in sochi she will again tell president vladimir putin that the recent unannounced russian halt to gas deliveries via belarus annoyed the eu and has nothing to do with normal business behavior .
merkel will once more demand moscow be reliable .
she will remind him of the not yet negotiated partnership deal between the european union and russia .
she will stress how important russia is - also for the resolution of international conflicts . merkel apparently does n't think much of absolution : calling putin a " flawless democrat , " as schröder did during his chancellorship , is something she still wo n't do .
the russian president is , after all , far from passing the test . cornelia rabitz is the head of dw-radio 's russian service -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's criticism of russia over energy marks shift in ties chancellor angela merkel 's rebuke of russia over it halting oil supplies to europe has revealed a possible shift in ties between the two countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 20.01.2007 germans at odds over eu 's emissons plans for car industry germans are divided over european union 's plan to impose new limits on carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions for the entire car industry in the 27-member bloc . the 27-member bloc 's environmental commissioner stavros dimas is floating plans for a new industry-wide co2 limit on new vehicles from 2012 , cutting the current voluntary limit of 140 grams per kilometer to an enforced 120 grams . the plans are part of the eu 's strategy to reduce the levels of greenhouse gases created by automotive vehicles on european highways .
its initial strategy of encouraging car companies to enforce their own self-regulated levels of co2 output in their newest vehicles has been inefficient .
few new vehicles on european roads achieve the 140 grams / km limit . germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel told the german parliament this week that the eu must do all it can to bring down the level of carbon dioxide emissions .
he said it was obvious that the policy of self-regulation within the auto industry was not working .
in short , gabriel apparently seemed to support the idea of a regulated and enforced limit . verheugen touts trading scheme bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen is in favor a carbon trading scheme for cars however günter verheugen , gabriel 's compatriot in the eu parliament , was not of the same mind .
the eu industry commissioner rejected the call for a strict limitation on co2 emissions in the car industry and argued that a system similar to that employed by industry where emission credits can be bought and sold . under the bloc 's emissions trading scheme , industries can buy and sell emissions quotas .
if they exceed their limit , they have to buy credits from other companies .
verheugen argued that for some car manufacturers , this would be less expensive than developing emission reduction technologies for their new vehicles by 2012 . " for a manufacturer like porsche , this would always be cheaper than to demand that its cars are developed to reach the emission level of 120 grams , " said verheugen . gabriel skeptical of alternative plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel wants auto firms to cut co2 to eu levels but sigmar gabriel is skeptical as to whether an expansion of the emissions trading scheme to the auto industry was practical . " it is already difficult enough to apply the trading scheme , " he said , and referred to the ongoing disarray within industry itself and the problems experienced while planning a similar scheme in the aviation business . gabriel added that the argument over automotive co2 emissions should be discussed through germany 's eu presidency but added that an agreement should not be rushed to be completed by the end of the six-month role . " this is very ambitious , " he said , adding that the topic required a lot of thought and discussion to find a compromise . he said that consultations with colleagues from the other 26 eu states would begin soon but that finding a common agreement by june would only happen " if things go really well .

" as a result , hrant dink was held in high esteem in various sections of turkish society , as well as in europe . " turkey promises to find murderer the turkish government vowed saturday that it would do " whatever it takes " to find and punish the murderer as it came under fire for failing to protect dink despite nationalist threats .

the agency had earlier said that a total of eight people were questioned . dink , the editor of the bilingual turkish-armenian weekly agos , was shot three times in the head and neck outside the newspaper 's office in downtown istanbul , sending shock waves throughout the country . " we are very close to solving the case .

" dink was convicted under the infamous article 301 of the penal code , which has served as a ground to prosecute a series of other intellectuals , including 2006 nobel literature laureate orhan pamuk , and which the eu has denounced a threat to free speech in the eu-hopeful country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous turkish writer orhan pamuk also faced charges for insulting " turkishness " nationalists had labeled him a " traitor " and dink had spoken of receiving threats and hate mail . despite the controversies , the soft-spoken and often emotional dink had won many hearts in turkey as a sincere activist for turkish-armenian dialogue , who denounced also armenian radicalism and most recently , a french bill in october to jail those who deny that the 1915-17 killings of armenians constituted genocide . he will be laid to rest on tuesday , his colleagues said . " murderer is a traitor " the turkish press piled pressure on the government to solve the murder , condemning it as a " national shame " and lashing out at the authorities for having failed to ensure protection for a man who openly wrote in his articles in agos that he was receiving threats . " not protecting people who are under threat amounts to paving the way for those who want to kill them , " liberal daily radikal wrote . " the murderer is a traitor , " declared mass-circulation hurriyet on its front page saturday , while the popular sabah headlined : " the greatest treason . " the police , reportedly looking for a young man , wearing a denim jacket and a white cap who was seen running from the scene , were examining footage from security cameras of nearby shops . damage to turkey 's image some commentators saw serious implications for turkish foreign policy , with the popular vatan newspaper stressing that armenian campaigns for an international recognition of the 1915-17 massacres as genocide would gain strength .

" they will definitely talk " about energy , merkel 's g8 advisor bernd pfaffenbach , said in an interview with russian daily vedomosti , adding that the row had " damaged russia 's authority . " " we will insist more firmly on the need for russia to be a reliable partner in the long term , " pfaffenbach said .
" we have a particular responsibility on this as president of the european union . " damaged reputation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's decision to stop oil deliveries concerned many across europe last week , merkel , herself , also said russia had damaged its image as a reliable partner by stopping oil deliveries through a main pipeline that runs crosses belarus on the way to eu countries . the german-russian relationship has become less cozy since merkel took over from her predecessor gerhard schröder .
last friday , she stressed she could not describe putin as " a flawless democrat , " as schröder once did . " i have n't said that yet and i 'm not saying that now , " merkel said . merkel has also put a stronger emphasis than schröder on the need for strong european ties to the united states . eu still needs russian energy but eu dependency on russian energy means that links remain pragmatic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in germany prefer nuclear energy to depending on russian gas and oil " this does not mean the german chancellor is negative about russia , " german foreign policy expert alexander rahr wrote in the russian government newspaper rossiiskaya gazeta .
" she still tries to build pragmatic and reliable relations with moscow . " on another important eu-russia trade matter , germany is hoping to clear the way for talks on a russian-eu strategic partnership , which have been blocked by a polish veto linked to a dispute over polish meat imports into russia . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , however , said friday that he was confident poland and russia would find an acceptable compromise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.01.2007 renaming of berlin street reopens old ideological rifts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight goes on a referendum on sunday in berlin will decide whether to name a street after a famous student protest leader of the 1960s .
the issue has polarized opinion and rekindled memories of a turbulent chapter in german history . on sunday , residents of berlin 's friedrichshain-kreuzberg district will go to the polls to settle a simmering controversy over the renaming of a street after rudi dutschke , a protest leader of the 1960s .
the emotive issue has polarized public opinion and brought into focus old political animosities . " germany and berlin need a rudi-dutschke-strasse , because it 's a very important symbol of what we are today and which political stream has made things happen in postwar germany , " said peter unfried , deputy editor-in-chief of left-leaning daily t az who has spearheaded a campaign to rename the street . " what we are today - a freer , more liberal society - is partly due to 1968 and rudi dutschke , " he said . charismatic leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutschke in 1968 during a protest in berlin born in 1940 , dutschke emerged as one of the most charismatic personalities of west germany 's student movement , which pitted children against their parents and anti-communists against leftists in the 1960s . a student of sociology at west berlin 's free university , dutschke was an influential theoretician in left-wing circles and active in organizing street protests - that shook up west german society - against the so-called " establishment . "
the high-profile dutschke was shot and seriously injured in 1968 and moved to london to recover .
years later , he returned to west germany - and life on the political stage .
shortly before his unexpected death in a bathtub in december 1979 - which was thought to have been related to injuries sustained during his shooting - he became actively involved with the ecologically minded greens , who established themselves as a political party three weeks later . right vs. left during the cold war , the greens and the left-wing taz manned the one side of west germany 's ideological battles and the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the right-wing axel springer publishing house the other . axel springer and the taz were n't just political enemies .
they were and still are close neighbors , too .
their offices are located just doors away from each other on kochstrasse -lrb- koch street -rrb- , the street at the center of the renaming fight . it was on this street that angry student protests erupted in 1968 after dutschke was shot and seriously wounded .
students blamed springer 's papers for inflaming public opinion against them and said the man who shot dutschke was influenced by views expressed by springer tabloid bild .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer built the tower block next to the wall as a " beacon of democracy " kochstrasse is something of a showcase of 20th century germany history .
himmler 's gestapo headquarters on wilhelmstrasse was just meters away from the street , at its far western end .
a few blocks to the east , it bisects friedrichstrasse next to what became checkpoint charlie , the us-controlled border crossing to communist east berlin , and remnants of the wall .
the taz is located a few buildings further east . another couple blocks down the road , at the intersection to axel-springer-strasse , stands the tower block the eponymous and powerful publisher built for the berlin office of his hamburg-based company . after naming its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 , the taz started a campaign to rename kochstrasse .
what 's in a name ?
in 2005 , the local assembly in friedrichhain-kreuzberg , dominated by the social democrats and the green party , decided to rename kochstrasse as rudi-dutschke-strasse - to the conservatives ' horror .
" the state should n't honor a person who was in favor of the dissolution of the state , " said timo husein , 26 , head of the cdu 's youth organization in the district .
" he was n't a democrat in a legal sense .
he propagated violence against property .
someone who uses violence to reach his aims is n't an appropriate person to be honored . "
husein said the renaming would mean that the street 's 1,000 residents would have to have their personal id cards changed .
in addition , the area 's estimated 700 businesses , from snack bars to a national insurance company , would have to shell out around 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 450,000 -rrb- to reprint signs , stationary and business cards .
backed by the local cdu , husein 's youth group collected the 10,000 signatures necessary to take the question of renaming the street to the ballot box .
fifteen percent of friedrichshain-kreuzberg 's voters , around 25,000 people , must vote in the referendum sunday to put a stop to the name change .
" a sort of poetic justice " it was a no-brainer for husein 's conservative youth group to take up the fight against dutschke .
" dutschke is naturally an opponent , " he said .
it 's not about changing a law on sales tax , which is rather boring .
it 's really about ideology , about left and right , and the left sees it that way , too . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taz named its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 husein was hopeful dutschke would lose in the referendum , though he admitted it was hard for conservatives to have an effect in the only electoral precinct in germany ever to have directly elected a green candidate to the federal parliament , in 2005 .
" but that 's no reason not to try , " he said .
meanwhile , the taz 's unfried was fairly certain friedrichshain-kreuzberg would go for dutschke .
but whatever the outcome of the poll , he was pleased that the campaign seemed to have raised consciousness of dutschke , a symbol , he said , for fighting for a better society . " not many people know that they changed lindenstrasse to axel-springer-strasse , which not everyone appreciates , especially people on the liberal , progressive side of the spectrum , " unfried said .

the issue has polarized opinion and rekindled memories of a turbulent chapter in german history . on sunday , residents of berlin 's friedrichshain-kreuzberg district will go to the polls to settle a simmering controversy over the renaming of a street after rudi dutschke , a protest leader of the 1960s .
the emotive issue has polarized public opinion and brought into focus old political animosities . " germany and berlin need a rudi-dutschke-strasse , because it 's a very important symbol of what we are today and which political stream has made things happen in postwar germany , " said peter unfried , deputy editor-in-chief of left-leaning daily t az who has spearheaded a campaign to rename the street . " what we are today - a freer , more liberal society - is partly due to 1968 and rudi dutschke , " he said . charismatic leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutschke in 1968 during a protest in berlin born in 1940 , dutschke emerged as one of the most charismatic personalities of west germany 's student movement , which pitted children against their parents and anti-communists against leftists in the 1960s . a student of sociology at west berlin 's free university , dutschke was an influential theoretician in left-wing circles and active in organizing street protests - that shook up west german society - against the so-called " establishment . "
the high-profile dutschke was shot and seriously injured in 1968 and moved to london to recover .
years later , he returned to west germany - and life on the political stage .
shortly before his unexpected death in a bathtub in december 1979 - which was thought to have been related to injuries sustained during his shooting - he became actively involved with the ecologically minded greens , who established themselves as a political party three weeks later . right vs. left during the cold war , the greens and the left-wing taz manned the one side of west germany 's ideological battles and the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the right-wing axel springer publishing house the other . axel springer and the taz were n't just political enemies .
they were and still are close neighbors , too .
their offices are located just doors away from each other on kochstrasse -lrb- koch street -rrb- , the street at the center of the renaming fight . it was on this street that angry student protests erupted in 1968 after dutschke was shot and seriously wounded .
students blamed springer 's papers for inflaming public opinion against them and said the man who shot dutschke was influenced by views expressed by springer tabloid bild .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer built the tower block next to the wall as a " beacon of democracy " kochstrasse is something of a showcase of 20th century germany history .
himmler 's gestapo headquarters on wilhelmstrasse was just meters away from the street , at its far western end .
a few blocks to the east , it bisects friedrichstrasse next to what became checkpoint charlie , the us-controlled border crossing to communist east berlin , and remnants of the wall .
the taz is located a few buildings further east . another couple blocks down the road , at the intersection to axel-springer-strasse , stands the tower block the eponymous and powerful publisher built for the berlin office of his hamburg-based company . after naming its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 , the taz started a campaign to rename kochstrasse .
what 's in a name ?
in 2005 , the local assembly in friedrichhain-kreuzberg , dominated by the social democrats and the green party , decided to rename kochstrasse as rudi-dutschke-strasse - to the conservatives ' horror .
" the state should n't honor a person who was in favor of the dissolution of the state , " said timo husein , 26 , head of the cdu 's youth organization in the district .
" he was n't a democrat in a legal sense .
he propagated violence against property .
someone who uses violence to reach his aims is n't an appropriate person to be honored . "
husein said the renaming would mean that the street 's 1,000 residents would have to have their personal id cards changed .
in addition , the area 's estimated 700 businesses , from snack bars to a national insurance company , would have to shell out around 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 450,000 -rrb- to reprint signs , stationary and business cards .
backed by the local cdu , husein 's youth group collected the 10,000 signatures necessary to take the question of renaming the street to the ballot box .
fifteen percent of friedrichshain-kreuzberg 's voters , around 25,000 people , must vote in the referendum sunday to put a stop to the name change .
" a sort of poetic justice " it was a no-brainer for husein 's conservative youth group to take up the fight against dutschke .
" dutschke is naturally an opponent , " he said .
it 's not about changing a law on sales tax , which is rather boring .
it 's really about ideology , about left and right , and the left sees it that way , too . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taz named its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 husein was hopeful dutschke would lose in the referendum , though he admitted it was hard for conservatives to have an effect in the only electoral precinct in germany ever to have directly elected a green candidate to the federal parliament , in 2005 .
" but that 's no reason not to try , " he said .
meanwhile , the taz 's unfried was fairly certain friedrichshain-kreuzberg would go for dutschke .
but whatever the outcome of the poll , he was pleased that the campaign seemed to have raised consciousness of dutschke , a symbol , he said , for fighting for a better society . " not many people know that they changed lindenstrasse to axel-springer-strasse , which not everyone appreciates , especially people on the liberal , progressive side of the spectrum , " unfried said .

" germany and berlin need a rudi-dutschke-strasse , because it 's a very important symbol of what we are today and which political stream has made things happen in postwar germany , " said peter unfried , deputy editor-in-chief of left-leaning daily t az who has spearheaded a campaign to rename the street . " what we are today - a freer , more liberal society - is partly due to 1968 and rudi dutschke , " he said . charismatic leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutschke in 1968 during a protest in berlin born in 1940 , dutschke emerged as one of the most charismatic personalities of west germany 's student movement , which pitted children against their parents and anti-communists against leftists in the 1960s . a student of sociology at west berlin 's free university , dutschke was an influential theoretician in left-wing circles and active in organizing street protests - that shook up west german society - against the so-called " establishment . "
the high-profile dutschke was shot and seriously injured in 1968 and moved to london to recover .
years later , he returned to west germany - and life on the political stage .
shortly before his unexpected death in a bathtub in december 1979 - which was thought to have been related to injuries sustained during his shooting - he became actively involved with the ecologically minded greens , who established themselves as a political party three weeks later . right vs. left during the cold war , the greens and the left-wing taz manned the one side of west germany 's ideological battles and the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the right-wing axel springer publishing house the other . axel springer and the taz were n't just political enemies .
they were and still are close neighbors , too .
their offices are located just doors away from each other on kochstrasse -lrb- koch street -rrb- , the street at the center of the renaming fight . it was on this street that angry student protests erupted in 1968 after dutschke was shot and seriously wounded .
students blamed springer 's papers for inflaming public opinion against them and said the man who shot dutschke was influenced by views expressed by springer tabloid bild .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer built the tower block next to the wall as a " beacon of democracy " kochstrasse is something of a showcase of 20th century germany history .
himmler 's gestapo headquarters on wilhelmstrasse was just meters away from the street , at its far western end .
a few blocks to the east , it bisects friedrichstrasse next to what became checkpoint charlie , the us-controlled border crossing to communist east berlin , and remnants of the wall .
the taz is located a few buildings further east . another couple blocks down the road , at the intersection to axel-springer-strasse , stands the tower block the eponymous and powerful publisher built for the berlin office of his hamburg-based company . after naming its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 , the taz started a campaign to rename kochstrasse .
what 's in a name ?
in 2005 , the local assembly in friedrichhain-kreuzberg , dominated by the social democrats and the green party , decided to rename kochstrasse as rudi-dutschke-strasse - to the conservatives ' horror .
" the state should n't honor a person who was in favor of the dissolution of the state , " said timo husein , 26 , head of the cdu 's youth organization in the district .
" he was n't a democrat in a legal sense .
he propagated violence against property .
someone who uses violence to reach his aims is n't an appropriate person to be honored . "
husein said the renaming would mean that the street 's 1,000 residents would have to have their personal id cards changed .
in addition , the area 's estimated 700 businesses , from snack bars to a national insurance company , would have to shell out around 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 450,000 -rrb- to reprint signs , stationary and business cards .
backed by the local cdu , husein 's youth group collected the 10,000 signatures necessary to take the question of renaming the street to the ballot box .
fifteen percent of friedrichshain-kreuzberg 's voters , around 25,000 people , must vote in the referendum sunday to put a stop to the name change .
" a sort of poetic justice " it was a no-brainer for husein 's conservative youth group to take up the fight against dutschke .
" dutschke is naturally an opponent , " he said .
it 's not about changing a law on sales tax , which is rather boring .
it 's really about ideology , about left and right , and the left sees it that way , too . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taz named its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 husein was hopeful dutschke would lose in the referendum , though he admitted it was hard for conservatives to have an effect in the only electoral precinct in germany ever to have directly elected a green candidate to the federal parliament , in 2005 .
" but that 's no reason not to try , " he said .
meanwhile , the taz 's unfried was fairly certain friedrichshain-kreuzberg would go for dutschke .
but whatever the outcome of the poll , he was pleased that the campaign seemed to have raised consciousness of dutschke , a symbol , he said , for fighting for a better society . " not many people know that they changed lindenstrasse to axel-springer-strasse , which not everyone appreciates , especially people on the liberal , progressive side of the spectrum , " unfried said .
" it 'll be a sort of poetic justice to have dutschke boulevard with axel springer street .

its initial strategy of encouraging car companies to enforce their own self-regulated levels of co2 output in their newest vehicles has been inefficient .
few new vehicles on european roads achieve the 140 grams / km limit . germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel told the german parliament this week that the eu must do all it can to bring down the level of carbon dioxide emissions .
he said it was obvious that the policy of self-regulation within the auto industry was not working .
in short , gabriel apparently seemed to support the idea of a regulated and enforced limit . verheugen touts trading scheme bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen is in favor a carbon trading scheme for cars however günter verheugen , gabriel 's compatriot in the eu parliament , was not of the same mind .
the eu industry commissioner rejected the call for a strict limitation on co2 emissions in the car industry and argued that a system similar to that employed by industry where emission credits can be bought and sold . under the bloc 's emissions trading scheme , industries can buy and sell emissions quotas .
if they exceed their limit , they have to buy credits from other companies .

his successor , angela merkel has a different approach , which she will make clear to putin when they meet sunday , according to dw 's cornelia rabitz . since his exit from the political stage and his new role as supervisory board chairman of the consortium that plans to build a baltic sea pipeline from russia to germany , former chancellor gerhard schröder has become something of a lobbyist . he seems to be inspired by his mission .
some people even suspect his consistent praise for russia 's policies has become something of a replacement for his politics drug . in a berlin hotel recently , schröder once more gave a packed house a taste of his stance .
but in the meantime his strident defense of russia causes a rather bad aftertaste .
it 's an embarrassment when a former chancellor is said to behave like the russian president 's spokesman .
it 's an embarrassment when schröder patronizingly charges that public discussion of russia here in germany is " marked by anti-russia reflexes . " of course schröder can call for closer german-russian cooperation .
it 's certainly legitimate to defend energy exporter russia when it 's accused of hypocrisy or becomes the subject of unfair criticism : criticizing russia while assiduously overlooking the political situation in other oil states , such as saudi arabia , iran , nigeria , libya or algeria is reckless . and no one seriously denies moscow 's right to demand market prices for energy from its onetime allies either . sure enough , for schröder , russia 's questionable actions in the most recent natural gas and oil disputes are n't an issue .
why does n't " gerd " recommend more sovereignty in foreign and economic policy matters to his dear friend " volodya " ?
why does n't he warn him of behavior that brings russia a massive loss in esteem and only feeds skepticism toward greater energy dependency ?
it 's an embarrassment when friendship on the political stage is confused with one-sided partisanship . it 's downright improper to willfully and deliberately ignore other aspects .
for supervisory board head schröder , issues of democracy , civil society , human rights , the murders of journalists and other kremlin critics and the lack of rule of law are all negligible and hardly worth mentioning .
it 's no wonder then that he gets top marks from the russian side ; the kremlin could hardly hope for a better - and such a prominent - propagandist . it must be a nuisance to chancellor angela merkel , who travels to sochi on sunday .
as president of the eu council , she is striving for a pragmatic , a good relationship to russia .
in contrast to her predecessor , she addresses problems in bilateral relations and beyond . that 's why in sochi she will again tell president vladimir putin that the recent unannounced russian halt to gas deliveries via belarus annoyed the eu and has nothing to do with normal business behavior .
merkel will once more demand moscow be reliable .
she will remind him of the not yet negotiated partnership deal between the european union and russia .
she will stress how important russia is - also for the resolution of international conflicts . merkel apparently does n't think much of absolution : calling putin a " flawless democrat , " as schröder did during his chancellorship , is something she still wo n't do .

his successor , angela merkel has a different approach , which she will make clear to putin when they meet sunday , according to dw 's cornelia rabitz . since his exit from the political stage and his new role as supervisory board chairman of the consortium that plans to build a baltic sea pipeline from russia to germany , former chancellor gerhard schröder has become something of a lobbyist . he seems to be inspired by his mission .
some people even suspect his consistent praise for russia 's policies has become something of a replacement for his politics drug . in a berlin hotel recently , schröder once more gave a packed house a taste of his stance .
but in the meantime his strident defense of russia causes a rather bad aftertaste .
it 's an embarrassment when a former chancellor is said to behave like the russian president 's spokesman .
it 's an embarrassment when schröder patronizingly charges that public discussion of russia here in germany is " marked by anti-russia reflexes . " of course schröder can call for closer german-russian cooperation .
it 's certainly legitimate to defend energy exporter russia when it 's accused of hypocrisy or becomes the subject of unfair criticism : criticizing russia while assiduously overlooking the political situation in other oil states , such as saudi arabia , iran , nigeria , libya or algeria is reckless . and no one seriously denies moscow 's right to demand market prices for energy from its onetime allies either . sure enough , for schröder , russia 's questionable actions in the most recent natural gas and oil disputes are n't an issue .
why does n't " gerd " recommend more sovereignty in foreign and economic policy matters to his dear friend " volodya " ?
why does n't he warn him of behavior that brings russia a massive loss in esteem and only feeds skepticism toward greater energy dependency ?
it 's an embarrassment when friendship on the political stage is confused with one-sided partisanship . it 's downright improper to willfully and deliberately ignore other aspects .
for supervisory board head schröder , issues of democracy , civil society , human rights , the murders of journalists and other kremlin critics and the lack of rule of law are all negligible and hardly worth mentioning .
it 's no wonder then that he gets top marks from the russian side ; the kremlin could hardly hope for a better - and such a prominent - propagandist . it must be a nuisance to chancellor angela merkel , who travels to sochi on sunday .
as president of the eu council , she is striving for a pragmatic , a good relationship to russia .
in contrast to her predecessor , she addresses problems in bilateral relations and beyond . that 's why in sochi she will again tell president vladimir putin that the recent unannounced russian halt to gas deliveries via belarus annoyed the eu and has nothing to do with normal business behavior .
merkel will once more demand moscow be reliable .
she will remind him of the not yet negotiated partnership deal between the european union and russia .
she will stress how important russia is - also for the resolution of international conflicts . merkel apparently does n't think much of absolution : calling putin a " flawless democrat , " as schröder did during his chancellorship , is something she still wo n't do .
the russian president is , after all , far from passing the test . cornelia rabitz is the head of dw-radio 's russian service -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's criticism of russia over energy marks shift in ties chancellor angela merkel 's rebuke of russia over it halting oil supplies to europe has revealed a possible shift in ties between the two countries .

it added that in 2005 the government also hoped to received further information about kurnaz from the american side that would " strengthen the case -lrb- against kurnaz -rrb- for his support of international terrorism . " the allegations have created pressure on german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who at the time was gerhard schröder 's chief of staff and hence in charge of intelligence . does schröder 's government bear responsibility ? the newspaper reported that the german government was informed in 2002 that kurnaz had been physically and psychologically abused in guantanamo .
it added that officials of germany 's bnd federal intelligence service who interrogated kurnaz in cuba in september 2002 had found no evidence linking him to any terrorist activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz during his appearance before a parliamentary investigation committee this week faced with this information , schröder 's social democrat-green party government still tried to block kurnaz ' return to germany after the 2005 federal elections , the paper said . the paper 's allegations were given further weight this week when kurnaz ' lawyer , bernhard docke , told a parliamentary inquiry in berlin that the german foreign ministry only administered kurnaz ' case and was n't proactive in freeing him . docke said he suspected that the government under then-chancellor schröder refused kurnaz entry into germany in the fall of 2002 , when the us originally offered to release him from the prison camp . " until this day i see no real reason why germany , if it had the offer from the us , did n't take it up , " after both sides had established that kurnaz was n't a terror suspect , " docke said .
" if kurnaz would have been german , he would already have been free in fall 2002 , " he said . docke told the parliamentary inquiry that former foreign minister joschka fischer told kurnaz 's mother in a letter that german help was limited because kurnaz had turkish citizenship and the us was only negotiating with the home nations of inmates . foreign minister under pressure the accusations against the former government and in particular the focus on steinmeier 's role sparked a heated debate among german politicians on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has some questions to answers in the kurnaz affair wolfgang neskovic of the opposition left party accused the previous government and steinmeier of " merciless , inhuman cold-bloodedness " in dealing with kurnaz .
neskovic slammed the government 's attempt to block kurnaz 's return to germany as " deeply cynical . " " i do n't think steinmeier will survive this politically , " he added . volker beck , head of the opposition green party which was a coalition partner in the previous government , said that if steinmeier had indeed sanctioned kurnaz spending long unnecessary years at guantanamo bay , the minister " could no longer credibly represent the german government 's human rights and foreign policy . " steinmeier 's spokesman jens plötner however rejected the allegations , pointing out that the parliamentary investigation into the kurnaz case had just begun its work and that it had still to collect much information before conclusions could be drawn from the affair . on friday , two german newspapers reported that the us offer to release kurnaz in 2002 - which was refused by germany - came with several conditions . for one , the us demanded that kurnaz be monitored round the clock in germany so that he would take up any terrorist activity , the bild and stuttgarter nachrichten reported . kurnaz alleges abuse at german and us hands apart from the previous german government 's role in the affair , kurnaz 's case is also being investigated for intelligence and security lapses on the part of german authorities . the inquiry is also investigating whether the questioning of kurnaz in guantanamo by german officials in feb .
2002 was appropriate .
the government at the time condemned the prison camp , yet was unprepared to question kurnaz over indications he may have been involved in a possible islamist terrorist cell in bremen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz has said he was abused by german special-forces soldiers kurnaz this week testified he was arrested on a trip to pakistan in october 2001 and handed over by the authorities to the americans who transferred him to a us prison in kandahar , in afghanistan .
from there he was later moved to guantanamo . kurnaz has alleged that two german special-forces soldiers beat him up while he was detained in kandahar , in afghanistan in 2002 .
prosecutors in germany are already considering filing charges against the two soldiers after kurnaz identified them from photographers . kurnaz , who returned to germany last year , has also testified he was tortured in guantanamo bay . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-born ex-prisoner describes torture at guantanamo bay former guantanamo bay prisoner , german-born turk murat kurnaz told a parliamentary committee he faced torture and other abuse during his four years spent at the us prison in cuba .

experts say political parties are largely to blame for the situation . germany 's first female chancellor angela merkel arguably became the most influential political figure in europe a few weeks ago as her country took over the presidency of both the eu and the g8 .
merkel was also voted the world 's most powerful woman by forbes magazine in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : segolene royal would be france 's first female president , if elected the german head of government is a high-profile example of the success of women in european politics and could soon be followed by segolene royal , who is hoping to become france 's first female president in may . but unlike merkel and other female leaders , many women in european parliaments still owe their mandate to gender quotas .
similar to equal employment quotas , they are designed to boost the number of women in politics and balance out the number of male and female representatives . do quotas work ? the use of gender quotas has been criticized as giving women an unfair advantage over male candidates and can take away a woman 's sense of empowerment that they had earned the position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ratio that 's still reality in some legislatures " this legislation -lrb- gender quotas -rrb- would mean that people would not deserve to be there , but that they are forced there , " said godfrey bloom , a european parliamentarian and member of uk independence party .
" it debases the currency for these poor ladies who can not prove that have earned the position . " but drude dahlerup , a professor of political science at stockholm university and an expert on gender quotas , said measures like quotas are a way to compensate for discrimination against women . " if everything was fair in society , i would n't argue for quotas , but you do n't have equal opportunity in society , " she added . resistance to change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some french parties would rather pay fines than adhere to gender quotas for the national assembly .
dahlerup attributed the unpopularity of quotas in europe to the " notion of liberal democracy . "
she said the quotas are often seen as interfering with the democratic system . she cited france as an example : there must be an equal number of men and women political candidates for national parliamentary elections , or parties must pay a fine .
most of the parties that can afford to pay the fine are choosing to do so rather than have the required number of female candidates . there has also been resistance to have a quota system in italy , where a vote on a so-called " pink quota " was rejected by the italian parliament in april 2006 .
this bill would have meant that one-third of all national election candidates would have to be women , to boost the current 11.5 percent female representation , the forth lowest in the european union . political parties hold the power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to parties to put more women on their ballots dahlerup said the political parties are the " gatekeepers " to the parliament , who have the power to change the gender balances .
this applies to a parliamentary system , not direct democracy which operates in the us and switzerland , which only require one-off majority votes for most of the time . " they -lrb- political parties -rrb- could change political representation tomorrow if they wanted because they control the nomination process , " dahlerup said .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist hrant dink was a critic of turkey 's official line on the massacre of armenians it also said dink , who was gunned down outside the offices of the newspaper he edited in istanbul on friday , was prepared to take great personal risks for his work . " he always strove to present a balanced picture and avoided provoking confrontations .
he staunchly supported the democratic reforms in turkey , " the eu presidency statement said . " as a result , hrant dink was held in high esteem in various sections of turkish society , as well as in europe . " turkey promises to find murderer the turkish government vowed saturday that it would do " whatever it takes " to find and punish the murderer as it came under fire for failing to protect dink despite nationalist threats . " the perpetrators will not escape justice , " prime minister recep tayyip erdogan said at a political function in kizilcahamam , near ankara . " the authorities will do whatever it takes to bring to justice the perpetrator , those who planned the murder or instigated it , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of demonstrators in istanbul protested the killing interior minister abdulkadir aksu , personally overseeing the investigation in istanbul , said all three people detained in connection with friday 's murder had been released , anatolia news agency reported .
the agency had earlier said that a total of eight people were questioned . dink , the editor of the bilingual turkish-armenian weekly agos , was shot three times in the head and neck outside the newspaper 's office in downtown istanbul , sending shock waves throughout the country . " we are very close to solving the case .
we have definitive evidence , " istanbul governor muammer guler told reporters late friday . journalist had received threats dink was one of the taboo-breaking critics of the official line on the mass massacres of armenians under the ottoman empire during world war i and was last year given a suspended six-month jail sentence for insulting " turkishness . " dink was convicted under the infamous article 301 of the penal code , which has served as a ground to prosecute a series of other intellectuals , including 2006 nobel literature laureate orhan pamuk , and which the eu has denounced a threat to free speech in the eu-hopeful country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous turkish writer orhan pamuk also faced charges for insulting " turkishness " nationalists had labeled him a " traitor " and dink had spoken of receiving threats and hate mail . despite the controversies , the soft-spoken and often emotional dink had won many hearts in turkey as a sincere activist for turkish-armenian dialogue , who denounced also armenian radicalism and most recently , a french bill in october to jail those who deny that the 1915-17 killings of armenians constituted genocide . he will be laid to rest on tuesday , his colleagues said . " murderer is a traitor " the turkish press piled pressure on the government to solve the murder , condemning it as a " national shame " and lashing out at the authorities for having failed to ensure protection for a man who openly wrote in his articles in agos that he was receiving threats .

last friday , she stressed she could not describe putin as " a flawless democrat , " as schröder once did . " i have n't said that yet and i 'm not saying that now , " merkel said . merkel has also put a stronger emphasis than schröder on the need for strong european ties to the united states . eu still needs russian energy but eu dependency on russian energy means that links remain pragmatic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in germany prefer nuclear energy to depending on russian gas and oil " this does not mean the german chancellor is negative about russia , " german foreign policy expert alexander rahr wrote in the russian government newspaper rossiiskaya gazeta .
" she still tries to build pragmatic and reliable relations with moscow . " on another important eu-russia trade matter , germany is hoping to clear the way for talks on a russian-eu strategic partnership , which have been blocked by a polish veto linked to a dispute over polish meat imports into russia . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , however , said friday that he was confident poland and russia would find an acceptable compromise .

it added that in 2005 the government also hoped to received further information about kurnaz from the american side that would " strengthen the case -lrb- against kurnaz -rrb- for his support of international terrorism . " the allegations have created pressure on german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who at the time was gerhard schröder 's chief of staff and hence in charge of intelligence . does schröder 's government bear responsibility ? the newspaper reported that the german government was informed in 2002 that kurnaz had been physically and psychologically abused in guantanamo .
it added that officials of germany 's bnd federal intelligence service who interrogated kurnaz in cuba in september 2002 had found no evidence linking him to any terrorist activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz during his appearance before a parliamentary investigation committee this week faced with this information , schröder 's social democrat-green party government still tried to block kurnaz ' return to germany after the 2005 federal elections , the paper said . the paper 's allegations were given further weight this week when kurnaz ' lawyer , bernhard docke , told a parliamentary inquiry in berlin that the german foreign ministry only administered kurnaz ' case and was n't proactive in freeing him . docke said he suspected that the government under then-chancellor schröder refused kurnaz entry into germany in the fall of 2002 , when the us originally offered to release him from the prison camp . " until this day i see no real reason why germany , if it had the offer from the us , did n't take it up , " after both sides had established that kurnaz was n't a terror suspect , " docke said .
" if kurnaz would have been german , he would already have been free in fall 2002 , " he said . docke told the parliamentary inquiry that former foreign minister joschka fischer told kurnaz 's mother in a letter that german help was limited because kurnaz had turkish citizenship and the us was only negotiating with the home nations of inmates . foreign minister under pressure the accusations against the former government and in particular the focus on steinmeier 's role sparked a heated debate among german politicians on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has some questions to answers in the kurnaz affair wolfgang neskovic of the opposition left party accused the previous government and steinmeier of " merciless , inhuman cold-bloodedness " in dealing with kurnaz .
neskovic slammed the government 's attempt to block kurnaz 's return to germany as " deeply cynical . " " i do n't think steinmeier will survive this politically , " he added . volker beck , head of the opposition green party which was a coalition partner in the previous government , said that if steinmeier had indeed sanctioned kurnaz spending long unnecessary years at guantanamo bay , the minister " could no longer credibly represent the german government 's human rights and foreign policy . " steinmeier 's spokesman jens plötner however rejected the allegations , pointing out that the parliamentary investigation into the kurnaz case had just begun its work and that it had still to collect much information before conclusions could be drawn from the affair . on friday , two german newspapers reported that the us offer to release kurnaz in 2002 - which was refused by germany - came with several conditions . for one , the us demanded that kurnaz be monitored round the clock in germany so that he would take up any terrorist activity , the bild and stuttgarter nachrichten reported . kurnaz alleges abuse at german and us hands apart from the previous german government 's role in the affair , kurnaz 's case is also being investigated for intelligence and security lapses on the part of german authorities . the inquiry is also investigating whether the questioning of kurnaz in guantanamo by german officials in feb .
2002 was appropriate .
the government at the time condemned the prison camp , yet was unprepared to question kurnaz over indications he may have been involved in a possible islamist terrorist cell in bremen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz has said he was abused by german special-forces soldiers kurnaz this week testified he was arrested on a trip to pakistan in october 2001 and handed over by the authorities to the americans who transferred him to a us prison in kandahar , in afghanistan .
from there he was later moved to guantanamo . kurnaz has alleged that two german special-forces soldiers beat him up while he was detained in kandahar , in afghanistan in 2002 .
prosecutors in germany are already considering filing charges against the two soldiers after kurnaz identified them from photographers . kurnaz , who returned to germany last year , has also testified he was tortured in guantanamo bay . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-born ex-prisoner describes torture at guantanamo bay former guantanamo bay prisoner , german-born turk murat kurnaz told a parliamentary committee he faced torture and other abuse during his four years spent at the us prison in cuba .

it added that in 2005 the government also hoped to received further information about kurnaz from the american side that would " strengthen the case -lrb- against kurnaz -rrb- for his support of international terrorism . " the allegations have created pressure on german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who at the time was gerhard schröder 's chief of staff and hence in charge of intelligence . does schröder 's government bear responsibility ? the newspaper reported that the german government was informed in 2002 that kurnaz had been physically and psychologically abused in guantanamo .
it added that officials of germany 's bnd federal intelligence service who interrogated kurnaz in cuba in september 2002 had found no evidence linking him to any terrorist activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz during his appearance before a parliamentary investigation committee this week faced with this information , schröder 's social democrat-green party government still tried to block kurnaz ' return to germany after the 2005 federal elections , the paper said . the paper 's allegations were given further weight this week when kurnaz ' lawyer , bernhard docke , told a parliamentary inquiry in berlin that the german foreign ministry only administered kurnaz ' case and was n't proactive in freeing him . docke said he suspected that the government under then-chancellor schröder refused kurnaz entry into germany in the fall of 2002 , when the us originally offered to release him from the prison camp . " until this day i see no real reason why germany , if it had the offer from the us , did n't take it up , " after both sides had established that kurnaz was n't a terror suspect , " docke said .
" if kurnaz would have been german , he would already have been free in fall 2002 , " he said . docke told the parliamentary inquiry that former foreign minister joschka fischer told kurnaz 's mother in a letter that german help was limited because kurnaz had turkish citizenship and the us was only negotiating with the home nations of inmates . foreign minister under pressure the accusations against the former government and in particular the focus on steinmeier 's role sparked a heated debate among german politicians on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has some questions to answers in the kurnaz affair wolfgang neskovic of the opposition left party accused the previous government and steinmeier of " merciless , inhuman cold-bloodedness " in dealing with kurnaz .
neskovic slammed the government 's attempt to block kurnaz 's return to germany as " deeply cynical . " " i do n't think steinmeier will survive this politically , " he added . volker beck , head of the opposition green party which was a coalition partner in the previous government , said that if steinmeier had indeed sanctioned kurnaz spending long unnecessary years at guantanamo bay , the minister " could no longer credibly represent the german government 's human rights and foreign policy . " steinmeier 's spokesman jens plötner however rejected the allegations , pointing out that the parliamentary investigation into the kurnaz case had just begun its work and that it had still to collect much information before conclusions could be drawn from the affair . on friday , two german newspapers reported that the us offer to release kurnaz in 2002 - which was refused by germany - came with several conditions . for one , the us demanded that kurnaz be monitored round the clock in germany so that he would take up any terrorist activity , the bild and stuttgarter nachrichten reported . kurnaz alleges abuse at german and us hands apart from the previous german government 's role in the affair , kurnaz 's case is also being investigated for intelligence and security lapses on the part of german authorities . the inquiry is also investigating whether the questioning of kurnaz in guantanamo by german officials in feb .
2002 was appropriate .
the government at the time condemned the prison camp , yet was unprepared to question kurnaz over indications he may have been involved in a possible islamist terrorist cell in bremen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz has said he was abused by german special-forces soldiers kurnaz this week testified he was arrested on a trip to pakistan in october 2001 and handed over by the authorities to the americans who transferred him to a us prison in kandahar , in afghanistan .
from there he was later moved to guantanamo . kurnaz has alleged that two german special-forces soldiers beat him up while he was detained in kandahar , in afghanistan in 2002 .
prosecutors in germany are already considering filing charges against the two soldiers after kurnaz identified them from photographers . kurnaz , who returned to germany last year , has also testified he was tortured in guantanamo bay . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-born ex-prisoner describes torture at guantanamo bay former guantanamo bay prisoner , german-born turk murat kurnaz told a parliamentary committee he faced torture and other abuse during his four years spent at the us prison in cuba .

his successor , angela merkel has a different approach , which she will make clear to putin when they meet sunday , according to dw 's cornelia rabitz . since his exit from the political stage and his new role as supervisory board chairman of the consortium that plans to build a baltic sea pipeline from russia to germany , former chancellor gerhard schröder has become something of a lobbyist . he seems to be inspired by his mission .
some people even suspect his consistent praise for russia 's policies has become something of a replacement for his politics drug . in a berlin hotel recently , schröder once more gave a packed house a taste of his stance .
but in the meantime his strident defense of russia causes a rather bad aftertaste .
it 's an embarrassment when a former chancellor is said to behave like the russian president 's spokesman .
it 's an embarrassment when schröder patronizingly charges that public discussion of russia here in germany is " marked by anti-russia reflexes . " of course schröder can call for closer german-russian cooperation .
it 's certainly legitimate to defend energy exporter russia when it 's accused of hypocrisy or becomes the subject of unfair criticism : criticizing russia while assiduously overlooking the political situation in other oil states , such as saudi arabia , iran , nigeria , libya or algeria is reckless . and no one seriously denies moscow 's right to demand market prices for energy from its onetime allies either . sure enough , for schröder , russia 's questionable actions in the most recent natural gas and oil disputes are n't an issue .
why does n't " gerd " recommend more sovereignty in foreign and economic policy matters to his dear friend " volodya " ?
why does n't he warn him of behavior that brings russia a massive loss in esteem and only feeds skepticism toward greater energy dependency ?
it 's an embarrassment when friendship on the political stage is confused with one-sided partisanship . it 's downright improper to willfully and deliberately ignore other aspects .
for supervisory board head schröder , issues of democracy , civil society , human rights , the murders of journalists and other kremlin critics and the lack of rule of law are all negligible and hardly worth mentioning .
it 's no wonder then that he gets top marks from the russian side ; the kremlin could hardly hope for a better - and such a prominent - propagandist . it must be a nuisance to chancellor angela merkel , who travels to sochi on sunday .
as president of the eu council , she is striving for a pragmatic , a good relationship to russia .
in contrast to her predecessor , she addresses problems in bilateral relations and beyond . that 's why in sochi she will again tell president vladimir putin that the recent unannounced russian halt to gas deliveries via belarus annoyed the eu and has nothing to do with normal business behavior .
merkel will once more demand moscow be reliable .
she will remind him of the not yet negotiated partnership deal between the european union and russia .
she will stress how important russia is - also for the resolution of international conflicts . merkel apparently does n't think much of absolution : calling putin a " flawless democrat , " as schröder did during his chancellorship , is something she still wo n't do .
the russian president is , after all , far from passing the test . cornelia rabitz is the head of dw-radio 's russian service -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's criticism of russia over energy marks shift in ties chancellor angela merkel 's rebuke of russia over it halting oil supplies to europe has revealed a possible shift in ties between the two countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 20.01.2007 opinion : merkel strikes right note with russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor gerhard schröder is known as a defender of russia .
his successor , angela merkel has a different approach , which she will make clear to putin when they meet sunday , according to dw 's cornelia rabitz . since his exit from the political stage and his new role as supervisory board chairman of the consortium that plans to build a baltic sea pipeline from russia to germany , former chancellor gerhard schröder has become something of a lobbyist . he seems to be inspired by his mission .
some people even suspect his consistent praise for russia 's policies has become something of a replacement for his politics drug . in a berlin hotel recently , schröder once more gave a packed house a taste of his stance .
but in the meantime his strident defense of russia causes a rather bad aftertaste .
it 's an embarrassment when a former chancellor is said to behave like the russian president 's spokesman .

" they will definitely talk " about energy , merkel 's g8 advisor bernd pfaffenbach , said in an interview with russian daily vedomosti , adding that the row had " damaged russia 's authority . " " we will insist more firmly on the need for russia to be a reliable partner in the long term , " pfaffenbach said .
" we have a particular responsibility on this as president of the european union .

last friday , she stressed she could not describe putin as " a flawless democrat , " as schröder once did . " i have n't said that yet and i 'm not saying that now , " merkel said . merkel has also put a stronger emphasis than schröder on the need for strong european ties to the united states . eu still needs russian energy but eu dependency on russian energy means that links remain pragmatic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in germany prefer nuclear energy to depending on russian gas and oil " this does not mean the german chancellor is negative about russia , " german foreign policy expert alexander rahr wrote in the russian government newspaper rossiiskaya gazeta .

" on another important eu-russia trade matter , germany is hoping to clear the way for talks on a russian-eu strategic partnership , which have been blocked by a polish veto linked to a dispute over polish meat imports into russia . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , however , said friday that he was confident poland and russia would find an acceptable compromise .

the issue has polarized opinion and rekindled memories of a turbulent chapter in german history . on sunday , residents of berlin 's friedrichshain-kreuzberg district will go to the polls to settle a simmering controversy over the renaming of a street after rudi dutschke , a protest leader of the 1960s .
the emotive issue has polarized public opinion and brought into focus old political animosities . " germany and berlin need a rudi-dutschke-strasse , because it 's a very important symbol of what we are today and which political stream has made things happen in postwar germany , " said peter unfried , deputy editor-in-chief of left-leaning daily t az who has spearheaded a campaign to rename the street . " what we are today - a freer , more liberal society - is partly due to 1968 and rudi dutschke , " he said . charismatic leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutschke in 1968 during a protest in berlin born in 1940 , dutschke emerged as one of the most charismatic personalities of west germany 's student movement , which pitted children against their parents and anti-communists against leftists in the 1960s . a student of sociology at west berlin 's free university , dutschke was an influential theoretician in left-wing circles and active in organizing street protests - that shook up west german society - against the so-called " establishment . "
the high-profile dutschke was shot and seriously injured in 1968 and moved to london to recover .
years later , he returned to west germany - and life on the political stage .
shortly before his unexpected death in a bathtub in december 1979 - which was thought to have been related to injuries sustained during his shooting - he became actively involved with the ecologically minded greens , who established themselves as a political party three weeks later . right vs. left during the cold war , the greens and the left-wing taz manned the one side of west germany 's ideological battles and the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the right-wing axel springer publishing house the other . axel springer and the taz were n't just political enemies .
they were and still are close neighbors , too .
their offices are located just doors away from each other on kochstrasse -lrb- koch street -rrb- , the street at the center of the renaming fight . it was on this street that angry student protests erupted in 1968 after dutschke was shot and seriously wounded .
students blamed springer 's papers for inflaming public opinion against them and said the man who shot dutschke was influenced by views expressed by springer tabloid bild .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer built the tower block next to the wall as a " beacon of democracy " kochstrasse is something of a showcase of 20th century germany history .
himmler 's gestapo headquarters on wilhelmstrasse was just meters away from the street , at its far western end .
a few blocks to the east , it bisects friedrichstrasse next to what became checkpoint charlie , the us-controlled border crossing to communist east berlin , and remnants of the wall .
the taz is located a few buildings further east . another couple blocks down the road , at the intersection to axel-springer-strasse , stands the tower block the eponymous and powerful publisher built for the berlin office of his hamburg-based company . after naming its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 , the taz started a campaign to rename kochstrasse .
what 's in a name ?
in 2005 , the local assembly in friedrichhain-kreuzberg , dominated by the social democrats and the green party , decided to rename kochstrasse as rudi-dutschke-strasse - to the conservatives ' horror .
" the state should n't honor a person who was in favor of the dissolution of the state , " said timo husein , 26 , head of the cdu 's youth organization in the district .
" he was n't a democrat in a legal sense .
he propagated violence against property .
someone who uses violence to reach his aims is n't an appropriate person to be honored . "
husein said the renaming would mean that the street 's 1,000 residents would have to have their personal id cards changed .
in addition , the area 's estimated 700 businesses , from snack bars to a national insurance company , would have to shell out around 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 450,000 -rrb- to reprint signs , stationary and business cards .
backed by the local cdu , husein 's youth group collected the 10,000 signatures necessary to take the question of renaming the street to the ballot box .
fifteen percent of friedrichshain-kreuzberg 's voters , around 25,000 people , must vote in the referendum sunday to put a stop to the name change .
" a sort of poetic justice " it was a no-brainer for husein 's conservative youth group to take up the fight against dutschke .
" dutschke is naturally an opponent , " he said .
it 's not about changing a law on sales tax , which is rather boring .
it 's really about ideology , about left and right , and the left sees it that way , too . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taz named its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 husein was hopeful dutschke would lose in the referendum , though he admitted it was hard for conservatives to have an effect in the only electoral precinct in germany ever to have directly elected a green candidate to the federal parliament , in 2005 .
" but that 's no reason not to try , " he said .
meanwhile , the taz 's unfried was fairly certain friedrichshain-kreuzberg would go for dutschke .
but whatever the outcome of the poll , he was pleased that the campaign seemed to have raised consciousness of dutschke , a symbol , he said , for fighting for a better society . " not many people know that they changed lindenstrasse to axel-springer-strasse , which not everyone appreciates , especially people on the liberal , progressive side of the spectrum , " unfried said .

the issue has polarized opinion and rekindled memories of a turbulent chapter in german history . on sunday , residents of berlin 's friedrichshain-kreuzberg district will go to the polls to settle a simmering controversy over the renaming of a street after rudi dutschke , a protest leader of the 1960s .
the emotive issue has polarized public opinion and brought into focus old political animosities . " germany and berlin need a rudi-dutschke-strasse , because it 's a very important symbol of what we are today and which political stream has made things happen in postwar germany , " said peter unfried , deputy editor-in-chief of left-leaning daily t az who has spearheaded a campaign to rename the street . " what we are today - a freer , more liberal society - is partly due to 1968 and rudi dutschke , " he said . charismatic leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutschke in 1968 during a protest in berlin born in 1940 , dutschke emerged as one of the most charismatic personalities of west germany 's student movement , which pitted children against their parents and anti-communists against leftists in the 1960s . a student of sociology at west berlin 's free university , dutschke was an influential theoretician in left-wing circles and active in organizing street protests - that shook up west german society - against the so-called " establishment . "
the high-profile dutschke was shot and seriously injured in 1968 and moved to london to recover .
years later , he returned to west germany - and life on the political stage .
shortly before his unexpected death in a bathtub in december 1979 - which was thought to have been related to injuries sustained during his shooting - he became actively involved with the ecologically minded greens , who established themselves as a political party three weeks later . right vs. left during the cold war , the greens and the left-wing taz manned the one side of west germany 's ideological battles and the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the right-wing axel springer publishing house the other . axel springer and the taz were n't just political enemies .
they were and still are close neighbors , too .
their offices are located just doors away from each other on kochstrasse -lrb- koch street -rrb- , the street at the center of the renaming fight . it was on this street that angry student protests erupted in 1968 after dutschke was shot and seriously wounded .
students blamed springer 's papers for inflaming public opinion against them and said the man who shot dutschke was influenced by views expressed by springer tabloid bild .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer built the tower block next to the wall as a " beacon of democracy " kochstrasse is something of a showcase of 20th century germany history .
himmler 's gestapo headquarters on wilhelmstrasse was just meters away from the street , at its far western end .
a few blocks to the east , it bisects friedrichstrasse next to what became checkpoint charlie , the us-controlled border crossing to communist east berlin , and remnants of the wall .
the taz is located a few buildings further east . another couple blocks down the road , at the intersection to axel-springer-strasse , stands the tower block the eponymous and powerful publisher built for the berlin office of his hamburg-based company . after naming its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 , the taz started a campaign to rename kochstrasse .
what 's in a name ?
in 2005 , the local assembly in friedrichhain-kreuzberg , dominated by the social democrats and the green party , decided to rename kochstrasse as rudi-dutschke-strasse - to the conservatives ' horror .
" the state should n't honor a person who was in favor of the dissolution of the state , " said timo husein , 26 , head of the cdu 's youth organization in the district .
" he was n't a democrat in a legal sense .
he propagated violence against property .
someone who uses violence to reach his aims is n't an appropriate person to be honored . "
husein said the renaming would mean that the street 's 1,000 residents would have to have their personal id cards changed .
in addition , the area 's estimated 700 businesses , from snack bars to a national insurance company , would have to shell out around 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 450,000 -rrb- to reprint signs , stationary and business cards .
backed by the local cdu , husein 's youth group collected the 10,000 signatures necessary to take the question of renaming the street to the ballot box .
fifteen percent of friedrichshain-kreuzberg 's voters , around 25,000 people , must vote in the referendum sunday to put a stop to the name change .
" a sort of poetic justice " it was a no-brainer for husein 's conservative youth group to take up the fight against dutschke .
" dutschke is naturally an opponent , " he said .
it 's not about changing a law on sales tax , which is rather boring .
it 's really about ideology , about left and right , and the left sees it that way , too . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taz named its building rudi dutschke house in 1993 husein was hopeful dutschke would lose in the referendum , though he admitted it was hard for conservatives to have an effect in the only electoral precinct in germany ever to have directly elected a green candidate to the federal parliament , in 2005 .
" but that 's no reason not to try , " he said .
meanwhile , the taz 's unfried was fairly certain friedrichshain-kreuzberg would go for dutschke .
but whatever the outcome of the poll , he was pleased that the campaign seemed to have raised consciousness of dutschke , a symbol , he said , for fighting for a better society . " not many people know that they changed lindenstrasse to axel-springer-strasse , which not everyone appreciates , especially people on the liberal , progressive side of the spectrum , " unfried said .

its initial strategy of encouraging car companies to enforce their own self-regulated levels of co2 output in their newest vehicles has been inefficient .
few new vehicles on european roads achieve the 140 grams / km limit . germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel told the german parliament this week that the eu must do all it can to bring down the level of carbon dioxide emissions .
he said it was obvious that the policy of self-regulation within the auto industry was not working .
in short , gabriel apparently seemed to support the idea of a regulated and enforced limit . verheugen touts trading scheme bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verheugen is in favor a carbon trading scheme for cars however günter verheugen , gabriel 's compatriot in the eu parliament , was not of the same mind .
the eu industry commissioner rejected the call for a strict limitation on co2 emissions in the car industry and argued that a system similar to that employed by industry where emission credits can be bought and sold . under the bloc 's emissions trading scheme , industries can buy and sell emissions quotas .

its initial strategy of encouraging car companies to enforce their own self-regulated levels of co2 output in their newest vehicles has been inefficient .
few new vehicles on european roads achieve the 140 grams / km limit . germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel told the german parliament this week that the eu must do all it can to bring down the level of carbon dioxide emissions .

experts say political parties are largely to blame for the situation . germany 's first female chancellor angela merkel arguably became the most influential political figure in europe a few weeks ago as her country took over the presidency of both the eu and the g8 .
merkel was also voted the world 's most powerful woman by forbes magazine in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : segolene royal would be france 's first female president , if elected the german head of government is a high-profile example of the success of women in european politics and could soon be followed by segolene royal , who is hoping to become france 's first female president in may . but unlike merkel and other female leaders , many women in european parliaments still owe their mandate to gender quotas .
similar to equal employment quotas , they are designed to boost the number of women in politics and balance out the number of male and female representatives . do quotas work ? the use of gender quotas has been criticized as giving women an unfair advantage over male candidates and can take away a woman 's sense of empowerment that they had earned the position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ratio that 's still reality in some legislatures " this legislation -lrb- gender quotas -rrb- would mean that people would not deserve to be there , but that they are forced there , " said godfrey bloom , a european parliamentarian and member of uk independence party .

" but drude dahlerup , a professor of political science at stockholm university and an expert on gender quotas , said measures like quotas are a way to compensate for discrimination against women . " if everything was fair in society , i would n't argue for quotas , but you do n't have equal opportunity in society , " she added . resistance to change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some french parties would rather pay fines than adhere to gender quotas for the national assembly .
dahlerup attributed the unpopularity of quotas in europe to the " notion of liberal democracy . "
she said the quotas are often seen as interfering with the democratic system . she cited france as an example : there must be an equal number of men and women political candidates for national parliamentary elections , or parties must pay a fine .
most of the parties that can afford to pay the fine are choosing to do so rather than have the required number of female candidates . there has also been resistance to have a quota system in italy , where a vote on a so-called " pink quota " was rejected by the italian parliament in april 2006 .
this bill would have meant that one-third of all national election candidates would have to be women , to boost the current 11.5 percent female representation , the forth lowest in the european union . political parties hold the power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to parties to put more women on their ballots dahlerup said the political parties are the " gatekeepers " to the parliament , who have the power to change the gender balances .
this applies to a parliamentary system , not direct democracy which operates in the us and switzerland , which only require one-off majority votes for most of the time . " they -lrb- political parties -rrb- could change political representation tomorrow if they wanted because they control the nomination process , " dahlerup said .

experts say political parties are largely to blame for the situation . germany 's first female chancellor angela merkel arguably became the most influential political figure in europe a few weeks ago as her country took over the presidency of both the eu and the g8 .
merkel was also voted the world 's most powerful woman by forbes magazine in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : segolene royal would be france 's first female president , if elected the german head of government is a high-profile example of the success of women in european politics and could soon be followed by segolene royal , who is hoping to become france 's first female president in may . but unlike merkel and other female leaders , many women in european parliaments still owe their mandate to gender quotas .
similar to equal employment quotas , they are designed to boost the number of women in politics and balance out the number of male and female representatives . do quotas work ? the use of gender quotas has been criticized as giving women an unfair advantage over male candidates and can take away a woman 's sense of empowerment that they had earned the position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ratio that 's still reality in some legislatures " this legislation -lrb- gender quotas -rrb- would mean that people would not deserve to be there , but that they are forced there , " said godfrey bloom , a european parliamentarian and member of uk independence party .

dahlerup attributed the unpopularity of quotas in europe to the " notion of liberal democracy . "
she said the quotas are often seen as interfering with the democratic system . she cited france as an example : there must be an equal number of men and women political candidates for national parliamentary elections , or parties must pay a fine .
most of the parties that can afford to pay the fine are choosing to do so rather than have the required number of female candidates . there has also been resistance to have a quota system in italy , where a vote on a so-called " pink quota " was rejected by the italian parliament in april 2006 .
this bill would have meant that one-third of all national election candidates would have to be women , to boost the current 11.5 percent female representation , the forth lowest in the european union . political parties hold the power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to parties to put more women on their ballots dahlerup said the political parties are the " gatekeepers " to the parliament , who have the power to change the gender balances .

khaddafy janjalani , head of abu sayyaf , was on a us terrorist list and wanted for killings , bombings and kidnappings .
officials believe he was killed in clashes with troops in september 2006 .
the news comes a few days after troops killed another senior abu sayyaf leader , abu sulaiman , in a gun battle on the southern island of jolo .
it was in a remote part of the jungles of jolo , near the town of patikul , that janjalani 's remains were found in december 2006 .
the philippine army said captured rebels had led them to the grave .
the captives said mr janjalani had been shot in the neck in an exchange with marines .
scientists took tissue samples from his body which were compared at an fbi laboratory in the us with dna samples taken from his brother hector , who is currently in jail .
abu sayyaf is the smallest of four muslim rebel groups in the philippines , with about 400 members .
it is blamed for kidnappings and bombings , including an attack on a ferry in 2004 that killed more than 100 people .
janjalani is the younger brother of abu sayyaf founder abdurajak abubakar janjalani , and took over as leader following his death in 1998 .
military crackdown this week philippines officials announced that another key abu sayyaf member had been killed in a gun battle .
abu sulaiman , also known as jainal antal sali , was fatally wounded in a clash with soldiers on the southern island of jolo , the army 's chief said .
captured rebels led troops to the remote jungle grave sulaiman had a $ 5m bounty placed on his head by the us , in part for the 2001 abduction of a group of tourists on the island of palawan .
the kidnapping resulted in the deaths of two americans and several others .
sulaiman is also believed to have been involved in the bombing of a passenger ferry in the central philippines in 2004 , which killed at least 100 people .
philippine troops backed by the us began an offensive on jolo in august last year , in an attempt to capture mr janjalani and indonesian terrorism suspects dulmatin and umar patek , who are thought to be in the region .

khaddafy janjalani , head of abu sayyaf , was on a us terrorist list and wanted for killings , bombings and kidnappings .
officials believe he was killed in clashes with troops in september 2006 .
the news comes a few days after troops killed another senior abu sayyaf leader , abu sulaiman , in a gun battle on the southern island of jolo .
it was in a remote part of the jungles of jolo , near the town of patikul , that janjalani 's remains were found in december 2006 .
the philippine army said captured rebels had led them to the grave .
the captives said mr janjalani had been shot in the neck in an exchange with marines .
scientists took tissue samples from his body which were compared at an fbi laboratory in the us with dna samples taken from his brother hector , who is currently in jail .
abu sayyaf is the smallest of four muslim rebel groups in the philippines , with about 400 members .
it is blamed for kidnappings and bombings , including an attack on a ferry in 2004 that killed more than 100 people .
janjalani is the younger brother of abu sayyaf founder abdurajak abubakar janjalani , and took over as leader following his death in 1998 .
military crackdown this week philippines officials announced that another key abu sayyaf member had been killed in a gun battle .
abu sulaiman , also known as jainal antal sali , was fatally wounded in a clash with soldiers on the southern island of jolo , the army 's chief said .
captured rebels led troops to the remote jungle grave sulaiman had a $ 5m bounty placed on his head by the us , in part for the 2001 abduction of a group of tourists on the island of palawan .
the kidnapping resulted in the deaths of two americans and several others .
sulaiman is also believed to have been involved in the bombing of a passenger ferry in the central philippines in 2004 , which killed at least 100 people .
philippine troops backed by the us began an offensive on jolo in august last year , in an attempt to capture mr janjalani and indonesian terrorism suspects dulmatin and umar patek , who are thought to be in the region .

the biometric data , part of security arrangements for visiting the us , was collected in cardiff by embassy staff , saving the orchestra travelling costs .
the 100-strong concert party faced a £ 10,000 bill if they had all gone to london to meet work visa requirements .
the embassy said its cardiff experience would help it develop the technology .

mr jenkins said the operation had cut his costs by about £ 10,000 and he was already taking calls from counterparts across europe to find out how it worked .
he said : " they saw us as guinea pigs to try out this new system .
" the embassy was disappointed at the initial visit when their software failed , but pulled all the stops out to make sure the return visit ran smoothly and without mishap . "

the daily telegraph reported the break to klosters was cancelled before he was criticised last week over plans to fly to the us for an environmental award .
the prince has described climate change as the " biggest threat to mankind " and pledged to fight pollution .
clarence house said it would not comment about holidays - it is thought the trip will not be rescheduled .
' heavy award ? '
the prince is due to fly to new york later this month to pick up the global environmental citizen prize .
the taxpayer-funded £ 116,000 trip , for a 20-strong entourage , was criticised by environment secretary david miliband , who called for the award to be accepted via video link .
he added : " was it a particularly heavy award ? "
one member of the commons public accounts committee called for an investigation into the cost of the trip by the national audit office .
labour mp ian davidson said : " -lsb- prince charles -rsb- seems to be travelling yet again on an international flight to collect a green award and padding out his programme with other events to justify the expense and extravagance of another foreign journey .
" this does not sit well with the green image that the prince is trying to project . "
last year , the prince urged uk industry to reduce carbon emissions , calling climate change " the number one risk in the world , ahead of terrorism and demographic change " .

more than 80,000 people have gathered to address a wide spectrum of social problems facing the world , including a focus on african issues .
set up in 2001 as a rival to the world economic forum , the forum will cover hiv / aids , the landless and migration .
it will also emphasise the struggles faced by deprived africans .
former zambian president kenneth kaunda waved the march off in kibera , africa 's largest slum , at the start of a route into central nairobi .
trade debate the world social forum describes itself as a platform for ordinary people to exchange ideas opposed to a world dominated by capitalism and imperialism .
in keeping with an organisation opposed to prescriptive solutions to the challenges facing the world , the multitude of meetings and activities are what is called " self-organised " .
among the pressing issues to be discussed are economic partnership agreements -lrb- epas -rrb- currently being negotiated between the european union and countries in africa , the caribbean and pacific regions .
intended to free up trade , many attending the forum believe the epas will penalise developing nations by requiring them to open up their markets to unfair foreign competition .

goody , 25 , was up against bollywood star shilpa shetty , who had been the target of the alleged abuse from goody and others in the reality tv show .
almost nine million people watched goody being interviewed by host davina mccall , according to overnight ratings .
goody said her behaviour was " nasty " adding : " i 'm not racist , but i can see why it has had the impact it 's had . "
on seeing clips from the show , she said : " i look like one of those people i do n't like . "
i apologise to anyone i offended jade goody instead of emerging from the house to the usual crowd , goody was taken straight to a studio for the interview .
she looked shocked when mccall showed her tv news headlines - revealing that goody 's comments and behaviour had become the subject of questions in the house of commons and public debate in india .
she was silent for a few seconds before saying : " that 's intense . "
goody , who received 82 % of the total votes cast , added : " i apologise to anyone i offended . "
goody , who rose to fame in the non-celebrity version of big brother in 2002 , already had an inkling there had been a furore around her alleged racist comments before leaving the house .
she made up with shetty before the eviction , with shetty saying she did not believe goody was racist .
about 40,000 viewers have complained about the show viewers have accused goody , as well as former s club 7 singer jo o 'meara , model danielle lloyd and goody 's boyfriend jack tweed , of bullying shetty .
comments have included goody calling shetty " shilpa poppadom " .
goody insisted on the show that she " did n't say shilpa poppadom in a racial way " and that she did not judge people " by the colour of their skin " .
goody told mccall : " i can see why it looks like bullying .
" i 'm disgusted in myself for saying what i have just seen myself saying .
i do not approve of any of my actions and i do not approve of the words that came out of my mouth . "
it was a straightforward contest between shilpa and jade , between good and bad shetty family spokesman the audience for friday 's coverage peaked at 8.8 million between 2245 and 2300 gmt , according to the unofficial overnight figures .
the entire show averaged 7.8 million .

on saturday , london mayor ken livingstone told bbc radio 4 's today programme he was " delighted " at her eviction .
" i think everyone is delighted that we got the result we did last night , " he said .
" otherwise the image of britain across india , which is the second-biggest investor in london after america now , would have been really damaged and it would have done a lot of harm to people 's jobs . "
a spokesman for shetty 's family said : " this vote has shown that goodness always prevails , like in bollywood films .
i have heard worse so called abuse on playgrounds and in internet chat rooms - all it helped was the ratings for a very tired programme julie , hereford have your say on celebrity big brother " this vote was not about just one contestant facing eviction , " dale bhagwagar told the agence france-presse news agency .
" it was a straightforward contest between shilpa and jade , between good and bad . "
earlier , shetty was asked by big brother whether she felt her argument with jade was racially motivated .
but shetty said : " i think it 's a sequence of events that created that misunderstanding and made me believe for maybe a fraction of a second that i thought she was being racist .
" but i do n't think so today , in hindsight , that she was being racist . "
the furore saw politicians including tony blair , gordon brown and david cameron drawn into the row , while more than 50 mps have signed a motion condemning the programme .
but channel 4 has continued to stand by it .
tv watchdog ofcom has now had about 40,000 complaints and sponsor carphone warehouse has suspended its affiliation with the show .
