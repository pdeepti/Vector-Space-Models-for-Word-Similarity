germany 's leading mass-market newspaper has joined the country 's major environment organizations in a nationwide campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . the campaign was launched this week and comes under the heading " save our earth . "
it is to be directed towards the readers of the bild newspaper , the daily with europe 's largest circulation , by way of articles and competitions to be held throughout the rest of the year . the organizers are aiming to change attitudes more than really make a substantial dent in germany 's climate-changing co2 emissions , partially by calling on readers to make their own private contributions to cutting greenhouse gas emissions . it 's a switch for the bild , which is n't known as the standard bearer of the environmentalist movement 's messages . advocates for german car industry in the past , the paper has waged campaigns against the introduction of ecology taxes on fuels and energy as well as fiercely defended germany 's automotive culture of no speed limits and powerful cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bild has n't always been concerned with cutting greenhouse gas emissions ?
anybody can makes mistakes , though , said gerhard timm from the german branch of friends of the earth -lrb- bund -rrb- , adding that the unusual alliance is not a gimmick by the tabloid to boost sales by riding the current wave of " save the planet " sentiments . " anybody can change his mind , and it 's my impression that bild has finally realized that climate change is really an important and crucial issue for mankind , " timm said . over the past few weeks , the newspaper has been running headlines along the lines of " our planet is dying " and " only 13 years left to change the world . " the paper has also highlighted the findings of the recent united nations ' scientific reports on climate change . journalists , readers need to do their part now , bild has called on its 12 million daily readers to make their own personal contributions to cutting germany 's co2 emissions . the aim is to save 3.5 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the year - a figure equivalent to the 3.5 million bild newspapers printed every day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can a newspaper convince readers to turn of the lights when they 're not home ?
florian von heintze , who is in charge of the campaign at the newspaper , admitted that the environmental organizations ' expertise and credibility are needed to make the campaign a success . " unusual circumstances require unusual measures , " heintze said . heintze said the partnership with the environmental groups evolved as a result of readers ' heightened interest in environmental issues , which led bild ' s journalists to do more than just write about climate change . heintze said the paper and its readers " share a common goal , which is to save our earth . " germans worried about climate change the campaign will be falling on fertile ground since 98 percent of germans say climate change is something to worry about . bild is planning to start a competition , in which readers can submit their stories about how they have saved energy .
the organizers said they might also crown a kind of climate king or queen . in a series of articles , the paper plans to give readers tips about how they can protect the climate - little things that can make a difference nonetheless , timm said . " in the traffic sector , you can reduce co2 emissions by turning off the engine at red lights , " he said .
" at home , you can switch off electrical devices and stop using the ' stand-by ' mode . " the campaign organizers said they are aware that reducing co2 emissions by 3.5 million tons does n't really compare with germany 's overall annual emissions of more than a billion tons . yet the mass-selling tabloid has a reputation for being able to change popular moods swiftly - so germany 's environmentalists hope the campaign will put added pressure on politicians , which could lead to a change in industry where it really matters , they said . uwe hessler -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : climate change poses serious challenge for europe the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that the world 's poorest countries will be affected most by climate change .

" when i see and hear all the reports on the news about virginia tech , everything from five years ago comes flooding back , " said christiane alt , the principal of erfurt 's gutenberg gymnasium , the school where 16 people were killed by a 19-year-old student who then took his own life . christian drechsel , a pupil at the erfurt school at the time of the shooting , said he can understand how the virginia tech students must be feeling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one mourner asked " why ? " in erfurt years ago " i know the feelings of the people , and if a group of people experience the same tragedy , it kind pulls people together as if they were a family , " drechsel said . " you get closer to people because they feel the same way you feel , " he added .
" if you look in their eyes you will see the same feelings you feel . " reliving the horror some of the gutenberg gymnasium pupils who lived through the massacre are still undergoing psychological treatment . " the people i 'm helping now who experienced the massacre sought psychological help very late , " said psychologist alina wilms .
" they first tried to deal with the situation on their own and at some point realized that just does n't work . " wilms also said that seeing reports of the virginia tech massacre sometimes cause victims or eyewitnesses to relive their own trauma again . calls for tighter gun controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five years ago : erfurt in grief as virginia tech students begin and the people of erfurt continue to deal with their shock , a political debate about tighter gun control law has reignited . drechsel , however , said he believes such incidents are the result of social problems rather than the availability of guns . " these people have problems , and if they are not helped , such things will happen again in america , and again in germany , " drechsel said . in comparison to the united states , germany had strict gun laws even before the erfurt shooting . in germany , all firearms must be marked and registered .
fully automatic weapons are banned , and people wanting to buy a hunting rifle must undergo background checks that can take up to a year . in virginia , although guns are widely available , they are banned on any university campus . criminals , not guns , kill people german gun lobbyist joachim streitburger said it 's people who are dangerous , not guns . " the legal gun owner is not a problem for public safety , " said streitburger .
" it 's the illegally held gun that is . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : virginia tech students are trying to terms with the killings of all the gun crimes in germany , less than 1 percent involve a legally owned gun . streitberger , from a group called " forum waffenrecht " -lrb- forum for weapons rights -rrb- , said that when a shocking killing spree takes place , politicians always leap on the issue of tighter gun controls . " after the shooting in erfurt , one proposal was that we have to prohibit every pump action gun , " said streitburger .
" the fact is that the guy who did the shooting at erfurt did n't even use the pump gun ; he had one with him but he did n't use it . " targeting legal weapons , however , wo n't stop further attacks from criminals , he added . streitburger 's arguments are in line with those of the us gun lobby , which say that to eradicate firearms completely punishes law-abiding citizens not those who break the law . as ceremonies for the victims of the virginia shooting continue in the united states , officials at the erfurt school have said a memorial service is planned for april 26 to commemorate those killed in 2002 . zoie jones -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe offers condolences for us university shooting victims the deadliest shooting rampage in us history , which left 32 dead at an american university , sent shudders around the world tuesday , setting off shock and sympathy along with questions over gun control in the usa .

" we are grateful to all of the uefa executive council members for their decision to accord us the right to host the european championship , " surkis told ukrainian television . " i promise that we will do our best to hold the championship at the highest possible level , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy at the world cup in germany last year in warsaw , football fans and officials who gathered in the city center to watch the announcement on a giant television screen burst into applause and chants . " it will be our chance to show we are capable of organizing large sports events like world championships or even the olympics , " said przemyslaw gosiewski , an aide to polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . " this is our passport to enter the club of elite countries , " he added . giving eastern countries a chance in rome , the reaction was much more muted , with italian sports minister giovanna melandri saying the decision had been mainly a political one . " they wanted to open up the finals to former eastern bloc countries who are striving to fully join the european scene , " she said .
" we just have to accept it in the name of sports and now try to win on the field . " the 2012 finals will once again feature 16 teams despite uefa examining a proposal to extend it to 24 countries . greece are the current european champions having won the title in lisbon in 2004 .

" we are grateful to all of the uefa executive council members for their decision to accord us the right to host the european championship , " surkis told ukrainian television . " i promise that we will do our best to hold the championship at the highest possible level , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy at the world cup in germany last year in warsaw , football fans and officials who gathered in the city center to watch the announcement on a giant television screen burst into applause and chants .

" would it be right to say : i would rather let 10 attacks take place than try to hinder someone who perhaps does n't want to carry out an attack ? " the conservative christian democratic politician asked .
" my view is that that would be wrong . " rolf stegner , the interior minister of germany 's northernmost state , schleswig-holstein , slammed schäuble 's comments . " this suggestion is entirely out of the question , " the social democrat said , calling on schäuble not to lose track of germany 's constitution when it came to security policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble schäuble was " operating far beyond the constitution if he wanted to suspend the assumption of suspects ' innocence , " green party co-chair claudia roth said .
disagreement over scope earlier in the day , germany 's federal cabinet agreed on a bill requiring all data concerning telephone and internet connections to be saved for at least six months .
the legislation , which must now be put to the bundestag for approval , stemmed from a european union directive that all bloc members were obliged to render into national law . schäuble , however , caused discord within the governing coalition by calling for the police to be given access to digitalized fingerprints and photographs which will be used to issue electronic passports to german citizens .
" all the experts say that it 's not a matter of whether the next attack will take place , but rather a matter of when , " he told stern .
he has also said that security officials should be allowed to carry out secret online searches of private computers .
not part of plans justice minister brigitte zypries , a social democrat , rejected schäuble 's suggestion to save millions of sets of fingerprints .

" the problematic issues are mostly political .
we can not cling to them and remain at a standstill , " gul told a press conference .
" when the political problems are one day resolved , we will meet with the eu and it will take us half an hour to open and close those chapters . " candidates for membership are required to adopt eu norms in 35 policy areas .
turkey can not officially close talks in any of the chapters until the cyprus dispute is resolved . eu welcomes turkish course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan met with merkel at the hanover trade fair this week " this is , of course , very much welcomed by the european commission ... and this is what is actually expected from any candidate country , " an eu spokeswoman on enlargement issues told reporters tuesday . she said , however , that it was too early for the eu 's executive body to comment on the content of the plan - essentially a program of technical reforms and a timetable for turkey to achieve them by 2013 . the spokeswoman also noted that the speed at which turkey undertakes reform would dictate how soon it joins europe 's rich club . turkey 's eu membership talks , which began in october 2005 and have been plagued with difficulties , are expected to last at least a decade , and ankara has been given no guarantee that it will even be allowed in at the end . many member nations are wary of inviting in a huge , relatively poor and mainly-muslim state which would , under eu rules , receive voting rights similar to major powers like britain or italy . aligning with eu standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , left , outlined his plan for turkey 's membership talks ending a long hiatus in the talks , the eu last month began negotiations with turkey on " enterprise and industry policy , " only the second chapter ankara has managed to open since " science and research " in june 2006 .

" the reforms will facilitate our negotiating process on the one hand and , on the other , raise standards in many aspects of our daily lives . " the program outlines a timetable for completing legislative amendments and other legal regulations by 2013 to align with eu standards in areas ranging from transport and food safety to customs , competition policies and the environment . turkey 's chief negotiator in the accession talks , economy minister ali babacan , said the timetable concerned only the completion of legislative work and did not include target dates for their implementation , which would be decided later on a case-by-case basis . the program will require parliament to enact about 200 pieces of legislation plus some 400 other regulations to be issued by the government , he said . turkey committed to continuing political reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : article 301 has resulted in the prosecution of intellectuals " political reforms will also continue , " babacan added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.04.2007 " germans and their politicians badly need a course correction " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desireé nick has figured out how to combine work , family and glamour as germans discuss increasing childcare opportunities and women in the workforce , german performer désirée nick taks to dw-world.de about motherhood and climbing the career ladder in high heels . german family minister ursula von der leyen has pushed through a plan to increase the country 's childcare provision .
the aim is to make it easier for mothers to go back to work .
germany is trying to reverse a falling birth rate and it 's thought if women can find a way to successfully balance career and children , they will opt to have more kids . but the plan has met with criticism , especially from conservative circles , who say that mothers should be at home with the kids , not leaving them in childcare while they move up the career ladder . désirée nick is a german entertainer , cabaret artist and author who has never been shy about expressing her opinion .
dw-world.de asked her where she stood on the topic of the role of women , and mothers , in germany . dw-world.de : désirée nick , what do you think of current attitudes for women and motherhood in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : désirée nick says germans are n't that crazy about kids désirée nick : i think it 's sick that the whole subject is being treated as it is .
of course a woman has the same right to develop her talents , abilities and possibilities just like a man does .
those who have a calling or a mission that will give their life form , who want to be independent and take advantage of everything life has to offer should n't be deprived of the right to raise children at the same time .
in germany , that is unfortunately the case .
children are presented as something bad .
in media reports , in politics , the fact that a woman has children and works is raised to the level of high drama .
how sick is that ? children have to orient themselves to the lives of their parents .
they have to be integrated into the working world of their parents .
it 's well known that the early socialization of children with others in their same age group has more benefits than time spent with mommy in between the ironing board and the washing machine . where does this image or idea come from ? oh , it 's just german .
the germans love panic and drama .
i think it 's sick that the whole subject of children is handled the way it is .
children are seen as something negative .
help !
i 'm going to have a child .
what 's going to happen to me ? !
i think such an attitude is completely on the wrong track .
the germans and their politicians badly need a course correction . the family minister , ursula von der leyen , wants to triple the number of childcare spots available so that mothers will have an easier time reentering the work force .
how do you explain the intense criticism of the plan from some quarters , particularly from more conservative ones ? i think we need to create possibilities for everything .
homosexuals and lesbians should be able to marry , because love does n't happen often enough in life .
if two people find each other , even if they are two men , they should be able to marry .
that does n't mean that i , who perhaps lives outside this milieu , also have to marry .
but the opportunity should be there . if the number of childcare spots is tripled , that does n't mean that the housewife and mother who does n't have to work will be forced to get a job .
but for those women who want to work , or who have to work , the childcare spots need to be there .
the biggest scandal of all , which is not even being discussed , is that childcare expenses are n't tax deductible .
i find that absolutely inexcusable . one german bishop who was critical of the plan said it would reduce women to the status of " birthing machines . " that 's also german , simply sick .
i 'm no friend of the germans , i have to be very clear .
i 'm a cosmopolitan , and i think after reunification , many more things should have been learned from east germany .
it was n't all bad back then .
of course , it was a horrible system , but parts of that country 's policies regarding children were positive .
they made it easy for women to go back to work after having children .
this new reunified federal republic should have incorporated some of those east german aspects .
all the things that one needs for a life that is worthwhile - a roof over your head , childcare , food , health care - all of that was taken care of in the gdr .
it 's also that way in the scandinavian countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evidently nick is no stranger to housework in germany today , these things are not being discussed .
here people say the germans are dying out , which also causes panic , but they are n't saying that because they love children .
they 're saying that because they 're afraid of not getting their pensions when they retire .
in places where children are really loved , for example , jamaica or rio , places marked by poverty , the financial situation of parents is no argument for severely limiting the number of kids you have .
germans are doing better than ever , and the better they live , the fewer children they have and the more egocentric they become . you have written a book , entitled " eva go home , " that refutes the thesis put forward by eva hermann in her own book that basically says a woman 's place is in the home .
why did you feel it necessary to write that book ? because ms. hermann 's opinion was played up throughout the media for three months .

but if you learn an instrument , a sport , do you want to be comfortable or do you want to be successful .
it 's not possible to have it both ways .
if you want something in this life , a little quality of life , you have to work for it .

the aim is to make it easier for mothers to go back to work .
germany is trying to reverse a falling birth rate and it 's thought if women can find a way to successfully balance career and children , they will opt to have more kids . but the plan has met with criticism , especially from conservative circles , who say that mothers should be at home with the kids , not leaving them in childcare while they move up the career ladder . désirée nick is a german entertainer , cabaret artist and author who has never been shy about expressing her opinion .
dw-world.de asked her where she stood on the topic of the role of women , and mothers , in germany . dw-world.de : désirée nick , what do you think of current attitudes for women and motherhood in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : désirée nick says germans are n't that crazy about kids désirée nick : i think it 's sick that the whole subject is being treated as it is .
of course a woman has the same right to develop her talents , abilities and possibilities just like a man does .
those who have a calling or a mission that will give their life form , who want to be independent and take advantage of everything life has to offer should n't be deprived of the right to raise children at the same time .
in germany , that is unfortunately the case .
children are presented as something bad .
in media reports , in politics , the fact that a woman has children and works is raised to the level of high drama .
how sick is that ? children have to orient themselves to the lives of their parents .
they have to be integrated into the working world of their parents .
it 's well known that the early socialization of children with others in their same age group has more benefits than time spent with mommy in between the ironing board and the washing machine . where does this image or idea come from ? oh , it 's just german .
the germans love panic and drama .
i think it 's sick that the whole subject of children is handled the way it is .
children are seen as something negative .
help !
i 'm going to have a child .
what 's going to happen to me ? !
i think such an attitude is completely on the wrong track .
the germans and their politicians badly need a course correction . the family minister , ursula von der leyen , wants to triple the number of childcare spots available so that mothers will have an easier time reentering the work force .
how do you explain the intense criticism of the plan from some quarters , particularly from more conservative ones ? i think we need to create possibilities for everything .
homosexuals and lesbians should be able to marry , because love does n't happen often enough in life .
if two people find each other , even if they are two men , they should be able to marry .
that does n't mean that i , who perhaps lives outside this milieu , also have to marry .
but the opportunity should be there . if the number of childcare spots is tripled , that does n't mean that the housewife and mother who does n't have to work will be forced to get a job .
but for those women who want to work , or who have to work , the childcare spots need to be there .
the biggest scandal of all , which is not even being discussed , is that childcare expenses are n't tax deductible .
i find that absolutely inexcusable . one german bishop who was critical of the plan said it would reduce women to the status of " birthing machines . " that 's also german , simply sick .
i 'm no friend of the germans , i have to be very clear .
i 'm a cosmopolitan , and i think after reunification , many more things should have been learned from east germany .
it was n't all bad back then .
of course , it was a horrible system , but parts of that country 's policies regarding children were positive .
they made it easy for women to go back to work after having children .
this new reunified federal republic should have incorporated some of those east german aspects .
all the things that one needs for a life that is worthwhile - a roof over your head , childcare , food , health care - all of that was taken care of in the gdr .
it 's also that way in the scandinavian countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evidently nick is no stranger to housework in germany today , these things are not being discussed .
here people say the germans are dying out , which also causes panic , but they are n't saying that because they love children .
they 're saying that because they 're afraid of not getting their pensions when they retire .
in places where children are really loved , for example , jamaica or rio , places marked by poverty , the financial situation of parents is no argument for severely limiting the number of kids you have .
germans are doing better than ever , and the better they live , the fewer children they have and the more egocentric they become . you have written a book , entitled " eva go home , " that refutes the thesis put forward by eva hermann in her own book that basically says a woman 's place is in the home .
why did you feel it necessary to write that book ? because ms. hermann 's opinion was played up throughout the media for three months .
she had a huge forum made available to her , although she occupies a very small niche , with her , yeah , almost racist , inhuman , discriminatory and inflammatory words : in short , saying that a woman belongs in the kitchen and should n't go to work .

she had a huge forum made available to her , although she occupies a very small niche , with her , yeah , almost racist , inhuman , discriminatory and inflammatory words : in short , saying that a woman belongs in the kitchen and should n't go to work .
i mean , just think about it , being a mother is one of the shortest times of a woman 's life .
children today are grown up by the time they 're 16 .
what is the woman supposed to do after that ?
that 's when the longest portion of a woman 's life begins . are eva hermann 's ideas a reaction against feminism ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1950s family of course .
she 's made feminism responsible for the decline in the birth rate .
she blames it for everything .
but she 's an amateur sociologist , a bottle-blond performer , and not a specialist .

you have a son and a very successful career . it 's not easy , i 'll tell you that .
equality for women demands a lot .
on the other side , i can only shrug my shoulders and point to a lot of woman who have achieved the same thing men have , just having to do it walking backwards and in high heels . it is a daily struggle .
but if you learn an instrument , a sport , do you want to be comfortable or do you want to be successful .
it 's not possible to have it both ways .
if you want something in this life , a little quality of life , you have to work for it .
i think that 's something that children can learn very well from working mothers . so what needs to happen to change these kinds of attitudes ? it 's not going to happen .
the germans are going to stay german .

the aim is to make it easier for mothers to go back to work .
germany is trying to reverse a falling birth rate and it 's thought if women can find a way to successfully balance career and children , they will opt to have more kids . but the plan has met with criticism , especially from conservative circles , who say that mothers should be at home with the kids , not leaving them in childcare while they move up the career ladder . désirée nick is a german entertainer , cabaret artist and author who has never been shy about expressing her opinion .
dw-world.de asked her where she stood on the topic of the role of women , and mothers , in germany . dw-world.de : désirée nick , what do you think of current attitudes for women and motherhood in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : désirée nick says germans are n't that crazy about kids désirée nick : i think it 's sick that the whole subject is being treated as it is .
of course a woman has the same right to develop her talents , abilities and possibilities just like a man does .
those who have a calling or a mission that will give their life form , who want to be independent and take advantage of everything life has to offer should n't be deprived of the right to raise children at the same time .
in germany , that is unfortunately the case .
children are presented as something bad .
in media reports , in politics , the fact that a woman has children and works is raised to the level of high drama .
how sick is that ? children have to orient themselves to the lives of their parents .
they have to be integrated into the working world of their parents .
it 's well known that the early socialization of children with others in their same age group has more benefits than time spent with mommy in between the ironing board and the washing machine . where does this image or idea come from ? oh , it 's just german .
the germans love panic and drama .
i think it 's sick that the whole subject of children is handled the way it is .
children are seen as something negative .
help !
i 'm going to have a child .
what 's going to happen to me ? !
i think such an attitude is completely on the wrong track .
the germans and their politicians badly need a course correction . the family minister , ursula von der leyen , wants to triple the number of childcare spots available so that mothers will have an easier time reentering the work force .
how do you explain the intense criticism of the plan from some quarters , particularly from more conservative ones ? i think we need to create possibilities for everything .
homosexuals and lesbians should be able to marry , because love does n't happen often enough in life .
if two people find each other , even if they are two men , they should be able to marry .
that does n't mean that i , who perhaps lives outside this milieu , also have to marry .
but the opportunity should be there . if the number of childcare spots is tripled , that does n't mean that the housewife and mother who does n't have to work will be forced to get a job .
but for those women who want to work , or who have to work , the childcare spots need to be there .
the biggest scandal of all , which is not even being discussed , is that childcare expenses are n't tax deductible .
i find that absolutely inexcusable . one german bishop who was critical of the plan said it would reduce women to the status of " birthing machines . " that 's also german , simply sick .
i 'm no friend of the germans , i have to be very clear .
i 'm a cosmopolitan , and i think after reunification , many more things should have been learned from east germany .
it was n't all bad back then .
of course , it was a horrible system , but parts of that country 's policies regarding children were positive .
they made it easy for women to go back to work after having children .
this new reunified federal republic should have incorporated some of those east german aspects .
all the things that one needs for a life that is worthwhile - a roof over your head , childcare , food , health care - all of that was taken care of in the gdr .
it 's also that way in the scandinavian countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evidently nick is no stranger to housework in germany today , these things are not being discussed .
here people say the germans are dying out , which also causes panic , but they are n't saying that because they love children .
they 're saying that because they 're afraid of not getting their pensions when they retire .
in places where children are really loved , for example , jamaica or rio , places marked by poverty , the financial situation of parents is no argument for severely limiting the number of kids you have .
germans are doing better than ever , and the better they live , the fewer children they have and the more egocentric they become . you have written a book , entitled " eva go home , " that refutes the thesis put forward by eva hermann in her own book that basically says a woman 's place is in the home .

germans are doing better than ever , and the better they live , the fewer children they have and the more egocentric they become . you have written a book , entitled " eva go home , " that refutes the thesis put forward by eva hermann in her own book that basically says a woman 's place is in the home .
why did you feel it necessary to write that book ? because ms. hermann 's opinion was played up throughout the media for three months .
she had a huge forum made available to her , although she occupies a very small niche , with her , yeah , almost racist , inhuman , discriminatory and inflammatory words : in short , saying that a woman belongs in the kitchen and should n't go to work .
i mean , just think about it , being a mother is one of the shortest times of a woman 's life .
children today are grown up by the time they 're 16 .
what is the woman supposed to do after that ?
that 's when the longest portion of a woman 's life begins . are eva hermann 's ideas a reaction against feminism ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1950s family of course .
she 's made feminism responsible for the decline in the birth rate .
she blames it for everything .
but she 's an amateur sociologist , a bottle-blond performer , and not a specialist .
if i want information , i 'll read a book written by a sociologist and not one by a news reader who 's written a book which turns germany into her own personal hazardous landfill site . you seem to have made it work .
you have a son and a very successful career . it 's not easy , i 'll tell you that .
equality for women demands a lot .
on the other side , i can only shrug my shoulders and point to a lot of woman who have achieved the same thing men have , just having to do it walking backwards and in high heels . it is a daily struggle .
but if you learn an instrument , a sport , do you want to be comfortable or do you want to be successful .
it 's not possible to have it both ways .
if you want something in this life , a little quality of life , you have to work for it .
i think that 's something that children can learn very well from working mothers . so what needs to happen to change these kinds of attitudes ? it 's not going to happen .
the germans are going to stay german .
the english are going to remain eccentrics , with their black humor that i love .
people in rio de janeiro are always going to be able to dance and look great on the beach , which i love even more .
and the americans are always going to have an optimistic attitude and be willing to take risks .
they have the ability to forget their failures and start over , anytime , anywhere . but if a german fails at some project , he 'll withdraw , become an alcoholic and write poetry .
an american shrugs his shoulders , says " so what , " and starts over .
that 's the way i 'm going to raise my child . kyle james interviewed désirée nick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we are still burdened by the national socialist legacy " germany is currently engaged in a heated debate over the creation of additional nursery schools .
while accepted in the former communist part of the country , western germans struggle with the plan , according to an expert .
-lrb- 14.04.2007 -rrb- german parents to get more daycare options germany hopes to catch up with other european countries with progressive childcare policies by providing more nursery school places in a bid to encourage mothers to work and reverse a declining birthrate .
-lrb- 03.04.2007 -rrb- german bishop slammed for calling women " birthing machines " a german bishop has sharply criticized government plans to improve childcare facilities , saying they reduce women to " birthing machines " who quickly have to return to work .

germany 's leading mass-market newspaper has joined the country 's major environment organizations in a nationwide campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . the campaign was launched this week and comes under the heading " save our earth . "
it is to be directed towards the readers of the bild newspaper , the daily with europe 's largest circulation , by way of articles and competitions to be held throughout the rest of the year . the organizers are aiming to change attitudes more than really make a substantial dent in germany 's climate-changing co2 emissions , partially by calling on readers to make their own private contributions to cutting greenhouse gas emissions . it 's a switch for the bild , which is n't known as the standard bearer of the environmentalist movement 's messages . advocates for german car industry in the past , the paper has waged campaigns against the introduction of ecology taxes on fuels and energy as well as fiercely defended germany 's automotive culture of no speed limits and powerful cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bild has n't always been concerned with cutting greenhouse gas emissions ?

" anybody can change his mind , and it 's my impression that bild has finally realized that climate change is really an important and crucial issue for mankind , " timm said . over the past few weeks , the newspaper has been running headlines along the lines of " our planet is dying " and " only 13 years left to change the world .

" the problematic issues are mostly political .
we can not cling to them and remain at a standstill , " gul told a press conference .

" the program outlines a timetable for completing legislative amendments and other legal regulations by 2013 to align with eu standards in areas ranging from transport and food safety to customs , competition policies and the environment . turkey 's chief negotiator in the accession talks , economy minister ali babacan , said the timetable concerned only the completion of legislative work and did not include target dates for their implementation , which would be decided later on a case-by-case basis . the program will require parliament to enact about 200 pieces of legislation plus some 400 other regulations to be issued by the government , he said . turkey committed to continuing political reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : article 301 has resulted in the prosecution of intellectuals " political reforms will also continue , " babacan added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 18.04.2007 " germans and their politicians badly need a course correction " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desireé nick has figured out how to combine work , family and glamour as germans discuss increasing childcare opportunities and women in the workforce , german performer désirée nick taks to dw-world.de about motherhood and climbing the career ladder in high heels . german family minister ursula von der leyen has pushed through a plan to increase the country 's childcare provision .
the aim is to make it easier for mothers to go back to work .
germany is trying to reverse a falling birth rate and it 's thought if women can find a way to successfully balance career and children , they will opt to have more kids . but the plan has met with criticism , especially from conservative circles , who say that mothers should be at home with the kids , not leaving them in childcare while they move up the career ladder . désirée nick is a german entertainer , cabaret artist and author who has never been shy about expressing her opinion .
dw-world.de asked her where she stood on the topic of the role of women , and mothers , in germany . dw-world.de : désirée nick , what do you think of current attitudes for women and motherhood in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : désirée nick says germans are n't that crazy about kids désirée nick : i think it 's sick that the whole subject is being treated as it is .
of course a woman has the same right to develop her talents , abilities and possibilities just like a man does .
those who have a calling or a mission that will give their life form , who want to be independent and take advantage of everything life has to offer should n't be deprived of the right to raise children at the same time .
in germany , that is unfortunately the case .
children are presented as something bad .
in media reports , in politics , the fact that a woman has children and works is raised to the level of high drama .
how sick is that ? children have to orient themselves to the lives of their parents .
they have to be integrated into the working world of their parents .
it 's well known that the early socialization of children with others in their same age group has more benefits than time spent with mommy in between the ironing board and the washing machine . where does this image or idea come from ? oh , it 's just german .
the germans love panic and drama .
i think it 's sick that the whole subject of children is handled the way it is .
children are seen as something negative .
help !
i 'm going to have a child .
what 's going to happen to me ? !
i think such an attitude is completely on the wrong track .
the germans and their politicians badly need a course correction . the family minister , ursula von der leyen , wants to triple the number of childcare spots available so that mothers will have an easier time reentering the work force .
how do you explain the intense criticism of the plan from some quarters , particularly from more conservative ones ? i think we need to create possibilities for everything .
homosexuals and lesbians should be able to marry , because love does n't happen often enough in life .
if two people find each other , even if they are two men , they should be able to marry .
that does n't mean that i , who perhaps lives outside this milieu , also have to marry .
but the opportunity should be there . if the number of childcare spots is tripled , that does n't mean that the housewife and mother who does n't have to work will be forced to get a job .
but for those women who want to work , or who have to work , the childcare spots need to be there .
the biggest scandal of all , which is not even being discussed , is that childcare expenses are n't tax deductible .
i find that absolutely inexcusable . one german bishop who was critical of the plan said it would reduce women to the status of " birthing machines . " that 's also german , simply sick .
i 'm no friend of the germans , i have to be very clear .
i 'm a cosmopolitan , and i think after reunification , many more things should have been learned from east germany .
it was n't all bad back then .
of course , it was a horrible system , but parts of that country 's policies regarding children were positive .
they made it easy for women to go back to work after having children .
this new reunified federal republic should have incorporated some of those east german aspects .
all the things that one needs for a life that is worthwhile - a roof over your head , childcare , food , health care - all of that was taken care of in the gdr .
it 's also that way in the scandinavian countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evidently nick is no stranger to housework in germany today , these things are not being discussed .
here people say the germans are dying out , which also causes panic , but they are n't saying that because they love children .
they 're saying that because they 're afraid of not getting their pensions when they retire .
in places where children are really loved , for example , jamaica or rio , places marked by poverty , the financial situation of parents is no argument for severely limiting the number of kids you have .
germans are doing better than ever , and the better they live , the fewer children they have and the more egocentric they become . you have written a book , entitled " eva go home , " that refutes the thesis put forward by eva hermann in her own book that basically says a woman 's place is in the home .
why did you feel it necessary to write that book ? because ms. hermann 's opinion was played up throughout the media for three months .
she had a huge forum made available to her , although she occupies a very small niche , with her , yeah , almost racist , inhuman , discriminatory and inflammatory words : in short , saying that a woman belongs in the kitchen and should n't go to work .
i mean , just think about it , being a mother is one of the shortest times of a woman 's life .
children today are grown up by the time they 're 16 .
what is the woman supposed to do after that ?
that 's when the longest portion of a woman 's life begins . are eva hermann 's ideas a reaction against feminism ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1950s family of course .
she 's made feminism responsible for the decline in the birth rate .
she blames it for everything .
but she 's an amateur sociologist , a bottle-blond performer , and not a specialist .
if i want information , i 'll read a book written by a sociologist and not one by a news reader who 's written a book which turns germany into her own personal hazardous landfill site . you seem to have made it work .
you have a son and a very successful career . it 's not easy , i 'll tell you that .
equality for women demands a lot .
on the other side , i can only shrug my shoulders and point to a lot of woman who have achieved the same thing men have , just having to do it walking backwards and in high heels . it is a daily struggle .
but if you learn an instrument , a sport , do you want to be comfortable or do you want to be successful .
it 's not possible to have it both ways .
if you want something in this life , a little quality of life , you have to work for it .
i think that 's something that children can learn very well from working mothers . so what needs to happen to change these kinds of attitudes ? it 's not going to happen .
the germans are going to stay german .
the english are going to remain eccentrics , with their black humor that i love .
people in rio de janeiro are always going to be able to dance and look great on the beach , which i love even more .
and the americans are always going to have an optimistic attitude and be willing to take risks .
they have the ability to forget their failures and start over , anytime , anywhere . but if a german fails at some project , he 'll withdraw , become an alcoholic and write poetry .
an american shrugs his shoulders , says " so what , " and starts over .
that 's the way i 'm going to raise my child . kyle james interviewed désirée nick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we are still burdened by the national socialist legacy " germany is currently engaged in a heated debate over the creation of additional nursery schools .
while accepted in the former communist part of the country , western germans struggle with the plan , according to an expert .
-lrb- 14.04.2007 -rrb- german parents to get more daycare options germany hopes to catch up with other european countries with progressive childcare policies by providing more nursery school places in a bid to encourage mothers to work and reverse a declining birthrate .
-lrb- 03.04.2007 -rrb- german bishop slammed for calling women " birthing machines " a german bishop has sharply criticized government plans to improve childcare facilities , saying they reduce women to " birthing machines " who quickly have to return to work .

the aim is to make it easier for mothers to go back to work .
germany is trying to reverse a falling birth rate and it 's thought if women can find a way to successfully balance career and children , they will opt to have more kids . but the plan has met with criticism , especially from conservative circles , who say that mothers should be at home with the kids , not leaving them in childcare while they move up the career ladder . désirée nick is a german entertainer , cabaret artist and author who has never been shy about expressing her opinion .
dw-world.de asked her where she stood on the topic of the role of women , and mothers , in germany . dw-world.de : désirée nick , what do you think of current attitudes for women and motherhood in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : désirée nick says germans are n't that crazy about kids désirée nick : i think it 's sick that the whole subject is being treated as it is .
of course a woman has the same right to develop her talents , abilities and possibilities just like a man does .
those who have a calling or a mission that will give their life form , who want to be independent and take advantage of everything life has to offer should n't be deprived of the right to raise children at the same time .
in germany , that is unfortunately the case .
children are presented as something bad .
in media reports , in politics , the fact that a woman has children and works is raised to the level of high drama .
how sick is that ? children have to orient themselves to the lives of their parents .
they have to be integrated into the working world of their parents .
it 's well known that the early socialization of children with others in their same age group has more benefits than time spent with mommy in between the ironing board and the washing machine . where does this image or idea come from ? oh , it 's just german .
the germans love panic and drama .
i think it 's sick that the whole subject of children is handled the way it is .
children are seen as something negative .
help !
i 'm going to have a child .
what 's going to happen to me ? !
i think such an attitude is completely on the wrong track .
the germans and their politicians badly need a course correction . the family minister , ursula von der leyen , wants to triple the number of childcare spots available so that mothers will have an easier time reentering the work force .
how do you explain the intense criticism of the plan from some quarters , particularly from more conservative ones ? i think we need to create possibilities for everything .
homosexuals and lesbians should be able to marry , because love does n't happen often enough in life .
if two people find each other , even if they are two men , they should be able to marry .
that does n't mean that i , who perhaps lives outside this milieu , also have to marry .
but the opportunity should be there . if the number of childcare spots is tripled , that does n't mean that the housewife and mother who does n't have to work will be forced to get a job .
but for those women who want to work , or who have to work , the childcare spots need to be there .
the biggest scandal of all , which is not even being discussed , is that childcare expenses are n't tax deductible .
i find that absolutely inexcusable . one german bishop who was critical of the plan said it would reduce women to the status of " birthing machines . " that 's also german , simply sick .
i 'm no friend of the germans , i have to be very clear .
i 'm a cosmopolitan , and i think after reunification , many more things should have been learned from east germany .
it was n't all bad back then .
of course , it was a horrible system , but parts of that country 's policies regarding children were positive .
they made it easy for women to go back to work after having children .
this new reunified federal republic should have incorporated some of those east german aspects .
all the things that one needs for a life that is worthwhile - a roof over your head , childcare , food , health care - all of that was taken care of in the gdr .
it 's also that way in the scandinavian countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evidently nick is no stranger to housework in germany today , these things are not being discussed .
here people say the germans are dying out , which also causes panic , but they are n't saying that because they love children .
they 're saying that because they 're afraid of not getting their pensions when they retire .
in places where children are really loved , for example , jamaica or rio , places marked by poverty , the financial situation of parents is no argument for severely limiting the number of kids you have .
germans are doing better than ever , and the better they live , the fewer children they have and the more egocentric they become . you have written a book , entitled " eva go home , " that refutes the thesis put forward by eva hermann in her own book that basically says a woman 's place is in the home .
why did you feel it necessary to write that book ? because ms. hermann 's opinion was played up throughout the media for three months .
she had a huge forum made available to her , although she occupies a very small niche , with her , yeah , almost racist , inhuman , discriminatory and inflammatory words : in short , saying that a woman belongs in the kitchen and should n't go to work .
i mean , just think about it , being a mother is one of the shortest times of a woman 's life .
children today are grown up by the time they 're 16 .
what is the woman supposed to do after that ?
that 's when the longest portion of a woman 's life begins . are eva hermann 's ideas a reaction against feminism ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1950s family of course .
she 's made feminism responsible for the decline in the birth rate .
she blames it for everything .
but she 's an amateur sociologist , a bottle-blond performer , and not a specialist .
if i want information , i 'll read a book written by a sociologist and not one by a news reader who 's written a book which turns germany into her own personal hazardous landfill site . you seem to have made it work .
you have a son and a very successful career . it 's not easy , i 'll tell you that .
equality for women demands a lot .
on the other side , i can only shrug my shoulders and point to a lot of woman who have achieved the same thing men have , just having to do it walking backwards and in high heels . it is a daily struggle .
but if you learn an instrument , a sport , do you want to be comfortable or do you want to be successful .
it 's not possible to have it both ways .
if you want something in this life , a little quality of life , you have to work for it .
i think that 's something that children can learn very well from working mothers . so what needs to happen to change these kinds of attitudes ? it 's not going to happen .
the germans are going to stay german .
the english are going to remain eccentrics , with their black humor that i love .

" the problematic issues are mostly political .
we can not cling to them and remain at a standstill , " gul told a press conference .
" when the political problems are one day resolved , we will meet with the eu and it will take us half an hour to open and close those chapters . " candidates for membership are required to adopt eu norms in 35 policy areas .
turkey can not officially close talks in any of the chapters until the cyprus dispute is resolved . eu welcomes turkish course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan met with merkel at the hanover trade fair this week " this is , of course , very much welcomed by the european commission ... and this is what is actually expected from any candidate country , " an eu spokeswoman on enlargement issues told reporters tuesday . she said , however , that it was too early for the eu 's executive body to comment on the content of the plan - essentially a program of technical reforms and a timetable for turkey to achieve them by 2013 . the spokeswoman also noted that the speed at which turkey undertakes reform would dictate how soon it joins europe 's rich club . turkey 's eu membership talks , which began in october 2005 and have been plagued with difficulties , are expected to last at least a decade , and ankara has been given no guarantee that it will even be allowed in at the end . many member nations are wary of inviting in a huge , relatively poor and mainly-muslim state which would , under eu rules , receive voting rights similar to major powers like britain or italy . aligning with eu standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , left , outlined his plan for turkey 's membership talks ending a long hiatus in the talks , the eu last month began negotiations with turkey on " enterprise and industry policy , " only the second chapter ankara has managed to open since " science and research " in june 2006 . " we maintain our goal of eu membership with determination , " gul said .
" the reforms will facilitate our negotiating process on the one hand and , on the other , raise standards in many aspects of our daily lives . " the program outlines a timetable for completing legislative amendments and other legal regulations by 2013 to align with eu standards in areas ranging from transport and food safety to customs , competition policies and the environment . turkey 's chief negotiator in the accession talks , economy minister ali babacan , said the timetable concerned only the completion of legislative work and did not include target dates for their implementation , which would be decided later on a case-by-case basis . the program will require parliament to enact about 200 pieces of legislation plus some 400 other regulations to be issued by the government , he said . turkey committed to continuing political reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : article 301 has resulted in the prosecution of intellectuals " political reforms will also continue , " babacan added .
" we will focus particularly on resolving problems that emerge on the ground in the implementation of the reforms . " gul said ankara is committed to amending article 301 of the penal code , which has resulted in the prosecution of dozens of intellectuals for " insulting turkishness " and triggered harsh eu criticism , but did not say when . turkey 's eu membership talks , which got off to a turbulent start in october 2005 , have been overshadowed by presidential elections in may and general elections scheduled for november . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and erdogan reconcile after turkish eu criticism german chancellor angela merkel met turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan in hanover and made their peace after the turkish leader made critical comments about german efforts in regard to turkey 's eu accession .

germany 's leading mass-market newspaper has joined the country 's major environment organizations in a nationwide campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . the campaign was launched this week and comes under the heading " save our earth . "
it is to be directed towards the readers of the bild newspaper , the daily with europe 's largest circulation , by way of articles and competitions to be held throughout the rest of the year . the organizers are aiming to change attitudes more than really make a substantial dent in germany 's climate-changing co2 emissions , partially by calling on readers to make their own private contributions to cutting greenhouse gas emissions . it 's a switch for the bild , which is n't known as the standard bearer of the environmentalist movement 's messages . advocates for german car industry in the past , the paper has waged campaigns against the introduction of ecology taxes on fuels and energy as well as fiercely defended germany 's automotive culture of no speed limits and powerful cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bild has n't always been concerned with cutting greenhouse gas emissions ?
anybody can makes mistakes , though , said gerhard timm from the german branch of friends of the earth -lrb- bund -rrb- , adding that the unusual alliance is not a gimmick by the tabloid to boost sales by riding the current wave of " save the planet " sentiments . " anybody can change his mind , and it 's my impression that bild has finally realized that climate change is really an important and crucial issue for mankind , " timm said . over the past few weeks , the newspaper has been running headlines along the lines of " our planet is dying " and " only 13 years left to change the world . " the paper has also highlighted the findings of the recent united nations ' scientific reports on climate change . journalists , readers need to do their part now , bild has called on its 12 million daily readers to make their own personal contributions to cutting germany 's co2 emissions . the aim is to save 3.5 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the year - a figure equivalent to the 3.5 million bild newspapers printed every day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can a newspaper convince readers to turn of the lights when they 're not home ?
florian von heintze , who is in charge of the campaign at the newspaper , admitted that the environmental organizations ' expertise and credibility are needed to make the campaign a success . " unusual circumstances require unusual measures , " heintze said . heintze said the partnership with the environmental groups evolved as a result of readers ' heightened interest in environmental issues , which led bild ' s journalists to do more than just write about climate change . heintze said the paper and its readers " share a common goal , which is to save our earth . " germans worried about climate change the campaign will be falling on fertile ground since 98 percent of germans say climate change is something to worry about . bild is planning to start a competition , in which readers can submit their stories about how they have saved energy .
the organizers said they might also crown a kind of climate king or queen . in a series of articles , the paper plans to give readers tips about how they can protect the climate - little things that can make a difference nonetheless , timm said . " in the traffic sector , you can reduce co2 emissions by turning off the engine at red lights , " he said .
" at home , you can switch off electrical devices and stop using the ' stand-by ' mode . " the campaign organizers said they are aware that reducing co2 emissions by 3.5 million tons does n't really compare with germany 's overall annual emissions of more than a billion tons . yet the mass-selling tabloid has a reputation for being able to change popular moods swiftly - so germany 's environmentalists hope the campaign will put added pressure on politicians , which could lead to a change in industry where it really matters , they said . uwe hessler -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : climate change poses serious challenge for europe the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that the world 's poorest countries will be affected most by climate change .

buback was the first victim of a bloody period dubbed the " german autumn " when he was shot in his car by raf gunmen on a motorcycle in the city of karlsruhe . buback 's son michael wrote in the paper that he had reliable information from anonymous sources connected to the now-disbanded group that klar was not involved in the 1977 murder of his father . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael buback and his mother , inge , at a memorial for siegfried buback in early april klar was arrested in 1982 and sentenced for his role in multiple murders . michael buback said the information he had received indicated that klar was not his father 's murderer and had played no part in planning the attack . " naturally i must be skeptical about information from such sources , " he wrote in the paper wednesday .
" it could intentionally or unintentionally be false , but it could also be true . " clemency rejected after speech the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang after its founders andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , mounted a violent campaign against what it considered was the oppressive capitalist state of west germany from 1977 to 1982 .
it targeted the german elite and the us military based in germany .
the organization , which officially disbanded in 1998 , is suspected of killing 34 people . brigitte mohnhaupt , who led the raf with klar after the group 's original leaders committed suicide in jail , was released from prison in march after serving 24 years for her role in nine murders , including buback 's .
justice authorities said she no longer posed a threat to society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar was sentenced to 26 years in 1985 but klar 's request for occasional day releases from prison was turned down in february after he called , in a speech read out on his behalf to a left-wing conference , for the " total defeat of the capitalists ' aims .

buback was the first victim of a bloody period dubbed the " german autumn " when he was shot in his car by raf gunmen on a motorcycle in the city of karlsruhe . buback 's son michael wrote in the paper that he had reliable information from anonymous sources connected to the now-disbanded group that klar was not involved in the 1977 murder of his father . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael buback and his mother , inge , at a memorial for siegfried buback in early april klar was arrested in 1982 and sentenced for his role in multiple murders . michael buback said the information he had received indicated that klar was not his father 's murderer and had played no part in planning the attack . " naturally i must be skeptical about information from such sources , " he wrote in the paper wednesday .
" it could intentionally or unintentionally be false , but it could also be true . " clemency rejected after speech the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang after its founders andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , mounted a violent campaign against what it considered was the oppressive capitalist state of west germany from 1977 to 1982 .
it targeted the german elite and the us military based in germany .
the organization , which officially disbanded in 1998 , is suspected of killing 34 people . brigitte mohnhaupt , who led the raf with klar after the group 's original leaders committed suicide in jail , was released from prison in march after serving 24 years for her role in nine murders , including buback 's .
justice authorities said she no longer posed a threat to society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar was sentenced to 26 years in 1985 but klar 's request for occasional day releases from prison was turned down in february after he called , in a speech read out on his behalf to a left-wing conference , for the " total defeat of the capitalists ' aims . " klar 's sentence stipulates that he will not be eligible for parole until 2009 , unless he is pardoned first . neither klar nor mohnhaupt have ever expressed remorse for the murders . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany remembers bloodiest year of left-wing terrorism past germany saturday marks the 30th anniversary of the raf killing of federal prosecutor buback , sparking the worst year of left-wing terror in west german history .

" when i see and hear all the reports on the news about virginia tech , everything from five years ago comes flooding back , " said christiane alt , the principal of erfurt 's gutenberg gymnasium , the school where 16 people were killed by a 19-year-old student who then took his own life . christian drechsel , a pupil at the erfurt school at the time of the shooting , said he can understand how the virginia tech students must be feeling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one mourner asked " why ? " in erfurt years ago " i know the feelings of the people , and if a group of people experience the same tragedy , it kind pulls people together as if they were a family , " drechsel said . " you get closer to people because they feel the same way you feel , " he added .
" if you look in their eyes you will see the same feelings you feel . " reliving the horror some of the gutenberg gymnasium pupils who lived through the massacre are still undergoing psychological treatment . " the people i 'm helping now who experienced the massacre sought psychological help very late , " said psychologist alina wilms .
" they first tried to deal with the situation on their own and at some point realized that just does n't work . " wilms also said that seeing reports of the virginia tech massacre sometimes cause victims or eyewitnesses to relive their own trauma again . calls for tighter gun controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five years ago : erfurt in grief as virginia tech students begin and the people of erfurt continue to deal with their shock , a political debate about tighter gun control law has reignited . drechsel , however , said he believes such incidents are the result of social problems rather than the availability of guns . " these people have problems , and if they are not helped , such things will happen again in america , and again in germany , " drechsel said . in comparison to the united states , germany had strict gun laws even before the erfurt shooting . in germany , all firearms must be marked and registered .
fully automatic weapons are banned , and people wanting to buy a hunting rifle must undergo background checks that can take up to a year . in virginia , although guns are widely available , they are banned on any university campus . criminals , not guns , kill people german gun lobbyist joachim streitburger said it 's people who are dangerous , not guns . " the legal gun owner is not a problem for public safety , " said streitburger .
" it 's the illegally held gun that is . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : virginia tech students are trying to terms with the killings of all the gun crimes in germany , less than 1 percent involve a legally owned gun . streitberger , from a group called " forum waffenrecht " -lrb- forum for weapons rights -rrb- , said that when a shocking killing spree takes place , politicians always leap on the issue of tighter gun controls . " after the shooting in erfurt , one proposal was that we have to prohibit every pump action gun , " said streitburger .
" the fact is that the guy who did the shooting at erfurt did n't even use the pump gun ; he had one with him but he did n't use it . " targeting legal weapons , however , wo n't stop further attacks from criminals , he added . streitburger 's arguments are in line with those of the us gun lobby , which say that to eradicate firearms completely punishes law-abiding citizens not those who break the law . as ceremonies for the victims of the virginia shooting continue in the united states , officials at the erfurt school have said a memorial service is planned for april 26 to commemorate those killed in 2002 . zoie jones -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe offers condolences for us university shooting victims the deadliest shooting rampage in us history , which left 32 dead at an american university , sent shudders around the world tuesday , setting off shock and sympathy along with questions over gun control in the usa .

the aim is to make it easier for mothers to go back to work .
germany is trying to reverse a falling birth rate and it 's thought if women can find a way to successfully balance career and children , they will opt to have more kids . but the plan has met with criticism , especially from conservative circles , who say that mothers should be at home with the kids , not leaving them in childcare while they move up the career ladder . désirée nick is a german entertainer , cabaret artist and author who has never been shy about expressing her opinion .
dw-world.de asked her where she stood on the topic of the role of women , and mothers , in germany . dw-world.de : désirée nick , what do you think of current attitudes for women and motherhood in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : désirée nick says germans are n't that crazy about kids désirée nick : i think it 's sick that the whole subject is being treated as it is .
of course a woman has the same right to develop her talents , abilities and possibilities just like a man does .
those who have a calling or a mission that will give their life form , who want to be independent and take advantage of everything life has to offer should n't be deprived of the right to raise children at the same time .
in germany , that is unfortunately the case .
children are presented as something bad .
in media reports , in politics , the fact that a woman has children and works is raised to the level of high drama .
how sick is that ? children have to orient themselves to the lives of their parents .
they have to be integrated into the working world of their parents .
it 's well known that the early socialization of children with others in their same age group has more benefits than time spent with mommy in between the ironing board and the washing machine . where does this image or idea come from ? oh , it 's just german .
the germans love panic and drama .
i think it 's sick that the whole subject of children is handled the way it is .
children are seen as something negative .
help !
i 'm going to have a child .
what 's going to happen to me ? !
i think such an attitude is completely on the wrong track .
the germans and their politicians badly need a course correction . the family minister , ursula von der leyen , wants to triple the number of childcare spots available so that mothers will have an easier time reentering the work force .
how do you explain the intense criticism of the plan from some quarters , particularly from more conservative ones ? i think we need to create possibilities for everything .
homosexuals and lesbians should be able to marry , because love does n't happen often enough in life .
if two people find each other , even if they are two men , they should be able to marry .
that does n't mean that i , who perhaps lives outside this milieu , also have to marry .
but the opportunity should be there . if the number of childcare spots is tripled , that does n't mean that the housewife and mother who does n't have to work will be forced to get a job .
but for those women who want to work , or who have to work , the childcare spots need to be there .
the biggest scandal of all , which is not even being discussed , is that childcare expenses are n't tax deductible .
i find that absolutely inexcusable . one german bishop who was critical of the plan said it would reduce women to the status of " birthing machines . " that 's also german , simply sick .
i 'm no friend of the germans , i have to be very clear .
i 'm a cosmopolitan , and i think after reunification , many more things should have been learned from east germany .
it was n't all bad back then .
of course , it was a horrible system , but parts of that country 's policies regarding children were positive .
they made it easy for women to go back to work after having children .
this new reunified federal republic should have incorporated some of those east german aspects .
all the things that one needs for a life that is worthwhile - a roof over your head , childcare , food , health care - all of that was taken care of in the gdr .
it 's also that way in the scandinavian countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evidently nick is no stranger to housework in germany today , these things are not being discussed .
here people say the germans are dying out , which also causes panic , but they are n't saying that because they love children .
they 're saying that because they 're afraid of not getting their pensions when they retire .
in places where children are really loved , for example , jamaica or rio , places marked by poverty , the financial situation of parents is no argument for severely limiting the number of kids you have .
germans are doing better than ever , and the better they live , the fewer children they have and the more egocentric they become . you have written a book , entitled " eva go home , " that refutes the thesis put forward by eva hermann in her own book that basically says a woman 's place is in the home .
why did you feel it necessary to write that book ? because ms. hermann 's opinion was played up throughout the media for three months .
she had a huge forum made available to her , although she occupies a very small niche , with her , yeah , almost racist , inhuman , discriminatory and inflammatory words : in short , saying that a woman belongs in the kitchen and should n't go to work .
i mean , just think about it , being a mother is one of the shortest times of a woman 's life .
children today are grown up by the time they 're 16 .
what is the woman supposed to do after that ?
that 's when the longest portion of a woman 's life begins . are eva hermann 's ideas a reaction against feminism ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1950s family of course .
she 's made feminism responsible for the decline in the birth rate .
she blames it for everything .
but she 's an amateur sociologist , a bottle-blond performer , and not a specialist .
if i want information , i 'll read a book written by a sociologist and not one by a news reader who 's written a book which turns germany into her own personal hazardous landfill site . you seem to have made it work .
you have a son and a very successful career . it 's not easy , i 'll tell you that .
equality for women demands a lot .
on the other side , i can only shrug my shoulders and point to a lot of woman who have achieved the same thing men have , just having to do it walking backwards and in high heels . it is a daily struggle .
but if you learn an instrument , a sport , do you want to be comfortable or do you want to be successful .
it 's not possible to have it both ways .
if you want something in this life , a little quality of life , you have to work for it .
i think that 's something that children can learn very well from working mothers . so what needs to happen to change these kinds of attitudes ? it 's not going to happen .
the germans are going to stay german .
the english are going to remain eccentrics , with their black humor that i love .
people in rio de janeiro are always going to be able to dance and look great on the beach , which i love even more .
and the americans are always going to have an optimistic attitude and be willing to take risks .
they have the ability to forget their failures and start over , anytime , anywhere . but if a german fails at some project , he 'll withdraw , become an alcoholic and write poetry .
an american shrugs his shoulders , says " so what , " and starts over .
that 's the way i 'm going to raise my child . kyle james interviewed désirée nick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we are still burdened by the national socialist legacy " germany is currently engaged in a heated debate over the creation of additional nursery schools .

germany 's leading mass-market newspaper has joined the country 's major environment organizations in a nationwide campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . the campaign was launched this week and comes under the heading " save our earth . "
it is to be directed towards the readers of the bild newspaper , the daily with europe 's largest circulation , by way of articles and competitions to be held throughout the rest of the year . the organizers are aiming to change attitudes more than really make a substantial dent in germany 's climate-changing co2 emissions , partially by calling on readers to make their own private contributions to cutting greenhouse gas emissions . it 's a switch for the bild , which is n't known as the standard bearer of the environmentalist movement 's messages . advocates for german car industry in the past , the paper has waged campaigns against the introduction of ecology taxes on fuels and energy as well as fiercely defended germany 's automotive culture of no speed limits and powerful cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bild has n't always been concerned with cutting greenhouse gas emissions ?

the organizers said they might also crown a kind of climate king or queen . in a series of articles , the paper plans to give readers tips about how they can protect the climate - little things that can make a difference nonetheless , timm said . " in the traffic sector , you can reduce co2 emissions by turning off the engine at red lights , " he said .
" at home , you can switch off electrical devices and stop using the ' stand-by ' mode .

it is to be directed towards the readers of the bild newspaper , the daily with europe 's largest circulation , by way of articles and competitions to be held throughout the rest of the year . the organizers are aiming to change attitudes more than really make a substantial dent in germany 's climate-changing co2 emissions , partially by calling on readers to make their own private contributions to cutting greenhouse gas emissions . it 's a switch for the bild , which is n't known as the standard bearer of the environmentalist movement 's messages . advocates for german car industry in the past , the paper has waged campaigns against the introduction of ecology taxes on fuels and energy as well as fiercely defended germany 's automotive culture of no speed limits and powerful cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bild has n't always been concerned with cutting greenhouse gas emissions ?
anybody can makes mistakes , though , said gerhard timm from the german branch of friends of the earth -lrb- bund -rrb- , adding that the unusual alliance is not a gimmick by the tabloid to boost sales by riding the current wave of " save the planet " sentiments . " anybody can change his mind , and it 's my impression that bild has finally realized that climate change is really an important and crucial issue for mankind , " timm said . over the past few weeks , the newspaper has been running headlines along the lines of " our planet is dying " and " only 13 years left to change the world . " the paper has also highlighted the findings of the recent united nations ' scientific reports on climate change . journalists , readers need to do their part now , bild has called on its 12 million daily readers to make their own personal contributions to cutting germany 's co2 emissions . the aim is to save 3.5 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the year - a figure equivalent to the 3.5 million bild newspapers printed every day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can a newspaper convince readers to turn of the lights when they 're not home ?
florian von heintze , who is in charge of the campaign at the newspaper , admitted that the environmental organizations ' expertise and credibility are needed to make the campaign a success . " unusual circumstances require unusual measures , " heintze said . heintze said the partnership with the environmental groups evolved as a result of readers ' heightened interest in environmental issues , which led bild ' s journalists to do more than just write about climate change . heintze said the paper and its readers " share a common goal , which is to save our earth . " germans worried about climate change the campaign will be falling on fertile ground since 98 percent of germans say climate change is something to worry about . bild is planning to start a competition , in which readers can submit their stories about how they have saved energy .
the organizers said they might also crown a kind of climate king or queen . in a series of articles , the paper plans to give readers tips about how they can protect the climate - little things that can make a difference nonetheless , timm said . " in the traffic sector , you can reduce co2 emissions by turning off the engine at red lights , " he said .
" at home , you can switch off electrical devices and stop using the ' stand-by ' mode . " the campaign organizers said they are aware that reducing co2 emissions by 3.5 million tons does n't really compare with germany 's overall annual emissions of more than a billion tons . yet the mass-selling tabloid has a reputation for being able to change popular moods swiftly - so germany 's environmentalists hope the campaign will put added pressure on politicians , which could lead to a change in industry where it really matters , they said . uwe hessler -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : climate change poses serious challenge for europe the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that the world 's poorest countries will be affected most by climate change .

" the problematic issues are mostly political .
we can not cling to them and remain at a standstill , " gul told a press conference .
" when the political problems are one day resolved , we will meet with the eu and it will take us half an hour to open and close those chapters . " candidates for membership are required to adopt eu norms in 35 policy areas .
turkey can not officially close talks in any of the chapters until the cyprus dispute is resolved . eu welcomes turkish course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan met with merkel at the hanover trade fair this week " this is , of course , very much welcomed by the european commission ... and this is what is actually expected from any candidate country , " an eu spokeswoman on enlargement issues told reporters tuesday . she said , however , that it was too early for the eu 's executive body to comment on the content of the plan - essentially a program of technical reforms and a timetable for turkey to achieve them by 2013 . the spokeswoman also noted that the speed at which turkey undertakes reform would dictate how soon it joins europe 's rich club . turkey 's eu membership talks , which began in october 2005 and have been plagued with difficulties , are expected to last at least a decade , and ankara has been given no guarantee that it will even be allowed in at the end . many member nations are wary of inviting in a huge , relatively poor and mainly-muslim state which would , under eu rules , receive voting rights similar to major powers like britain or italy . aligning with eu standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , left , outlined his plan for turkey 's membership talks ending a long hiatus in the talks , the eu last month began negotiations with turkey on " enterprise and industry policy , " only the second chapter ankara has managed to open since " science and research " in june 2006 . " we maintain our goal of eu membership with determination , " gul said .
" the reforms will facilitate our negotiating process on the one hand and , on the other , raise standards in many aspects of our daily lives . " the program outlines a timetable for completing legislative amendments and other legal regulations by 2013 to align with eu standards in areas ranging from transport and food safety to customs , competition policies and the environment . turkey 's chief negotiator in the accession talks , economy minister ali babacan , said the timetable concerned only the completion of legislative work and did not include target dates for their implementation , which would be decided later on a case-by-case basis . the program will require parliament to enact about 200 pieces of legislation plus some 400 other regulations to be issued by the government , he said . turkey committed to continuing political reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : article 301 has resulted in the prosecution of intellectuals " political reforms will also continue , " babacan added .
" we will focus particularly on resolving problems that emerge on the ground in the implementation of the reforms .

" the problematic issues are mostly political .
we can not cling to them and remain at a standstill , " gul told a press conference .
" when the political problems are one day resolved , we will meet with the eu and it will take us half an hour to open and close those chapters . " candidates for membership are required to adopt eu norms in 35 policy areas .
turkey can not officially close talks in any of the chapters until the cyprus dispute is resolved . eu welcomes turkish course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan met with merkel at the hanover trade fair this week " this is , of course , very much welcomed by the european commission ... and this is what is actually expected from any candidate country , " an eu spokeswoman on enlargement issues told reporters tuesday . she said , however , that it was too early for the eu 's executive body to comment on the content of the plan - essentially a program of technical reforms and a timetable for turkey to achieve them by 2013 . the spokeswoman also noted that the speed at which turkey undertakes reform would dictate how soon it joins europe 's rich club . turkey 's eu membership talks , which began in october 2005 and have been plagued with difficulties , are expected to last at least a decade , and ankara has been given no guarantee that it will even be allowed in at the end . many member nations are wary of inviting in a huge , relatively poor and mainly-muslim state which would , under eu rules , receive voting rights similar to major powers like britain or italy . aligning with eu standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , left , outlined his plan for turkey 's membership talks ending a long hiatus in the talks , the eu last month began negotiations with turkey on " enterprise and industry policy , " only the second chapter ankara has managed to open since " science and research " in june 2006 . " we maintain our goal of eu membership with determination , " gul said .
" the reforms will facilitate our negotiating process on the one hand and , on the other , raise standards in many aspects of our daily lives . " the program outlines a timetable for completing legislative amendments and other legal regulations by 2013 to align with eu standards in areas ranging from transport and food safety to customs , competition policies and the environment . turkey 's chief negotiator in the accession talks , economy minister ali babacan , said the timetable concerned only the completion of legislative work and did not include target dates for their implementation , which would be decided later on a case-by-case basis . the program will require parliament to enact about 200 pieces of legislation plus some 400 other regulations to be issued by the government , he said . turkey committed to continuing political reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : article 301 has resulted in the prosecution of intellectuals " political reforms will also continue , " babacan added .

" when i see and hear all the reports on the news about virginia tech , everything from five years ago comes flooding back , " said christiane alt , the principal of erfurt 's gutenberg gymnasium , the school where 16 people were killed by a 19-year-old student who then took his own life . christian drechsel , a pupil at the erfurt school at the time of the shooting , said he can understand how the virginia tech students must be feeling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one mourner asked " why ? " in erfurt years ago " i know the feelings of the people , and if a group of people experience the same tragedy , it kind pulls people together as if they were a family , " drechsel said . " you get closer to people because they feel the same way you feel , " he added .
" if you look in their eyes you will see the same feelings you feel . " reliving the horror some of the gutenberg gymnasium pupils who lived through the massacre are still undergoing psychological treatment . " the people i 'm helping now who experienced the massacre sought psychological help very late , " said psychologist alina wilms .
" they first tried to deal with the situation on their own and at some point realized that just does n't work . " wilms also said that seeing reports of the virginia tech massacre sometimes cause victims or eyewitnesses to relive their own trauma again . calls for tighter gun controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five years ago : erfurt in grief as virginia tech students begin and the people of erfurt continue to deal with their shock , a political debate about tighter gun control law has reignited . drechsel , however , said he believes such incidents are the result of social problems rather than the availability of guns . " these people have problems , and if they are not helped , such things will happen again in america , and again in germany , " drechsel said . in comparison to the united states , germany had strict gun laws even before the erfurt shooting . in germany , all firearms must be marked and registered .
fully automatic weapons are banned , and people wanting to buy a hunting rifle must undergo background checks that can take up to a year . in virginia , although guns are widely available , they are banned on any university campus . criminals , not guns , kill people german gun lobbyist joachim streitburger said it 's people who are dangerous , not guns . " the legal gun owner is not a problem for public safety , " said streitburger .
" it 's the illegally held gun that is . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : virginia tech students are trying to terms with the killings of all the gun crimes in germany , less than 1 percent involve a legally owned gun . streitberger , from a group called " forum waffenrecht " -lrb- forum for weapons rights -rrb- , said that when a shocking killing spree takes place , politicians always leap on the issue of tighter gun controls . " after the shooting in erfurt , one proposal was that we have to prohibit every pump action gun , " said streitburger .
" the fact is that the guy who did the shooting at erfurt did n't even use the pump gun ; he had one with him but he did n't use it . " targeting legal weapons , however , wo n't stop further attacks from criminals , he added . streitburger 's arguments are in line with those of the us gun lobby , which say that to eradicate firearms completely punishes law-abiding citizens not those who break the law . as ceremonies for the victims of the virginia shooting continue in the united states , officials at the erfurt school have said a memorial service is planned for april 26 to commemorate those killed in 2002 . zoie jones -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe offers condolences for us university shooting victims the deadliest shooting rampage in us history , which left 32 dead at an american university , sent shudders around the world tuesday , setting off shock and sympathy along with questions over gun control in the usa .

" we are grateful to all of the uefa executive council members for their decision to accord us the right to host the european championship , " surkis told ukrainian television . " i promise that we will do our best to hold the championship at the highest possible level , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy at the world cup in germany last year in warsaw , football fans and officials who gathered in the city center to watch the announcement on a giant television screen burst into applause and chants . " it will be our chance to show we are capable of organizing large sports events like world championships or even the olympics , " said przemyslaw gosiewski , an aide to polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . " this is our passport to enter the club of elite countries , " he added . giving eastern countries a chance in rome , the reaction was much more muted , with italian sports minister giovanna melandri saying the decision had been mainly a political one . " they wanted to open up the finals to former eastern bloc countries who are striving to fully join the european scene , " she said .
" we just have to accept it in the name of sports and now try to win on the field . " the 2012 finals will once again feature 16 teams despite uefa examining a proposal to extend it to 24 countries . greece are the current european champions having won the title in lisbon in 2004 .

" when i see and hear all the reports on the news about virginia tech , everything from five years ago comes flooding back , " said christiane alt , the principal of erfurt 's gutenberg gymnasium , the school where 16 people were killed by a 19-year-old student who then took his own life . christian drechsel , a pupil at the erfurt school at the time of the shooting , said he can understand how the virginia tech students must be feeling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one mourner asked " why ? " in erfurt years ago " i know the feelings of the people , and if a group of people experience the same tragedy , it kind pulls people together as if they were a family , " drechsel said . " you get closer to people because they feel the same way you feel , " he added .
" if you look in their eyes you will see the same feelings you feel . " reliving the horror some of the gutenberg gymnasium pupils who lived through the massacre are still undergoing psychological treatment . " the people i 'm helping now who experienced the massacre sought psychological help very late , " said psychologist alina wilms .
" they first tried to deal with the situation on their own and at some point realized that just does n't work . " wilms also said that seeing reports of the virginia tech massacre sometimes cause victims or eyewitnesses to relive their own trauma again . calls for tighter gun controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five years ago : erfurt in grief as virginia tech students begin and the people of erfurt continue to deal with their shock , a political debate about tighter gun control law has reignited . drechsel , however , said he believes such incidents are the result of social problems rather than the availability of guns . " these people have problems , and if they are not helped , such things will happen again in america , and again in germany , " drechsel said . in comparison to the united states , germany had strict gun laws even before the erfurt shooting . in germany , all firearms must be marked and registered .
fully automatic weapons are banned , and people wanting to buy a hunting rifle must undergo background checks that can take up to a year . in virginia , although guns are widely available , they are banned on any university campus . criminals , not guns , kill people german gun lobbyist joachim streitburger said it 's people who are dangerous , not guns . " the legal gun owner is not a problem for public safety , " said streitburger .
" it 's the illegally held gun that is . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : virginia tech students are trying to terms with the killings of all the gun crimes in germany , less than 1 percent involve a legally owned gun . streitberger , from a group called " forum waffenrecht " -lrb- forum for weapons rights -rrb- , said that when a shocking killing spree takes place , politicians always leap on the issue of tighter gun controls . " after the shooting in erfurt , one proposal was that we have to prohibit every pump action gun , " said streitburger .
" the fact is that the guy who did the shooting at erfurt did n't even use the pump gun ; he had one with him but he did n't use it . " targeting legal weapons , however , wo n't stop further attacks from criminals , he added . streitburger 's arguments are in line with those of the us gun lobby , which say that to eradicate firearms completely punishes law-abiding citizens not those who break the law . as ceremonies for the victims of the virginia shooting continue in the united states , officials at the erfurt school have said a memorial service is planned for april 26 to commemorate those killed in 2002 . zoie jones -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe offers condolences for us university shooting victims the deadliest shooting rampage in us history , which left 32 dead at an american university , sent shudders around the world tuesday , setting off shock and sympathy along with questions over gun control in the usa .

the aim is to make it easier for mothers to go back to work .
germany is trying to reverse a falling birth rate and it 's thought if women can find a way to successfully balance career and children , they will opt to have more kids . but the plan has met with criticism , especially from conservative circles , who say that mothers should be at home with the kids , not leaving them in childcare while they move up the career ladder . désirée nick is a german entertainer , cabaret artist and author who has never been shy about expressing her opinion .
dw-world.de asked her where she stood on the topic of the role of women , and mothers , in germany . dw-world.de : désirée nick , what do you think of current attitudes for women and motherhood in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : désirée nick says germans are n't that crazy about kids désirée nick : i think it 's sick that the whole subject is being treated as it is .
of course a woman has the same right to develop her talents , abilities and possibilities just like a man does .
those who have a calling or a mission that will give their life form , who want to be independent and take advantage of everything life has to offer should n't be deprived of the right to raise children at the same time .
in germany , that is unfortunately the case .
children are presented as something bad .
in media reports , in politics , the fact that a woman has children and works is raised to the level of high drama .
how sick is that ? children have to orient themselves to the lives of their parents .
they have to be integrated into the working world of their parents .
it 's well known that the early socialization of children with others in their same age group has more benefits than time spent with mommy in between the ironing board and the washing machine . where does this image or idea come from ? oh , it 's just german .
the germans love panic and drama .
i think it 's sick that the whole subject of children is handled the way it is .
children are seen as something negative .
help !
i 'm going to have a child .
what 's going to happen to me ? !
i think such an attitude is completely on the wrong track .
the germans and their politicians badly need a course correction . the family minister , ursula von der leyen , wants to triple the number of childcare spots available so that mothers will have an easier time reentering the work force .
how do you explain the intense criticism of the plan from some quarters , particularly from more conservative ones ? i think we need to create possibilities for everything .
homosexuals and lesbians should be able to marry , because love does n't happen often enough in life .
if two people find each other , even if they are two men , they should be able to marry .
that does n't mean that i , who perhaps lives outside this milieu , also have to marry .
but the opportunity should be there . if the number of childcare spots is tripled , that does n't mean that the housewife and mother who does n't have to work will be forced to get a job .
but for those women who want to work , or who have to work , the childcare spots need to be there .
the biggest scandal of all , which is not even being discussed , is that childcare expenses are n't tax deductible .
i find that absolutely inexcusable . one german bishop who was critical of the plan said it would reduce women to the status of " birthing machines . " that 's also german , simply sick .
i 'm no friend of the germans , i have to be very clear .
i 'm a cosmopolitan , and i think after reunification , many more things should have been learned from east germany .
it was n't all bad back then .
of course , it was a horrible system , but parts of that country 's policies regarding children were positive .
they made it easy for women to go back to work after having children .
this new reunified federal republic should have incorporated some of those east german aspects .
all the things that one needs for a life that is worthwhile - a roof over your head , childcare , food , health care - all of that was taken care of in the gdr .
it 's also that way in the scandinavian countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evidently nick is no stranger to housework in germany today , these things are not being discussed .
here people say the germans are dying out , which also causes panic , but they are n't saying that because they love children .
they 're saying that because they 're afraid of not getting their pensions when they retire .
in places where children are really loved , for example , jamaica or rio , places marked by poverty , the financial situation of parents is no argument for severely limiting the number of kids you have .
germans are doing better than ever , and the better they live , the fewer children they have and the more egocentric they become . you have written a book , entitled " eva go home , " that refutes the thesis put forward by eva hermann in her own book that basically says a woman 's place is in the home .
why did you feel it necessary to write that book ? because ms. hermann 's opinion was played up throughout the media for three months .
she had a huge forum made available to her , although she occupies a very small niche , with her , yeah , almost racist , inhuman , discriminatory and inflammatory words : in short , saying that a woman belongs in the kitchen and should n't go to work .
i mean , just think about it , being a mother is one of the shortest times of a woman 's life .
children today are grown up by the time they 're 16 .
what is the woman supposed to do after that ?
that 's when the longest portion of a woman 's life begins . are eva hermann 's ideas a reaction against feminism ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1950s family of course .
she 's made feminism responsible for the decline in the birth rate .
she blames it for everything .
but she 's an amateur sociologist , a bottle-blond performer , and not a specialist .
if i want information , i 'll read a book written by a sociologist and not one by a news reader who 's written a book which turns germany into her own personal hazardous landfill site . you seem to have made it work .
you have a son and a very successful career . it 's not easy , i 'll tell you that .
equality for women demands a lot .
on the other side , i can only shrug my shoulders and point to a lot of woman who have achieved the same thing men have , just having to do it walking backwards and in high heels . it is a daily struggle .
but if you learn an instrument , a sport , do you want to be comfortable or do you want to be successful .
it 's not possible to have it both ways .
if you want something in this life , a little quality of life , you have to work for it .
i think that 's something that children can learn very well from working mothers . so what needs to happen to change these kinds of attitudes ? it 's not going to happen .
the germans are going to stay german .
the english are going to remain eccentrics , with their black humor that i love .
people in rio de janeiro are always going to be able to dance and look great on the beach , which i love even more .
and the americans are always going to have an optimistic attitude and be willing to take risks .
they have the ability to forget their failures and start over , anytime , anywhere . but if a german fails at some project , he 'll withdraw , become an alcoholic and write poetry .
an american shrugs his shoulders , says " so what , " and starts over .
that 's the way i 'm going to raise my child . kyle james interviewed désirée nick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we are still burdened by the national socialist legacy " germany is currently engaged in a heated debate over the creation of additional nursery schools .

buback was the first victim of a bloody period dubbed the " german autumn " when he was shot in his car by raf gunmen on a motorcycle in the city of karlsruhe . buback 's son michael wrote in the paper that he had reliable information from anonymous sources connected to the now-disbanded group that klar was not involved in the 1977 murder of his father . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael buback and his mother , inge , at a memorial for siegfried buback in early april klar was arrested in 1982 and sentenced for his role in multiple murders . michael buback said the information he had received indicated that klar was not his father 's murderer and had played no part in planning the attack .

the organization , which officially disbanded in 1998 , is suspected of killing 34 people . brigitte mohnhaupt , who led the raf with klar after the group 's original leaders committed suicide in jail , was released from prison in march after serving 24 years for her role in nine murders , including buback 's .

germany 's leading mass-market newspaper has joined the country 's major environment organizations in a nationwide campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . the campaign was launched this week and comes under the heading " save our earth . "
it is to be directed towards the readers of the bild newspaper , the daily with europe 's largest circulation , by way of articles and competitions to be held throughout the rest of the year . the organizers are aiming to change attitudes more than really make a substantial dent in germany 's climate-changing co2 emissions , partially by calling on readers to make their own private contributions to cutting greenhouse gas emissions . it 's a switch for the bild , which is n't known as the standard bearer of the environmentalist movement 's messages . advocates for german car industry in the past , the paper has waged campaigns against the introduction of ecology taxes on fuels and energy as well as fiercely defended germany 's automotive culture of no speed limits and powerful cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bild has n't always been concerned with cutting greenhouse gas emissions ?
anybody can makes mistakes , though , said gerhard timm from the german branch of friends of the earth -lrb- bund -rrb- , adding that the unusual alliance is not a gimmick by the tabloid to boost sales by riding the current wave of " save the planet " sentiments . " anybody can change his mind , and it 's my impression that bild has finally realized that climate change is really an important and crucial issue for mankind , " timm said . over the past few weeks , the newspaper has been running headlines along the lines of " our planet is dying " and " only 13 years left to change the world . " the paper has also highlighted the findings of the recent united nations ' scientific reports on climate change . journalists , readers need to do their part now , bild has called on its 12 million daily readers to make their own personal contributions to cutting germany 's co2 emissions . the aim is to save 3.5 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the year - a figure equivalent to the 3.5 million bild newspapers printed every day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can a newspaper convince readers to turn of the lights when they 're not home ?
florian von heintze , who is in charge of the campaign at the newspaper , admitted that the environmental organizations ' expertise and credibility are needed to make the campaign a success . " unusual circumstances require unusual measures , " heintze said . heintze said the partnership with the environmental groups evolved as a result of readers ' heightened interest in environmental issues , which led bild ' s journalists to do more than just write about climate change . heintze said the paper and its readers " share a common goal , which is to save our earth . " germans worried about climate change the campaign will be falling on fertile ground since 98 percent of germans say climate change is something to worry about . bild is planning to start a competition , in which readers can submit their stories about how they have saved energy .
the organizers said they might also crown a kind of climate king or queen . in a series of articles , the paper plans to give readers tips about how they can protect the climate - little things that can make a difference nonetheless , timm said . " in the traffic sector , you can reduce co2 emissions by turning off the engine at red lights , " he said .
" at home , you can switch off electrical devices and stop using the ' stand-by ' mode . " the campaign organizers said they are aware that reducing co2 emissions by 3.5 million tons does n't really compare with germany 's overall annual emissions of more than a billion tons . yet the mass-selling tabloid has a reputation for being able to change popular moods swiftly - so germany 's environmentalists hope the campaign will put added pressure on politicians , which could lead to a change in industry where it really matters , they said . uwe hessler -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : climate change poses serious challenge for europe the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that the world 's poorest countries will be affected most by climate change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.04.2007 " germans and their politicians badly need a course correction " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desireé nick has figured out how to combine work , family and glamour as germans discuss increasing childcare opportunities and women in the workforce , german performer désirée nick taks to dw-world.de about motherhood and climbing the career ladder in high heels . german family minister ursula von der leyen has pushed through a plan to increase the country 's childcare provision .
the aim is to make it easier for mothers to go back to work .
germany is trying to reverse a falling birth rate and it 's thought if women can find a way to successfully balance career and children , they will opt to have more kids . but the plan has met with criticism , especially from conservative circles , who say that mothers should be at home with the kids , not leaving them in childcare while they move up the career ladder . désirée nick is a german entertainer , cabaret artist and author who has never been shy about expressing her opinion .
dw-world.de asked her where she stood on the topic of the role of women , and mothers , in germany . dw-world.de : désirée nick , what do you think of current attitudes for women and motherhood in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : désirée nick says germans are n't that crazy about kids désirée nick : i think it 's sick that the whole subject is being treated as it is .
of course a woman has the same right to develop her talents , abilities and possibilities just like a man does .
those who have a calling or a mission that will give their life form , who want to be independent and take advantage of everything life has to offer should n't be deprived of the right to raise children at the same time .
in germany , that is unfortunately the case .
children are presented as something bad .
in media reports , in politics , the fact that a woman has children and works is raised to the level of high drama .
how sick is that ? children have to orient themselves to the lives of their parents .
they have to be integrated into the working world of their parents .
it 's well known that the early socialization of children with others in their same age group has more benefits than time spent with mommy in between the ironing board and the washing machine . where does this image or idea come from ? oh , it 's just german .
the germans love panic and drama .
i think it 's sick that the whole subject of children is handled the way it is .
children are seen as something negative .
help !
i 'm going to have a child .
what 's going to happen to me ? !
i think such an attitude is completely on the wrong track .
the germans and their politicians badly need a course correction . the family minister , ursula von der leyen , wants to triple the number of childcare spots available so that mothers will have an easier time reentering the work force .
how do you explain the intense criticism of the plan from some quarters , particularly from more conservative ones ? i think we need to create possibilities for everything .
homosexuals and lesbians should be able to marry , because love does n't happen often enough in life .
if two people find each other , even if they are two men , they should be able to marry .
that does n't mean that i , who perhaps lives outside this milieu , also have to marry .
but the opportunity should be there . if the number of childcare spots is tripled , that does n't mean that the housewife and mother who does n't have to work will be forced to get a job .
but for those women who want to work , or who have to work , the childcare spots need to be there .
the biggest scandal of all , which is not even being discussed , is that childcare expenses are n't tax deductible .
i find that absolutely inexcusable . one german bishop who was critical of the plan said it would reduce women to the status of " birthing machines . " that 's also german , simply sick .
i 'm no friend of the germans , i have to be very clear .
i 'm a cosmopolitan , and i think after reunification , many more things should have been learned from east germany .
it was n't all bad back then .
of course , it was a horrible system , but parts of that country 's policies regarding children were positive .
they made it easy for women to go back to work after having children .
this new reunified federal republic should have incorporated some of those east german aspects .
all the things that one needs for a life that is worthwhile - a roof over your head , childcare , food , health care - all of that was taken care of in the gdr .
it 's also that way in the scandinavian countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evidently nick is no stranger to housework in germany today , these things are not being discussed .
here people say the germans are dying out , which also causes panic , but they are n't saying that because they love children .
they 're saying that because they 're afraid of not getting their pensions when they retire .
in places where children are really loved , for example , jamaica or rio , places marked by poverty , the financial situation of parents is no argument for severely limiting the number of kids you have .
germans are doing better than ever , and the better they live , the fewer children they have and the more egocentric they become . you have written a book , entitled " eva go home , " that refutes the thesis put forward by eva hermann in her own book that basically says a woman 's place is in the home .
why did you feel it necessary to write that book ? because ms. hermann 's opinion was played up throughout the media for three months .
she had a huge forum made available to her , although she occupies a very small niche , with her , yeah , almost racist , inhuman , discriminatory and inflammatory words : in short , saying that a woman belongs in the kitchen and should n't go to work .
i mean , just think about it , being a mother is one of the shortest times of a woman 's life .
children today are grown up by the time they 're 16 .
what is the woman supposed to do after that ?
that 's when the longest portion of a woman 's life begins . are eva hermann 's ideas a reaction against feminism ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1950s family of course .
she 's made feminism responsible for the decline in the birth rate .
she blames it for everything .
but she 's an amateur sociologist , a bottle-blond performer , and not a specialist .
if i want information , i 'll read a book written by a sociologist and not one by a news reader who 's written a book which turns germany into her own personal hazardous landfill site . you seem to have made it work .
you have a son and a very successful career . it 's not easy , i 'll tell you that .
equality for women demands a lot .
on the other side , i can only shrug my shoulders and point to a lot of woman who have achieved the same thing men have , just having to do it walking backwards and in high heels . it is a daily struggle .
but if you learn an instrument , a sport , do you want to be comfortable or do you want to be successful .
it 's not possible to have it both ways .
if you want something in this life , a little quality of life , you have to work for it .
i think that 's something that children can learn very well from working mothers . so what needs to happen to change these kinds of attitudes ? it 's not going to happen .
the germans are going to stay german .
the english are going to remain eccentrics , with their black humor that i love .
people in rio de janeiro are always going to be able to dance and look great on the beach , which i love even more .
and the americans are always going to have an optimistic attitude and be willing to take risks .

the aim is to make it easier for mothers to go back to work .
germany is trying to reverse a falling birth rate and it 's thought if women can find a way to successfully balance career and children , they will opt to have more kids . but the plan has met with criticism , especially from conservative circles , who say that mothers should be at home with the kids , not leaving them in childcare while they move up the career ladder . désirée nick is a german entertainer , cabaret artist and author who has never been shy about expressing her opinion .
dw-world.de asked her where she stood on the topic of the role of women , and mothers , in germany . dw-world.de : désirée nick , what do you think of current attitudes for women and motherhood in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : désirée nick says germans are n't that crazy about kids désirée nick : i think it 's sick that the whole subject is being treated as it is .
of course a woman has the same right to develop her talents , abilities and possibilities just like a man does .
those who have a calling or a mission that will give their life form , who want to be independent and take advantage of everything life has to offer should n't be deprived of the right to raise children at the same time .
in germany , that is unfortunately the case .
children are presented as something bad .
in media reports , in politics , the fact that a woman has children and works is raised to the level of high drama .
how sick is that ? children have to orient themselves to the lives of their parents .
they have to be integrated into the working world of their parents .
it 's well known that the early socialization of children with others in their same age group has more benefits than time spent with mommy in between the ironing board and the washing machine . where does this image or idea come from ? oh , it 's just german .
the germans love panic and drama .
i think it 's sick that the whole subject of children is handled the way it is .
children are seen as something negative .
help !
i 'm going to have a child .
what 's going to happen to me ? !
i think such an attitude is completely on the wrong track .
the germans and their politicians badly need a course correction . the family minister , ursula von der leyen , wants to triple the number of childcare spots available so that mothers will have an easier time reentering the work force .
how do you explain the intense criticism of the plan from some quarters , particularly from more conservative ones ? i think we need to create possibilities for everything .
homosexuals and lesbians should be able to marry , because love does n't happen often enough in life .
if two people find each other , even if they are two men , they should be able to marry .
that does n't mean that i , who perhaps lives outside this milieu , also have to marry .
but the opportunity should be there . if the number of childcare spots is tripled , that does n't mean that the housewife and mother who does n't have to work will be forced to get a job .
but for those women who want to work , or who have to work , the childcare spots need to be there .
the biggest scandal of all , which is not even being discussed , is that childcare expenses are n't tax deductible .
i find that absolutely inexcusable . one german bishop who was critical of the plan said it would reduce women to the status of " birthing machines . " that 's also german , simply sick .
i 'm no friend of the germans , i have to be very clear .
i 'm a cosmopolitan , and i think after reunification , many more things should have been learned from east germany .
it was n't all bad back then .
of course , it was a horrible system , but parts of that country 's policies regarding children were positive .
they made it easy for women to go back to work after having children .
this new reunified federal republic should have incorporated some of those east german aspects .
all the things that one needs for a life that is worthwhile - a roof over your head , childcare , food , health care - all of that was taken care of in the gdr .
it 's also that way in the scandinavian countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evidently nick is no stranger to housework in germany today , these things are not being discussed .
here people say the germans are dying out , which also causes panic , but they are n't saying that because they love children .
they 're saying that because they 're afraid of not getting their pensions when they retire .
in places where children are really loved , for example , jamaica or rio , places marked by poverty , the financial situation of parents is no argument for severely limiting the number of kids you have .
germans are doing better than ever , and the better they live , the fewer children they have and the more egocentric they become . you have written a book , entitled " eva go home , " that refutes the thesis put forward by eva hermann in her own book that basically says a woman 's place is in the home .
why did you feel it necessary to write that book ? because ms. hermann 's opinion was played up throughout the media for three months .
she had a huge forum made available to her , although she occupies a very small niche , with her , yeah , almost racist , inhuman , discriminatory and inflammatory words : in short , saying that a woman belongs in the kitchen and should n't go to work .
i mean , just think about it , being a mother is one of the shortest times of a woman 's life .
children today are grown up by the time they 're 16 .
what is the woman supposed to do after that ?
that 's when the longest portion of a woman 's life begins . are eva hermann 's ideas a reaction against feminism ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1950s family of course .
she 's made feminism responsible for the decline in the birth rate .
she blames it for everything .
but she 's an amateur sociologist , a bottle-blond performer , and not a specialist .
if i want information , i 'll read a book written by a sociologist and not one by a news reader who 's written a book which turns germany into her own personal hazardous landfill site . you seem to have made it work .
you have a son and a very successful career . it 's not easy , i 'll tell you that .
equality for women demands a lot .
on the other side , i can only shrug my shoulders and point to a lot of woman who have achieved the same thing men have , just having to do it walking backwards and in high heels . it is a daily struggle .
but if you learn an instrument , a sport , do you want to be comfortable or do you want to be successful .
it 's not possible to have it both ways .
if you want something in this life , a little quality of life , you have to work for it .
i think that 's something that children can learn very well from working mothers . so what needs to happen to change these kinds of attitudes ? it 's not going to happen .
the germans are going to stay german .
the english are going to remain eccentrics , with their black humor that i love .
people in rio de janeiro are always going to be able to dance and look great on the beach , which i love even more .
and the americans are always going to have an optimistic attitude and be willing to take risks .
they have the ability to forget their failures and start over , anytime , anywhere . but if a german fails at some project , he 'll withdraw , become an alcoholic and write poetry .

the aim is to make it easier for mothers to go back to work .
germany is trying to reverse a falling birth rate and it 's thought if women can find a way to successfully balance career and children , they will opt to have more kids . but the plan has met with criticism , especially from conservative circles , who say that mothers should be at home with the kids , not leaving them in childcare while they move up the career ladder . désirée nick is a german entertainer , cabaret artist and author who has never been shy about expressing her opinion .
dw-world.de asked her where she stood on the topic of the role of women , and mothers , in germany . dw-world.de : désirée nick , what do you think of current attitudes for women and motherhood in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : désirée nick says germans are n't that crazy about kids désirée nick : i think it 's sick that the whole subject is being treated as it is .
of course a woman has the same right to develop her talents , abilities and possibilities just like a man does .
those who have a calling or a mission that will give their life form , who want to be independent and take advantage of everything life has to offer should n't be deprived of the right to raise children at the same time .
in germany , that is unfortunately the case .
children are presented as something bad .
in media reports , in politics , the fact that a woman has children and works is raised to the level of high drama .
how sick is that ? children have to orient themselves to the lives of their parents .
they have to be integrated into the working world of their parents .
it 's well known that the early socialization of children with others in their same age group has more benefits than time spent with mommy in between the ironing board and the washing machine . where does this image or idea come from ? oh , it 's just german .
the germans love panic and drama .
i think it 's sick that the whole subject of children is handled the way it is .
children are seen as something negative .
help !
i 'm going to have a child .
what 's going to happen to me ? !
i think such an attitude is completely on the wrong track .
the germans and their politicians badly need a course correction . the family minister , ursula von der leyen , wants to triple the number of childcare spots available so that mothers will have an easier time reentering the work force .
how do you explain the intense criticism of the plan from some quarters , particularly from more conservative ones ? i think we need to create possibilities for everything .
homosexuals and lesbians should be able to marry , because love does n't happen often enough in life .
if two people find each other , even if they are two men , they should be able to marry .
that does n't mean that i , who perhaps lives outside this milieu , also have to marry .
but the opportunity should be there . if the number of childcare spots is tripled , that does n't mean that the housewife and mother who does n't have to work will be forced to get a job .
but for those women who want to work , or who have to work , the childcare spots need to be there .
the biggest scandal of all , which is not even being discussed , is that childcare expenses are n't tax deductible .
i find that absolutely inexcusable . one german bishop who was critical of the plan said it would reduce women to the status of " birthing machines . " that 's also german , simply sick .
i 'm no friend of the germans , i have to be very clear .
i 'm a cosmopolitan , and i think after reunification , many more things should have been learned from east germany .
it was n't all bad back then .
of course , it was a horrible system , but parts of that country 's policies regarding children were positive .
they made it easy for women to go back to work after having children .
this new reunified federal republic should have incorporated some of those east german aspects .
all the things that one needs for a life that is worthwhile - a roof over your head , childcare , food , health care - all of that was taken care of in the gdr .
it 's also that way in the scandinavian countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evidently nick is no stranger to housework in germany today , these things are not being discussed .
here people say the germans are dying out , which also causes panic , but they are n't saying that because they love children .
they 're saying that because they 're afraid of not getting their pensions when they retire .
in places where children are really loved , for example , jamaica or rio , places marked by poverty , the financial situation of parents is no argument for severely limiting the number of kids you have .
germans are doing better than ever , and the better they live , the fewer children they have and the more egocentric they become . you have written a book , entitled " eva go home , " that refutes the thesis put forward by eva hermann in her own book that basically says a woman 's place is in the home .
why did you feel it necessary to write that book ? because ms. hermann 's opinion was played up throughout the media for three months .
she had a huge forum made available to her , although she occupies a very small niche , with her , yeah , almost racist , inhuman , discriminatory and inflammatory words : in short , saying that a woman belongs in the kitchen and should n't go to work .
i mean , just think about it , being a mother is one of the shortest times of a woman 's life .
children today are grown up by the time they 're 16 .
what is the woman supposed to do after that ?
that 's when the longest portion of a woman 's life begins . are eva hermann 's ideas a reaction against feminism ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1950s family of course .
she 's made feminism responsible for the decline in the birth rate .
she blames it for everything .
but she 's an amateur sociologist , a bottle-blond performer , and not a specialist .
if i want information , i 'll read a book written by a sociologist and not one by a news reader who 's written a book which turns germany into her own personal hazardous landfill site . you seem to have made it work .
you have a son and a very successful career . it 's not easy , i 'll tell you that .
equality for women demands a lot .
on the other side , i can only shrug my shoulders and point to a lot of woman who have achieved the same thing men have , just having to do it walking backwards and in high heels . it is a daily struggle .
but if you learn an instrument , a sport , do you want to be comfortable or do you want to be successful .
it 's not possible to have it both ways .
if you want something in this life , a little quality of life , you have to work for it .
i think that 's something that children can learn very well from working mothers . so what needs to happen to change these kinds of attitudes ? it 's not going to happen .
the germans are going to stay german .
the english are going to remain eccentrics , with their black humor that i love .
people in rio de janeiro are always going to be able to dance and look great on the beach , which i love even more .
and the americans are always going to have an optimistic attitude and be willing to take risks .
they have the ability to forget their failures and start over , anytime , anywhere . but if a german fails at some project , he 'll withdraw , become an alcoholic and write poetry .

" the problematic issues are mostly political .

" when the political problems are one day resolved , we will meet with the eu and it will take us half an hour to open and close those chapters . " candidates for membership are required to adopt eu norms in 35 policy areas .

" you get closer to people because they feel the same way you feel , " he added .
" if you look in their eyes you will see the same feelings you feel . " reliving the horror some of the gutenberg gymnasium pupils who lived through the massacre are still undergoing psychological treatment . " the people i 'm helping now who experienced the massacre sought psychological help very late , " said psychologist alina wilms .
" they first tried to deal with the situation on their own and at some point realized that just does n't work . " wilms also said that seeing reports of the virginia tech massacre sometimes cause victims or eyewitnesses to relive their own trauma again . calls for tighter gun controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five years ago : erfurt in grief as virginia tech students begin and the people of erfurt continue to deal with their shock , a political debate about tighter gun control law has reignited . drechsel , however , said he believes such incidents are the result of social problems rather than the availability of guns . " these people have problems , and if they are not helped , such things will happen again in america , and again in germany , " drechsel said . in comparison to the united states , germany had strict gun laws even before the erfurt shooting . in germany , all firearms must be marked and registered .
fully automatic weapons are banned , and people wanting to buy a hunting rifle must undergo background checks that can take up to a year . in virginia , although guns are widely available , they are banned on any university campus . criminals , not guns , kill people german gun lobbyist joachim streitburger said it 's people who are dangerous , not guns . " the legal gun owner is not a problem for public safety , " said streitburger .
" it 's the illegally held gun that is . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : virginia tech students are trying to terms with the killings of all the gun crimes in germany , less than 1 percent involve a legally owned gun . streitberger , from a group called " forum waffenrecht " -lrb- forum for weapons rights -rrb- , said that when a shocking killing spree takes place , politicians always leap on the issue of tighter gun controls . " after the shooting in erfurt , one proposal was that we have to prohibit every pump action gun , " said streitburger .
" the fact is that the guy who did the shooting at erfurt did n't even use the pump gun ; he had one with him but he did n't use it . " targeting legal weapons , however , wo n't stop further attacks from criminals , he added . streitburger 's arguments are in line with those of the us gun lobby , which say that to eradicate firearms completely punishes law-abiding citizens not those who break the law . as ceremonies for the victims of the virginia shooting continue in the united states , officials at the erfurt school have said a memorial service is planned for april 26 to commemorate those killed in 2002 . zoie jones -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe offers condolences for us university shooting victims the deadliest shooting rampage in us history , which left 32 dead at an american university , sent shudders around the world tuesday , setting off shock and sympathy along with questions over gun control in the usa .

germany 's leading mass-market newspaper has joined the country 's major environment organizations in a nationwide campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . the campaign was launched this week and comes under the heading " save our earth . "
it is to be directed towards the readers of the bild newspaper , the daily with europe 's largest circulation , by way of articles and competitions to be held throughout the rest of the year . the organizers are aiming to change attitudes more than really make a substantial dent in germany 's climate-changing co2 emissions , partially by calling on readers to make their own private contributions to cutting greenhouse gas emissions . it 's a switch for the bild , which is n't known as the standard bearer of the environmentalist movement 's messages . advocates for german car industry in the past , the paper has waged campaigns against the introduction of ecology taxes on fuels and energy as well as fiercely defended germany 's automotive culture of no speed limits and powerful cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bild has n't always been concerned with cutting greenhouse gas emissions ?

" anybody can change his mind , and it 's my impression that bild has finally realized that climate change is really an important and crucial issue for mankind , " timm said . over the past few weeks , the newspaper has been running headlines along the lines of " our planet is dying " and " only 13 years left to change the world . " the paper has also highlighted the findings of the recent united nations ' scientific reports on climate change . journalists , readers need to do their part now , bild has called on its 12 million daily readers to make their own personal contributions to cutting germany 's co2 emissions . the aim is to save 3.5 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the year - a figure equivalent to the 3.5 million bild newspapers printed every day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can a newspaper convince readers to turn of the lights when they 're not home ?
florian von heintze , who is in charge of the campaign at the newspaper , admitted that the environmental organizations ' expertise and credibility are needed to make the campaign a success . " unusual circumstances require unusual measures , " heintze said . heintze said the partnership with the environmental groups evolved as a result of readers ' heightened interest in environmental issues , which led bild ' s journalists to do more than just write about climate change . heintze said the paper and its readers " share a common goal , which is to save our earth .

" in the traffic sector , you can reduce co2 emissions by turning off the engine at red lights , " he said .
" at home , you can switch off electrical devices and stop using the ' stand-by ' mode . " the campaign organizers said they are aware that reducing co2 emissions by 3.5 million tons does n't really compare with germany 's overall annual emissions of more than a billion tons . yet the mass-selling tabloid has a reputation for being able to change popular moods swiftly - so germany 's environmentalists hope the campaign will put added pressure on politicians , which could lead to a change in industry where it really matters , they said . uwe hessler -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : climate change poses serious challenge for europe the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that the world 's poorest countries will be affected most by climate change .

" would it be right to say : i would rather let 10 attacks take place than try to hinder someone who perhaps does n't want to carry out an attack ? " the conservative christian democratic politician asked .
" my view is that that would be wrong . " rolf stegner , the interior minister of germany 's northernmost state , schleswig-holstein , slammed schäuble 's comments . " this suggestion is entirely out of the question , " the social democrat said , calling on schäuble not to lose track of germany 's constitution when it came to security policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble schäuble was " operating far beyond the constitution if he wanted to suspend the assumption of suspects ' innocence , " green party co-chair claudia roth said .
disagreement over scope earlier in the day , germany 's federal cabinet agreed on a bill requiring all data concerning telephone and internet connections to be saved for at least six months .
the legislation , which must now be put to the bundestag for approval , stemmed from a european union directive that all bloc members were obliged to render into national law . schäuble , however , caused discord within the governing coalition by calling for the police to be given access to digitalized fingerprints and photographs which will be used to issue electronic passports to german citizens .
" all the experts say that it 's not a matter of whether the next attack will take place , but rather a matter of when , " he told stern .
he has also said that security officials should be allowed to carry out secret online searches of private computers .
not part of plans justice minister brigitte zypries , a social democrat , rejected schäuble 's suggestion to save millions of sets of fingerprints .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries " there 's no legal basis for that at the moment and no draft either , " she said in an interview with german public broadcaster ard . next week , germany 's parliament , the bundestag , is set to discuss amendments to the passport law which have been in the works for some time , zypries pointed out , adding that there had been general agreement about what they should include . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm suggested on wednesday not every comment of the last few days should be " commented on so excitedly . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.04.2007 german paper teams up with environmentalists to save planet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will a newspaper printed on dead trees be able to save the earth ?
germany 's leading mass-market newspaper has joined the country 's major environment organizations in a nationwide campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . the campaign was launched this week and comes under the heading " save our earth . "
it is to be directed towards the readers of the bild newspaper , the daily with europe 's largest circulation , by way of articles and competitions to be held throughout the rest of the year . the organizers are aiming to change attitudes more than really make a substantial dent in germany 's climate-changing co2 emissions , partially by calling on readers to make their own private contributions to cutting greenhouse gas emissions . it 's a switch for the bild , which is n't known as the standard bearer of the environmentalist movement 's messages . advocates for german car industry in the past , the paper has waged campaigns against the introduction of ecology taxes on fuels and energy as well as fiercely defended germany 's automotive culture of no speed limits and powerful cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bild has n't always been concerned with cutting greenhouse gas emissions ?
anybody can makes mistakes , though , said gerhard timm from the german branch of friends of the earth -lrb- bund -rrb- , adding that the unusual alliance is not a gimmick by the tabloid to boost sales by riding the current wave of " save the planet " sentiments . " anybody can change his mind , and it 's my impression that bild has finally realized that climate change is really an important and crucial issue for mankind , " timm said . over the past few weeks , the newspaper has been running headlines along the lines of " our planet is dying " and " only 13 years left to change the world . " the paper has also highlighted the findings of the recent united nations ' scientific reports on climate change . journalists , readers need to do their part now , bild has called on its 12 million daily readers to make their own personal contributions to cutting germany 's co2 emissions . the aim is to save 3.5 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the year - a figure equivalent to the 3.5 million bild newspapers printed every day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can a newspaper convince readers to turn of the lights when they 're not home ?
florian von heintze , who is in charge of the campaign at the newspaper , admitted that the environmental organizations ' expertise and credibility are needed to make the campaign a success . " unusual circumstances require unusual measures , " heintze said . heintze said the partnership with the environmental groups evolved as a result of readers ' heightened interest in environmental issues , which led bild ' s journalists to do more than just write about climate change . heintze said the paper and its readers " share a common goal , which is to save our earth . " germans worried about climate change the campaign will be falling on fertile ground since 98 percent of germans say climate change is something to worry about . bild is planning to start a competition , in which readers can submit their stories about how they have saved energy .
the organizers said they might also crown a kind of climate king or queen . in a series of articles , the paper plans to give readers tips about how they can protect the climate - little things that can make a difference nonetheless , timm said . " in the traffic sector , you can reduce co2 emissions by turning off the engine at red lights , " he said .
" at home , you can switch off electrical devices and stop using the ' stand-by ' mode . " the campaign organizers said they are aware that reducing co2 emissions by 3.5 million tons does n't really compare with germany 's overall annual emissions of more than a billion tons . yet the mass-selling tabloid has a reputation for being able to change popular moods swiftly - so germany 's environmentalists hope the campaign will put added pressure on politicians , which could lead to a change in industry where it really matters , they said . uwe hessler -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : climate change poses serious challenge for europe the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that the world 's poorest countries will be affected most by climate change .

germany 's leading mass-market newspaper has joined the country 's major environment organizations in a nationwide campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . the campaign was launched this week and comes under the heading " save our earth . "
it is to be directed towards the readers of the bild newspaper , the daily with europe 's largest circulation , by way of articles and competitions to be held throughout the rest of the year . the organizers are aiming to change attitudes more than really make a substantial dent in germany 's climate-changing co2 emissions , partially by calling on readers to make their own private contributions to cutting greenhouse gas emissions . it 's a switch for the bild , which is n't known as the standard bearer of the environmentalist movement 's messages . advocates for german car industry in the past , the paper has waged campaigns against the introduction of ecology taxes on fuels and energy as well as fiercely defended germany 's automotive culture of no speed limits and powerful cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bild has n't always been concerned with cutting greenhouse gas emissions ?
anybody can makes mistakes , though , said gerhard timm from the german branch of friends of the earth -lrb- bund -rrb- , adding that the unusual alliance is not a gimmick by the tabloid to boost sales by riding the current wave of " save the planet " sentiments . " anybody can change his mind , and it 's my impression that bild has finally realized that climate change is really an important and crucial issue for mankind , " timm said . over the past few weeks , the newspaper has been running headlines along the lines of " our planet is dying " and " only 13 years left to change the world . " the paper has also highlighted the findings of the recent united nations ' scientific reports on climate change . journalists , readers need to do their part now , bild has called on its 12 million daily readers to make their own personal contributions to cutting germany 's co2 emissions . the aim is to save 3.5 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the year - a figure equivalent to the 3.5 million bild newspapers printed every day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can a newspaper convince readers to turn of the lights when they 're not home ?
florian von heintze , who is in charge of the campaign at the newspaper , admitted that the environmental organizations ' expertise and credibility are needed to make the campaign a success . " unusual circumstances require unusual measures , " heintze said . heintze said the partnership with the environmental groups evolved as a result of readers ' heightened interest in environmental issues , which led bild ' s journalists to do more than just write about climate change . heintze said the paper and its readers " share a common goal , which is to save our earth . " germans worried about climate change the campaign will be falling on fertile ground since 98 percent of germans say climate change is something to worry about . bild is planning to start a competition , in which readers can submit their stories about how they have saved energy .
the organizers said they might also crown a kind of climate king or queen . in a series of articles , the paper plans to give readers tips about how they can protect the climate - little things that can make a difference nonetheless , timm said . " in the traffic sector , you can reduce co2 emissions by turning off the engine at red lights , " he said .
" at home , you can switch off electrical devices and stop using the ' stand-by ' mode . " the campaign organizers said they are aware that reducing co2 emissions by 3.5 million tons does n't really compare with germany 's overall annual emissions of more than a billion tons . yet the mass-selling tabloid has a reputation for being able to change popular moods swiftly - so germany 's environmentalists hope the campaign will put added pressure on politicians , which could lead to a change in industry where it really matters , they said . uwe hessler -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : climate change poses serious challenge for europe the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that the world 's poorest countries will be affected most by climate change .

" we are grateful to all of the uefa executive council members for their decision to accord us the right to host the european championship , " surkis told ukrainian television . " i promise that we will do our best to hold the championship at the highest possible level , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy at the world cup in germany last year in warsaw , football fans and officials who gathered in the city center to watch the announcement on a giant television screen burst into applause and chants . " it will be our chance to show we are capable of organizing large sports events like world championships or even the olympics , " said przemyslaw gosiewski , an aide to polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . " this is our passport to enter the club of elite countries , " he added . giving eastern countries a chance in rome , the reaction was much more muted , with italian sports minister giovanna melandri saying the decision had been mainly a political one . " they wanted to open up the finals to former eastern bloc countries who are striving to fully join the european scene , " she said .
" we just have to accept it in the name of sports and now try to win on the field . " the 2012 finals will once again feature 16 teams despite uefa examining a proposal to extend it to 24 countries . greece are the current european champions having won the title in lisbon in 2004 .

the aim is to make it easier for mothers to go back to work .
germany is trying to reverse a falling birth rate and it 's thought if women can find a way to successfully balance career and children , they will opt to have more kids . but the plan has met with criticism , especially from conservative circles , who say that mothers should be at home with the kids , not leaving them in childcare while they move up the career ladder . désirée nick is a german entertainer , cabaret artist and author who has never been shy about expressing her opinion .
dw-world.de asked her where she stood on the topic of the role of women , and mothers , in germany . dw-world.de : désirée nick , what do you think of current attitudes for women and motherhood in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : désirée nick says germans are n't that crazy about kids désirée nick : i think it 's sick that the whole subject is being treated as it is .
of course a woman has the same right to develop her talents , abilities and possibilities just like a man does .
those who have a calling or a mission that will give their life form , who want to be independent and take advantage of everything life has to offer should n't be deprived of the right to raise children at the same time .
in germany , that is unfortunately the case .
children are presented as something bad .
in media reports , in politics , the fact that a woman has children and works is raised to the level of high drama .
how sick is that ? children have to orient themselves to the lives of their parents .
they have to be integrated into the working world of their parents .
it 's well known that the early socialization of children with others in their same age group has more benefits than time spent with mommy in between the ironing board and the washing machine . where does this image or idea come from ? oh , it 's just german .
the germans love panic and drama .
i think it 's sick that the whole subject of children is handled the way it is .
children are seen as something negative .
help !
i 'm going to have a child .
what 's going to happen to me ? !
i think such an attitude is completely on the wrong track .
the germans and their politicians badly need a course correction . the family minister , ursula von der leyen , wants to triple the number of childcare spots available so that mothers will have an easier time reentering the work force .
how do you explain the intense criticism of the plan from some quarters , particularly from more conservative ones ? i think we need to create possibilities for everything .
homosexuals and lesbians should be able to marry , because love does n't happen often enough in life .
if two people find each other , even if they are two men , they should be able to marry .
that does n't mean that i , who perhaps lives outside this milieu , also have to marry .
but the opportunity should be there . if the number of childcare spots is tripled , that does n't mean that the housewife and mother who does n't have to work will be forced to get a job .
but for those women who want to work , or who have to work , the childcare spots need to be there .
the biggest scandal of all , which is not even being discussed , is that childcare expenses are n't tax deductible .
i find that absolutely inexcusable . one german bishop who was critical of the plan said it would reduce women to the status of " birthing machines . " that 's also german , simply sick .
i 'm no friend of the germans , i have to be very clear .
i 'm a cosmopolitan , and i think after reunification , many more things should have been learned from east germany .
it was n't all bad back then .
of course , it was a horrible system , but parts of that country 's policies regarding children were positive .
they made it easy for women to go back to work after having children .
this new reunified federal republic should have incorporated some of those east german aspects .
all the things that one needs for a life that is worthwhile - a roof over your head , childcare , food , health care - all of that was taken care of in the gdr .
it 's also that way in the scandinavian countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evidently nick is no stranger to housework in germany today , these things are not being discussed .
here people say the germans are dying out , which also causes panic , but they are n't saying that because they love children .
they 're saying that because they 're afraid of not getting their pensions when they retire .
in places where children are really loved , for example , jamaica or rio , places marked by poverty , the financial situation of parents is no argument for severely limiting the number of kids you have .
germans are doing better than ever , and the better they live , the fewer children they have and the more egocentric they become . you have written a book , entitled " eva go home , " that refutes the thesis put forward by eva hermann in her own book that basically says a woman 's place is in the home .
why did you feel it necessary to write that book ? because ms. hermann 's opinion was played up throughout the media for three months .
she had a huge forum made available to her , although she occupies a very small niche , with her , yeah , almost racist , inhuman , discriminatory and inflammatory words : in short , saying that a woman belongs in the kitchen and should n't go to work .
i mean , just think about it , being a mother is one of the shortest times of a woman 's life .
children today are grown up by the time they 're 16 .
what is the woman supposed to do after that ?
that 's when the longest portion of a woman 's life begins . are eva hermann 's ideas a reaction against feminism ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1950s family of course .
she 's made feminism responsible for the decline in the birth rate .
she blames it for everything .
but she 's an amateur sociologist , a bottle-blond performer , and not a specialist .
if i want information , i 'll read a book written by a sociologist and not one by a news reader who 's written a book which turns germany into her own personal hazardous landfill site . you seem to have made it work .
you have a son and a very successful career . it 's not easy , i 'll tell you that .
equality for women demands a lot .
on the other side , i can only shrug my shoulders and point to a lot of woman who have achieved the same thing men have , just having to do it walking backwards and in high heels . it is a daily struggle .
but if you learn an instrument , a sport , do you want to be comfortable or do you want to be successful .
it 's not possible to have it both ways .
if you want something in this life , a little quality of life , you have to work for it .
i think that 's something that children can learn very well from working mothers . so what needs to happen to change these kinds of attitudes ? it 's not going to happen .
the germans are going to stay german .
the english are going to remain eccentrics , with their black humor that i love .
people in rio de janeiro are always going to be able to dance and look great on the beach , which i love even more .
and the americans are always going to have an optimistic attitude and be willing to take risks .
they have the ability to forget their failures and start over , anytime , anywhere . but if a german fails at some project , he 'll withdraw , become an alcoholic and write poetry .
an american shrugs his shoulders , says " so what , " and starts over .
that 's the way i 'm going to raise my child . kyle james interviewed désirée nick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we are still burdened by the national socialist legacy " germany is currently engaged in a heated debate over the creation of additional nursery schools .

the aim is to make it easier for mothers to go back to work .
germany is trying to reverse a falling birth rate and it 's thought if women can find a way to successfully balance career and children , they will opt to have more kids . but the plan has met with criticism , especially from conservative circles , who say that mothers should be at home with the kids , not leaving them in childcare while they move up the career ladder . désirée nick is a german entertainer , cabaret artist and author who has never been shy about expressing her opinion .
dw-world.de asked her where she stood on the topic of the role of women , and mothers , in germany . dw-world.de : désirée nick , what do you think of current attitudes for women and motherhood in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : désirée nick says germans are n't that crazy about kids désirée nick : i think it 's sick that the whole subject is being treated as it is .
of course a woman has the same right to develop her talents , abilities and possibilities just like a man does .
those who have a calling or a mission that will give their life form , who want to be independent and take advantage of everything life has to offer should n't be deprived of the right to raise children at the same time .
in germany , that is unfortunately the case .
children are presented as something bad .
in media reports , in politics , the fact that a woman has children and works is raised to the level of high drama .
how sick is that ? children have to orient themselves to the lives of their parents .
they have to be integrated into the working world of their parents .
it 's well known that the early socialization of children with others in their same age group has more benefits than time spent with mommy in between the ironing board and the washing machine . where does this image or idea come from ? oh , it 's just german .
the germans love panic and drama .
i think it 's sick that the whole subject of children is handled the way it is .
children are seen as something negative .
help !
i 'm going to have a child .
what 's going to happen to me ? !
i think such an attitude is completely on the wrong track .
the germans and their politicians badly need a course correction . the family minister , ursula von der leyen , wants to triple the number of childcare spots available so that mothers will have an easier time reentering the work force .
how do you explain the intense criticism of the plan from some quarters , particularly from more conservative ones ? i think we need to create possibilities for everything .
homosexuals and lesbians should be able to marry , because love does n't happen often enough in life .
if two people find each other , even if they are two men , they should be able to marry .
that does n't mean that i , who perhaps lives outside this milieu , also have to marry .
but the opportunity should be there . if the number of childcare spots is tripled , that does n't mean that the housewife and mother who does n't have to work will be forced to get a job .
but for those women who want to work , or who have to work , the childcare spots need to be there .
the biggest scandal of all , which is not even being discussed , is that childcare expenses are n't tax deductible .
i find that absolutely inexcusable . one german bishop who was critical of the plan said it would reduce women to the status of " birthing machines . " that 's also german , simply sick .
i 'm no friend of the germans , i have to be very clear .
i 'm a cosmopolitan , and i think after reunification , many more things should have been learned from east germany .
it was n't all bad back then .
of course , it was a horrible system , but parts of that country 's policies regarding children were positive .
they made it easy for women to go back to work after having children .
this new reunified federal republic should have incorporated some of those east german aspects .
all the things that one needs for a life that is worthwhile - a roof over your head , childcare , food , health care - all of that was taken care of in the gdr .
it 's also that way in the scandinavian countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evidently nick is no stranger to housework in germany today , these things are not being discussed .
here people say the germans are dying out , which also causes panic , but they are n't saying that because they love children .
they 're saying that because they 're afraid of not getting their pensions when they retire .
in places where children are really loved , for example , jamaica or rio , places marked by poverty , the financial situation of parents is no argument for severely limiting the number of kids you have .
germans are doing better than ever , and the better they live , the fewer children they have and the more egocentric they become . you have written a book , entitled " eva go home , " that refutes the thesis put forward by eva hermann in her own book that basically says a woman 's place is in the home .
why did you feel it necessary to write that book ? because ms. hermann 's opinion was played up throughout the media for three months .
she had a huge forum made available to her , although she occupies a very small niche , with her , yeah , almost racist , inhuman , discriminatory and inflammatory words : in short , saying that a woman belongs in the kitchen and should n't go to work .
i mean , just think about it , being a mother is one of the shortest times of a woman 's life .
children today are grown up by the time they 're 16 .
what is the woman supposed to do after that ?
that 's when the longest portion of a woman 's life begins . are eva hermann 's ideas a reaction against feminism ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1950s family of course .
she 's made feminism responsible for the decline in the birth rate .
she blames it for everything .
but she 's an amateur sociologist , a bottle-blond performer , and not a specialist .
if i want information , i 'll read a book written by a sociologist and not one by a news reader who 's written a book which turns germany into her own personal hazardous landfill site . you seem to have made it work .
you have a son and a very successful career . it 's not easy , i 'll tell you that .
equality for women demands a lot .
on the other side , i can only shrug my shoulders and point to a lot of woman who have achieved the same thing men have , just having to do it walking backwards and in high heels . it is a daily struggle .
but if you learn an instrument , a sport , do you want to be comfortable or do you want to be successful .
it 's not possible to have it both ways .
if you want something in this life , a little quality of life , you have to work for it .
i think that 's something that children can learn very well from working mothers . so what needs to happen to change these kinds of attitudes ? it 's not going to happen .
the germans are going to stay german .
the english are going to remain eccentrics , with their black humor that i love .
people in rio de janeiro are always going to be able to dance and look great on the beach , which i love even more .
and the americans are always going to have an optimistic attitude and be willing to take risks .
they have the ability to forget their failures and start over , anytime , anywhere . but if a german fails at some project , he 'll withdraw , become an alcoholic and write poetry .
an american shrugs his shoulders , says " so what , " and starts over .
that 's the way i 'm going to raise my child . kyle james interviewed désirée nick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we are still burdened by the national socialist legacy " germany is currently engaged in a heated debate over the creation of additional nursery schools .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.04.2007 " germans and their politicians badly need a course correction " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desireé nick has figured out how to combine work , family and glamour as germans discuss increasing childcare opportunities and women in the workforce , german performer désirée nick taks to dw-world.de about motherhood and climbing the career ladder in high heels . german family minister ursula von der leyen has pushed through a plan to increase the country 's childcare provision .
the aim is to make it easier for mothers to go back to work .
germany is trying to reverse a falling birth rate and it 's thought if women can find a way to successfully balance career and children , they will opt to have more kids . but the plan has met with criticism , especially from conservative circles , who say that mothers should be at home with the kids , not leaving them in childcare while they move up the career ladder . désirée nick is a german entertainer , cabaret artist and author who has never been shy about expressing her opinion .
dw-world.de asked her where she stood on the topic of the role of women , and mothers , in germany . dw-world.de : désirée nick , what do you think of current attitudes for women and motherhood in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : désirée nick says germans are n't that crazy about kids désirée nick : i think it 's sick that the whole subject is being treated as it is .
of course a woman has the same right to develop her talents , abilities and possibilities just like a man does .
those who have a calling or a mission that will give their life form , who want to be independent and take advantage of everything life has to offer should n't be deprived of the right to raise children at the same time .
in germany , that is unfortunately the case .
children are presented as something bad .
in media reports , in politics , the fact that a woman has children and works is raised to the level of high drama .
how sick is that ? children have to orient themselves to the lives of their parents .
they have to be integrated into the working world of their parents .
it 's well known that the early socialization of children with others in their same age group has more benefits than time spent with mommy in between the ironing board and the washing machine . where does this image or idea come from ? oh , it 's just german .
the germans love panic and drama .
i think it 's sick that the whole subject of children is handled the way it is .
children are seen as something negative .
help !
i 'm going to have a child .
what 's going to happen to me ? !
i think such an attitude is completely on the wrong track .
the germans and their politicians badly need a course correction . the family minister , ursula von der leyen , wants to triple the number of childcare spots available so that mothers will have an easier time reentering the work force .
how do you explain the intense criticism of the plan from some quarters , particularly from more conservative ones ? i think we need to create possibilities for everything .
homosexuals and lesbians should be able to marry , because love does n't happen often enough in life .
if two people find each other , even if they are two men , they should be able to marry .
that does n't mean that i , who perhaps lives outside this milieu , also have to marry .
but the opportunity should be there . if the number of childcare spots is tripled , that does n't mean that the housewife and mother who does n't have to work will be forced to get a job .
but for those women who want to work , or who have to work , the childcare spots need to be there .
the biggest scandal of all , which is not even being discussed , is that childcare expenses are n't tax deductible .
i find that absolutely inexcusable . one german bishop who was critical of the plan said it would reduce women to the status of " birthing machines . " that 's also german , simply sick .
i 'm no friend of the germans , i have to be very clear .
i 'm a cosmopolitan , and i think after reunification , many more things should have been learned from east germany .
it was n't all bad back then .
of course , it was a horrible system , but parts of that country 's policies regarding children were positive .
they made it easy for women to go back to work after having children .
this new reunified federal republic should have incorporated some of those east german aspects .
all the things that one needs for a life that is worthwhile - a roof over your head , childcare , food , health care - all of that was taken care of in the gdr .
it 's also that way in the scandinavian countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evidently nick is no stranger to housework in germany today , these things are not being discussed .
here people say the germans are dying out , which also causes panic , but they are n't saying that because they love children .
they 're saying that because they 're afraid of not getting their pensions when they retire .
in places where children are really loved , for example , jamaica or rio , places marked by poverty , the financial situation of parents is no argument for severely limiting the number of kids you have .
germans are doing better than ever , and the better they live , the fewer children they have and the more egocentric they become . you have written a book , entitled " eva go home , " that refutes the thesis put forward by eva hermann in her own book that basically says a woman 's place is in the home .
why did you feel it necessary to write that book ? because ms. hermann 's opinion was played up throughout the media for three months .
she had a huge forum made available to her , although she occupies a very small niche , with her , yeah , almost racist , inhuman , discriminatory and inflammatory words : in short , saying that a woman belongs in the kitchen and should n't go to work .
i mean , just think about it , being a mother is one of the shortest times of a woman 's life .
children today are grown up by the time they 're 16 .
what is the woman supposed to do after that ?
that 's when the longest portion of a woman 's life begins . are eva hermann 's ideas a reaction against feminism ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1950s family of course .
she 's made feminism responsible for the decline in the birth rate .
she blames it for everything .
but she 's an amateur sociologist , a bottle-blond performer , and not a specialist .
if i want information , i 'll read a book written by a sociologist and not one by a news reader who 's written a book which turns germany into her own personal hazardous landfill site . you seem to have made it work .
you have a son and a very successful career . it 's not easy , i 'll tell you that .
equality for women demands a lot .
on the other side , i can only shrug my shoulders and point to a lot of woman who have achieved the same thing men have , just having to do it walking backwards and in high heels . it is a daily struggle .
but if you learn an instrument , a sport , do you want to be comfortable or do you want to be successful .
it 's not possible to have it both ways .
if you want something in this life , a little quality of life , you have to work for it .
i think that 's something that children can learn very well from working mothers . so what needs to happen to change these kinds of attitudes ? it 's not going to happen .
the germans are going to stay german .
the english are going to remain eccentrics , with their black humor that i love .
people in rio de janeiro are always going to be able to dance and look great on the beach , which i love even more .
and the americans are always going to have an optimistic attitude and be willing to take risks .
they have the ability to forget their failures and start over , anytime , anywhere . but if a german fails at some project , he 'll withdraw , become an alcoholic and write poetry .
an american shrugs his shoulders , says " so what , " and starts over .
that 's the way i 'm going to raise my child . kyle james interviewed désirée nick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we are still burdened by the national socialist legacy " germany is currently engaged in a heated debate over the creation of additional nursery schools .
while accepted in the former communist part of the country , western germans struggle with the plan , according to an expert .

" would it be right to say : i would rather let 10 attacks take place than try to hinder someone who perhaps does n't want to carry out an attack ? " the conservative christian democratic politician asked .
" my view is that that would be wrong . " rolf stegner , the interior minister of germany 's northernmost state , schleswig-holstein , slammed schäuble 's comments . " this suggestion is entirely out of the question , " the social democrat said , calling on schäuble not to lose track of germany 's constitution when it came to security policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble schäuble was " operating far beyond the constitution if he wanted to suspend the assumption of suspects ' innocence , " green party co-chair claudia roth said .
disagreement over scope earlier in the day , germany 's federal cabinet agreed on a bill requiring all data concerning telephone and internet connections to be saved for at least six months .
the legislation , which must now be put to the bundestag for approval , stemmed from a european union directive that all bloc members were obliged to render into national law . schäuble , however , caused discord within the governing coalition by calling for the police to be given access to digitalized fingerprints and photographs which will be used to issue electronic passports to german citizens .
" all the experts say that it 's not a matter of whether the next attack will take place , but rather a matter of when , " he told stern .
he has also said that security officials should be allowed to carry out secret online searches of private computers .

the aim is to make it easier for mothers to go back to work .
germany is trying to reverse a falling birth rate and it 's thought if women can find a way to successfully balance career and children , they will opt to have more kids . but the plan has met with criticism , especially from conservative circles , who say that mothers should be at home with the kids , not leaving them in childcare while they move up the career ladder . désirée nick is a german entertainer , cabaret artist and author who has never been shy about expressing her opinion .
dw-world.de asked her where she stood on the topic of the role of women , and mothers , in germany . dw-world.de : désirée nick , what do you think of current attitudes for women and motherhood in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : désirée nick says germans are n't that crazy about kids désirée nick : i think it 's sick that the whole subject is being treated as it is .
of course a woman has the same right to develop her talents , abilities and possibilities just like a man does .
those who have a calling or a mission that will give their life form , who want to be independent and take advantage of everything life has to offer should n't be deprived of the right to raise children at the same time .
in germany , that is unfortunately the case .
children are presented as something bad .
in media reports , in politics , the fact that a woman has children and works is raised to the level of high drama .
how sick is that ? children have to orient themselves to the lives of their parents .
they have to be integrated into the working world of their parents .
it 's well known that the early socialization of children with others in their same age group has more benefits than time spent with mommy in between the ironing board and the washing machine . where does this image or idea come from ? oh , it 's just german .
the germans love panic and drama .
i think it 's sick that the whole subject of children is handled the way it is .
children are seen as something negative .
help !
i 'm going to have a child .
what 's going to happen to me ? !
i think such an attitude is completely on the wrong track .
the germans and their politicians badly need a course correction . the family minister , ursula von der leyen , wants to triple the number of childcare spots available so that mothers will have an easier time reentering the work force .
how do you explain the intense criticism of the plan from some quarters , particularly from more conservative ones ? i think we need to create possibilities for everything .
homosexuals and lesbians should be able to marry , because love does n't happen often enough in life .
if two people find each other , even if they are two men , they should be able to marry .
that does n't mean that i , who perhaps lives outside this milieu , also have to marry .
but the opportunity should be there . if the number of childcare spots is tripled , that does n't mean that the housewife and mother who does n't have to work will be forced to get a job .
but for those women who want to work , or who have to work , the childcare spots need to be there .
the biggest scandal of all , which is not even being discussed , is that childcare expenses are n't tax deductible .
i find that absolutely inexcusable . one german bishop who was critical of the plan said it would reduce women to the status of " birthing machines . " that 's also german , simply sick .
i 'm no friend of the germans , i have to be very clear .
i 'm a cosmopolitan , and i think after reunification , many more things should have been learned from east germany .
it was n't all bad back then .
of course , it was a horrible system , but parts of that country 's policies regarding children were positive .
they made it easy for women to go back to work after having children .
this new reunified federal republic should have incorporated some of those east german aspects .
all the things that one needs for a life that is worthwhile - a roof over your head , childcare , food , health care - all of that was taken care of in the gdr .
it 's also that way in the scandinavian countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evidently nick is no stranger to housework in germany today , these things are not being discussed .
here people say the germans are dying out , which also causes panic , but they are n't saying that because they love children .
they 're saying that because they 're afraid of not getting their pensions when they retire .
in places where children are really loved , for example , jamaica or rio , places marked by poverty , the financial situation of parents is no argument for severely limiting the number of kids you have .
germans are doing better than ever , and the better they live , the fewer children they have and the more egocentric they become . you have written a book , entitled " eva go home , " that refutes the thesis put forward by eva hermann in her own book that basically says a woman 's place is in the home .
why did you feel it necessary to write that book ? because ms. hermann 's opinion was played up throughout the media for three months .
she had a huge forum made available to her , although she occupies a very small niche , with her , yeah , almost racist , inhuman , discriminatory and inflammatory words : in short , saying that a woman belongs in the kitchen and should n't go to work .
i mean , just think about it , being a mother is one of the shortest times of a woman 's life .
children today are grown up by the time they 're 16 .
what is the woman supposed to do after that ?
that 's when the longest portion of a woman 's life begins . are eva hermann 's ideas a reaction against feminism ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1950s family of course .
she 's made feminism responsible for the decline in the birth rate .
she blames it for everything .
but she 's an amateur sociologist , a bottle-blond performer , and not a specialist .
if i want information , i 'll read a book written by a sociologist and not one by a news reader who 's written a book which turns germany into her own personal hazardous landfill site . you seem to have made it work .
you have a son and a very successful career . it 's not easy , i 'll tell you that .
equality for women demands a lot .
on the other side , i can only shrug my shoulders and point to a lot of woman who have achieved the same thing men have , just having to do it walking backwards and in high heels . it is a daily struggle .
but if you learn an instrument , a sport , do you want to be comfortable or do you want to be successful .
it 's not possible to have it both ways .
if you want something in this life , a little quality of life , you have to work for it .
i think that 's something that children can learn very well from working mothers . so what needs to happen to change these kinds of attitudes ? it 's not going to happen .
the germans are going to stay german .
the english are going to remain eccentrics , with their black humor that i love .
people in rio de janeiro are always going to be able to dance and look great on the beach , which i love even more .
and the americans are always going to have an optimistic attitude and be willing to take risks .
they have the ability to forget their failures and start over , anytime , anywhere . but if a german fails at some project , he 'll withdraw , become an alcoholic and write poetry .
an american shrugs his shoulders , says " so what , " and starts over .
that 's the way i 'm going to raise my child . kyle james interviewed désirée nick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we are still burdened by the national socialist legacy " germany is currently engaged in a heated debate over the creation of additional nursery schools .
while accepted in the former communist part of the country , western germans struggle with the plan , according to an expert .
-lrb- 14.04.2007 -rrb- german parents to get more daycare options germany hopes to catch up with other european countries with progressive childcare policies by providing more nursery school places in a bid to encourage mothers to work and reverse a declining birthrate .
-lrb- 03.04.2007 -rrb- german bishop slammed for calling women " birthing machines " a german bishop has sharply criticized government plans to improve childcare facilities , saying they reduce women to " birthing machines " who quickly have to return to work .

" we are grateful to all of the uefa executive council members for their decision to accord us the right to host the european championship , " surkis told ukrainian television . " i promise that we will do our best to hold the championship at the highest possible level , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy at the world cup in germany last year in warsaw , football fans and officials who gathered in the city center to watch the announcement on a giant television screen burst into applause and chants .

" this is our passport to enter the club of elite countries , " he added . giving eastern countries a chance in rome , the reaction was much more muted , with italian sports minister giovanna melandri saying the decision had been mainly a political one . " they wanted to open up the finals to former eastern bloc countries who are striving to fully join the european scene , " she said .
" we just have to accept it in the name of sports and now try to win on the field . " the 2012 finals will once again feature 16 teams despite uefa examining a proposal to extend it to 24 countries . greece are the current european champions having won the title in lisbon in 2004 .

" we are grateful to all of the uefa executive council members for their decision to accord us the right to host the european championship , " surkis told ukrainian television . " i promise that we will do our best to hold the championship at the highest possible level , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy at the world cup in germany last year in warsaw , football fans and officials who gathered in the city center to watch the announcement on a giant television screen burst into applause and chants . " it will be our chance to show we are capable of organizing large sports events like world championships or even the olympics , " said przemyslaw gosiewski , an aide to polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . " this is our passport to enter the club of elite countries , " he added . giving eastern countries a chance in rome , the reaction was much more muted , with italian sports minister giovanna melandri saying the decision had been mainly a political one . " they wanted to open up the finals to former eastern bloc countries who are striving to fully join the european scene , " she said .
" we just have to accept it in the name of sports and now try to win on the field . " the 2012 finals will once again feature 16 teams despite uefa examining a proposal to extend it to 24 countries . greece are the current european champions having won the title in lisbon in 2004 .

" the problematic issues are mostly political .
we can not cling to them and remain at a standstill , " gul told a press conference .
" when the political problems are one day resolved , we will meet with the eu and it will take us half an hour to open and close those chapters . " candidates for membership are required to adopt eu norms in 35 policy areas .
turkey can not officially close talks in any of the chapters until the cyprus dispute is resolved . eu welcomes turkish course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan met with merkel at the hanover trade fair this week " this is , of course , very much welcomed by the european commission ... and this is what is actually expected from any candidate country , " an eu spokeswoman on enlargement issues told reporters tuesday . she said , however , that it was too early for the eu 's executive body to comment on the content of the plan - essentially a program of technical reforms and a timetable for turkey to achieve them by 2013 . the spokeswoman also noted that the speed at which turkey undertakes reform would dictate how soon it joins europe 's rich club . turkey 's eu membership talks , which began in october 2005 and have been plagued with difficulties , are expected to last at least a decade , and ankara has been given no guarantee that it will even be allowed in at the end . many member nations are wary of inviting in a huge , relatively poor and mainly-muslim state which would , under eu rules , receive voting rights similar to major powers like britain or italy . aligning with eu standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , left , outlined his plan for turkey 's membership talks ending a long hiatus in the talks , the eu last month began negotiations with turkey on " enterprise and industry policy , " only the second chapter ankara has managed to open since " science and research " in june 2006 . " we maintain our goal of eu membership with determination , " gul said .
" the reforms will facilitate our negotiating process on the one hand and , on the other , raise standards in many aspects of our daily lives . " the program outlines a timetable for completing legislative amendments and other legal regulations by 2013 to align with eu standards in areas ranging from transport and food safety to customs , competition policies and the environment . turkey 's chief negotiator in the accession talks , economy minister ali babacan , said the timetable concerned only the completion of legislative work and did not include target dates for their implementation , which would be decided later on a case-by-case basis . the program will require parliament to enact about 200 pieces of legislation plus some 400 other regulations to be issued by the government , he said . turkey committed to continuing political reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : article 301 has resulted in the prosecution of intellectuals " political reforms will also continue , " babacan added .
" we will focus particularly on resolving problems that emerge on the ground in the implementation of the reforms . " gul said ankara is committed to amending article 301 of the penal code , which has resulted in the prosecution of dozens of intellectuals for " insulting turkishness " and triggered harsh eu criticism , but did not say when . turkey 's eu membership talks , which got off to a turbulent start in october 2005 , have been overshadowed by presidential elections in may and general elections scheduled for november . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and erdogan reconcile after turkish eu criticism german chancellor angela merkel met turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan in hanover and made their peace after the turkish leader made critical comments about german efforts in regard to turkey 's eu accession .

" we are grateful to all of the uefa executive council members for their decision to accord us the right to host the european championship , " surkis told ukrainian television . " i promise that we will do our best to hold the championship at the highest possible level , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy at the world cup in germany last year in warsaw , football fans and officials who gathered in the city center to watch the announcement on a giant television screen burst into applause and chants .

" this is our passport to enter the club of elite countries , " he added . giving eastern countries a chance in rome , the reaction was much more muted , with italian sports minister giovanna melandri saying the decision had been mainly a political one . " they wanted to open up the finals to former eastern bloc countries who are striving to fully join the european scene , " she said .
" we just have to accept it in the name of sports and now try to win on the field . " the 2012 finals will once again feature 16 teams despite uefa examining a proposal to extend it to 24 countries . greece are the current european champions having won the title in lisbon in 2004 .

florian von heintze , who is in charge of the campaign at the newspaper , admitted that the environmental organizations ' expertise and credibility are needed to make the campaign a success . " unusual circumstances require unusual measures , " heintze said . heintze said the partnership with the environmental groups evolved as a result of readers ' heightened interest in environmental issues , which led bild ' s journalists to do more than just write about climate change . heintze said the paper and its readers " share a common goal , which is to save our earth . " germans worried about climate change the campaign will be falling on fertile ground since 98 percent of germans say climate change is something to worry about . bild is planning to start a competition , in which readers can submit their stories about how they have saved energy .
the organizers said they might also crown a kind of climate king or queen . in a series of articles , the paper plans to give readers tips about how they can protect the climate - little things that can make a difference nonetheless , timm said . " in the traffic sector , you can reduce co2 emissions by turning off the engine at red lights , " he said .
" at home , you can switch off electrical devices and stop using the ' stand-by ' mode . " the campaign organizers said they are aware that reducing co2 emissions by 3.5 million tons does n't really compare with germany 's overall annual emissions of more than a billion tons . yet the mass-selling tabloid has a reputation for being able to change popular moods swiftly - so germany 's environmentalists hope the campaign will put added pressure on politicians , which could lead to a change in industry where it really matters , they said . uwe hessler -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : climate change poses serious challenge for europe the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that the world 's poorest countries will be affected most by climate change .

germany 's leading mass-market newspaper has joined the country 's major environment organizations in a nationwide campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . the campaign was launched this week and comes under the heading " save our earth . "
it is to be directed towards the readers of the bild newspaper , the daily with europe 's largest circulation , by way of articles and competitions to be held throughout the rest of the year . the organizers are aiming to change attitudes more than really make a substantial dent in germany 's climate-changing co2 emissions , partially by calling on readers to make their own private contributions to cutting greenhouse gas emissions . it 's a switch for the bild , which is n't known as the standard bearer of the environmentalist movement 's messages . advocates for german car industry in the past , the paper has waged campaigns against the introduction of ecology taxes on fuels and energy as well as fiercely defended germany 's automotive culture of no speed limits and powerful cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bild has n't always been concerned with cutting greenhouse gas emissions ?
anybody can makes mistakes , though , said gerhard timm from the german branch of friends of the earth -lrb- bund -rrb- , adding that the unusual alliance is not a gimmick by the tabloid to boost sales by riding the current wave of " save the planet " sentiments . " anybody can change his mind , and it 's my impression that bild has finally realized that climate change is really an important and crucial issue for mankind , " timm said . over the past few weeks , the newspaper has been running headlines along the lines of " our planet is dying " and " only 13 years left to change the world .

" would it be right to say : i would rather let 10 attacks take place than try to hinder someone who perhaps does n't want to carry out an attack ? " the conservative christian democratic politician asked .
" my view is that that would be wrong . " rolf stegner , the interior minister of germany 's northernmost state , schleswig-holstein , slammed schäuble 's comments .

the legislation , which must now be put to the bundestag for approval , stemmed from a european union directive that all bloc members were obliged to render into national law . schäuble , however , caused discord within the governing coalition by calling for the police to be given access to digitalized fingerprints and photographs which will be used to issue electronic passports to german citizens .
" all the experts say that it 's not a matter of whether the next attack will take place , but rather a matter of when , " he told stern .
he has also said that security officials should be allowed to carry out secret online searches of private computers .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries " there 's no legal basis for that at the moment and no draft either , " she said in an interview with german public broadcaster ard . next week , germany 's parliament , the bundestag , is set to discuss amendments to the passport law which have been in the works for some time , zypries pointed out , adding that there had been general agreement about what they should include . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm suggested on wednesday not every comment of the last few days should be " commented on so excitedly .

germany 's leading mass-market newspaper has joined the country 's major environment organizations in a nationwide campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . the campaign was launched this week and comes under the heading " save our earth . "
it is to be directed towards the readers of the bild newspaper , the daily with europe 's largest circulation , by way of articles and competitions to be held throughout the rest of the year . the organizers are aiming to change attitudes more than really make a substantial dent in germany 's climate-changing co2 emissions , partially by calling on readers to make their own private contributions to cutting greenhouse gas emissions . it 's a switch for the bild , which is n't known as the standard bearer of the environmentalist movement 's messages . advocates for german car industry in the past , the paper has waged campaigns against the introduction of ecology taxes on fuels and energy as well as fiercely defended germany 's automotive culture of no speed limits and powerful cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bild has n't always been concerned with cutting greenhouse gas emissions ?

" anybody can change his mind , and it 's my impression that bild has finally realized that climate change is really an important and crucial issue for mankind , " timm said . over the past few weeks , the newspaper has been running headlines along the lines of " our planet is dying " and " only 13 years left to change the world .

florian von heintze , who is in charge of the campaign at the newspaper , admitted that the environmental organizations ' expertise and credibility are needed to make the campaign a success . " unusual circumstances require unusual measures , " heintze said . heintze said the partnership with the environmental groups evolved as a result of readers ' heightened interest in environmental issues , which led bild ' s journalists to do more than just write about climate change . heintze said the paper and its readers " share a common goal , which is to save our earth . " germans worried about climate change the campaign will be falling on fertile ground since 98 percent of germans say climate change is something to worry about . bild is planning to start a competition , in which readers can submit their stories about how they have saved energy .
the organizers said they might also crown a kind of climate king or queen . in a series of articles , the paper plans to give readers tips about how they can protect the climate - little things that can make a difference nonetheless , timm said . " in the traffic sector , you can reduce co2 emissions by turning off the engine at red lights , " he said .
" at home , you can switch off electrical devices and stop using the ' stand-by ' mode . " the campaign organizers said they are aware that reducing co2 emissions by 3.5 million tons does n't really compare with germany 's overall annual emissions of more than a billion tons . yet the mass-selling tabloid has a reputation for being able to change popular moods swiftly - so germany 's environmentalists hope the campaign will put added pressure on politicians , which could lead to a change in industry where it really matters , they said . uwe hessler -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : climate change poses serious challenge for europe the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that the world 's poorest countries will be affected most by climate change .

" when i see and hear all the reports on the news about virginia tech , everything from five years ago comes flooding back , " said christiane alt , the principal of erfurt 's gutenberg gymnasium , the school where 16 people were killed by a 19-year-old student who then took his own life . christian drechsel , a pupil at the erfurt school at the time of the shooting , said he can understand how the virginia tech students must be feeling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one mourner asked " why ? " in erfurt years ago " i know the feelings of the people , and if a group of people experience the same tragedy , it kind pulls people together as if they were a family , " drechsel said . " you get closer to people because they feel the same way you feel , " he added .
" if you look in their eyes you will see the same feelings you feel . " reliving the horror some of the gutenberg gymnasium pupils who lived through the massacre are still undergoing psychological treatment . " the people i 'm helping now who experienced the massacre sought psychological help very late , " said psychologist alina wilms .
" they first tried to deal with the situation on their own and at some point realized that just does n't work . " wilms also said that seeing reports of the virginia tech massacre sometimes cause victims or eyewitnesses to relive their own trauma again . calls for tighter gun controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five years ago : erfurt in grief as virginia tech students begin and the people of erfurt continue to deal with their shock , a political debate about tighter gun control law has reignited . drechsel , however , said he believes such incidents are the result of social problems rather than the availability of guns . " these people have problems , and if they are not helped , such things will happen again in america , and again in germany , " drechsel said . in comparison to the united states , germany had strict gun laws even before the erfurt shooting . in germany , all firearms must be marked and registered .
fully automatic weapons are banned , and people wanting to buy a hunting rifle must undergo background checks that can take up to a year . in virginia , although guns are widely available , they are banned on any university campus . criminals , not guns , kill people german gun lobbyist joachim streitburger said it 's people who are dangerous , not guns . " the legal gun owner is not a problem for public safety , " said streitburger .
" it 's the illegally held gun that is . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : virginia tech students are trying to terms with the killings of all the gun crimes in germany , less than 1 percent involve a legally owned gun . streitberger , from a group called " forum waffenrecht " -lrb- forum for weapons rights -rrb- , said that when a shocking killing spree takes place , politicians always leap on the issue of tighter gun controls . " after the shooting in erfurt , one proposal was that we have to prohibit every pump action gun , " said streitburger .
" the fact is that the guy who did the shooting at erfurt did n't even use the pump gun ; he had one with him but he did n't use it . " targeting legal weapons , however , wo n't stop further attacks from criminals , he added . streitburger 's arguments are in line with those of the us gun lobby , which say that to eradicate firearms completely punishes law-abiding citizens not those who break the law . as ceremonies for the victims of the virginia shooting continue in the united states , officials at the erfurt school have said a memorial service is planned for april 26 to commemorate those killed in 2002 . zoie jones -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe offers condolences for us university shooting victims the deadliest shooting rampage in us history , which left 32 dead at an american university , sent shudders around the world tuesday , setting off shock and sympathy along with questions over gun control in the usa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 18.04.2007 " germans and their politicians badly need a course correction " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desireé nick has figured out how to combine work , family and glamour as germans discuss increasing childcare opportunities and women in the workforce , german performer désirée nick taks to dw-world.de about motherhood and climbing the career ladder in high heels . german family minister ursula von der leyen has pushed through a plan to increase the country 's childcare provision .
the aim is to make it easier for mothers to go back to work .
germany is trying to reverse a falling birth rate and it 's thought if women can find a way to successfully balance career and children , they will opt to have more kids . but the plan has met with criticism , especially from conservative circles , who say that mothers should be at home with the kids , not leaving them in childcare while they move up the career ladder . désirée nick is a german entertainer , cabaret artist and author who has never been shy about expressing her opinion .
dw-world.de asked her where she stood on the topic of the role of women , and mothers , in germany . dw-world.de : désirée nick , what do you think of current attitudes for women and motherhood in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : désirée nick says germans are n't that crazy about kids désirée nick : i think it 's sick that the whole subject is being treated as it is .
of course a woman has the same right to develop her talents , abilities and possibilities just like a man does .
those who have a calling or a mission that will give their life form , who want to be independent and take advantage of everything life has to offer should n't be deprived of the right to raise children at the same time .
in germany , that is unfortunately the case .
children are presented as something bad .
in media reports , in politics , the fact that a woman has children and works is raised to the level of high drama .
how sick is that ? children have to orient themselves to the lives of their parents .
they have to be integrated into the working world of their parents .
it 's well known that the early socialization of children with others in their same age group has more benefits than time spent with mommy in between the ironing board and the washing machine . where does this image or idea come from ? oh , it 's just german .
the germans love panic and drama .
i think it 's sick that the whole subject of children is handled the way it is .
children are seen as something negative .
help !
i 'm going to have a child .
what 's going to happen to me ? !
i think such an attitude is completely on the wrong track .
the germans and their politicians badly need a course correction . the family minister , ursula von der leyen , wants to triple the number of childcare spots available so that mothers will have an easier time reentering the work force .
how do you explain the intense criticism of the plan from some quarters , particularly from more conservative ones ? i think we need to create possibilities for everything .
homosexuals and lesbians should be able to marry , because love does n't happen often enough in life .
if two people find each other , even if they are two men , they should be able to marry .
that does n't mean that i , who perhaps lives outside this milieu , also have to marry .
but the opportunity should be there . if the number of childcare spots is tripled , that does n't mean that the housewife and mother who does n't have to work will be forced to get a job .
but for those women who want to work , or who have to work , the childcare spots need to be there .
the biggest scandal of all , which is not even being discussed , is that childcare expenses are n't tax deductible .
i find that absolutely inexcusable . one german bishop who was critical of the plan said it would reduce women to the status of " birthing machines . " that 's also german , simply sick .
i 'm no friend of the germans , i have to be very clear .
i 'm a cosmopolitan , and i think after reunification , many more things should have been learned from east germany .
it was n't all bad back then .
of course , it was a horrible system , but parts of that country 's policies regarding children were positive .
they made it easy for women to go back to work after having children .
this new reunified federal republic should have incorporated some of those east german aspects .
all the things that one needs for a life that is worthwhile - a roof over your head , childcare , food , health care - all of that was taken care of in the gdr .
it 's also that way in the scandinavian countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evidently nick is no stranger to housework in germany today , these things are not being discussed .
here people say the germans are dying out , which also causes panic , but they are n't saying that because they love children .
they 're saying that because they 're afraid of not getting their pensions when they retire .
in places where children are really loved , for example , jamaica or rio , places marked by poverty , the financial situation of parents is no argument for severely limiting the number of kids you have .
germans are doing better than ever , and the better they live , the fewer children they have and the more egocentric they become . you have written a book , entitled " eva go home , " that refutes the thesis put forward by eva hermann in her own book that basically says a woman 's place is in the home .
why did you feel it necessary to write that book ? because ms. hermann 's opinion was played up throughout the media for three months .
she had a huge forum made available to her , although she occupies a very small niche , with her , yeah , almost racist , inhuman , discriminatory and inflammatory words : in short , saying that a woman belongs in the kitchen and should n't go to work .
i mean , just think about it , being a mother is one of the shortest times of a woman 's life .
children today are grown up by the time they 're 16 .
what is the woman supposed to do after that ?
that 's when the longest portion of a woman 's life begins . are eva hermann 's ideas a reaction against feminism ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1950s family of course .
she 's made feminism responsible for the decline in the birth rate .
she blames it for everything .
but she 's an amateur sociologist , a bottle-blond performer , and not a specialist .
if i want information , i 'll read a book written by a sociologist and not one by a news reader who 's written a book which turns germany into her own personal hazardous landfill site . you seem to have made it work .
you have a son and a very successful career . it 's not easy , i 'll tell you that .
equality for women demands a lot .
on the other side , i can only shrug my shoulders and point to a lot of woman who have achieved the same thing men have , just having to do it walking backwards and in high heels . it is a daily struggle .
but if you learn an instrument , a sport , do you want to be comfortable or do you want to be successful .
it 's not possible to have it both ways .
if you want something in this life , a little quality of life , you have to work for it .
i think that 's something that children can learn very well from working mothers . so what needs to happen to change these kinds of attitudes ? it 's not going to happen .
the germans are going to stay german .
the english are going to remain eccentrics , with their black humor that i love .
people in rio de janeiro are always going to be able to dance and look great on the beach , which i love even more .
and the americans are always going to have an optimistic attitude and be willing to take risks .
they have the ability to forget their failures and start over , anytime , anywhere . but if a german fails at some project , he 'll withdraw , become an alcoholic and write poetry .
an american shrugs his shoulders , says " so what , " and starts over .
that 's the way i 'm going to raise my child . kyle james interviewed désirée nick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we are still burdened by the national socialist legacy " germany is currently engaged in a heated debate over the creation of additional nursery schools .
while accepted in the former communist part of the country , western germans struggle with the plan , according to an expert .
-lrb- 14.04.2007 -rrb- german parents to get more daycare options germany hopes to catch up with other european countries with progressive childcare policies by providing more nursery school places in a bid to encourage mothers to work and reverse a declining birthrate .
-lrb- 03.04.2007 -rrb- german bishop slammed for calling women " birthing machines " a german bishop has sharply criticized government plans to improve childcare facilities , saying they reduce women to " birthing machines " who quickly have to return to work .
the remarks even have conservatives up in arms .

" would it be right to say : i would rather let 10 attacks take place than try to hinder someone who perhaps does n't want to carry out an attack ? " the conservative christian democratic politician asked .
" my view is that that would be wrong . " rolf stegner , the interior minister of germany 's northernmost state , schleswig-holstein , slammed schäuble 's comments . " this suggestion is entirely out of the question , " the social democrat said , calling on schäuble not to lose track of germany 's constitution when it came to security policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble schäuble was " operating far beyond the constitution if he wanted to suspend the assumption of suspects ' innocence , " green party co-chair claudia roth said .
disagreement over scope earlier in the day , germany 's federal cabinet agreed on a bill requiring all data concerning telephone and internet connections to be saved for at least six months .
the legislation , which must now be put to the bundestag for approval , stemmed from a european union directive that all bloc members were obliged to render into national law . schäuble , however , caused discord within the governing coalition by calling for the police to be given access to digitalized fingerprints and photographs which will be used to issue electronic passports to german citizens .
" all the experts say that it 's not a matter of whether the next attack will take place , but rather a matter of when , " he told stern .
he has also said that security officials should be allowed to carry out secret online searches of private computers .
not part of plans justice minister brigitte zypries , a social democrat , rejected schäuble 's suggestion to save millions of sets of fingerprints .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries " there 's no legal basis for that at the moment and no draft either , " she said in an interview with german public broadcaster ard . next week , germany 's parliament , the bundestag , is set to discuss amendments to the passport law which have been in the works for some time , zypries pointed out , adding that there had been general agreement about what they should include . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm suggested on wednesday not every comment of the last few days should be " commented on so excitedly .

the aim is to make it easier for mothers to go back to work .
germany is trying to reverse a falling birth rate and it 's thought if women can find a way to successfully balance career and children , they will opt to have more kids . but the plan has met with criticism , especially from conservative circles , who say that mothers should be at home with the kids , not leaving them in childcare while they move up the career ladder . désirée nick is a german entertainer , cabaret artist and author who has never been shy about expressing her opinion .
dw-world.de asked her where she stood on the topic of the role of women , and mothers , in germany . dw-world.de : désirée nick , what do you think of current attitudes for women and motherhood in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : désirée nick says germans are n't that crazy about kids désirée nick : i think it 's sick that the whole subject is being treated as it is .
of course a woman has the same right to develop her talents , abilities and possibilities just like a man does .
those who have a calling or a mission that will give their life form , who want to be independent and take advantage of everything life has to offer should n't be deprived of the right to raise children at the same time .
in germany , that is unfortunately the case .
children are presented as something bad .
in media reports , in politics , the fact that a woman has children and works is raised to the level of high drama .
how sick is that ? children have to orient themselves to the lives of their parents .
they have to be integrated into the working world of their parents .
it 's well known that the early socialization of children with others in their same age group has more benefits than time spent with mommy in between the ironing board and the washing machine . where does this image or idea come from ? oh , it 's just german .
the germans love panic and drama .
i think it 's sick that the whole subject of children is handled the way it is .
children are seen as something negative .
help !
i 'm going to have a child .
what 's going to happen to me ? !
i think such an attitude is completely on the wrong track .
the germans and their politicians badly need a course correction . the family minister , ursula von der leyen , wants to triple the number of childcare spots available so that mothers will have an easier time reentering the work force .
how do you explain the intense criticism of the plan from some quarters , particularly from more conservative ones ? i think we need to create possibilities for everything .
homosexuals and lesbians should be able to marry , because love does n't happen often enough in life .
if two people find each other , even if they are two men , they should be able to marry .
that does n't mean that i , who perhaps lives outside this milieu , also have to marry .
but the opportunity should be there . if the number of childcare spots is tripled , that does n't mean that the housewife and mother who does n't have to work will be forced to get a job .
but for those women who want to work , or who have to work , the childcare spots need to be there .
the biggest scandal of all , which is not even being discussed , is that childcare expenses are n't tax deductible .
i find that absolutely inexcusable . one german bishop who was critical of the plan said it would reduce women to the status of " birthing machines . " that 's also german , simply sick .
i 'm no friend of the germans , i have to be very clear .
i 'm a cosmopolitan , and i think after reunification , many more things should have been learned from east germany .
it was n't all bad back then .
of course , it was a horrible system , but parts of that country 's policies regarding children were positive .
they made it easy for women to go back to work after having children .
this new reunified federal republic should have incorporated some of those east german aspects .
all the things that one needs for a life that is worthwhile - a roof over your head , childcare , food , health care - all of that was taken care of in the gdr .
it 's also that way in the scandinavian countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evidently nick is no stranger to housework in germany today , these things are not being discussed .
here people say the germans are dying out , which also causes panic , but they are n't saying that because they love children .
they 're saying that because they 're afraid of not getting their pensions when they retire .
in places where children are really loved , for example , jamaica or rio , places marked by poverty , the financial situation of parents is no argument for severely limiting the number of kids you have .
germans are doing better than ever , and the better they live , the fewer children they have and the more egocentric they become . you have written a book , entitled " eva go home , " that refutes the thesis put forward by eva hermann in her own book that basically says a woman 's place is in the home .
why did you feel it necessary to write that book ? because ms. hermann 's opinion was played up throughout the media for three months .
she had a huge forum made available to her , although she occupies a very small niche , with her , yeah , almost racist , inhuman , discriminatory and inflammatory words : in short , saying that a woman belongs in the kitchen and should n't go to work .
i mean , just think about it , being a mother is one of the shortest times of a woman 's life .
children today are grown up by the time they 're 16 .
what is the woman supposed to do after that ?
that 's when the longest portion of a woman 's life begins . are eva hermann 's ideas a reaction against feminism ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1950s family of course .
she 's made feminism responsible for the decline in the birth rate .
she blames it for everything .
but she 's an amateur sociologist , a bottle-blond performer , and not a specialist .
if i want information , i 'll read a book written by a sociologist and not one by a news reader who 's written a book which turns germany into her own personal hazardous landfill site . you seem to have made it work .
you have a son and a very successful career . it 's not easy , i 'll tell you that .
equality for women demands a lot .
on the other side , i can only shrug my shoulders and point to a lot of woman who have achieved the same thing men have , just having to do it walking backwards and in high heels . it is a daily struggle .
but if you learn an instrument , a sport , do you want to be comfortable or do you want to be successful .
it 's not possible to have it both ways .
if you want something in this life , a little quality of life , you have to work for it .
i think that 's something that children can learn very well from working mothers . so what needs to happen to change these kinds of attitudes ? it 's not going to happen .
the germans are going to stay german .
the english are going to remain eccentrics , with their black humor that i love .
people in rio de janeiro are always going to be able to dance and look great on the beach , which i love even more .
and the americans are always going to have an optimistic attitude and be willing to take risks .
they have the ability to forget their failures and start over , anytime , anywhere . but if a german fails at some project , he 'll withdraw , become an alcoholic and write poetry .
an american shrugs his shoulders , says " so what , " and starts over .
that 's the way i 'm going to raise my child . kyle james interviewed désirée nick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we are still burdened by the national socialist legacy " germany is currently engaged in a heated debate over the creation of additional nursery schools .
while accepted in the former communist part of the country , western germans struggle with the plan , according to an expert .
-lrb- 14.04.2007 -rrb- german parents to get more daycare options germany hopes to catch up with other european countries with progressive childcare policies by providing more nursery school places in a bid to encourage mothers to work and reverse a declining birthrate .

she had a huge forum made available to her , although she occupies a very small niche , with her , yeah , almost racist , inhuman , discriminatory and inflammatory words : in short , saying that a woman belongs in the kitchen and should n't go to work .
i mean , just think about it , being a mother is one of the shortest times of a woman 's life .
children today are grown up by the time they 're 16 .
what is the woman supposed to do after that ?
that 's when the longest portion of a woman 's life begins . are eva hermann 's ideas a reaction against feminism ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1950s family of course .
she 's made feminism responsible for the decline in the birth rate .
she blames it for everything .
but she 's an amateur sociologist , a bottle-blond performer , and not a specialist .
if i want information , i 'll read a book written by a sociologist and not one by a news reader who 's written a book which turns germany into her own personal hazardous landfill site . you seem to have made it work .
you have a son and a very successful career . it 's not easy , i 'll tell you that .
equality for women demands a lot .
on the other side , i can only shrug my shoulders and point to a lot of woman who have achieved the same thing men have , just having to do it walking backwards and in high heels . it is a daily struggle .
but if you learn an instrument , a sport , do you want to be comfortable or do you want to be successful .
it 's not possible to have it both ways .
if you want something in this life , a little quality of life , you have to work for it .
i think that 's something that children can learn very well from working mothers . so what needs to happen to change these kinds of attitudes ? it 's not going to happen .
the germans are going to stay german .
the english are going to remain eccentrics , with their black humor that i love .
people in rio de janeiro are always going to be able to dance and look great on the beach , which i love even more .
and the americans are always going to have an optimistic attitude and be willing to take risks .
they have the ability to forget their failures and start over , anytime , anywhere . but if a german fails at some project , he 'll withdraw , become an alcoholic and write poetry .
an american shrugs his shoulders , says " so what , " and starts over .
that 's the way i 'm going to raise my child . kyle james interviewed désirée nick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we are still burdened by the national socialist legacy " germany is currently engaged in a heated debate over the creation of additional nursery schools .
while accepted in the former communist part of the country , western germans struggle with the plan , according to an expert .
-lrb- 14.04.2007 -rrb- german parents to get more daycare options germany hopes to catch up with other european countries with progressive childcare policies by providing more nursery school places in a bid to encourage mothers to work and reverse a declining birthrate .

" the problematic issues are mostly political .
we can not cling to them and remain at a standstill , " gul told a press conference .
" when the political problems are one day resolved , we will meet with the eu and it will take us half an hour to open and close those chapters . " candidates for membership are required to adopt eu norms in 35 policy areas .
turkey can not officially close talks in any of the chapters until the cyprus dispute is resolved . eu welcomes turkish course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan met with merkel at the hanover trade fair this week " this is , of course , very much welcomed by the european commission ... and this is what is actually expected from any candidate country , " an eu spokeswoman on enlargement issues told reporters tuesday . she said , however , that it was too early for the eu 's executive body to comment on the content of the plan - essentially a program of technical reforms and a timetable for turkey to achieve them by 2013 . the spokeswoman also noted that the speed at which turkey undertakes reform would dictate how soon it joins europe 's rich club . turkey 's eu membership talks , which began in october 2005 and have been plagued with difficulties , are expected to last at least a decade , and ankara has been given no guarantee that it will even be allowed in at the end . many member nations are wary of inviting in a huge , relatively poor and mainly-muslim state which would , under eu rules , receive voting rights similar to major powers like britain or italy . aligning with eu standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , left , outlined his plan for turkey 's membership talks ending a long hiatus in the talks , the eu last month began negotiations with turkey on " enterprise and industry policy , " only the second chapter ankara has managed to open since " science and research " in june 2006 .

" we will focus particularly on resolving problems that emerge on the ground in the implementation of the reforms . " gul said ankara is committed to amending article 301 of the penal code , which has resulted in the prosecution of dozens of intellectuals for " insulting turkishness " and triggered harsh eu criticism , but did not say when . turkey 's eu membership talks , which got off to a turbulent start in october 2005 , have been overshadowed by presidential elections in may and general elections scheduled for november . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and erdogan reconcile after turkish eu criticism german chancellor angela merkel met turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan in hanover and made their peace after the turkish leader made critical comments about german efforts in regard to turkey 's eu accession .

" the problematic issues are mostly political .
we can not cling to them and remain at a standstill , " gul told a press conference .
" when the political problems are one day resolved , we will meet with the eu and it will take us half an hour to open and close those chapters . " candidates for membership are required to adopt eu norms in 35 policy areas .
turkey can not officially close talks in any of the chapters until the cyprus dispute is resolved . eu welcomes turkish course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan met with merkel at the hanover trade fair this week " this is , of course , very much welcomed by the european commission ... and this is what is actually expected from any candidate country , " an eu spokeswoman on enlargement issues told reporters tuesday . she said , however , that it was too early for the eu 's executive body to comment on the content of the plan - essentially a program of technical reforms and a timetable for turkey to achieve them by 2013 . the spokeswoman also noted that the speed at which turkey undertakes reform would dictate how soon it joins europe 's rich club . turkey 's eu membership talks , which began in october 2005 and have been plagued with difficulties , are expected to last at least a decade , and ankara has been given no guarantee that it will even be allowed in at the end . many member nations are wary of inviting in a huge , relatively poor and mainly-muslim state which would , under eu rules , receive voting rights similar to major powers like britain or italy . aligning with eu standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gul , left , outlined his plan for turkey 's membership talks ending a long hiatus in the talks , the eu last month began negotiations with turkey on " enterprise and industry policy , " only the second chapter ankara has managed to open since " science and research " in june 2006 . " we maintain our goal of eu membership with determination , " gul said .
" the reforms will facilitate our negotiating process on the one hand and , on the other , raise standards in many aspects of our daily lives . " the program outlines a timetable for completing legislative amendments and other legal regulations by 2013 to align with eu standards in areas ranging from transport and food safety to customs , competition policies and the environment . turkey 's chief negotiator in the accession talks , economy minister ali babacan , said the timetable concerned only the completion of legislative work and did not include target dates for their implementation , which would be decided later on a case-by-case basis . the program will require parliament to enact about 200 pieces of legislation plus some 400 other regulations to be issued by the government , he said . turkey committed to continuing political reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : article 301 has resulted in the prosecution of intellectuals " political reforms will also continue , " babacan added .
" we will focus particularly on resolving problems that emerge on the ground in the implementation of the reforms . " gul said ankara is committed to amending article 301 of the penal code , which has resulted in the prosecution of dozens of intellectuals for " insulting turkishness " and triggered harsh eu criticism , but did not say when . turkey 's eu membership talks , which got off to a turbulent start in october 2005 , have been overshadowed by presidential elections in may and general elections scheduled for november . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and erdogan reconcile after turkish eu criticism german chancellor angela merkel met turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan in hanover and made their peace after the turkish leader made critical comments about german efforts in regard to turkey 's eu accession .

" when i see and hear all the reports on the news about virginia tech , everything from five years ago comes flooding back , " said christiane alt , the principal of erfurt 's gutenberg gymnasium , the school where 16 people were killed by a 19-year-old student who then took his own life . christian drechsel , a pupil at the erfurt school at the time of the shooting , said he can understand how the virginia tech students must be feeling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one mourner asked " why ? " in erfurt years ago " i know the feelings of the people , and if a group of people experience the same tragedy , it kind pulls people together as if they were a family , " drechsel said . " you get closer to people because they feel the same way you feel , " he added .
" if you look in their eyes you will see the same feelings you feel . " reliving the horror some of the gutenberg gymnasium pupils who lived through the massacre are still undergoing psychological treatment . " the people i 'm helping now who experienced the massacre sought psychological help very late , " said psychologist alina wilms .
" they first tried to deal with the situation on their own and at some point realized that just does n't work . " wilms also said that seeing reports of the virginia tech massacre sometimes cause victims or eyewitnesses to relive their own trauma again . calls for tighter gun controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five years ago : erfurt in grief as virginia tech students begin and the people of erfurt continue to deal with their shock , a political debate about tighter gun control law has reignited . drechsel , however , said he believes such incidents are the result of social problems rather than the availability of guns . " these people have problems , and if they are not helped , such things will happen again in america , and again in germany , " drechsel said . in comparison to the united states , germany had strict gun laws even before the erfurt shooting . in germany , all firearms must be marked and registered .
fully automatic weapons are banned , and people wanting to buy a hunting rifle must undergo background checks that can take up to a year . in virginia , although guns are widely available , they are banned on any university campus . criminals , not guns , kill people german gun lobbyist joachim streitburger said it 's people who are dangerous , not guns . " the legal gun owner is not a problem for public safety , " said streitburger .
" it 's the illegally held gun that is . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : virginia tech students are trying to terms with the killings of all the gun crimes in germany , less than 1 percent involve a legally owned gun . streitberger , from a group called " forum waffenrecht " -lrb- forum for weapons rights -rrb- , said that when a shocking killing spree takes place , politicians always leap on the issue of tighter gun controls . " after the shooting in erfurt , one proposal was that we have to prohibit every pump action gun , " said streitburger .
" the fact is that the guy who did the shooting at erfurt did n't even use the pump gun ; he had one with him but he did n't use it . " targeting legal weapons , however , wo n't stop further attacks from criminals , he added . streitburger 's arguments are in line with those of the us gun lobby , which say that to eradicate firearms completely punishes law-abiding citizens not those who break the law . as ceremonies for the victims of the virginia shooting continue in the united states , officials at the erfurt school have said a memorial service is planned for april 26 to commemorate those killed in 2002 . zoie jones -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe offers condolences for us university shooting victims the deadliest shooting rampage in us history , which left 32 dead at an american university , sent shudders around the world tuesday , setting off shock and sympathy along with questions over gun control in the usa .
-lrb- 17.04.2007 -rrb- us shootings resurrect erfurt horror on monday , a pupil entered the red lake high school in minnesota and killed ten people .
the killings stirred painful memories in the german town of erfurt , which endured its own massacre three years ago .

4 . the four men in the dock are suspected mastermind jihad hamad , 22 , as well as khaled al-hajj dib , 19 , ayman hawwa , 22 , and khalil bubu , 23 , judicial sources said . bubu is also facing another trial for links in a bomb attack on a lebanese army barracks in beirut last year . suspects targeted german passengers at the opening of the trial last wednesday , the beirut court also issued arrest warrants for saddam al-hajj dib , who remains at large , and his brother yusef mohammed al-hajj dib , who is in custody in germany .
both are being tried in absentia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police displayed parts of the bombs contained in the suitcases at a press conference last year while yusef mohammed al-hajj dib is being detained on a german arrest warrant , the court in beirut decided to issue a lebanese arrest warrant . all six are being tried for " an attempt to carry out mass killing in two passenger trains in germany on july 31 by using incendiary materials confiscated by german authorities , " a judicial source said . if found guilty , the four suspects in custody could be jailed for a maximum period of 15 years while those in absentia could receive longer prison terms . suspect : plot linked to mohammed cartoons hamad has confessed under judicial interrogation to having placed a suitcase containing explosives on a train in germany last july , lebanese judicial sources said . " the intention was not to kill people , but to avenge any harm done to muslims after the publication in denmark of cartoons that were harmful to the prophet mohammed , " hamad was quoted as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jihad hamad has said the attacks were meant to avenge harm done to muslims by the mohammed cartoons german federal police said the publication of cartoons of the prophet mohammed in western and some arab media had been the " detonator " which pushed the gang to organise a plot to bomb german trains on july 31 . the plan failed when bombs concealed on two regional trains did not explode because of faulty detonators . german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung said last week that bomb-building instructions had been found on a deleted hard disk of a laptop computer which hamad had taken with him from germany to lebanon . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suitcase bomber confirms confession a lebanese man has reaffirmed he placed a bomb on a train in germany last year .

the aim is to make it easier for mothers to go back to work .
germany is trying to reverse a falling birth rate and it 's thought if women can find a way to successfully balance career and children , they will opt to have more kids . but the plan has met with criticism , especially from conservative circles , who say that mothers should be at home with the kids , not leaving them in childcare while they move up the career ladder . désirée nick is a german entertainer , cabaret artist and author who has never been shy about expressing her opinion .
dw-world.de asked her where she stood on the topic of the role of women , and mothers , in germany . dw-world.de : désirée nick , what do you think of current attitudes for women and motherhood in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : désirée nick says germans are n't that crazy about kids désirée nick : i think it 's sick that the whole subject is being treated as it is .
of course a woman has the same right to develop her talents , abilities and possibilities just like a man does .
those who have a calling or a mission that will give their life form , who want to be independent and take advantage of everything life has to offer should n't be deprived of the right to raise children at the same time .
in germany , that is unfortunately the case .
children are presented as something bad .
in media reports , in politics , the fact that a woman has children and works is raised to the level of high drama .
how sick is that ? children have to orient themselves to the lives of their parents .
they have to be integrated into the working world of their parents .
it 's well known that the early socialization of children with others in their same age group has more benefits than time spent with mommy in between the ironing board and the washing machine . where does this image or idea come from ? oh , it 's just german .
the germans love panic and drama .
i think it 's sick that the whole subject of children is handled the way it is .
children are seen as something negative .
help !
i 'm going to have a child .
what 's going to happen to me ? !
i think such an attitude is completely on the wrong track .
the germans and their politicians badly need a course correction . the family minister , ursula von der leyen , wants to triple the number of childcare spots available so that mothers will have an easier time reentering the work force .
how do you explain the intense criticism of the plan from some quarters , particularly from more conservative ones ? i think we need to create possibilities for everything .
homosexuals and lesbians should be able to marry , because love does n't happen often enough in life .
if two people find each other , even if they are two men , they should be able to marry .
that does n't mean that i , who perhaps lives outside this milieu , also have to marry .
but the opportunity should be there . if the number of childcare spots is tripled , that does n't mean that the housewife and mother who does n't have to work will be forced to get a job .
but for those women who want to work , or who have to work , the childcare spots need to be there .
the biggest scandal of all , which is not even being discussed , is that childcare expenses are n't tax deductible .
i find that absolutely inexcusable . one german bishop who was critical of the plan said it would reduce women to the status of " birthing machines . " that 's also german , simply sick .
i 'm no friend of the germans , i have to be very clear .
i 'm a cosmopolitan , and i think after reunification , many more things should have been learned from east germany .
it was n't all bad back then .
of course , it was a horrible system , but parts of that country 's policies regarding children were positive .
they made it easy for women to go back to work after having children .
this new reunified federal republic should have incorporated some of those east german aspects .
all the things that one needs for a life that is worthwhile - a roof over your head , childcare , food , health care - all of that was taken care of in the gdr .
it 's also that way in the scandinavian countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evidently nick is no stranger to housework in germany today , these things are not being discussed .
here people say the germans are dying out , which also causes panic , but they are n't saying that because they love children .
they 're saying that because they 're afraid of not getting their pensions when they retire .
in places where children are really loved , for example , jamaica or rio , places marked by poverty , the financial situation of parents is no argument for severely limiting the number of kids you have .
germans are doing better than ever , and the better they live , the fewer children they have and the more egocentric they become . you have written a book , entitled " eva go home , " that refutes the thesis put forward by eva hermann in her own book that basically says a woman 's place is in the home .
why did you feel it necessary to write that book ? because ms. hermann 's opinion was played up throughout the media for three months .
she had a huge forum made available to her , although she occupies a very small niche , with her , yeah , almost racist , inhuman , discriminatory and inflammatory words : in short , saying that a woman belongs in the kitchen and should n't go to work .
i mean , just think about it , being a mother is one of the shortest times of a woman 's life .
children today are grown up by the time they 're 16 .
what is the woman supposed to do after that ?
that 's when the longest portion of a woman 's life begins . are eva hermann 's ideas a reaction against feminism ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1950s family of course .
she 's made feminism responsible for the decline in the birth rate .
she blames it for everything .
but she 's an amateur sociologist , a bottle-blond performer , and not a specialist .
if i want information , i 'll read a book written by a sociologist and not one by a news reader who 's written a book which turns germany into her own personal hazardous landfill site . you seem to have made it work .
you have a son and a very successful career . it 's not easy , i 'll tell you that .
equality for women demands a lot .
on the other side , i can only shrug my shoulders and point to a lot of woman who have achieved the same thing men have , just having to do it walking backwards and in high heels . it is a daily struggle .
but if you learn an instrument , a sport , do you want to be comfortable or do you want to be successful .
it 's not possible to have it both ways .
if you want something in this life , a little quality of life , you have to work for it .
i think that 's something that children can learn very well from working mothers . so what needs to happen to change these kinds of attitudes ? it 's not going to happen .
the germans are going to stay german .
the english are going to remain eccentrics , with their black humor that i love .
people in rio de janeiro are always going to be able to dance and look great on the beach , which i love even more .
and the americans are always going to have an optimistic attitude and be willing to take risks .
they have the ability to forget their failures and start over , anytime , anywhere . but if a german fails at some project , he 'll withdraw , become an alcoholic and write poetry .
an american shrugs his shoulders , says " so what , " and starts over .
that 's the way i 'm going to raise my child . kyle james interviewed désirée nick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we are still burdened by the national socialist legacy " germany is currently engaged in a heated debate over the creation of additional nursery schools .
while accepted in the former communist part of the country , western germans struggle with the plan , according to an expert .
-lrb- 14.04.2007 -rrb- german parents to get more daycare options germany hopes to catch up with other european countries with progressive childcare policies by providing more nursery school places in a bid to encourage mothers to work and reverse a declining birthrate .

" when i see and hear all the reports on the news about virginia tech , everything from five years ago comes flooding back , " said christiane alt , the principal of erfurt 's gutenberg gymnasium , the school where 16 people were killed by a 19-year-old student who then took his own life . christian drechsel , a pupil at the erfurt school at the time of the shooting , said he can understand how the virginia tech students must be feeling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one mourner asked " why ? " in erfurt years ago " i know the feelings of the people , and if a group of people experience the same tragedy , it kind pulls people together as if they were a family , " drechsel said . " you get closer to people because they feel the same way you feel , " he added .
" if you look in their eyes you will see the same feelings you feel . " reliving the horror some of the gutenberg gymnasium pupils who lived through the massacre are still undergoing psychological treatment . " the people i 'm helping now who experienced the massacre sought psychological help very late , " said psychologist alina wilms .
" they first tried to deal with the situation on their own and at some point realized that just does n't work . " wilms also said that seeing reports of the virginia tech massacre sometimes cause victims or eyewitnesses to relive their own trauma again . calls for tighter gun controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five years ago : erfurt in grief as virginia tech students begin and the people of erfurt continue to deal with their shock , a political debate about tighter gun control law has reignited . drechsel , however , said he believes such incidents are the result of social problems rather than the availability of guns . " these people have problems , and if they are not helped , such things will happen again in america , and again in germany , " drechsel said . in comparison to the united states , germany had strict gun laws even before the erfurt shooting . in germany , all firearms must be marked and registered .
fully automatic weapons are banned , and people wanting to buy a hunting rifle must undergo background checks that can take up to a year . in virginia , although guns are widely available , they are banned on any university campus . criminals , not guns , kill people german gun lobbyist joachim streitburger said it 's people who are dangerous , not guns . " the legal gun owner is not a problem for public safety , " said streitburger .
" it 's the illegally held gun that is . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : virginia tech students are trying to terms with the killings of all the gun crimes in germany , less than 1 percent involve a legally owned gun . streitberger , from a group called " forum waffenrecht " -lrb- forum for weapons rights -rrb- , said that when a shocking killing spree takes place , politicians always leap on the issue of tighter gun controls .

" we are grateful to all of the uefa executive council members for their decision to accord us the right to host the european championship , " surkis told ukrainian television . " i promise that we will do our best to hold the championship at the highest possible level , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy at the world cup in germany last year in warsaw , football fans and officials who gathered in the city center to watch the announcement on a giant television screen burst into applause and chants . " it will be our chance to show we are capable of organizing large sports events like world championships or even the olympics , " said przemyslaw gosiewski , an aide to polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . " this is our passport to enter the club of elite countries , " he added . giving eastern countries a chance in rome , the reaction was much more muted , with italian sports minister giovanna melandri saying the decision had been mainly a political one . " they wanted to open up the finals to former eastern bloc countries who are striving to fully join the european scene , " she said .
" we just have to accept it in the name of sports and now try to win on the field . " the 2012 finals will once again feature 16 teams despite uefa examining a proposal to extend it to 24 countries . greece are the current european champions having won the title in lisbon in 2004 .

4 . the four men in the dock are suspected mastermind jihad hamad , 22 , as well as khaled al-hajj dib , 19 , ayman hawwa , 22 , and khalil bubu , 23 , judicial sources said . bubu is also facing another trial for links in a bomb attack on a lebanese army barracks in beirut last year . suspects targeted german passengers at the opening of the trial last wednesday , the beirut court also issued arrest warrants for saddam al-hajj dib , who remains at large , and his brother yusef mohammed al-hajj dib , who is in custody in germany .
both are being tried in absentia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police displayed parts of the bombs contained in the suitcases at a press conference last year while yusef mohammed al-hajj dib is being detained on a german arrest warrant , the court in beirut decided to issue a lebanese arrest warrant . all six are being tried for " an attempt to carry out mass killing in two passenger trains in germany on july 31 by using incendiary materials confiscated by german authorities , " a judicial source said . if found guilty , the four suspects in custody could be jailed for a maximum period of 15 years while those in absentia could receive longer prison terms . suspect : plot linked to mohammed cartoons hamad has confessed under judicial interrogation to having placed a suitcase containing explosives on a train in germany last july , lebanese judicial sources said . " the intention was not to kill people , but to avenge any harm done to muslims after the publication in denmark of cartoons that were harmful to the prophet mohammed , " hamad was quoted as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jihad hamad has said the attacks were meant to avenge harm done to muslims by the mohammed cartoons german federal police said the publication of cartoons of the prophet mohammed in western and some arab media had been the " detonator " which pushed the gang to organise a plot to bomb german trains on july 31 . the plan failed when bombs concealed on two regional trains did not explode because of faulty detonators . german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung said last week that bomb-building instructions had been found on a deleted hard disk of a laptop computer which hamad had taken with him from germany to lebanon . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de suitcase bomber confirms confession a lebanese man has reaffirmed he placed a bomb on a train in germany last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.04.2007 " germans and their politicians badly need a course correction " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desireé nick has figured out how to combine work , family and glamour as germans discuss increasing childcare opportunities and women in the workforce , german performer désirée nick taks to dw-world.de about motherhood and climbing the career ladder in high heels . german family minister ursula von der leyen has pushed through a plan to increase the country 's childcare provision .
the aim is to make it easier for mothers to go back to work .
germany is trying to reverse a falling birth rate and it 's thought if women can find a way to successfully balance career and children , they will opt to have more kids . but the plan has met with criticism , especially from conservative circles , who say that mothers should be at home with the kids , not leaving them in childcare while they move up the career ladder . désirée nick is a german entertainer , cabaret artist and author who has never been shy about expressing her opinion .
dw-world.de asked her where she stood on the topic of the role of women , and mothers , in germany . dw-world.de : désirée nick , what do you think of current attitudes for women and motherhood in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : désirée nick says germans are n't that crazy about kids désirée nick : i think it 's sick that the whole subject is being treated as it is .
of course a woman has the same right to develop her talents , abilities and possibilities just like a man does .
those who have a calling or a mission that will give their life form , who want to be independent and take advantage of everything life has to offer should n't be deprived of the right to raise children at the same time .
in germany , that is unfortunately the case .
children are presented as something bad .
in media reports , in politics , the fact that a woman has children and works is raised to the level of high drama .
how sick is that ? children have to orient themselves to the lives of their parents .
they have to be integrated into the working world of their parents .
it 's well known that the early socialization of children with others in their same age group has more benefits than time spent with mommy in between the ironing board and the washing machine . where does this image or idea come from ? oh , it 's just german .
the germans love panic and drama .
i think it 's sick that the whole subject of children is handled the way it is .
children are seen as something negative .
help !
i 'm going to have a child .
what 's going to happen to me ? !
i think such an attitude is completely on the wrong track .
the germans and their politicians badly need a course correction . the family minister , ursula von der leyen , wants to triple the number of childcare spots available so that mothers will have an easier time reentering the work force .
how do you explain the intense criticism of the plan from some quarters , particularly from more conservative ones ? i think we need to create possibilities for everything .
homosexuals and lesbians should be able to marry , because love does n't happen often enough in life .
if two people find each other , even if they are two men , they should be able to marry .
that does n't mean that i , who perhaps lives outside this milieu , also have to marry .
but the opportunity should be there . if the number of childcare spots is tripled , that does n't mean that the housewife and mother who does n't have to work will be forced to get a job .
but for those women who want to work , or who have to work , the childcare spots need to be there .
the biggest scandal of all , which is not even being discussed , is that childcare expenses are n't tax deductible .
i find that absolutely inexcusable . one german bishop who was critical of the plan said it would reduce women to the status of " birthing machines . " that 's also german , simply sick .
i 'm no friend of the germans , i have to be very clear .
i 'm a cosmopolitan , and i think after reunification , many more things should have been learned from east germany .
it was n't all bad back then .
of course , it was a horrible system , but parts of that country 's policies regarding children were positive .
they made it easy for women to go back to work after having children .
this new reunified federal republic should have incorporated some of those east german aspects .
all the things that one needs for a life that is worthwhile - a roof over your head , childcare , food , health care - all of that was taken care of in the gdr .
it 's also that way in the scandinavian countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evidently nick is no stranger to housework in germany today , these things are not being discussed .
here people say the germans are dying out , which also causes panic , but they are n't saying that because they love children .
they 're saying that because they 're afraid of not getting their pensions when they retire .
in places where children are really loved , for example , jamaica or rio , places marked by poverty , the financial situation of parents is no argument for severely limiting the number of kids you have .
germans are doing better than ever , and the better they live , the fewer children they have and the more egocentric they become . you have written a book , entitled " eva go home , " that refutes the thesis put forward by eva hermann in her own book that basically says a woman 's place is in the home .
why did you feel it necessary to write that book ? because ms. hermann 's opinion was played up throughout the media for three months .
she had a huge forum made available to her , although she occupies a very small niche , with her , yeah , almost racist , inhuman , discriminatory and inflammatory words : in short , saying that a woman belongs in the kitchen and should n't go to work .
i mean , just think about it , being a mother is one of the shortest times of a woman 's life .
children today are grown up by the time they 're 16 .
what is the woman supposed to do after that ?
that 's when the longest portion of a woman 's life begins . are eva hermann 's ideas a reaction against feminism ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1950s family of course .
she 's made feminism responsible for the decline in the birth rate .
she blames it for everything .
but she 's an amateur sociologist , a bottle-blond performer , and not a specialist .
if i want information , i 'll read a book written by a sociologist and not one by a news reader who 's written a book which turns germany into her own personal hazardous landfill site . you seem to have made it work .
you have a son and a very successful career . it 's not easy , i 'll tell you that .
equality for women demands a lot .
on the other side , i can only shrug my shoulders and point to a lot of woman who have achieved the same thing men have , just having to do it walking backwards and in high heels . it is a daily struggle .
but if you learn an instrument , a sport , do you want to be comfortable or do you want to be successful .
it 's not possible to have it both ways .
if you want something in this life , a little quality of life , you have to work for it .
i think that 's something that children can learn very well from working mothers . so what needs to happen to change these kinds of attitudes ? it 's not going to happen .
the germans are going to stay german .
the english are going to remain eccentrics , with their black humor that i love .
people in rio de janeiro are always going to be able to dance and look great on the beach , which i love even more .
and the americans are always going to have an optimistic attitude and be willing to take risks .
they have the ability to forget their failures and start over , anytime , anywhere . but if a german fails at some project , he 'll withdraw , become an alcoholic and write poetry .
an american shrugs his shoulders , says " so what , " and starts over .
that 's the way i 'm going to raise my child . kyle james interviewed désirée nick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we are still burdened by the national socialist legacy " germany is currently engaged in a heated debate over the creation of additional nursery schools .
while accepted in the former communist part of the country , western germans struggle with the plan , according to an expert .

" when i see and hear all the reports on the news about virginia tech , everything from five years ago comes flooding back , " said christiane alt , the principal of erfurt 's gutenberg gymnasium , the school where 16 people were killed by a 19-year-old student who then took his own life . christian drechsel , a pupil at the erfurt school at the time of the shooting , said he can understand how the virginia tech students must be feeling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one mourner asked " why ? " in erfurt years ago " i know the feelings of the people , and if a group of people experience the same tragedy , it kind pulls people together as if they were a family , " drechsel said . " you get closer to people because they feel the same way you feel , " he added .
" if you look in their eyes you will see the same feelings you feel . " reliving the horror some of the gutenberg gymnasium pupils who lived through the massacre are still undergoing psychological treatment . " the people i 'm helping now who experienced the massacre sought psychological help very late , " said psychologist alina wilms .
" they first tried to deal with the situation on their own and at some point realized that just does n't work . " wilms also said that seeing reports of the virginia tech massacre sometimes cause victims or eyewitnesses to relive their own trauma again . calls for tighter gun controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five years ago : erfurt in grief as virginia tech students begin and the people of erfurt continue to deal with their shock , a political debate about tighter gun control law has reignited . drechsel , however , said he believes such incidents are the result of social problems rather than the availability of guns . " these people have problems , and if they are not helped , such things will happen again in america , and again in germany , " drechsel said . in comparison to the united states , germany had strict gun laws even before the erfurt shooting . in germany , all firearms must be marked and registered .
fully automatic weapons are banned , and people wanting to buy a hunting rifle must undergo background checks that can take up to a year . in virginia , although guns are widely available , they are banned on any university campus . criminals , not guns , kill people german gun lobbyist joachim streitburger said it 's people who are dangerous , not guns . " the legal gun owner is not a problem for public safety , " said streitburger .
" it 's the illegally held gun that is . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : virginia tech students are trying to terms with the killings of all the gun crimes in germany , less than 1 percent involve a legally owned gun . streitberger , from a group called " forum waffenrecht " -lrb- forum for weapons rights -rrb- , said that when a shocking killing spree takes place , politicians always leap on the issue of tighter gun controls . " after the shooting in erfurt , one proposal was that we have to prohibit every pump action gun , " said streitburger .
" the fact is that the guy who did the shooting at erfurt did n't even use the pump gun ; he had one with him but he did n't use it . " targeting legal weapons , however , wo n't stop further attacks from criminals , he added . streitburger 's arguments are in line with those of the us gun lobby , which say that to eradicate firearms completely punishes law-abiding citizens not those who break the law . as ceremonies for the victims of the virginia shooting continue in the united states , officials at the erfurt school have said a memorial service is planned for april 26 to commemorate those killed in 2002 . zoie jones -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe offers condolences for us university shooting victims the deadliest shooting rampage in us history , which left 32 dead at an american university , sent shudders around the world tuesday , setting off shock and sympathy along with questions over gun control in the usa .

buback was the first victim of a bloody period dubbed the " german autumn " when he was shot in his car by raf gunmen on a motorcycle in the city of karlsruhe . buback 's son michael wrote in the paper that he had reliable information from anonymous sources connected to the now-disbanded group that klar was not involved in the 1977 murder of his father . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael buback and his mother , inge , at a memorial for siegfried buback in early april klar was arrested in 1982 and sentenced for his role in multiple murders . michael buback said the information he had received indicated that klar was not his father 's murderer and had played no part in planning the attack . " naturally i must be skeptical about information from such sources , " he wrote in the paper wednesday .
" it could intentionally or unintentionally be false , but it could also be true . " clemency rejected after speech the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang after its founders andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , mounted a violent campaign against what it considered was the oppressive capitalist state of west germany from 1977 to 1982 .
it targeted the german elite and the us military based in germany .

germany 's leading mass-market newspaper has joined the country 's major environment organizations in a nationwide campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . the campaign was launched this week and comes under the heading " save our earth . "
it is to be directed towards the readers of the bild newspaper , the daily with europe 's largest circulation , by way of articles and competitions to be held throughout the rest of the year . the organizers are aiming to change attitudes more than really make a substantial dent in germany 's climate-changing co2 emissions , partially by calling on readers to make their own private contributions to cutting greenhouse gas emissions . it 's a switch for the bild , which is n't known as the standard bearer of the environmentalist movement 's messages . advocates for german car industry in the past , the paper has waged campaigns against the introduction of ecology taxes on fuels and energy as well as fiercely defended germany 's automotive culture of no speed limits and powerful cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bild has n't always been concerned with cutting greenhouse gas emissions ?
anybody can makes mistakes , though , said gerhard timm from the german branch of friends of the earth -lrb- bund -rrb- , adding that the unusual alliance is not a gimmick by the tabloid to boost sales by riding the current wave of " save the planet " sentiments . " anybody can change his mind , and it 's my impression that bild has finally realized that climate change is really an important and crucial issue for mankind , " timm said . over the past few weeks , the newspaper has been running headlines along the lines of " our planet is dying " and " only 13 years left to change the world . " the paper has also highlighted the findings of the recent united nations ' scientific reports on climate change . journalists , readers need to do their part now , bild has called on its 12 million daily readers to make their own personal contributions to cutting germany 's co2 emissions . the aim is to save 3.5 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the year - a figure equivalent to the 3.5 million bild newspapers printed every day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can a newspaper convince readers to turn of the lights when they 're not home ?
florian von heintze , who is in charge of the campaign at the newspaper , admitted that the environmental organizations ' expertise and credibility are needed to make the campaign a success . " unusual circumstances require unusual measures , " heintze said . heintze said the partnership with the environmental groups evolved as a result of readers ' heightened interest in environmental issues , which led bild ' s journalists to do more than just write about climate change . heintze said the paper and its readers " share a common goal , which is to save our earth . " germans worried about climate change the campaign will be falling on fertile ground since 98 percent of germans say climate change is something to worry about . bild is planning to start a competition , in which readers can submit their stories about how they have saved energy .
the organizers said they might also crown a kind of climate king or queen . in a series of articles , the paper plans to give readers tips about how they can protect the climate - little things that can make a difference nonetheless , timm said . " in the traffic sector , you can reduce co2 emissions by turning off the engine at red lights , " he said .
" at home , you can switch off electrical devices and stop using the ' stand-by ' mode . " the campaign organizers said they are aware that reducing co2 emissions by 3.5 million tons does n't really compare with germany 's overall annual emissions of more than a billion tons . yet the mass-selling tabloid has a reputation for being able to change popular moods swiftly - so germany 's environmentalists hope the campaign will put added pressure on politicians , which could lead to a change in industry where it really matters , they said . uwe hessler -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : climate change poses serious challenge for europe the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that the world 's poorest countries will be affected most by climate change .

germany 's leading mass-market newspaper has joined the country 's major environment organizations in a nationwide campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . the campaign was launched this week and comes under the heading " save our earth . "
it is to be directed towards the readers of the bild newspaper , the daily with europe 's largest circulation , by way of articles and competitions to be held throughout the rest of the year . the organizers are aiming to change attitudes more than really make a substantial dent in germany 's climate-changing co2 emissions , partially by calling on readers to make their own private contributions to cutting greenhouse gas emissions . it 's a switch for the bild , which is n't known as the standard bearer of the environmentalist movement 's messages . advocates for german car industry in the past , the paper has waged campaigns against the introduction of ecology taxes on fuels and energy as well as fiercely defended germany 's automotive culture of no speed limits and powerful cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bild has n't always been concerned with cutting greenhouse gas emissions ?
anybody can makes mistakes , though , said gerhard timm from the german branch of friends of the earth -lrb- bund -rrb- , adding that the unusual alliance is not a gimmick by the tabloid to boost sales by riding the current wave of " save the planet " sentiments . " anybody can change his mind , and it 's my impression that bild has finally realized that climate change is really an important and crucial issue for mankind , " timm said . over the past few weeks , the newspaper has been running headlines along the lines of " our planet is dying " and " only 13 years left to change the world . " the paper has also highlighted the findings of the recent united nations ' scientific reports on climate change . journalists , readers need to do their part now , bild has called on its 12 million daily readers to make their own personal contributions to cutting germany 's co2 emissions . the aim is to save 3.5 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the year - a figure equivalent to the 3.5 million bild newspapers printed every day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can a newspaper convince readers to turn of the lights when they 're not home ?
florian von heintze , who is in charge of the campaign at the newspaper , admitted that the environmental organizations ' expertise and credibility are needed to make the campaign a success . " unusual circumstances require unusual measures , " heintze said . heintze said the partnership with the environmental groups evolved as a result of readers ' heightened interest in environmental issues , which led bild ' s journalists to do more than just write about climate change . heintze said the paper and its readers " share a common goal , which is to save our earth . " germans worried about climate change the campaign will be falling on fertile ground since 98 percent of germans say climate change is something to worry about . bild is planning to start a competition , in which readers can submit their stories about how they have saved energy .
the organizers said they might also crown a kind of climate king or queen . in a series of articles , the paper plans to give readers tips about how they can protect the climate - little things that can make a difference nonetheless , timm said . " in the traffic sector , you can reduce co2 emissions by turning off the engine at red lights , " he said .
" at home , you can switch off electrical devices and stop using the ' stand-by ' mode . " the campaign organizers said they are aware that reducing co2 emissions by 3.5 million tons does n't really compare with germany 's overall annual emissions of more than a billion tons . yet the mass-selling tabloid has a reputation for being able to change popular moods swiftly - so germany 's environmentalists hope the campaign will put added pressure on politicians , which could lead to a change in industry where it really matters , they said . uwe hessler -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : climate change poses serious challenge for europe the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that the world 's poorest countries will be affected most by climate change .

germany 's leading mass-market newspaper has joined the country 's major environment organizations in a nationwide campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . the campaign was launched this week and comes under the heading " save our earth . "
it is to be directed towards the readers of the bild newspaper , the daily with europe 's largest circulation , by way of articles and competitions to be held throughout the rest of the year . the organizers are aiming to change attitudes more than really make a substantial dent in germany 's climate-changing co2 emissions , partially by calling on readers to make their own private contributions to cutting greenhouse gas emissions . it 's a switch for the bild , which is n't known as the standard bearer of the environmentalist movement 's messages . advocates for german car industry in the past , the paper has waged campaigns against the introduction of ecology taxes on fuels and energy as well as fiercely defended germany 's automotive culture of no speed limits and powerful cars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bild has n't always been concerned with cutting greenhouse gas emissions ?
anybody can makes mistakes , though , said gerhard timm from the german branch of friends of the earth -lrb- bund -rrb- , adding that the unusual alliance is not a gimmick by the tabloid to boost sales by riding the current wave of " save the planet " sentiments . " anybody can change his mind , and it 's my impression that bild has finally realized that climate change is really an important and crucial issue for mankind , " timm said . over the past few weeks , the newspaper has been running headlines along the lines of " our planet is dying " and " only 13 years left to change the world . " the paper has also highlighted the findings of the recent united nations ' scientific reports on climate change . journalists , readers need to do their part now , bild has called on its 12 million daily readers to make their own personal contributions to cutting germany 's co2 emissions . the aim is to save 3.5 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the year - a figure equivalent to the 3.5 million bild newspapers printed every day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can a newspaper convince readers to turn of the lights when they 're not home ?
florian von heintze , who is in charge of the campaign at the newspaper , admitted that the environmental organizations ' expertise and credibility are needed to make the campaign a success . " unusual circumstances require unusual measures , " heintze said . heintze said the partnership with the environmental groups evolved as a result of readers ' heightened interest in environmental issues , which led bild ' s journalists to do more than just write about climate change . heintze said the paper and its readers " share a common goal , which is to save our earth . " germans worried about climate change the campaign will be falling on fertile ground since 98 percent of germans say climate change is something to worry about . bild is planning to start a competition , in which readers can submit their stories about how they have saved energy .
the organizers said they might also crown a kind of climate king or queen . in a series of articles , the paper plans to give readers tips about how they can protect the climate - little things that can make a difference nonetheless , timm said . " in the traffic sector , you can reduce co2 emissions by turning off the engine at red lights , " he said .
" at home , you can switch off electrical devices and stop using the ' stand-by ' mode . " the campaign organizers said they are aware that reducing co2 emissions by 3.5 million tons does n't really compare with germany 's overall annual emissions of more than a billion tons . yet the mass-selling tabloid has a reputation for being able to change popular moods swiftly - so germany 's environmentalists hope the campaign will put added pressure on politicians , which could lead to a change in industry where it really matters , they said . uwe hessler -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : report : climate change poses serious challenge for europe the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that the world 's poorest countries will be affected most by climate change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 18.04.2007 " germans and their politicians badly need a course correction " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desireé nick has figured out how to combine work , family and glamour as germans discuss increasing childcare opportunities and women in the workforce , german performer désirée nick taks to dw-world.de about motherhood and climbing the career ladder in high heels . german family minister ursula von der leyen has pushed through a plan to increase the country 's childcare provision .
the aim is to make it easier for mothers to go back to work .
germany is trying to reverse a falling birth rate and it 's thought if women can find a way to successfully balance career and children , they will opt to have more kids . but the plan has met with criticism , especially from conservative circles , who say that mothers should be at home with the kids , not leaving them in childcare while they move up the career ladder . désirée nick is a german entertainer , cabaret artist and author who has never been shy about expressing her opinion .
dw-world.de asked her where she stood on the topic of the role of women , and mothers , in germany . dw-world.de : désirée nick , what do you think of current attitudes for women and motherhood in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : désirée nick says germans are n't that crazy about kids désirée nick : i think it 's sick that the whole subject is being treated as it is .
of course a woman has the same right to develop her talents , abilities and possibilities just like a man does .
those who have a calling or a mission that will give their life form , who want to be independent and take advantage of everything life has to offer should n't be deprived of the right to raise children at the same time .
in germany , that is unfortunately the case .
children are presented as something bad .
in media reports , in politics , the fact that a woman has children and works is raised to the level of high drama .
how sick is that ? children have to orient themselves to the lives of their parents .
they have to be integrated into the working world of their parents .
it 's well known that the early socialization of children with others in their same age group has more benefits than time spent with mommy in between the ironing board and the washing machine . where does this image or idea come from ? oh , it 's just german .
the germans love panic and drama .
i think it 's sick that the whole subject of children is handled the way it is .
children are seen as something negative .
help !
i 'm going to have a child .
what 's going to happen to me ? !
i think such an attitude is completely on the wrong track .
the germans and their politicians badly need a course correction . the family minister , ursula von der leyen , wants to triple the number of childcare spots available so that mothers will have an easier time reentering the work force .
how do you explain the intense criticism of the plan from some quarters , particularly from more conservative ones ? i think we need to create possibilities for everything .
homosexuals and lesbians should be able to marry , because love does n't happen often enough in life .
if two people find each other , even if they are two men , they should be able to marry .
that does n't mean that i , who perhaps lives outside this milieu , also have to marry .
but the opportunity should be there . if the number of childcare spots is tripled , that does n't mean that the housewife and mother who does n't have to work will be forced to get a job .
but for those women who want to work , or who have to work , the childcare spots need to be there .
the biggest scandal of all , which is not even being discussed , is that childcare expenses are n't tax deductible .
i find that absolutely inexcusable . one german bishop who was critical of the plan said it would reduce women to the status of " birthing machines . " that 's also german , simply sick .
i 'm no friend of the germans , i have to be very clear .
i 'm a cosmopolitan , and i think after reunification , many more things should have been learned from east germany .
it was n't all bad back then .
of course , it was a horrible system , but parts of that country 's policies regarding children were positive .
they made it easy for women to go back to work after having children .
this new reunified federal republic should have incorporated some of those east german aspects .
all the things that one needs for a life that is worthwhile - a roof over your head , childcare , food , health care - all of that was taken care of in the gdr .
it 's also that way in the scandinavian countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evidently nick is no stranger to housework in germany today , these things are not being discussed .
here people say the germans are dying out , which also causes panic , but they are n't saying that because they love children .
they 're saying that because they 're afraid of not getting their pensions when they retire .
in places where children are really loved , for example , jamaica or rio , places marked by poverty , the financial situation of parents is no argument for severely limiting the number of kids you have .
germans are doing better than ever , and the better they live , the fewer children they have and the more egocentric they become . you have written a book , entitled " eva go home , " that refutes the thesis put forward by eva hermann in her own book that basically says a woman 's place is in the home .
why did you feel it necessary to write that book ? because ms. hermann 's opinion was played up throughout the media for three months .
she had a huge forum made available to her , although she occupies a very small niche , with her , yeah , almost racist , inhuman , discriminatory and inflammatory words : in short , saying that a woman belongs in the kitchen and should n't go to work .
i mean , just think about it , being a mother is one of the shortest times of a woman 's life .
children today are grown up by the time they 're 16 .
what is the woman supposed to do after that ?
that 's when the longest portion of a woman 's life begins . are eva hermann 's ideas a reaction against feminism ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1950s family of course .
she 's made feminism responsible for the decline in the birth rate .
she blames it for everything .
but she 's an amateur sociologist , a bottle-blond performer , and not a specialist .
if i want information , i 'll read a book written by a sociologist and not one by a news reader who 's written a book which turns germany into her own personal hazardous landfill site . you seem to have made it work .
you have a son and a very successful career . it 's not easy , i 'll tell you that .
equality for women demands a lot .
on the other side , i can only shrug my shoulders and point to a lot of woman who have achieved the same thing men have , just having to do it walking backwards and in high heels . it is a daily struggle .
but if you learn an instrument , a sport , do you want to be comfortable or do you want to be successful .
it 's not possible to have it both ways .
if you want something in this life , a little quality of life , you have to work for it .
i think that 's something that children can learn very well from working mothers . so what needs to happen to change these kinds of attitudes ? it 's not going to happen .
the germans are going to stay german .
the english are going to remain eccentrics , with their black humor that i love .
people in rio de janeiro are always going to be able to dance and look great on the beach , which i love even more .
and the americans are always going to have an optimistic attitude and be willing to take risks .
they have the ability to forget their failures and start over , anytime , anywhere . but if a german fails at some project , he 'll withdraw , become an alcoholic and write poetry .
an american shrugs his shoulders , says " so what , " and starts over .
that 's the way i 'm going to raise my child . kyle james interviewed désirée nick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : " we are still burdened by the national socialist legacy " germany is currently engaged in a heated debate over the creation of additional nursery schools .
while accepted in the former communist part of the country , western germans struggle with the plan , according to an expert .
-lrb- 14.04.2007 -rrb- dw-world : german parents to get more daycare options germany hopes to catch up with other european countries with progressive childcare policies by providing more nursery school places in a bid to encourage mothers to work and reverse a declining birthrate .

a computer model set up to simulate air quality in 2020 found that in some areas ozone levels would increase if all cars were run on bioethanol .
deaths from respiratory problems and asthma attacks would increase with such levels , the researchers reported in environmental science and technology .
the eu has agreed that biofuels should be used in 10 % of transport by 2020 .
mark jacobson , an atmospheric scientist at stanford university in california , used a computer model which took into account factors such as temperatures , sunlight , clouds and rain to simulate air quality in 2020 for two different scenarios .
in one simulation all vehicles were fuelled by petrol and in the other all vehicles were fuelled by e85 - a mix of 85 % ethanol and 15 % petrol . "
the question is , if we 're not getting any health benefits , then why continue to promote ethanol and other biofuels " mark jacobson if all cars were run on e85 , he found that in some parts of the us there were significant increases in ozone - a pollutant with harmful effects on the human respiratory system - compared with petrol cars .
in the study , the increase in smog translated to an extra 200 deaths per year in the whole of the us , with 120 occurring in los angeles alone .
increases in ozone in some areas of the us would be offset by decreases in other areas but overall there would be 770 additional visits to accident and emergency and 990 additional hospitalisations for asthma and other respiratory problems , the results showed .
although ethanol was found to reduce levels of two atmospheric carcinogens , levels of others increased so associated cancers would be the same as with pollution caused by petrol fumes , the study showed .
damage " we found that using e85 will cause at least as much health damage as gasoline , which already causes about 10,000 premature deaths annually from ozone and particulate matter , " said jacobson .
" the question is , if we 're not getting any health benefits , then why continue to promote ethanol and other biofuels . "
he added : " by comparison , converting all vehicles to battery-electric , where the electricity is from wind energy would eliminate 10,000 air pollution deaths per year and 98 % of carbon emissions from vehicles . "
in principle , biofuels - ethanol and diesel , made from crops including corn , sugarcane and rapeseed - are a way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional transport fuels .
although they produce carbon dioxide , growing the plants absorbs a comparable amount of the gas from the atmosphere .
a government report said that biofuels could reduce emissions by 50-60 % compared to fossil fuels .
stuart shales , senior lecturer in environmental biotechnology at the university of the west england , said there were companies in the uk producing biofuel but that the uk was lagging behind other countries .
he added that it would not be feasible for all cars to run on ethanol because too much land would be needed to grow the crops .
" what people are looking at are second generation fuels which will be produced from whole biomass , like wood , which can be broken down to fermentable sugars . "
" this is the first time i 've seen any research about ozone .
" the question i would ask is , has there been any respiratory problems in brazil where ethanol has been used since the early 1970s . "

the question is , if we 're not getting any health benefits , then why continue to promote ethanol and other biofuels mark jacobson if all cars were run on e85 , he found that in some parts of the us there were significant increases in ozone - a pollutant with harmful effects on the human respiratory system - compared with petrol cars .
in the study , the increase in smog translated to an extra 200 deaths per year in the whole of the us , with 120 occurring in los angeles alone .
increases in ozone in some areas of the us would be offset by decreases in other areas but overall there would be 770 additional visits to accident and emergency and 990 additional hospitalisations for asthma and other respiratory problems , the results showed .
although ethanol was found to reduce levels of two atmospheric carcinogens , levels of others increased so associated cancers would be the same as with pollution caused by petrol fumes , the study showed .
damage " we found that using e85 will cause at least as much health damage as gasoline , which already causes about 10,000 premature deaths annually from ozone and particulate matter , " said jacobson .
" the question is , if we 're not getting any health benefits , then why continue to promote ethanol and other biofuels . "
he added : " by comparison , converting all vehicles to battery-electric , where the electricity is from wind energy would eliminate 10,000 air pollution deaths per year and 98 % of carbon emissions from vehicles . "
in principle , biofuels - ethanol and diesel , made from crops including corn , sugarcane and rapeseed - are a way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional transport fuels .
although they produce carbon dioxide , growing the plants absorbs a comparable amount of the gas from the atmosphere .
a government report said that biofuels could reduce emissions by 50-60 % compared to fossil fuels .
stuart shales , senior lecturer in environmental biotechnology at the university of the west england , said there were companies in the uk producing biofuel but that the uk was lagging behind other countries .
he added that it would not be feasible for all cars to run on ethanol because too much land would be needed to grow the crops .
" what people are looking at are second generation fuels which will be produced from whole biomass , like wood , which can be broken down to fermentable sugars . "
" this is the first time i 've seen any research about ozone .
" the question i would ask is , has there been any respiratory problems in brazil where ethanol has been used since the early 1970s . "

the drink is reportedly made by steeping tiger carcasses in rice wine .
those who drink the wine believe it makes them strong .
chinese delegates at the international tiger symposium in nepal are arguing for the lifting of a current ban on the trade in tiger bones and skins .
but other asian nations with threatened tiger populations want the ban to stay .
emotive issue there has been a forceful exchange of views on the issue at the symposium , according to the bbc correspondent in kathmandu , charles haviland .
experts say there are several reasons why tiger numbers have drastically declined , but just one has grabbed the limelight , our correspondent says .
the argument centres on the existence of so-called " tiger farms " in china , which have bred thousands of captive tigers with the ostensible purpose of entertaining visitors .
but the conservation group wwf , which is chairing the symposium , says these farms are fronts for the production of tiger bone wine .
wwf also says the captive tigers can not survive in the wild , and believes the production of wine and underhand trade in skin and bones also threaten to make wild tiger poaching more lucrative .
a senior wwf official said the discussions were heated , with chinese academics saying their country should lift its ban on the trade in tiger parts .
but experts from states like nepal and bangladesh , which have threatened tiger populations , are urging that the ban should remain .
on wednesday , a more formal forum of government delegations will begin discussing the fate of the majestic beast , which a recent television poll declared to be the world 's most popular animal .

the debt was calculated from a survey of all welsh nhs trusts , local health boards and health commission wales .
overspending has risen by nearly 10 % on last year , but the bulk of the deficit is down to a few key institutions .
the final figures will be presented to the welsh assembly government in the coming months .
the predicted overspend of £ 33.45m for the last 12 months is still only a small proportion of the overall health and social services budget of £ 5,114.4m.
however , there are also historical debts across the welsh nhs of around £ 84m , according to welsh assembly government figures .
gwent healthcare nhs trust is forecasting one of the greatest overspends , with an anticipated debt of £ 6.5m.
one-off payments the welsh ambulance service , which has suffered a turbulent 12 months with changes at the top in management and claims of crisis , is also forecasting a £ 6.4m debt .
three local health boards also fared badly , with carmarthenshire forecasting a deficit of £ 4.2m , swansea an overspend of £ 4.468m , and powys predicting a deficit of £ 3.2m.
the overall deficit figure would have passed £ 40m without one-off payments made to two nhs bodies .
health commission wales - which has been heavily criticised for making cuts to its services - is forecasting a break even , but only due to an additional £ 5m payment received from the welsh assembly government .
similarly , north east wales nhs trust forecasts a break even position , thanks to an additional £ 3.2m non-recurring payment from local health boards .
' culture of debt ' the four main political parties have reacted to the news of the anticipated overspend , with labour saying the culture of debt must be changed and the nhs had to live within its means .
but the conservatives said labour had been in charge for 10 years , and the situation was getting worse .
" today 's debts are tomorrow 's cuts , " they said .
plaid cymru said they wanted to establish how much of the problem was down to underfunding , and how much was down to mismanagement .
they said it had to be sorted out before nursing jobs were lost .
the liberal democrats said there was terrible bureaucracy in the nhs , and they wanted to co-ordinate services better .
" there is mismanagement , but throwing money at the problem is n't the answer , " they said .

at the end of an energy summit of south american nations , brazil said it could double output in the next 10 years .
mr chavez has expressed concern about brazil 's tie-up with the us to jointly promote ethanol as an alternative fuel .
mr chavez said he was not opposed to biofuels as such although he disliked fuel produced from corn in the us .
' way out ' brazil produces the bulk of its ethanol from sugar cane , a practice which mr chavez has previously criticised claiming it uses up valuable land and contributes to rural poverty .
but mr chavez appeared to tone down criticism of his neighbour at the two-day meeting in venezuela , focusing instead on us production methods .
venezuela has said it will buy 200,000 barrels of ethanol a day from brazil for use in fuel additives .
brazil said it could potentially increase production by up to 10 % a year and would lobby for the us to reduce tariffs on its imports .

during the 1970s and early 1980s , nearly 5,000 people were exposed to hepatitis c and of these more than 1,200 were also infected with hiv .
more than 1,700 patients have since died , and many more are terminally ill .
the inquiry is being funded privately , and not by the government who said treatments were given in " good faith " .
labour peer lord archer of sandwell , a former solicitor general , is leading the inquiry which is due to report in late summer .
in his opening statement , lord archer said the inquiry would investigate the circumstances surrounding the supply of contaminated nhs blood and blood products and make recommendations to assess the needs of patients and bereaved families .
hopefully , we may discover something that will help for the future and we can learn some lessons lord archer bbc 's newsnight programme has reported seeing documents suggesting experts were aware of the threat at an early stage , but transfusions were not stopped .
lord archer said the first purpose of the inquiry was to find out why and how this contamination occurred to help those affected come to terms with what had happened .
he added : " hopefully , we may discover something that will help for the future and we can learn some lessons . "
lord archer said the department of health had told him it would help as far as it could and he promised to ask officials for documents that could be relevant .
any evidence " of anything which is blameworthy " would be investigated , he added .
if we had gone in for self-sufficiency , i am pretty confident we would have had a substantial reduction in contaminated blood supplies lord owen ' i need answers ' warnings ' ignored ' asked about the newsnight allegations , lord archer said : " i can not comment on what evidence we are going to have , because we have not heard any evidence . "
he said if allegations were made against particular doctors or consultants they would be asked to the inquiry .
former health ministers had also offered to help the inquiry , lord archer added .
meanwhile former health minister lord owen said he had secured extra money in 1975 to help avoid using blood donations from abroad , but had later found out it had not been spent .
lord owen said : " if we had gone in for self-sufficiency , i am pretty confident we would have had a substantial reduction in contaminated blood supplies .
" it would not have completely ruled it out , but i think much fewer people would have got hepatitis c and fewer people would have got aids . "
bleeding disorder haemophilia is a rare inherited bleeding disorder in which blood does not clot normally .
there 's a huge number of questions that need to be answered roddy morrison , haemophilia society ' i was n't told i had hiv ' the main problem is internal bleeding into joints , muscles and soft tissues .
currently , the condition can only be treated by injections of the clotting chemical , known as factor viii .
in the early 1970s , patients were treated with blood proteins that came in dry powder form and could then be reconstituted with water - plasma from 10,000 donors went into the product .
the treatment , which often came from patients in the united states who were paid for giving blood , exposed 4,670 patients to hepatitis c infection .
in 1981 it was also found that some plasma products were infected with hiv .
after the mid-1980s the plasma products were treated with heat to kill viruses .
successive governments have refused to admit any fault but payments of varying amounts have been made to people who caught hiv .
in 2004 , the skipton fund was set up for those infected with hepatitis c virus but no payments were made to those who died before 2003 .
campaign roddy morrison , chairman of the haemophilia society said he was absolutely delighted the inquiry was going ahead .
" it 's taken 19 years of campaigning .
" there 's never been a chance for people to tell their stories and to know that people with the right skills will be able to look at this and establish what happened and could things have been done to prevent this .
" there 's a huge number of questions that need to be answered . "
a spokesperson for the department of health said they had been open and transparent about the issue .
" we have great sympathy for those who were infected with hepatitis c and hiv and understand why they want to know how it happened and why it could not have been prevented .
" however , the government of the day acted in good faith , relying on the information available at the time . "
professor christine lee , emeritus professor of haemophilia in the university of london agreed there was a lot of misunderstanding about what was known at the time .
" the hepatitis c virus was n't isolated until 1989 and there was n't a blood test until 1991 .
" also there was no alternative and the life expectancy of someone with haemophilia was 20 years , " she said .
but she added that the inquiry may give patients the chance to vent their feelings and get some closure .

the inquiry is being funded privately , and not by the government who said treatments were given in " good faith " .
labour peer lord archer of sandwell , a former solicitor general , is leading the inquiry which is due to report in late summer .

there 's a huge number of questions that need to be answered roddy morrison , haemophilia society ' i was n't told i had hiv ' the main problem is internal bleeding into joints , muscles and soft tissues .
currently , the condition can only be treated by injections of the clotting chemical , known as factor viii .
in the early 1970s , patients were treated with blood proteins that came in dry powder form and could then be reconstituted with water - plasma from 10,000 donors went into the product .
the treatment , which often came from patients in the united states who were paid for giving blood , exposed 4,670 patients to hepatitis c infection .
in 1981 it was also found that some plasma products were infected with hiv .
after the mid-1980s the plasma products were treated with heat to kill viruses .
successive governments have refused to admit any fault but payments of varying amounts have been made to people who caught hiv .
in 2004 , the skipton fund was set up for those infected with hepatitis c virus but no payments were made to those who died before 2003 .
campaign roddy morrison , chairman of the haemophilia society said he was absolutely delighted the inquiry was going ahead .
" it 's taken 19 years of campaigning .
" there 's never been a chance for people to tell their stories and to know that people with the right skills will be able to look at this and establish what happened and could things have been done to prevent this .
" there 's a huge number of questions that need to be answered . "
a spokesperson for the department of health said they had been open and transparent about the issue .
" we have great sympathy for those who were infected with hepatitis c and hiv and understand why they want to know how it happened and why it could not have been prevented .
" however , the government of the day acted in good faith , relying on the information available at the time . "
professor christine lee , emeritus professor of haemophilia in the university of london agreed there was a lot of misunderstanding about what was known at the time .
" the hepatitis c virus was n't isolated until 1989 and there was n't a blood test until 1991 .
" also there was no alternative and the life expectancy of someone with haemophilia was 20 years , " she said .
but she added that the inquiry may give patients the chance to vent their feelings and get some closure .

nottingham schoolboy liam , 15 , explains why he sells tickets on ebay .
i 'm 15 and i 'm at school at the moment , so ticket touting seems to be the only way i can make a good income .
i started touting last september .
i just had a look on ebay to see how much tickets were going for , and thought , ' wow , i can make this amount of money ' , so i have just gone from there .
liam says he has made more than £ 500 profit so far i have bought tickets for lily allen , the killers , placebo , kings of leon and gwen stefani .
i think there are two ways of looking at the issue .
you can think it 's taking away the chance for genuine fans to get their tickets , but i 've got to make my money and it 's better than being like most kids and going out causing trouble on the streets .
i decide whose tickets i 'm going to get by looking at any media coverage they have been getting , whether they are good singers , and if there is likely to be enough demand .
i also look on the internet at people 's gig reviews .
when they go on sale , i log on to the seetickets website or aloud.com - any ticket service really .
my friends are a little bit annoyed that i 'm not going out at six o 'clock in the morning to do a paper round like them liam q & a : concert tickets have your say on touts i make sure i 'm one of the first on there , bang on nine o 'clock , because what tends to happen is that as more and more people get onto the website , there will be like an overload and it will crash .
for the time being , i 've been spending the profit on my social life , so i 'm only buying pairs of tickets .
but i managed to get a couple of tickets for the police not long ago , so hopefully with the money that comes in from that , i 'm going to build up to about £ 400 and from there i can start buying wholesale lots .
i sell most of my tickets on ebay , but you can sell them anywhere - gumtree.com , any touting website , you can do whatever you like really .
i bought four tickets for the killers tickets and i made £ 184 profit .
kings of leon , i made £ 40 on them , placebo £ 40 , take that i made £ 50 on .
i imagine i can make about £ 150 on the police .
so i 'm guessing about £ 500 or £ 600 since i started .
it is a risk because there is no guarantee the concerts will sell out liam there is a guilt part to it , but it 's like any business thing - you are there to make your money .
at the end of the day , if people are prepared to sell at that price and people are willing to buy at that price , and it 's mutual agreement , i think there is no problem .
my friends are a little bit annoyed that i 'm not going out at six o 'clock in the morning to do a paper round like them , but they have got the money to do it as well .
it 's just being able to be bothered to do it and risking your money .
and it is a risk because there is no guarantee that they will sell out .
i 've had a few bands that have n't sold out , like aerosmith .
there are over 2,000 tickets left , but i managed to sell them at face value .

princeton university 's professor alan krueger explains the economics behind buying and selling tickets on the secondary market .
if you go to a concert by the police , u2 or madonna , there is about a one in four chance you purchased your prized ticket from a tout .
it is a figure professor alan krueger - described as " the world 's first and foremost professor of rockonomics " - says many people find surprising .
professor krueger thinks tickets are too cheap on the primary market in a random sample of 28 gigs in the us last summer , he found 10 % of tickets were re-sold - rising to one-in-four at " superstar " concerts .
" what we found was that 10 % of people bought their tickets in the secondary market , which is lower than many people expect , but many of these concerts did not sell out , " professor krueger says .
" if you look at concerts that sold out , it 's higher - closer to 15 % .
and if you look at those with really high demand , it is more like 25 % . "
falling cd sales professor krueger believes the fall in cd sales over the last few years is partly behind the recent rise in concert ticket prices .
from 1996 to 2003 , ticket prices rose by 8.9 % a year in the us , with similarly sharp increases in the uk , he says .
i think that the main reason there are ticket touts is because the prices are not set properly to begin with professor alan krueger " beginning in 1996 , ticket prices took off .
i think the main reason was that the artists were not making the income they had previously made from record sales , " he explains .
" in the old days , i think they kept the concert prices lower than they needed to in order to gain popularity and help record sales .
" now i think they are setting concert prices to try and make the most money they can , irrespective of record sales . "
in fact , it was david bowie who in 2002 told his fellow artists to prepare to charge fans more to go to concerts .
' ' music itself is going to become like running water or electricity , " professor krueger says .
" i think what he had in mind was the first explanation that it is going to be really hard to make money from record sales and that you should charge what you can for the concerts . "
stones ' doing it right ' but the key to beating ticket touts is to set concert tickets prices even higher , he believes .
" i think that the main reason there are ticket touts is because the prices are not set properly to begin with .
bruce springsteen has been a popular target for ticket touts " the rolling stones have pushed their prices up higher - i 'd like to point out that mick jagger went to the london school of economics - and i think they price as close to the market as anyone .
" i think they probably still have room to raise their prices , but i think they are doing it most right . "
and because the best seats reach the best prices on the secondary market , he says it is up to artists and promoters to price accordingly .
" the reason why people are going to the secondary market is that they want to get a better seat than what 's available and i think that is an indication that they were not priced properly in the first place , " he says .
" in the secondary market , the tickets average 50 % more than their list prices , and some go for a lot more than that .
the very best seats go for double or triple the list prices .
" i think artists are still underpricing the very best seats , but i think it is slowly changing . "
good value but professor krueger admits artists are reluctant to raise prices further .
" bruce springsteen charged $ 75 -lrb- £ 37.70 -rrb- for each ticket , while the secondary market was $ 300 -lrb- £ 150 -rrb- a ticket .
he gave away more money that he actually raised , " he explains .
" but i think from the artists ' perspective , they view putting on a concert a little like throwing a party .
and if you throw a party , you do n't want to charge your guests too much .
" the artists feel like they are rewarding their loyal fans by giving them good value .
" i think that 's breaking down in part because the artists are looking at the web with their managers and saying : ' why should the middle-man get all this money ?
why do n't we charge more ? " '
but professor krueger says the increase in prices is not all bad news for music fans .
" i think the nature of concerts is changing .
look at all the light shows and pyrotechnics at a u2 concert .
" not across the board - a bruce springsteen concert is still pretty similar to what is was 20 years ago .
but i do think the industry in evolving into what the audience expects . "

princeton university 's professor alan krueger explains the economics behind buying and selling tickets on the secondary market .
if you go to a concert by the police , u2 or madonna , there is about a one in four chance you purchased your prized ticket from a tout .
it is a figure professor alan krueger - described as " the world 's first and foremost professor of rockonomics " - says many people find surprising .
professor krueger thinks tickets are too cheap on the primary market in a random sample of 28 gigs in the us last summer , he found 10 % of tickets were re-sold - rising to one-in-four at " superstar " concerts .
" what we found was that 10 % of people bought their tickets in the secondary market , which is lower than many people expect , but many of these concerts did not sell out , " professor krueger says .
" if you look at concerts that sold out , it 's higher - closer to 15 % .
and if you look at those with really high demand , it is more like 25 % . "
falling cd sales professor krueger believes the fall in cd sales over the last few years is partly behind the recent rise in concert ticket prices .
from 1996 to 2003 , ticket prices rose by 8.9 % a year in the us , with similarly sharp increases in the uk , he says .

it is a figure professor alan krueger - described as " the world 's first and foremost professor of rockonomics " - says many people find surprising .
professor krueger thinks tickets are too cheap on the primary market in a random sample of 28 gigs in the us last summer , he found 10 % of tickets were re-sold - rising to one-in-four at " superstar " concerts .
" what we found was that 10 % of people bought their tickets in the secondary market , which is lower than many people expect , but many of these concerts did not sell out , " professor krueger says .
" if you look at concerts that sold out , it 's higher - closer to 15 % .
and if you look at those with really high demand , it is more like 25 % . "
falling cd sales professor krueger believes the fall in cd sales over the last few years is partly behind the recent rise in concert ticket prices .
from 1996 to 2003 , ticket prices rose by 8.9 % a year in the us , with similarly sharp increases in the uk , he says .
i think that the main reason there are ticket touts is because the prices are not set properly to begin with professor alan krueger " beginning in 1996 , ticket prices took off .
i think the main reason was that the artists were not making the income they had previously made from record sales , " he explains .
" in the old days , i think they kept the concert prices lower than they needed to in order to gain popularity and help record sales .
" now i think they are setting concert prices to try and make the most money they can , irrespective of record sales . "
in fact , it was david bowie who in 2002 told his fellow artists to prepare to charge fans more to go to concerts .
' ' music itself is going to become like running water or electricity , " professor krueger says .
" i think what he had in mind was the first explanation that it is going to be really hard to make money from record sales and that you should charge what you can for the concerts . "
stones ' doing it right ' but the key to beating ticket touts is to set concert tickets prices even higher , he believes .
" i think that the main reason there are ticket touts is because the prices are not set properly to begin with .
bruce springsteen has been a popular target for ticket touts " the rolling stones have pushed their prices up higher - i 'd like to point out that mick jagger went to the london school of economics - and i think they price as close to the market as anyone .
" i think they probably still have room to raise their prices , but i think they are doing it most right . "
and because the best seats reach the best prices on the secondary market , he says it is up to artists and promoters to price accordingly .
" the reason why people are going to the secondary market is that they want to get a better seat than what 's available and i think that is an indication that they were not priced properly in the first place , " he says .
" in the secondary market , the tickets average 50 % more than their list prices , and some go for a lot more than that .
the very best seats go for double or triple the list prices .
" i think artists are still underpricing the very best seats , but i think it is slowly changing . "
good value but professor krueger admits artists are reluctant to raise prices further .
" bruce springsteen charged $ 75 -lrb- £ 37.70 -rrb- for each ticket , while the secondary market was $ 300 -lrb- £ 150 -rrb- a ticket .
he gave away more money that he actually raised , " he explains .
" but i think from the artists ' perspective , they view putting on a concert a little like throwing a party .
and if you throw a party , you do n't want to charge your guests too much .
" the artists feel like they are rewarding their loyal fans by giving them good value .
" i think that 's breaking down in part because the artists are looking at the web with their managers and saying : ' why should the middle-man get all this money ?
why do n't we charge more ? " '
but professor krueger says the increase in prices is not all bad news for music fans .
" i think the nature of concerts is changing .
look at all the light shows and pyrotechnics at a u2 concert .
" not across the board - a bruce springsteen concert is still pretty similar to what is was 20 years ago .
but i do think the industry in evolving into what the audience expects . "

nottingham schoolboy liam , 15 , explains why he sells tickets on ebay .
i 'm 15 and i 'm at school at the moment , so ticket touting seems to be the only way i can make a good income .
i started touting last september .
i just had a look on ebay to see how much tickets were going for , and thought , ' wow , i can make this amount of money ' , so i have just gone from there .
liam says he has made more than £ 500 profit so far i have bought tickets for lily allen , the killers , placebo , kings of leon and gwen stefani .
i think there are two ways of looking at the issue .
you can think it 's taking away the chance for genuine fans to get their tickets , but i 've got to make my money and it 's better than being like most kids and going out causing trouble on the streets .
i decide whose tickets i 'm going to get by looking at any media coverage they have been getting , whether they are good singers , and if there is likely to be enough demand .
i also look on the internet at people 's gig reviews .
when they go on sale , i log on to the seetickets website or aloud.com - any ticket service really .
my friends are a little bit annoyed that i 'm not going out at six o 'clock in the morning to do a paper round like them liam q & a : concert tickets have your say on touts i make sure i 'm one of the first on there , bang on nine o 'clock , because what tends to happen is that as more and more people get onto the website , there will be like an overload and it will crash .
for the time being , i 've been spending the profit on my social life , so i 'm only buying pairs of tickets .
but i managed to get a couple of tickets for the police not long ago , so hopefully with the money that comes in from that , i 'm going to build up to about £ 400 and from there i can start buying wholesale lots .
i sell most of my tickets on ebay , but you can sell them anywhere - gumtree.com , any touting website , you can do whatever you like really .
i bought four tickets for the killers tickets and i made £ 184 profit .
kings of leon , i made £ 40 on them , placebo £ 40 , take that i made £ 50 on .
i imagine i can make about £ 150 on the police .
so i 'm guessing about £ 500 or £ 600 since i started .
it is a risk because there is no guarantee the concerts will sell out liam there is a guilt part to it , but it 's like any business thing - you are there to make your money .
at the end of the day , if people are prepared to sell at that price and people are willing to buy at that price , and it 's mutual agreement , i think there is no problem .
my friends are a little bit annoyed that i 'm not going out at six o 'clock in the morning to do a paper round like them , but they have got the money to do it as well .
it 's just being able to be bothered to do it and risking your money .
and it is a risk because there is no guarantee that they will sell out .
i 've had a few bands that have n't sold out , like aerosmith .
there are over 2,000 tickets left , but i managed to sell them at face value .
i did n't lose any money but i could have done without the hassle .

princeton university 's professor alan krueger explains the economics behind buying and selling tickets on the secondary market .
if you go to a concert by the police , u2 or madonna , there is about a one in four chance you purchased your prized ticket from a tout .
it is a figure professor alan krueger - described as " the world 's first and foremost professor of rockonomics " - says many people find surprising .
in a random sample of 28 gigs in the us last summer , he found 10 % of tickets were re-sold - rising to one-in-four at " superstar " concerts .
" what we found was that 10 % of people bought their tickets in the secondary market , which is lower than many people expect , but many of these concerts did not sell out , " professor krueger says .
" if you look at concerts that sold out , it 's higher - closer to 15 % .
and if you look at those with really high demand , it is more like 25 % . "
falling cd sales professor krueger believes the fall in cd sales over the last few years is partly behind the recent rise in concert ticket prices .
from 1996 to 2003 , ticket prices rose by 8.9 % a year in the us , with similarly sharp increases in the uk , he says . "
i think that the main reason there are ticket touts is because the prices are not set properly to begin with " professor alan krueger " beginning in 1996 , ticket prices took off .
i think the main reason was that the artists were not making the income they had previously made from record sales , " he explains .
" in the old days , i think they kept the concert prices lower than they needed to in order to gain popularity and help record sales .
" now i think they are setting concert prices to try and make the most money they can , irrespective of record sales . "
in fact , it was david bowie who in 2002 told his fellow artists to prepare to charge fans more to go to concerts .
' ' music itself is going to become like running water or electricity , " professor krueger says .
" i think what he had in mind was the first explanation that it is going to be really hard to make money from record sales and that you should charge what you can for the concerts . "
stones ' doing it right ' but the key to beating ticket touts is to set concert tickets prices even higher , he believes .
" i think that the main reason there are ticket touts is because the prices are not set properly to begin with .
" the rolling stones have pushed their prices up higher - i 'd like to point out that mick jagger went to the london school of economics - and i think they price as close to the market as anyone .
" i think they probably still have room to raise their prices , but i think they are doing it most right . "
and because the best seats reach the best prices on the secondary market , he says it is up to artists and promoters to price accordingly .
" the reason why people are going to the secondary market is that they want to get a better seat than what 's available and i think that is an indication that they were not priced properly in the first place , " he says .
" in the secondary market , the tickets average 50 % more than their list prices , and some go for a lot more than that .
the very best seats go for double or triple the list prices .
" i think artists are still underpricing the very best seats , but i think it is slowly changing . "
good value but professor krueger admits artists are reluctant to raise prices further .
" bruce springsteen charged $ 75 -lrb- £ 37.70 -rrb- for each ticket , while the secondary market was $ 300 -lrb- £ 150 -rrb- a ticket .
he gave away more money that he actually raised , " he explains .
" but i think from the artists ' perspective , they view putting on a concert a little like throwing a party .
and if you throw a party , you do n't want to charge your guests too much .
" the artists feel like they are rewarding their loyal fans by giving them good value .
" i think that 's breaking down in part because the artists are looking at the web with their managers and saying : ' why should the middle-man get all this money ?
why do n't we charge more ? " '
but professor krueger says the increase in prices is not all bad news for music fans .
" i think the nature of concerts is changing .
look at all the light shows and pyrotechnics at a u2 concert .
" not across the board - a bruce springsteen concert is still pretty similar to what is was 20 years ago .
but i do think the industry in evolving into what the audience expects . "

nottingham schoolboy liam , 15 , explains why he sells tickets on ebay . "
i 'm 15 and i 'm at school at the moment , so ticket touting seems to be the only way i can make a good income .
i started touting last september .
i just had a look on ebay to see how much tickets were going for , and thought , ' wow , i can make this amount of money ' , so i have just gone from there .
i have bought tickets for lily allen , the killers , placebo , kings of leon and gwen stefani .
i think there are two ways of looking at the issue .
you can think it 's taking away the chance for genuine fans to get their tickets , but i 've got to make my money and it 's better than being like most kids and going out causing trouble on the streets .
i decide whose tickets i 'm going to get by looking at any media coverage they have been getting , whether they are good singers , and if there is likely to be enough demand .
i also look on the internet at people 's gig reviews .
when they go on sale , i log on to the seetickets website or aloud.com - any ticket service really . "
my friends are a little bit annoyed that i 'm not going out at six o 'clock in the morning to do a paper round like them " liam q & a : concert tickets have your say on touts i make sure i 'm one of the first on there , bang on nine o 'clock , because what tends to happen is that as more and more people get onto the website , there will be like an overload and it will crash .
for the time being , i 've been spending the profit on my social life , so i 'm only buying pairs of tickets .
but i managed to get a couple of tickets for the police not long ago , so hopefully with the money that comes in from that , i 'm going to build up to about £ 400 and from there i can start buying wholesale lots .
i sell most of my tickets on ebay , but you can sell them anywhere - gumtree.com , any touting website , you can do whatever you like really .
i bought four tickets for the killers tickets and i made £ 184 profit .
kings of leon , i made £ 40 on them , placebo £ 40 , take that i made £ 50 on .
i imagine i can make about £ 150 on the police .
so i 'm guessing about £ 500 or £ 600 since i started . "
it is a risk because there is no guarantee the concerts will sell out " liam there is a guilt part to it , but it 's like any business thing - you are there to make your money .
at the end of the day , if people are prepared to sell at that price and people are willing to buy at that price , and it 's mutual agreement , i think there is no problem .
my friends are a little bit annoyed that i 'm not going out at six o 'clock in the morning to do a paper round like them , but they have got the money to do it as well .

united utilities has vowed to ensure all its transactions meet ofwat rules .
the firm said it was already making " significant progress " to address ofwat 's concerns by competitively tendering relevant services .
protecting customers under its licence united utilities water is obliged to " market test for services that it procures from companies within the united utilities group " .
philip fletcher , ofwat chairman , said : " our job as regulator is to protect customers by ensuring they pay the minimum necessary for high quality sustainable water services " .
" this depends on ofwat being able to measure accurately companies ' costs when it sets price limits . "
ofwat 's proposed fine - which is under consultation - relates to breaches between october 2005 and march 2007 .
they relate to united utilities water 's trading arrangements with vertex data science , united utilities facilities management , united utilities property solutions , united utilities networks and your communications .

it is expected to be the uk 's biggest test yet of the electronic vote counting system .
experts from the united states have told bbc scotland the scottish system lacks enough independent safeguards .
however , deputy scottish secretary david cairns said the system had been thoroughly tested and a hand recount was still an option if things go wrong .
the electoral commission called for e-counting to be independently verified more than three years ago to boost voter confidence but nothing has been done . "
we will still have the bits of paper and could do a manual recount if needed " david cairns deputy scottish secretary speaking to the bbc 's newsnight scotland programme , two us experts said the system lacks the safeguards that would guarantee voter confidence .

he said they can work provided the correct safeguards are in place .
" california law says that after every election they have to select 1 % of the vote and do a hand count of those ballots to check that the machines counted them accurately , " he said .
' adopted technology ' currently the scottish elections have no such condition attached to the electronic voting system .
the company which supplied the counting machines to polling stations across scotland , drs , said it would welcome such a move .
drs head of elections , sonia anderson , said : " as an organisation , we would be hugely in support of an independent accreditation programme if e-counting is to become in the longer term an adopted technology that returning officers have the freedom to use as opposed to manual counting . "
she added that the decision to introduce the safety system would rest with the scottish executive or the scotland office .
mr cairns said he had full confidence in the e-vote method .

students on their school easter holidays flocked to bbc birmingham 's public space to try their hand at radio news-reading .
during a one-off bbc news school report event , students were invited to go behind the scenes to learn about the news-making process .
their first task was to assemble a running order , choosing just five scripts from dozens to appear in their news bulletin .
these included stories on asylum , mobile phone tariffs and the bafta nominations , as well as sport news and a weather update .
live on air students were then given the task of writing opening and closing remarks for their scripts , including headlines , sign-offs and the occasional " still to come " .
during live news bulletins , presenters have to be word perfect ; rehearsals are therefore a crucial part of broadcasting .
the students gained in confidence as they practised reading aloud under the guidance of school report producers ros smith and naomi kennedy .
i was a little bit nervous but i just concentrated and tried to read the news clearly rebecca , 11 during rehearsals , students learnt to rewrite scripts in order to make them easier to read .
one student found " new research suggests " a bit of a mouthful and changed it to : " a survey says " .
another exchanged " proposals " for " plans " .
finally , the all-important moment arrived - recording the bulletin down a microphone in front of the nerve-racking red " on-air " light .
there was only one chance to get it right , so all the students had to be one-take wonders .
rebecca , 11 , told school report : " it was a really good experience .
i was a little bit nervous but i just concentrated and tried to read the news clearly .
practising helped .
i will definitely tell my teacher about the project when i go to secondary school in september " .
her mother , donna , said : " i listen to bbc radio west midlands and rebecca said she 'd love to have a go .
she does n't lack confidence so it was fun for her .
i think learning about news is very important .
she 'll be covering current affairs when she does her sats exams in may so this will help . "
some students were even given the chance to read their live bulletin on les ross 's afternoon show on bbc wm .
news inspiration catherine , 13 , and her brother patrick , 11 , both researched and wrote their pieces .
highlights from the national school report news day were shown catherine realised that newsreaders do n't just " turn up for the job . "
she said : " people have put a lot of work into it . "
she added : " i imagined radio presenters would have an teleprompter like they do on tv news , but they do n't .
reading your script is nerve-racking but i kept practising to get it right . "
patrick said : " i felt nervous , so to stop myself i just finished it !
i liked being a newsreader and i liked speaking into the microphone . "
their mother , teresa , said : " it 's been very educational .
it has given a lot of confidence to the children to read out loud in a nice environment . "
the public space co-ordinator at bbc birmingham said : " it 's been a brilliant time for the young people in the public space .
it 's made the media even more accessible to this age group of young adults and hopefully they will be tuning in to the bbc more often . "

students on their school easter holidays flocked to bbc birmingham 's public space to try their hand at radio news-reading .
during a one-off bbc news school report event , students were invited to go behind the scenes to learn about the news-making process .
their first task was to assemble a running order , choosing just five scripts from dozens to appear in their news bulletin .
these included stories on asylum , mobile phone tariffs and the bafta nominations , as well as sport news and a weather update .
live on air students were then given the task of writing opening and closing remarks for their scripts , including headlines , sign-offs and the occasional " still to come " .
during live news bulletins , presenters have to be word perfect ; rehearsals are therefore a crucial part of broadcasting .
the students gained in confidence as they practised reading aloud under the guidance of school report producers ros smith and naomi kennedy .
i was a little bit nervous but i just concentrated and tried to read the news clearly rebecca , 11 during rehearsals , students learnt to rewrite scripts in order to make them easier to read .
one student found " new research suggests " a bit of a mouthful and changed it to : " a survey says " .
another exchanged " proposals " for " plans " .
finally , the all-important moment arrived - recording the bulletin down a microphone in front of the nerve-racking red " on-air " light .
there was only one chance to get it right , so all the students had to be one-take wonders .
rebecca , 11 , told school report : " it was a really good experience .
i was a little bit nervous but i just concentrated and tried to read the news clearly .
practising helped .
i will definitely tell my teacher about the project when i go to secondary school in september " .
her mother , donna , said : " i listen to bbc radio west midlands and rebecca said she 'd love to have a go .
she does n't lack confidence so it was fun for her .
i think learning about news is very important .
she 'll be covering current affairs when she does her sats exams in may so this will help . "
some students were even given the chance to read their live bulletin on les ross 's afternoon show on bbc wm .
news inspiration catherine , 13 , and her brother patrick , 11 , both researched and wrote their pieces .
highlights from the national school report news day were shown catherine realised that newsreaders do n't just " turn up for the job . "
she said : " people have put a lot of work into it . "
she added : " i imagined radio presenters would have an teleprompter like they do on tv news , but they do n't .
reading your script is nerve-racking but i kept practising to get it right . "
patrick said : " i felt nervous , so to stop myself i just finished it !
i liked being a newsreader and i liked speaking into the microphone . "
their mother , teresa , said : " it 's been very educational .
it has given a lot of confidence to the children to read out loud in a nice environment . "
the public space co-ordinator at bbc birmingham said : " it 's been a brilliant time for the young people in the public space .
it 's made the media even more accessible to this age group of young adults and hopefully they will be tuning in to the bbc more often . "
the young people who took part were inspired by an exhibition of work put together by students at st john wall catholic school in birmingham , who took part in the national school report news day in march .

one day she turned around and said : " you 're just like a drug addict ! "
it was only then that her husband told her that he had been bankrolling their son 's heroin habit .
she sought help from her gp and a treatment centre , but did n't get it .
her son had to come off drugs in the family home , where he smashed some of the furniture and had to be kept under constant surveillance .
sally said joe 's addiction left everyone in the family isolated .
her husband was depressed and anxious and she felt she had no one to turn to .
" my husband was coping with the situation by not talking about it , but i really needed to .
" i asked a psychiatric nurse who was coming out to see joe if i could talk to her too , but she said no .
i felt so alone : no-one was listening . "
many relatives or partners of drug users feel similarly isolated .
family inclusion living with a drug user can push many people to the edge and have long-term medical implications , including depression . "
in the past , the problem has been talked about as if it was a problem for the individual , but the effects on families and communities is huge " professor jim orford drug treatment organisations like adfam have been campaigning for years for families to be included in treatment and at last , their work seems to be paying off .
at a recent adfam conference , colin bradbury , regional manager for the national treatment agency , the body set up by the government to improve drug treatment in england , floated the idea that targets should be set for inclusion of families in drug treatment .
drug workers who have worked with families have seized upon bradbury 's words and say that such targets could make a lot of difference .
they say that inclusion of families not only helps family members , but also increases the chance that drug users will be successfully treated and not relapse .
policy failures a report published by the uk drugs policy released on wednesday says the uk 's drugs policy has failed amid soaring numbers of drug users .
it comes a month after the royal society for the endowment of the arts released research which came to similar conclusions and called for radical action .
the rsa report said addiction to drugs and other substances " should be treated as a chronic health condition and a social problem , not simply a crime or a cause of crime " and that " drug users should be treated in the same way as any other chronic disease sufferers " .
drug addiction has a huge range of health implications .
apart from the risk of overdose , long-term use of hard drugs can cause brain damage , mental health problems , heart disease and stroke .
many drug workers back radical action .
a conference in bath next month will encourage " out-of-the-box " thinking .
one speaker at the unhooked thinking conference is professor jim orford , who has done a huge amount of research into the subject of addiction .
parents blamed he says the inclusion of families in drug treatment is patchy around the country , partly for funding reasons but also because the thinking behind drug policy has not been family-oriented . "
investment in drug treatment over the last few years has not necessarily translated into services for families " adfam " it blamed parents rather than taking the view that addiction is like some sort of disaster for the family , like a bombshell from outside .
" in the past , the problem has been talked about as if it was a problem for the individual , but the effects on families and communities is huge .
it is much more of a family or social problem . "
adfam sees colin bradbury 's remarks as offering a way forward .
" people have latched on to them with some degree of hope and we will be lobbying quite hard on them , " said a spokesman .
" there is very little in terms of family work in lots of parts of the country and investment in drug treatment over the last few years has not necessarily translated into services for families .
but there is a real feeling now that family members need to have some support in their own right regardless of its effect on substance users . "
unpaid helpers but john chamberlain , a drugs consultant who is also speaking at the unhooked thinking conference , said there was a danger that some services will see family members more as " unpaid helpers " than in need of treatment themselves .
" quite often they do n't say they need help , " he said , adding that they can also find it difficult after the person has come off drugs , adjusting to them being more independent .
he was rung up by a man who offered him £ 15,000 to move in with his 25-year-old daughter to get her off heroin .
" i asked him if he wanted help himself and he said he was okay , but i said is it sane to ring someone and offer a large sum of money to a stranger to move in with your daughter ?
" he must have been at his wits ' end . "

one day she turned around and said : " you 're just like a drug addict ! "
it was only then that her husband told her that he had been bankrolling their son 's heroin habit .
she sought help from her gp and a treatment centre , but did n't get it .
her son had to come off drugs in the family home , where he smashed some of the furniture and had to be kept under constant surveillance .
sally said joe 's addiction left everyone in the family isolated .
her husband was depressed and anxious and she felt she had no one to turn to .
" my husband was coping with the situation by not talking about it , but i really needed to .
" i asked a psychiatric nurse who was coming out to see joe if i could talk to her too , but she said no .
i felt so alone : no-one was listening . "
many relatives or partners of drug users feel similarly isolated .
family inclusion living with a drug user can push many people to the edge and have long-term medical implications , including depression .
in the past , the problem has been talked about as if it was a problem for the individual , but the effects on families and communities is huge professor jim orford drug treatment organisations like adfam have been campaigning for years for families to be included in treatment and at last , their work seems to be paying off .
at a recent adfam conference , colin bradbury , regional manager for the national treatment agency , the body set up by the government to improve drug treatment in england , floated the idea that targets should be set for inclusion of families in drug treatment .
drug workers who have worked with families have seized upon bradbury 's words and say that such targets could make a lot of difference .
they say that inclusion of families not only helps family members , but also increases the chance that drug users will be successfully treated and not relapse .
policy failures a report published by the uk drugs policy released on wednesday says the uk 's drugs policy has failed amid soaring numbers of drug users .
it comes a month after the royal society for the endowment of the arts released research which came to similar conclusions and called for radical action .
the rsa report said addiction to drugs and other substances " should be treated as a chronic health condition and a social problem , not simply a crime or a cause of crime " and that " drug users should be treated in the same way as any other chronic disease sufferers " .
drug addiction has a huge range of health implications .
apart from the risk of overdose , long-term use of hard drugs can cause brain damage , mental health problems , heart disease and stroke .
many drug workers back radical action .
a conference in bath next month will encourage " out-of-the-box " thinking .
one speaker at the unhooked thinking conference is professor jim orford , who has done a huge amount of research into the subject of addiction .
parents blamed he says the inclusion of families in drug treatment is patchy around the country , partly for funding reasons but also because the thinking behind drug policy has not been family-oriented .
investment in drug treatment over the last few years has not necessarily translated into services for families adfam " it blamed parents rather than taking the view that addiction is like some sort of disaster for the family , like a bombshell from outside .
" in the past , the problem has been talked about as if it was a problem for the individual , but the effects on families and communities is huge .
it is much more of a family or social problem . "
adfam sees colin bradbury 's remarks as offering a way forward .
" people have latched on to them with some degree of hope and we will be lobbying quite hard on them , " said a spokesman .
" there is very little in terms of family work in lots of parts of the country and investment in drug treatment over the last few years has not necessarily translated into services for families .
but there is a real feeling now that family members need to have some support in their own right regardless of its effect on substance users . "
unpaid helpers but john chamberlain , a drugs consultant who is also speaking at the unhooked thinking conference , said there was a danger that some services will see family members more as " unpaid helpers " than in need of treatment themselves .
" quite often they do n't say they need help , " he said , adding that they can also find it difficult after the person has come off drugs , adjusting to them being more independent .
he was rung up by a man who offered him £ 15,000 to move in with his 25-year-old daughter to get her off heroin .
" i asked him if he wanted help himself and he said he was okay , but i said is it sane to ring someone and offer a large sum of money to a stranger to move in with your daughter ?
" he must have been at his wits ' end . "

europe 's largest single contribution to the iss has been rescheduled for lift-off no earlier than 6 december .
the delay to the launch of the orbiting lab was one of six announced by nasa , due to damage sustained by the atlantis shuttle in a hail storm in february .
cargo has also been shifted between missions .
columbus will now fly on the atlantis shuttle instead of discovery .
cautious approach atlantis was to carry the station 's next set of solar wing panels to the iss in march but a freak hail storm dropped ice chunks as big as golf balls on the shuttle , damaging the ship 's fuel tank .
the ship was at the launch pad for flight preparations when the storm hit .
in graphics : space station hopes for a quick recovery faded as inspections revealed extensive damage to the tank 's insulation foam .
nasa has been particularly sensitive about shuttle tank safety since losing columbia and seven astronauts in 2003 as a result of a debris strike from tank foam insulation .
the impact , which occurred during lift-off , damaged the shuttle 's heat shield , which failed as columbia soared through the atmosphere .
with temperatures reaching as hot as the surface of the sun , the ship broke apart , dooming the astronauts .
atlantis ' flight has been rescheduled for no earlier than 8 june , effectively bumping a fifth mission from this year 's flight roster and jeopardizing the columbus module launch on what would be the fourth and final flight of the year .
the module is at the kennedy space center in florida where it is being prepared for launch .
" flying four flights is not outside the realm of possibility , but we want to do this in a safe and orderly manner and we 'll just see how it works out , " said shuttle programme manager wayne hale .
work to repair the shuttle 's fuel tank is under way in florida .
engineers have identified 2,664 dings , gouges and other damage sites that need to be fixed before the shuttle can fly , said john honeycutt , an external tank program manager .
some areas are so heavily pitted that technicians will apply a new layer of foam rather than attempt individual repairs , he added .
nasa must also prove that the repaired areas will be safe to fly .
bill gerstenmaier , the associate administrator for spaceflight , said he expects the shuttle programme to digest the delays within a year or so and that there will still be enough time to complete the space station assembly before the shuttles are retired in 2010 .

europe 's largest single contribution to the iss has been rescheduled for lift-off no earlier than 6 december .
the delay to the launch of the orbiting lab was one of six announced by nasa , due to damage sustained by the atlantis shuttle in a hail storm in february .
cargo has also been shifted between missions .
columbus will now fly on the atlantis shuttle instead of discovery .
cautious approach atlantis was to carry the station 's next set of solar wing panels to the iss in march but a freak hail storm dropped ice chunks as big as golf balls on the shuttle , damaging the ship 's fuel tank .
the ship was at the launch pad for flight preparations when the storm hit .
in graphics : space station hopes for a quick recovery faded as inspections revealed extensive damage to the tank 's insulation foam .
nasa has been particularly sensitive about shuttle tank safety since losing columbia and seven astronauts in 2003 as a result of a debris strike from tank foam insulation .
the impact , which occurred during lift-off , damaged the shuttle 's heat shield , which failed as columbia soared through the atmosphere .
with temperatures reaching as hot as the surface of the sun , the ship broke apart , dooming the astronauts .
atlantis ' flight has been rescheduled for no earlier than 8 june , effectively bumping a fifth mission from this year 's flight roster and jeopardizing the columbus module launch on what would be the fourth and final flight of the year .
the module is at the kennedy space center in florida where it is being prepared for launch .
" flying four flights is not outside the realm of possibility , but we want to do this in a safe and orderly manner and we 'll just see how it works out , " said shuttle programme manager wayne hale .
work to repair the shuttle 's fuel tank is under way in florida .
engineers have identified 2,664 dings , gouges and other damage sites that need to be fixed before the shuttle can fly , said john honeycutt , an external tank program manager .
some areas are so heavily pitted that technicians will apply a new layer of foam rather than attempt individual repairs , he added .
nasa must also prove that the repaired areas will be safe to fly .
bill gerstenmaier , the associate administrator for spaceflight , said he expects the shuttle programme to digest the delays within a year or so and that there will still be enough time to complete the space station assembly before the shuttles are retired in 2010 .

expanding waistlines are forcing many councils to spend thousands widening their furnaces , the local government association has warned .
in some cases grieving relatives have to travel hundreds of miles to find crematoria that can accommodate over-sized coffins .
standard coffins range from 16-20 inches , but coffins up to 40 inches are becoming increasingly common .
the lga , which represents over 400 councils in england and wales , is warning that local authorities are finding that many of their furnaces are too narrow to deal with these larger coffins .
this is just another demonstration of how the uk 's obesity problem is putting a real strain on public services hazel harding around 430,000 cremations take place in britain each year .
in lanarkshire , scotland , a new 41-inch-wide cremator , has been dealing with the funerals of obese people from all over scotland .
and lewisham council has ordered a special cremator from america , measuring 44 inches in width .
the crematorium has taken coffins from as far away as the west midlands and gloucester .
as part of a £ 1.2m refurbishment , a new furnace at mintlyn crematorium in bawsey was recently installed by king 's lynn and west norfolk council to accommodate coffins a metre wide .

" the death of a loved one is always a difficult time and having to decamp to another area for the cremation just adds to the ordeal .
" it is important that grieving relatives get the service they deserve and councils are doing what they can to accommodate larger clients locally . "
tim morris , chief executive of the institute of cemetery and crematorium management said : " the institute has received calls from funeral directors from all parts of the country whose local crematorium is unable to cremate large coffins .

" we 've heard of obese people having to use animal mri scanners and problems with aeroplane seats but this is linking it with death and of course there is an increased risk of premature death with obesity . "

standard coffins range from 16-20 inches , but coffins up to 40 inches are becoming increasingly common .
the lga , which represents over 400 councils in england and wales , is warning that local authorities are finding that many of their furnaces are too narrow to deal with these larger coffins .

blackburn with darwen council has plans to install a 42-inch cremator in the next few years to deal with wider coffins .
growing problem in 1980 , 8 % of women and 6 % of men were classified as obese .
by 2004 this had increased to 24 % of men and women and by 2010 is expected to rise to a third of all adults .
hazel harding from the lga , said : " as long as the nation keeps on piling on the pounds , pressure will continue to be placed on crematoria .
" this is just another demonstration of how the uk 's obesity problem is putting a real strain on public services . "
" the death of a loved one is always a difficult time and having to decamp to another area for the cremation just adds to the ordeal .
" it is important that grieving relatives get the service they deserve and councils are doing what they can to accommodate larger clients locally . "

the european commission has penalised heineken , grolsch and bavaria for stifling competition by sharing pricing policy and levels .
the move follows a lengthy inquiry by brussels into sales of beer to dutch bars and restaurants in the late 1990s .
heineken is to appeal against its 219m euros fine , calling it " excessive " .
the fine is the seventh-largest competition penalty ever handed out by the eu and its scale reflects the fact that heineken accounts for more than half of beer sales in the country .
' covering tracks ' grolsch has been fined 31.7m euros , while bavaria will have to pay 22.9m euros .
the highest management of these companies knew very well that their behaviour was illegal neelie kroes , eu competition commissioner inbev , the owner of stella artois which was also accused of violating eu laws , escaped a fine after providing key information about the infractions .
competition commissioner neelie kroes said the brewers had " carved up " the market between them , adding that such behaviour was " unacceptable " .
she said that board members and senior executives at the companies concerned had either participated or been aware of the actions and done nothing to stop them .
" the highest management of these companies knew very well that their behaviour was illegal but they went ahead anyway and tried to cover their tracks , " she said .
heineken said it was " highly surprised " by the decision and would appeal .
" heineken finds the fine excessive and unjustified , " it said in a statement .
grolsch said it was " amazed " by the decision and said it would also be launching an appeal .
compensation ?
the commission said individual consumers may now seek compensation against the firms concerned in the dutch courts .
a trade association representing dutch hotels and restaurants said it would seek financial redress in the form of discounts on future beer purchases and possibly compensation .
level of fines heineken : 219m euros grolsch : 31.7m euros bavaria : 22.9m euros the commission has already taken action against brewers in belgium , france and luxembourg for similar offences .
it formally accused the three brewers and smaller firm bavaria of unfair trading practices in 2005 , having launched its investigation several years earlier .
they were alleged to have co-operated in setting the price of beer sales to licensed premises in the netherlands , keeping prices artificially high .
the netherlands is one of europe 's largest beer-drinking markets although sales have fallen in recent years as older consumers tend to favour wine .
reports suggest that commissioners decided some time ago to penalise the companies and were merely deliberating over the scale of fines appropriate in the case .
inbev is the world 's largest brewer in terms of sales volumes , producing the likes of beck 's , hoegarden and bass .
ms kroes has made the fight against price fixing and other competition violations one of her main priorities .
brussels has already issued fines totalling 1.7bn euros against firms this year in cartel cases .

the debate was initiated by britain , which holds this month 's council presidency , with the argument that climate change could pose to world security .
it is an attempt to build up the debate from its scientific foundations and is being compared by british officials to a security council discussion in january 2000 on the threat to security in africa of hiv / aids .
that debate is reckoned to have been what one british official called a " turning point " in getting international action on the disease .
whether this debate will make a significant impact on climate change remains to be seen .
the british foreign secretary margaret beckett chaired the debate and said : " the security council is the forum to discuss issues that threaten the peace and security of the international community .
what makes wars start ?
fights over water .
changing patterns of rainfall .
fights over food production , land use ... there are few greater potential threats to our economies too ... but also to peace and security itself . "
however there were objections from developing countries who said that the security council was infringing on the roles of other un bodies .
russia did not veto the debate , as it could have , but was not enthusiastic and the united states chose to stress the role that governments should play .
" the most effective way to bolster security and stability is to increase the capacity of states to govern effectively , " said the us un ambassador alejandro wolff .
and china all but dismissed the discussion , calling it " an exception " and stating that the council was " not the right decision-making place " .
but the un secretary general ban ki-moon supported the debate .
he said there were some " alarming scenarios " that could weaken the power of states to resolve conflicts .
leading official the key british official in this effort is john ashton , who was appointed special climate change representative by mrs beckett when she took office almost a year ago .
since then , the foreign office has had to get used to dealing with climate as a diplomatic issue .
formerly in the foreign office himself , john ashton is now on secondment from a climate lobby group called e3g .
" the security implications of climate changes are bigger than we thought even two or three years ago , " he said of the security council debate .
" their effects can already be seen in darfur and in water shortages in central asia .
the recent european summit committed the eu to a lower carbon economy and was a key moment .
now it is in the security council .
" the significance of the security council debate is the debate itself .
the council has not had one before .
but if there is no action , there will be no winners .
all will be losers . "
role for china john ashton has previously stressed the importance of international action , saying in particular that without action by china on its coal-fired power stations , the efforts of many other nations will be in vain .
" if you do not have a policy for coal , you do not have a policy for climate , " he stated .
areas of concern include the possible submergence of entire small island states -lrb- and -rrb- dramatically receding coastlines british government document as for the united states , british officials say there has already been a " very dramatic shift towards a more engaged position " and that a growing number of individual us states are taking action in the absence of a federal government lead .
" but this is not only about government decisions , " one senior official said .
" it is about changing where investment goes .
international agreements are simply the means to the end of shifting investment to low-carbon economies .
it is not a war but it does require worldwide mobilisation . "
british paper the british mission to the un circulated a paper explaining why it felt that a discussion was needed .
for a foreign office document , it is full of unusually stark phrases .
it shows the new diplomacy of global warming at work .
it warns of " major changes to the world 's physical landmass during this century " , resulting in border and maritime disputes .
" areas of concern include the possible submergence of entire small island states -lsb- and -rsb- dramatically receding coastlines , " it says .
two-hundred-million people could be displaced by the middle of the century because " substantial parts of the world risk being left uninhabitable by rising sea levels " .
there could be conflicts over " scarce energy resources , security of supply and the role energy resources play once conflict has broken out " .
new player a day in advance of the security council discussion , a report is being published by a significant new player in the climate change debate - the united states military .
a report , issued from the federally-funded center for naval analyses and written by 11 senior retired generals , says that global warming " presents significant national security challenges to the united states " .
it says that climate change " can act as a threat multiplier for instability in some of the most volatile regions of the world " .
last month , the us army war college and the triangle institute for security studies held a seminar entitled " the national security implications of global climate change . "
the seminar invitation stated : " this is an important and timely topic , deserving serious analysis and discussion . "

msf treat men with gunshot wounds at st catherine 's hospital " both sides were using very heavy machine-guns and a bullet can go through three houses , it can break through two or three walls for sure , " says fabio pompetti , head of the international medical aid agency medecins sans frontieres mission in haiti .
" last year we had a bullet hit the hospital and it went through two big walls , boom boom . "
he is talking about fighting which raged when un peacekeepers cracked down on armed gangs in the port-au-prince slum of cite soleil , home to nearly 250,000 people , where his team runs the st catherine hospital .
being impartial means that you stand there , you judge the situation as it is and you take charge maj gen patrick cammaert until recently un commander in eastern drc between 22 december and 9 february , the hospital received 58 people injured by bullets and six who died after arrival .
the bodies of an unknown number of other fatalities , at least some of them gunmen , were not brought in .
two of the dead were women aged 18 and 20 , and the wounded included six women and two children under the age of 12 .
" i can not say whose bullets hurt these people but what i can say is that all of these people were hit during fighting and clashes between the un and the armed groups , " mr pompetti told the bbc news website .
poverty and gangs hurt haiti a former commander of the un mission -lrb- minustah -rrb- , gen augusto heleno ribeiro , testified before the brazilian parliament in december 2004 that he had been under " extreme pressure from the international community to use violence " .
in january 2006 , msf denounced minustah for referring to civilian casualties as " collateral damage " , saying it was " inexcusable for so many lives to be torn apart every day in the crossfire " .
since then , and notwithstanding the civilian casualties received at st catherine 's , minustah has been " much more careful to avoid killing civilians " , says mr pompetti .
' impartial , not neutral ' maj gen patrick cammaert knows more than most about the challenge of enforcing peace .
gen cammaert 's career began with the dutch marine corps in 1968 the dutch marine has commanded un peacekeepers in cambodia -lrb- 1992-93 -rrb- and the horn of africa -lrb- 2000-02 -rrb- , and has also served as military adviser to the un 's department of peacekeeping operations in new york .
in early 2005 , he took command of the 15,000-strong un -lrb- monuc -rrb- forces in eastern drc , leading them back from what he calls the " very low point " of bukavu in 2004 , when rebel soldiers overran the town and committed atrocities .
" monuc had threatened them ... but did not live up to their threats , " he recalls , speaking to the bbc news website after completing his drc posting in february .
while neither monuc 's mission nor its rules of engagement changed substantially , gen cammaert set about enforcing the mandate on his principle that " un forces are impartial and not neutral " .
" being neutral means that you stand there and you say ' well , i have nothing to do with it ' , while being impartial means that you stand there , you judge the situation as it is and you take charge , " he explains .
equipped with attack helicopters and special forces , his eastern division took action in some of the region 's most troubled areas .
in the spring of 2005 , for example , monuc troops killed 50 militia fighters in a high-profile offensive in ituri after losing nine of its own soldiers in an ambush .
but monuc was , the general says , nonetheless " extremely careful in not applying too much force " .
dubious allies ?
monuc 's tough enforcement policy was " reasonably successful " , the general believes , helping safeguard elections in 2006 and strengthening security in the east .
it seems inevitable that any kind of enforcement entails civilian casualties nicholas doyle , kinshasa , dr congo bbc news website reader but human rights campaigners , who initially lamented monuc inaction and demanded robust enforcement of its mandate to protect civilians , are concerned about how the tougher approach may be evolving .
while not accusing monuc troops themselves of harming civilians , human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- is investigating whether the un 's local ally , the new drc army , may have committed war crimes during joint operations against rebels in the east .
hrw senior researcher anneke van woudenberg , who last year visited ituri , told the bbc news website that the army is viewed by some as " the worst human rights abusers in the drc " .
combat instinct taking the long view of peacekeeping , gen cammaert believes the un has " really come a long way " since the crises in somalia , bosnia and rwanda in the 1990s .
terror in bukavu drc troops jailed for crimes un takes fight to drc militia he says monuc 's eastern division " can really match any peacekeeping operation of nato or the eu " .
dr paul higate , politics lecturer at bristol university , has studied peacekeeping in dr congo and sierra leone and sees a " tension between peacekeeping as traditionally defined in terms of impartiality , neutrality etc , and more obviously pro-active , military action " .
" most peacekeeping troops are combat-trained and many do find peacekeeping somewhat frustrating , making little or no use of their military skills , " he says hence there is a risk that more pro-active operations might be seen as having greater status .
at the same time , dr higate adds , the amount of risk peacekeepers are willing to take may be determined by a commander 's fear that losing a soldier on a peacekeeping operation " might be seen to be something of a failure " .
have you served as a peacekeeper with the un ?
are you happy with a tougher attitude to peace enforcement ?
your comments : i 've served with the un missions in sierra leone and the drc .
i am very optimistic the impartial approach of the un missions works , slowly though .
i believe impartiality is not a weakness .
in addition , i agree with gen cammaert that impartiality is different from neutrality .
you can call them " blue bullets " or whatever , but one thing for sure remains , those boys and girls in blue helmets are heroes .
viva les casques .
richard musonda , lusaka , zambia with the exception of the excellent brazilian soldiers who actually challenge and defeat the tiny minority of armed gangs who murder , kidnap and terrorise the majority of good haitian people , the un soldiers are not widely seen as being effective in enforcing security .
partly due to the limited mandate and partly due to the countries the soldiers are supplied from .
minustah is not nicknamed tourista for no reason !
the us marines actually proved to be the most effective peace implementation force on several previous occasions .
ian jones , port au prince , haiti as the wife of someone who served in somalia , i want to thank you for covering this and thank those who are speaking out about the frustration soldiers face in the role of a peacekeeper .
heather , houston , usa i have worked closely with monuc forces whilst managing humanitarian work in drc 's ituri district and appreciate the extraordinary difficulties in getting the balance right between peacekeeping and peace enforcement .
unfortunately , it seems inevitable that any kind of enforcement entails civilian casualties , if only because going after vicious militia personnel - whose lives are characterised by unimaginable brutality - always has uncontrollable repercussions .
unless un action completely wipes out militia forces - unlikely in the kind of terrain where they normally operate - survivors disperse and parasitize in terrifying style on local populations .
much as i respect the work of the human rights campaigners , they often seem unable to grasp the implications of a more proactive defense of the very rights they champion .
nicholas doyle , kinshasa , dr congo i am convinced that a neutral peacekeeping force ... misleads the victims that they are protected hence exposing them to the danger , instead of finding their own ways of escaping kazoora naphtal , kigali , rwanda bbc news website reader gen cammaert and the mainly indian and pakistani un troops can rightly be proud of having built up a security environment that allowed the elections to take place in drc .
the security situation i saw in bukavu and goma in 2006 as a long-term election observer was tough .
monuc needed " elbowroom " and respect from residents and the countless armed groups .
atrocities especially in outlying villages were still committed , the police and " national " army were not paid appropriately .
ole wagner smitt , copenhagen denmark i served with the canadian forces , in unprofor , in croatia in 1993 .
with the exception of the british army , most of the other contingents were unprofessional and poorly equipped .
it was hard to participate in peacekeeping , or peacemaking operations when those around you could n't work in the cold , were there only for the money , or had chosen to back a particular side .
i was in bosnia with s-for in 2000 and the difference was like night and day .
all contingents were very professional and there was a proper balance of dialogue and firepower to make things work .
un peacekeeping looks great on tv , but it never works .
like the cold war , it 's a thing of the past .
mike , toronto as an ex-serviceman who served on un peacekeeping ops , i have to say that the un 's more robust attitude is welcomed , since during my un ops , enforcement of the peace was required , and the un 's rules of engagement prohibited this .
your assessment that combat troops do not necessarily make good peacekeepers was totally correct , and my own experience of un command -lrb- op grapple 2 , bosnia 1993-94 -rrb- was that we were reduced to merely counting the bodies as atrocities were committed around us , when we would have been happy to intervene , despite the potential risk to ourselves .
if the un is to be taken seriously as a peacekeeper , it needs teeth to enforce the peace by all means necessary , and if that means " fighting for peace " then so be it .
had we been allowed to act in a more aggressive manner in bosnia , for example , then the outcome would have been quite different , and in my opinion , many lives would have been saved .
dl , europe i have never served as a peacekeeper , but i am convinced that a neutral peacekeeping force ... misleads the victims that they are protected hence exposing them to the danger , instead of finding their own ways of escaping .
once they hear that a un force is around , they tend to seek refuge in their camps , only to be exposed to the danger .
this has happened in our country and other countries where so-called neutral forces have been deployed .
i therefore support impartial un force , although impartiality should be treated with extra care to avoid siding with one party , thus leading to a wrong decision .
kazoora naphtal , kigali , rwanda we judge these men and women when they do nothing yet when they do something and engage the threat to civilians we go against them .
maybe the people who judge them negatively should spend a day in their boots ?
alex maisey , london / england i have served as a peacekeeper with the un .
i was also a desk officer of the military planning service , the military division , the un department of peacekeeping operations when gen cammaert was the military advisor .
i was deployed to haiti with the un assessment mission before the establishment of minustah ...
the key to stabilise haiti still rests with the control of violence in several shantytowns of the capital , especially cite soleil ...
un forces are allowed to use force sufficient to silence a source of deadly fire that is directed at un troops ... while the security council also authorises the use of force beyond self-defense to execute mandate of the missions .
should the un troops hesitate to use force , the armed groups play down the un troops and the security situation will get worse in most of the failed states .
in addition , the lack of proactiveness damages the credibility of the member state that deployed its troops .
the protection of soft targets including innocent civilians is another issue the modern un operations now face with .
the armed groups sometimes uses innocent civilians as human shield or intentionally shoot them to announce they got shot at by the un troops ...
the issue is more complex than just asking whether you are happy with a tougher attitude to peace enforcement or not .
michio suda , tokyo , japan the idea that well-armed un troops just stand about when people are being murdered in front of them is appalling .
of course they should go in and kill every last one of the people doing the killing but at the other end we should admit that these rebels or freedom fighters or whatever they are can only fight if they can get weapons .
we should turn the really big political guns on those who manufacture weapons and that sadly tends to be exactly the same un countries who are most upset about murdering militias running about the world .
we have to pull the babies from the river but we also have to stop them being chucked in upstream , and only we can do the latter .
john , dundee , uk i served in bosnia under the eufor mandate which is similar .
the frustrations combat-trained soldiers face mentioned in your article is very real and has a negative effect on both morale and effectiveness ...
how do these ngos and human rights groups expect peacekeepers to confront violent , well-armed paramilitary groups ?
a floppy hat , soft posture and nice words will get you very little in the way of law enforcement and peace keeping especially in places like the drc .

msf treat men with gunshot wounds at st catherine 's hospital " both sides were using very heavy machine-guns and a bullet can go through three houses , it can break through two or three walls for sure , " says fabio pompetti , head of the international medical aid agency medecins sans frontieres mission in haiti .
" last year we had a bullet hit the hospital and it went through two big walls , boom boom . "
he is talking about fighting which raged when un peacekeepers cracked down on armed gangs in the port-au-prince slum of cite soleil , home to nearly 250,000 people , where his team runs the st catherine hospital .
being impartial means that you stand there , you judge the situation as it is and you take charge maj gen patrick cammaert until recently un commander in eastern drc between 22 december and 9 february , the hospital received 58 people injured by bullets and six who died after arrival .
the bodies of an unknown number of other fatalities , at least some of them gunmen , were not brought in .
two of the dead were women aged 18 and 20 , and the wounded included six women and two children under the age of 12 .
" i can not say whose bullets hurt these people but what i can say is that all of these people were hit during fighting and clashes between the un and the armed groups , " mr pompetti told the bbc news website .
poverty and gangs hurt haiti a former commander of the un mission -lrb- minustah -rrb- , gen augusto heleno ribeiro , testified before the brazilian parliament in december 2004 that he had been under " extreme pressure from the international community to use violence " .
in january 2006 , msf denounced minustah for referring to civilian casualties as " collateral damage " , saying it was " inexcusable for so many lives to be torn apart every day in the crossfire " .
since then , and notwithstanding the civilian casualties received at st catherine 's , minustah has been " much more careful to avoid killing civilians " , says mr pompetti .
' impartial , not neutral ' maj gen patrick cammaert knows more than most about the challenge of enforcing peace .
gen cammaert 's career began with the dutch marine corps in 1968 the dutch marine has commanded un peacekeepers in cambodia -lrb- 1992-93 -rrb- and the horn of africa -lrb- 2000-02 -rrb- , and has also served as military adviser to the un 's department of peacekeeping operations in new york .
in early 2005 , he took command of the 15,000-strong un -lrb- monuc -rrb- forces in eastern drc , leading them back from what he calls the " very low point " of bukavu in 2004 , when rebel soldiers overran the town and committed atrocities .
" monuc had threatened them ... but did not live up to their threats , " he recalls , speaking to the bbc news website after completing his drc posting in february .
while neither monuc 's mission nor its rules of engagement changed substantially , gen cammaert set about enforcing the mandate on his principle that " un forces are impartial and not neutral " .
" being neutral means that you stand there and you say ' well , i have nothing to do with it ' , while being impartial means that you stand there , you judge the situation as it is and you take charge , " he explains .
equipped with attack helicopters and special forces , his eastern division took action in some of the region 's most troubled areas .
in the spring of 2005 , for example , monuc troops killed 50 militia fighters in a high-profile offensive in ituri after losing nine of its own soldiers in an ambush .
but monuc was , the general says , nonetheless " extremely careful in not applying too much force " .
dubious allies ?
monuc 's tough enforcement policy was " reasonably successful " , the general believes , helping safeguard elections in 2006 and strengthening security in the east .
it seems inevitable that any kind of enforcement entails civilian casualties nicholas doyle , kinshasa , dr congo bbc news website reader but human rights campaigners , who initially lamented monuc inaction and demanded robust enforcement of its mandate to protect civilians , are concerned about how the tougher approach may be evolving .
while not accusing monuc troops themselves of harming civilians , human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- is investigating whether the un 's local ally , the new drc army , may have committed war crimes during joint operations against rebels in the east .
hrw senior researcher anneke van woudenberg , who last year visited ituri , told the bbc news website that the army is viewed by some as " the worst human rights abusers in the drc " .
combat instinct taking the long view of peacekeeping , gen cammaert believes the un has " really come a long way " since the crises in somalia , bosnia and rwanda in the 1990s .
terror in bukavu drc troops jailed for crimes un takes fight to drc militia he says monuc 's eastern division " can really match any peacekeeping operation of nato or the eu " .
dr paul higate , politics lecturer at bristol university , has studied peacekeeping in dr congo and sierra leone and sees a " tension between peacekeeping as traditionally defined in terms of impartiality , neutrality etc , and more obviously pro-active , military action " .
" most peacekeeping troops are combat-trained and many do find peacekeeping somewhat frustrating , making little or no use of their military skills , " he says hence there is a risk that more pro-active operations might be seen as having greater status .
at the same time , dr higate adds , the amount of risk peacekeepers are willing to take may be determined by a commander 's fear that losing a soldier on a peacekeeping operation " might be seen to be something of a failure " .
have you served as a peacekeeper with the un ?
are you happy with a tougher attitude to peace enforcement ?
your comments : i 've served with the un missions in sierra leone and the drc .
i am very optimistic the impartial approach of the un missions works , slowly though .
i believe impartiality is not a weakness .
in addition , i agree with gen cammaert that impartiality is different from neutrality .
you can call them " blue bullets " or whatever , but one thing for sure remains , those boys and girls in blue helmets are heroes .
viva les casques .
richard musonda , lusaka , zambia with the exception of the excellent brazilian soldiers who actually challenge and defeat the tiny minority of armed gangs who murder , kidnap and terrorise the majority of good haitian people , the un soldiers are not widely seen as being effective in enforcing security .
partly due to the limited mandate and partly due to the countries the soldiers are supplied from .
minustah is not nicknamed tourista for no reason !
the us marines actually proved to be the most effective peace implementation force on several previous occasions .
ian jones , port au prince , haiti as the wife of someone who served in somalia , i want to thank you for covering this and thank those who are speaking out about the frustration soldiers face in the role of a peacekeeper .
heather , houston , usa i have worked closely with monuc forces whilst managing humanitarian work in drc 's ituri district and appreciate the extraordinary difficulties in getting the balance right between peacekeeping and peace enforcement .
unfortunately , it seems inevitable that any kind of enforcement entails civilian casualties , if only because going after vicious militia personnel - whose lives are characterised by unimaginable brutality - always has uncontrollable repercussions .
unless un action completely wipes out militia forces - unlikely in the kind of terrain where they normally operate - survivors disperse and parasitize in terrifying style on local populations .
much as i respect the work of the human rights campaigners , they often seem unable to grasp the implications of a more proactive defense of the very rights they champion .
nicholas doyle , kinshasa , dr congo i am convinced that a neutral peacekeeping force ... misleads the victims that they are protected hence exposing them to the danger , instead of finding their own ways of escaping kazoora naphtal , kigali , rwanda bbc news website reader gen cammaert and the mainly indian and pakistani un troops can rightly be proud of having built up a security environment that allowed the elections to take place in drc .
the security situation i saw in bukavu and goma in 2006 as a long-term election observer was tough .
monuc needed " elbowroom " and respect from residents and the countless armed groups .
atrocities especially in outlying villages were still committed , the police and " national " army were not paid appropriately .
ole wagner smitt , copenhagen denmark i served with the canadian forces , in unprofor , in croatia in 1993 .
with the exception of the british army , most of the other contingents were unprofessional and poorly equipped .
it was hard to participate in peacekeeping , or peacemaking operations when those around you could n't work in the cold , were there only for the money , or had chosen to back a particular side .
i was in bosnia with s-for in 2000 and the difference was like night and day .

msf treat men with gunshot wounds at st catherine 's hospital " both sides were using very heavy machine-guns and a bullet can go through three houses , it can break through two or three walls for sure , " says fabio pompetti , head of the international medical aid agency medecins sans frontieres mission in haiti .
" last year we had a bullet hit the hospital and it went through two big walls , boom boom . "
he is talking about fighting which raged when un peacekeepers cracked down on armed gangs in the port-au-prince slum of cite soleil , home to nearly 250,000 people , where his team runs the st catherine hospital .
being impartial means that you stand there , you judge the situation as it is and you take charge maj gen patrick cammaert until recently un commander in eastern drc between 22 december and 9 february , the hospital received 58 people injured by bullets and six who died after arrival .
the bodies of an unknown number of other fatalities , at least some of them gunmen , were not brought in .
two of the dead were women aged 18 and 20 , and the wounded included six women and two children under the age of 12 .
" i can not say whose bullets hurt these people but what i can say is that all of these people were hit during fighting and clashes between the un and the armed groups , " mr pompetti told the bbc news website .
poverty and gangs hurt haiti a former commander of the un mission -lrb- minustah -rrb- , gen augusto heleno ribeiro , testified before the brazilian parliament in december 2004 that he had been under " extreme pressure from the international community to use violence " .
in january 2006 , msf denounced minustah for referring to civilian casualties as " collateral damage " , saying it was " inexcusable for so many lives to be torn apart every day in the crossfire " .
since then , and notwithstanding the civilian casualties received at st catherine 's , minustah has been " much more careful to avoid killing civilians " , says mr pompetti .
' impartial , not neutral ' maj gen patrick cammaert knows more than most about the challenge of enforcing peace .
gen cammaert 's career began with the dutch marine corps in 1968 the dutch marine has commanded un peacekeepers in cambodia -lrb- 1992-93 -rrb- and the horn of africa -lrb- 2000-02 -rrb- , and has also served as military adviser to the un 's department of peacekeeping operations in new york .
in early 2005 , he took command of the 15,000-strong un -lrb- monuc -rrb- forces in eastern drc , leading them back from what he calls the " very low point " of bukavu in 2004 , when rebel soldiers overran the town and committed atrocities .
" monuc had threatened them ... but did not live up to their threats , " he recalls , speaking to the bbc news website after completing his drc posting in february .
while neither monuc 's mission nor its rules of engagement changed substantially , gen cammaert set about enforcing the mandate on his principle that " un forces are impartial and not neutral " .
" being neutral means that you stand there and you say ' well , i have nothing to do with it ' , while being impartial means that you stand there , you judge the situation as it is and you take charge , " he explains .
equipped with attack helicopters and special forces , his eastern division took action in some of the region 's most troubled areas .
in the spring of 2005 , for example , monuc troops killed 50 militia fighters in a high-profile offensive in ituri after losing nine of its own soldiers in an ambush .
but monuc was , the general says , nonetheless " extremely careful in not applying too much force " .
dubious allies ?
monuc 's tough enforcement policy was " reasonably successful " , the general believes , helping safeguard elections in 2006 and strengthening security in the east .
it seems inevitable that any kind of enforcement entails civilian casualties nicholas doyle , kinshasa , dr congo bbc news website reader but human rights campaigners , who initially lamented monuc inaction and demanded robust enforcement of its mandate to protect civilians , are concerned about how the tougher approach may be evolving .
while not accusing monuc troops themselves of harming civilians , human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- is investigating whether the un 's local ally , the new drc army , may have committed war crimes during joint operations against rebels in the east .
hrw senior researcher anneke van woudenberg , who last year visited ituri , told the bbc news website that the army is viewed by some as " the worst human rights abusers in the drc " .
combat instinct taking the long view of peacekeeping , gen cammaert believes the un has " really come a long way " since the crises in somalia , bosnia and rwanda in the 1990s .
terror in bukavu drc troops jailed for crimes un takes fight to drc militia he says monuc 's eastern division " can really match any peacekeeping operation of nato or the eu " .
dr paul higate , politics lecturer at bristol university , has studied peacekeeping in dr congo and sierra leone and sees a " tension between peacekeeping as traditionally defined in terms of impartiality , neutrality etc , and more obviously pro-active , military action " .
" most peacekeeping troops are combat-trained and many do find peacekeeping somewhat frustrating , making little or no use of their military skills , " he says hence there is a risk that more pro-active operations might be seen as having greater status .
at the same time , dr higate adds , the amount of risk peacekeepers are willing to take may be determined by a commander 's fear that losing a soldier on a peacekeeping operation " might be seen to be something of a failure " .
have you served as a peacekeeper with the un ?
are you happy with a tougher attitude to peace enforcement ?
your comments : i 've served with the un missions in sierra leone and the drc .
i am very optimistic the impartial approach of the un missions works , slowly though .
i believe impartiality is not a weakness .
in addition , i agree with gen cammaert that impartiality is different from neutrality .
you can call them " blue bullets " or whatever , but one thing for sure remains , those boys and girls in blue helmets are heroes .
viva les casques .
richard musonda , lusaka , zambia with the exception of the excellent brazilian soldiers who actually challenge and defeat the tiny minority of armed gangs who murder , kidnap and terrorise the majority of good haitian people , the un soldiers are not widely seen as being effective in enforcing security .
partly due to the limited mandate and partly due to the countries the soldiers are supplied from .
minustah is not nicknamed tourista for no reason !
the us marines actually proved to be the most effective peace implementation force on several previous occasions .
ian jones , port au prince , haiti as the wife of someone who served in somalia , i want to thank you for covering this and thank those who are speaking out about the frustration soldiers face in the role of a peacekeeper .
heather , houston , usa i have worked closely with monuc forces whilst managing humanitarian work in drc 's ituri district and appreciate the extraordinary difficulties in getting the balance right between peacekeeping and peace enforcement .
unfortunately , it seems inevitable that any kind of enforcement entails civilian casualties , if only because going after vicious militia personnel - whose lives are characterised by unimaginable brutality - always has uncontrollable repercussions .
unless un action completely wipes out militia forces - unlikely in the kind of terrain where they normally operate - survivors disperse and parasitize in terrifying style on local populations .
much as i respect the work of the human rights campaigners , they often seem unable to grasp the implications of a more proactive defense of the very rights they champion .
nicholas doyle , kinshasa , dr congo i am convinced that a neutral peacekeeping force ... misleads the victims that they are protected hence exposing them to the danger , instead of finding their own ways of escaping kazoora naphtal , kigali , rwanda bbc news website reader gen cammaert and the mainly indian and pakistani un troops can rightly be proud of having built up a security environment that allowed the elections to take place in drc .
the security situation i saw in bukavu and goma in 2006 as a long-term election observer was tough .
monuc needed " elbowroom " and respect from residents and the countless armed groups .
atrocities especially in outlying villages were still committed , the police and " national " army were not paid appropriately .
ole wagner smitt , copenhagen denmark i served with the canadian forces , in unprofor , in croatia in 1993 .
with the exception of the british army , most of the other contingents were unprofessional and poorly equipped .
it was hard to participate in peacekeeping , or peacemaking operations when those around you could n't work in the cold , were there only for the money , or had chosen to back a particular side .
i was in bosnia with s-for in 2000 and the difference was like night and day .
all contingents were very professional and there was a proper balance of dialogue and firepower to make things work .
un peacekeeping looks great on tv , but it never works .
like the cold war , it 's a thing of the past .
mike , toronto as an ex-serviceman who served on un peacekeeping ops , i have to say that the un 's more robust attitude is welcomed , since during my un ops , enforcement of the peace was required , and the un 's rules of engagement prohibited this .
your assessment that combat troops do not necessarily make good peacekeepers was totally correct , and my own experience of un command -lrb- op grapple 2 , bosnia 1993-94 -rrb- was that we were reduced to merely counting the bodies as atrocities were committed around us , when we would have been happy to intervene , despite the potential risk to ourselves .
if the un is to be taken seriously as a peacekeeper , it needs teeth to enforce the peace by all means necessary , and if that means " fighting for peace " then so be it .
had we been allowed to act in a more aggressive manner in bosnia , for example , then the outcome would have been quite different , and in my opinion , many lives would have been saved .
dl , europe i have never served as a peacekeeper , but i am convinced that a neutral peacekeeping force ... misleads the victims that they are protected hence exposing them to the danger , instead of finding their own ways of escaping .
once they hear that a un force is around , they tend to seek refuge in their camps , only to be exposed to the danger .
this has happened in our country and other countries where so-called neutral forces have been deployed .
i therefore support impartial un force , although impartiality should be treated with extra care to avoid siding with one party , thus leading to a wrong decision .
kazoora naphtal , kigali , rwanda we judge these men and women when they do nothing yet when they do something and engage the threat to civilians we go against them .
maybe the people who judge them negatively should spend a day in their boots ?
alex maisey , london / england i have served as a peacekeeper with the un .
i was also a desk officer of the military planning service , the military division , the un department of peacekeeping operations when gen cammaert was the military advisor .
i was deployed to haiti with the un assessment mission before the establishment of minustah ...
the key to stabilise haiti still rests with the control of violence in several shantytowns of the capital , especially cite soleil ...
un forces are allowed to use force sufficient to silence a source of deadly fire that is directed at un troops ... while the security council also authorises the use of force beyond self-defense to execute mandate of the missions .
should the un troops hesitate to use force , the armed groups play down the un troops and the security situation will get worse in most of the failed states .
in addition , the lack of proactiveness damages the credibility of the member state that deployed its troops .
the protection of soft targets including innocent civilians is another issue the modern un operations now face with .
the armed groups sometimes uses innocent civilians as human shield or intentionally shoot them to announce they got shot at by the un troops ...
the issue is more complex than just asking whether you are happy with a tougher attitude to peace enforcement or not .
michio suda , tokyo , japan the idea that well-armed un troops just stand about when people are being murdered in front of them is appalling .
of course they should go in and kill every last one of the people doing the killing but at the other end we should admit that these rebels or freedom fighters or whatever they are can only fight if they can get weapons .
we should turn the really big political guns on those who manufacture weapons and that sadly tends to be exactly the same un countries who are most upset about murdering militias running about the world .
we have to pull the babies from the river but we also have to stop them being chucked in upstream , and only we can do the latter .
john , dundee , uk i served in bosnia under the eufor mandate which is similar .
the frustrations combat-trained soldiers face mentioned in your article is very real and has a negative effect on both morale and effectiveness ...
how do these ngos and human rights groups expect peacekeepers to confront violent , well-armed paramilitary groups ?
a floppy hat , soft posture and nice words will get you very little in the way of law enforcement and peace keeping especially in places like the drc .
