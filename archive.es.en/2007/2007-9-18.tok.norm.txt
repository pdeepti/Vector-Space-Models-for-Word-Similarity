those five current permanent members - the world war ii victors - have veto power over security matters .
the resolution calls for the 62nd general assembly , which begins work on tuesday , sept .
18 , to " take immediate steps to facilitate results-oriented inter-governmental negotiations " along the lines of discussions among un members in past years .
germany and japan , which also have aspirations for permanent seats on the security council , did not join in sponsoring the resolution .
but they stand to benefit if negotiations succeed in reforming the council .
after years of pushing for a permanent seat on the un security council , germany announced in july that it had scaled back its ambitions in the hope that a series of larger reforms would ultimately end with berlin as part of the body .
reforms could benefit germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier could make a case for a council spot over the summer , germany said it was going to change its course from calling for a seat on the council to looking for an " intelligent compromise . "
officials in berlin claimed that the un was suffering from " reform fatigue " and would restart its negotiations for a permanent seat once a viable reform package was under way .
the new resolution could be the first step in a larger reform process that could see germany and its so-called group of four partners - japan , brazil and india - admitted to the security council .
group of four opposed by regional rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's un aspirations were toned down , not quashed two years ago , the group of four issued a series of demands for permanent seats .
but each met fierce regional opposition : india was opposed by pakistan , japan was opposed by south korea and china , germany was opposed by italy , and brazil was opposed by several latin american nations .
in addition to the council 's five permanent members , there are also 10 members elected for a two-year term with the 10 seats rotating among the world 's five regions .
un members have for more than 15 years called for revamping the council to include more countries - as many as 20 or 25 members - and give more representation to developing nations . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the man spent seven weeks in the intensive care unit with no sign of improvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany draws the line at embryonic stem cell research stauer decided to apply stem cell therapy on the patient .
following nine days of treatment , the man had improved enough that he could leave intensive care and be moved to a rehabilitation center . the therapy involved extracting adult stem cells from the patient 's bone marrow and then inserting them , with the help of a balloon catheter , into the artery damaged by the infarction . the procedure took about a half hour . stauer called it a " global innovation " in that cardiogenic shock - inadequate delivery of oxygen to the heart tissues - could be treated with stem cell therapy for the first time ever . embryonic stem cell research banned in germany such stem cell therapy , however , has enlivened the debate on embryonic stem cell research . recently , the german government said it would allocate five million euros -lrb- $ 6.9 million -rrb- over the next three years for non-embryonic stem cell research . stem cells can develop into different cell types , including those for bones , blood and the brain .
specialists say they can help in treating illnesses such as parkinson 's , and can help to regenerate damaged organs or tissue . researchers say embryonic stem cells - cells taken from days-old human embryos - are the most promising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minor heart attacks often go unnoticed however , genetic research is highly contested in germany due to its nazi history of experimentation to create a " master race . " since 2002 , the production of embryonic cells from pre-existing stem cell lines is prohibited in germany .
scientists are also not permitted to research on any lines produced after jan .

18 , franco-german relations are maneuvering a patch of rough water : personality clashes between leaders and policy differences are the problem . when former french president jacques chirac would come calling on chancellor angela merkel , she seemed charmed by his gallant style , old world sensibility and those light kisses on the hand that got so much media play .
but his successor 's habit of familiarly kissing and hugging the german leader at their meetings has left her cold , even annoyed , according to reports , and has not helped strengthen a relationship that is seen as pivotal within the european union . were it just a matter of where to place a kiss , the issue might be solved with the intervention of a protocol officer .
but the differences between the two leaders are ones of both style and substance , which make them more difficult to bridge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel received many a kiss on the hand from france 's former president jacques chirac last week , france 's government spokesman said sarkozy told his cabinet his latest talks with merkel had been " very frank " - diplomatic speak for heated .
it comes after a series of low-level spats , including disagreements over the independence of the european central bank , the future of nuclear power , sarkozy 's protectionist murmurings , and even his stealing the spotlight over the freeing of bulgarian medics long held by libya . according to observers in both france and germany , merkel is not amused .
the french le figaro newspaper said the chancellor was irritated by sarkozy 's " rough and ready " manner .
the german rheinische post daily called the relationship one in " deep crisis . " " there is real annoyance , although i would n't use the word ' crisis , " ' said henrik uterwedde , deputy director of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg in southwestern germany .
" but it 's not peanuts and it should ring alarm bells . " styles : day and night when sarkozy became president in may , it was thought he and merkel would be the perfect couple .
both come from parties on the right-hand side of the political spectrum , both have an interest in economic reform and getting an eu reform treaty back on track .
they were even born just six months apart .
but , on closer examination , the fact that they have not hit it off personally might not be surprising .
their styles could not be more different . angela merkel , a pastor 's daughter who grew up in east germany , is cautious and reserved .
she has a down-to-earth style that dispenses with all flash .
but she has succeeded in finding a way to communicate her positions - even to foreign leaders on controversial topics like human rights in china or russian democracy - in a low-key but effective manner .
she is the quintessential team player . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he likes the crowd 's adulation and ministers who know their place nicolas sarkozy is a near opposite of that .
brash and in constant movement , he has been called hyperactive by many .
comparisons to bonaparte have been frequent , given his dismissive behavior towards his cabinet and his apparent love for showmanship and the spotlight . " france 's government system is much more hierarchical than germany 's , " said uterwedde .
" under sarkozy , it is even more so . " sarkozy recently crashed a meeting of finance ministers in brussels and explained his country 's short-term economic strategy while france 's own finance minister christine lagarde " sat there like a schoolgirl , " according to uterwedde . when german finance minister peer steinbrück accusing the french president of " giving fiscal handouts to voters " instead of keeping his european budgetary promises , sarkozy became incensed . " how dare you speak to me in that tone , " sarkozy is said to have replied , and was later furious with merkel for not rapping her finance minister 's knuckles as he requested . l 'état , c 'est moi ? while observers say the franco-german situation has not reached the breaking point , sarkozy would be wise to calm his style and become more of a player on team eu , or he could risk alienating more than just angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is accused of taking credit for initiatives that were n't his own , such as the release of medics held by libya " sarkozy has to learn that france is not playing alone but is part of a team called europe , " said isabelle bourgeois , a researcher at cirac , a paris-based think tank that studies franco-german relations . as far as the symbolic relationship of the french and german leaders goes , the current situation is bad , she says , although she 's careful to add that on the economic level , the two countries are integrated more than ever .
so far , the merkel-sarkozy irritation has caused little serious collateral damage . but other key areas , such as reforms of european markets , the constitution and the euro require close , high-level franco-german cooperation .
the fact that the two leaders might have a difficult time being in the same room together could hinder european progress on those fronts . wider irritation just this weekend , tensions over economic policy between sarkozy and other european leaders burst into the open . the head of the german bundesbank , axel weber , called sarkozy 's understanding of economic realities " zero " in the wake of the french leader 's constant criticism of the european central bank .

18 , franco-german relations are maneuvering a patch of rough water : personality clashes between leaders and policy differences are the problem . when former french president jacques chirac would come calling on chancellor angela merkel , she seemed charmed by his gallant style , old world sensibility and those light kisses on the hand that got so much media play .
but his successor 's habit of familiarly kissing and hugging the german leader at their meetings has left her cold , even annoyed , according to reports , and has not helped strengthen a relationship that is seen as pivotal within the european union . were it just a matter of where to place a kiss , the issue might be solved with the intervention of a protocol officer .
but the differences between the two leaders are ones of both style and substance , which make them more difficult to bridge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel received many a kiss on the hand from france 's former president jacques chirac last week , france 's government spokesman said sarkozy told his cabinet his latest talks with merkel had been " very frank " - diplomatic speak for heated .
it comes after a series of low-level spats , including disagreements over the independence of the european central bank , the future of nuclear power , sarkozy 's protectionist murmurings , and even his stealing the spotlight over the freeing of bulgarian medics long held by libya . according to observers in both france and germany , merkel is not amused .
the french le figaro newspaper said the chancellor was irritated by sarkozy 's " rough and ready " manner .
the german rheinische post daily called the relationship one in " deep crisis . " " there is real annoyance , although i would n't use the word ' crisis , " ' said henrik uterwedde , deputy director of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg in southwestern germany .

both come from parties on the right-hand side of the political spectrum , both have an interest in economic reform and getting an eu reform treaty back on track .
they were even born just six months apart .
but , on closer examination , the fact that they have not hit it off personally might not be surprising .
their styles could not be more different . angela merkel , a pastor 's daughter who grew up in east germany , is cautious and reserved .
she has a down-to-earth style that dispenses with all flash .
but she has succeeded in finding a way to communicate her positions - even to foreign leaders on controversial topics like human rights in china or russian democracy - in a low-key but effective manner .
she is the quintessential team player . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he likes the crowd 's adulation and ministers who know their place nicolas sarkozy is a near opposite of that .
brash and in constant movement , he has been called hyperactive by many .
comparisons to bonaparte have been frequent , given his dismissive behavior towards his cabinet and his apparent love for showmanship and the spotlight . " france 's government system is much more hierarchical than germany 's , " said uterwedde .
" under sarkozy , it is even more so . " sarkozy recently crashed a meeting of finance ministers in brussels and explained his country 's short-term economic strategy while france 's own finance minister christine lagarde " sat there like a schoolgirl , " according to uterwedde . when german finance minister peer steinbrück accusing the french president of " giving fiscal handouts to voters " instead of keeping his european budgetary promises , sarkozy became incensed . " how dare you speak to me in that tone , " sarkozy is said to have replied , and was later furious with merkel for not rapping her finance minister 's knuckles as he requested . l 'état , c 'est moi ? while observers say the franco-german situation has not reached the breaking point , sarkozy would be wise to calm his style and become more of a player on team eu , or he could risk alienating more than just angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is accused of taking credit for initiatives that were n't his own , such as the release of medics held by libya " sarkozy has to learn that france is not playing alone but is part of a team called europe , " said isabelle bourgeois , a researcher at cirac , a paris-based think tank that studies franco-german relations . as far as the symbolic relationship of the french and german leaders goes , the current situation is bad , she says , although she 's careful to add that on the economic level , the two countries are integrated more than ever .
so far , the merkel-sarkozy irritation has caused little serious collateral damage . but other key areas , such as reforms of european markets , the constitution and the euro require close , high-level franco-german cooperation .
the fact that the two leaders might have a difficult time being in the same room together could hinder european progress on those fronts . wider irritation just this weekend , tensions over economic policy between sarkozy and other european leaders burst into the open . the head of the german bundesbank , axel weber , called sarkozy 's understanding of economic realities " zero " in the wake of the french leader 's constant criticism of the european central bank .

18 , franco-german relations are maneuvering a patch of rough water : personality clashes between leaders and policy differences are the problem . when former french president jacques chirac would come calling on chancellor angela merkel , she seemed charmed by his gallant style , old world sensibility and those light kisses on the hand that got so much media play .
but his successor 's habit of familiarly kissing and hugging the german leader at their meetings has left her cold , even annoyed , according to reports , and has not helped strengthen a relationship that is seen as pivotal within the european union . were it just a matter of where to place a kiss , the issue might be solved with the intervention of a protocol officer .
but the differences between the two leaders are ones of both style and substance , which make them more difficult to bridge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel received many a kiss on the hand from france 's former president jacques chirac last week , france 's government spokesman said sarkozy told his cabinet his latest talks with merkel had been " very frank " - diplomatic speak for heated .
it comes after a series of low-level spats , including disagreements over the independence of the european central bank , the future of nuclear power , sarkozy 's protectionist murmurings , and even his stealing the spotlight over the freeing of bulgarian medics long held by libya . according to observers in both france and germany , merkel is not amused .
the french le figaro newspaper said the chancellor was irritated by sarkozy 's " rough and ready " manner .
the german rheinische post daily called the relationship one in " deep crisis . " " there is real annoyance , although i would n't use the word ' crisis , " ' said henrik uterwedde , deputy director of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg in southwestern germany .
" but it 's not peanuts and it should ring alarm bells . " styles : day and night when sarkozy became president in may , it was thought he and merkel would be the perfect couple .
both come from parties on the right-hand side of the political spectrum , both have an interest in economic reform and getting an eu reform treaty back on track .
they were even born just six months apart .
but , on closer examination , the fact that they have not hit it off personally might not be surprising .
their styles could not be more different . angela merkel , a pastor 's daughter who grew up in east germany , is cautious and reserved .
she has a down-to-earth style that dispenses with all flash .
but she has succeeded in finding a way to communicate her positions - even to foreign leaders on controversial topics like human rights in china or russian democracy - in a low-key but effective manner .

those five current permanent members - the world war ii victors - have veto power over security matters .
the resolution calls for the 62nd general assembly , which begins work on tuesday , sept .
18 , to " take immediate steps to facilitate results-oriented inter-governmental negotiations " along the lines of discussions among un members in past years .
germany and japan , which also have aspirations for permanent seats on the security council , did not join in sponsoring the resolution .
but they stand to benefit if negotiations succeed in reforming the council .
after years of pushing for a permanent seat on the un security council , germany announced in july that it had scaled back its ambitions in the hope that a series of larger reforms would ultimately end with berlin as part of the body .
reforms could benefit germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier could make a case for a council spot over the summer , germany said it was going to change its course from calling for a seat on the council to looking for an " intelligent compromise . "
officials in berlin claimed that the un was suffering from " reform fatigue " and would restart its negotiations for a permanent seat once a viable reform package was under way .
the new resolution could be the first step in a larger reform process that could see germany and its so-called group of four partners - japan , brazil and india - admitted to the security council .
group of four opposed by regional rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's un aspirations were toned down , not quashed two years ago , the group of four issued a series of demands for permanent seats .
but each met fierce regional opposition : india was opposed by pakistan , japan was opposed by south korea and china , germany was opposed by italy , and brazil was opposed by several latin american nations .
in addition to the council 's five permanent members , there are also 10 members elected for a two-year term with the 10 seats rotating among the world 's five regions .
un members have for more than 15 years called for revamping the council to include more countries - as many as 20 or 25 members - and give more representation to developing nations . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , that wealthy nations are spending far more money on education than they did 12 years ago .
however , in its annual " education at a glance survey " presented in berlin , the organization also said that inefficient use of resources is impeding efforts to improve standards . oecd said that if current resources were employed more efficiently , learning levels could increase by 22 percent . " countries are collectively spending more than they ever have on education , " the oecd said .
" but the results gained from that investment are far from maximized . " the paris-based organization represents 30 industrialized countries .

" forty years ago , the number of university entrants stood at one in 10 pupils . according to the oecd web site , more than 40 percent of young people in countries such as denmark , australia , italy , the netherlands and poland complete university courses .

this included acquiring weapons , chemicals or other substances in order to commit a violent offense .
the proposal would also outlaw financing a terrorist attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries wants more legal means to fight terrorism this legislation would also cover , for example , a suspect charged with carrying out a bombing in germany who had previously traveled to a terrorist camp to receive explosives training , or a person who took flight training in order to hijack an aircraft . the ministry said , however , that the law would apply only to training with the specific intent to carry out a terrorist attack .
this means that attending a training camp in itself would not necessarily be a crime .
prosecutors said the three men arrested in germany on sept .
4 trained at camps in pakistan run by the islamic jihad union . the second proposal in the new legislation would criminalize publishing or acquiring instructions for attacks or bombs , for example , via the internet .
if the instructions were deemed to motivate others to commit attacks , the crime would carry a prison sentence of up to three years . zypries ' proposals will now be coordinated within the federal government .

in the future , preparing an attack or receiving explicit training for a violent act will be punishable by up to 10 years in prison . the worldwide threat of terrorist attacks includes germany , according to the country 's justice minister brigitte zypries . " we can not exclude a terrorist attack in our country , " zypries told reporters in berlin on tuesday , sept .
18 .
" as regrettable as this realization is , it is unfortunately by no means new . " the justice ministry has therefore proposed new legislation , which would make the preparation of terrorist acts , as well as the instruction of such actions , a criminal offence .
if convicted , offenders would face up to 10 years in prison . existing anti-terrorist laws no longer timely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the men arrested in germany were planning bombs using hydrogen peroxide the proposal comes after authorities arrested three men earlier this month for planning massive terrorist attacks targeting us nationals in germany . the justice ministry has been reviewing germany 's criminal law over the past few months to determine whether loopholes existed .
the planned legislation would allow preparations ahead of terrorist attacks to be legally dealt with more systematically , zypries said . existing german laws against terrorism could not be applied to terrorist acts today , the ministry said .
laws introduced to battle the militant , left-wing red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- in the 1970s stipulated that a terrorist organization must have at least three members before its formation - or support of the organization - can be deemed illegal . but terrorist structures have changed since then , the ministry said . " as opposed to the raf , islamic offenders are often active without any firm connection to a hierarchically based group , " it said in a statement . yet the related danger was nonetheless " considerable " and therefore needed to be punishable by law , it said . only explicit training for a terrorist act will be a crime the first proposal to the new legislation stipulated that preparing a terrorist attack would be punishable by six months to 10 years in prison .
this included acquiring weapons , chemicals or other substances in order to commit a violent offense .
the proposal would also outlaw financing a terrorist attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries wants more legal means to fight terrorism this legislation would also cover , for example , a suspect charged with carrying out a bombing in germany who had previously traveled to a terrorist camp to receive explosives training , or a person who took flight training in order to hijack an aircraft . the ministry said , however , that the law would apply only to training with the specific intent to carry out a terrorist attack .
this means that attending a training camp in itself would not necessarily be a crime .
prosecutors said the three men arrested in germany on sept .
4 trained at camps in pakistan run by the islamic jihad union . the second proposal in the new legislation would criminalize publishing or acquiring instructions for attacks or bombs , for example , via the internet .
if the instructions were deemed to motivate others to commit attacks , the crime would carry a prison sentence of up to three years . zypries ' proposals will now be coordinated within the federal government .

an explosion at the nuclear power plant in 1986 caused one of the world 's most disastrous nuclear meltdowns . the french consortium novarka on monday entered an agreement with ukraine to construct a massive shield around chernobyl over the next four to five years .
the structure will seal the radioactive remnants on the site . the arch-shaped metal covering , measuring 105 meters -lrb- 345 feet -rrb- tall by 150 meters -lrb- 490 -rrb- long , should entirely enclose the existing sarcophagus .
it had been hastily constructed in the months following the april 26 , 1986 accident and has shown signs of leakage . meant to last a hundred years , the shield is to provide an environment suitable for the disassembly of the nuclear power plant within . " chernobyl will not exist anymore " by the end of the shell 's lifespan , said yves-thibault de silguy , chairmen of vinci , one of the french firms in the novarka consortium .
" the end goal of the shield is to allow for -lsb- chernobyl 's -rsb- dismantling . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " liquidators " were the first to enter the plant after it exploded in a second deal also signed monday , ukraine commissioned us-based nuclear specialist holtec international to build containers for radioactive fuel still on the site . " we are talking about a unique project for this planet , " said ukrainian president victor yushchenko .
" the danger linked to the site of the accident is not confined to ukraine 's borders . " in a statement , yushchenko called the multi-million dollar project " a great historic event . " greenpeace has qualms over shield environmentalists disagreed with the plans , however . " the biggest problem for us is stopping the flow of contaminated coolant into the environment , " tobias münchmeyer from greenpeace told dw-world.de. in his opinion , the planned metal dome was not the best use of funds , he said . the ukrainian government and the european bank for reconstruction and development -lrb- ebrd -rrb- have estimated that as much as 95 percent of the original radioactive material still exists within the reactors .
yet greenpeace said that most of the radioactivity was released at the time of the accident and in the following years . the environmental organization has also disputed the number of deaths directly related to the meltdown over two decades ago .
according to greenpeace estimates , 93,000 people have died or will die of cancer caused by the chernobyl accident .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , on the other hand , has counted only 4,000 deaths . shared financial burden the ebrd will primarily finance and oversee the sarcophagus project .
the bank will administer grants from 28 donor countries and the european union . nearly $ 2.5 billion have been committed to the project already , according to german news agency dpa .

in the future , preparing an attack or receiving explicit training for a violent act will be punishable by up to 10 years in prison . the worldwide threat of terrorist attacks includes germany , according to the country 's justice minister brigitte zypries . " we can not exclude a terrorist attack in our country , " zypries told reporters in berlin on tuesday , sept .
18 .
" as regrettable as this realization is , it is unfortunately by no means new . " the justice ministry has therefore proposed new legislation , which would make the preparation of terrorist acts , as well as the instruction of such actions , a criminal offence .
if convicted , offenders would face up to 10 years in prison . existing anti-terrorist laws no longer timely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the men arrested in germany were planning bombs using hydrogen peroxide the proposal comes after authorities arrested three men earlier this month for planning massive terrorist attacks targeting us nationals in germany . the justice ministry has been reviewing germany 's criminal law over the past few months to determine whether loopholes existed .
the planned legislation would allow preparations ahead of terrorist attacks to be legally dealt with more systematically , zypries said . existing german laws against terrorism could not be applied to terrorist acts today , the ministry said .
laws introduced to battle the militant , left-wing red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- in the 1970s stipulated that a terrorist organization must have at least three members before its formation - or support of the organization - can be deemed illegal . but terrorist structures have changed since then , the ministry said .

the proposal would also outlaw financing a terrorist attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries wants more legal means to fight terrorism this legislation would also cover , for example , a suspect charged with carrying out a bombing in germany who had previously traveled to a terrorist camp to receive explosives training , or a person who took flight training in order to hijack an aircraft . the ministry said , however , that the law would apply only to training with the specific intent to carry out a terrorist attack .
this means that attending a training camp in itself would not necessarily be a crime .
prosecutors said the three men arrested in germany on sept .
4 trained at camps in pakistan run by the islamic jihad union . the second proposal in the new legislation would criminalize publishing or acquiring instructions for attacks or bombs , for example , via the internet .
if the instructions were deemed to motivate others to commit attacks , the crime would carry a prison sentence of up to three years . zypries ' proposals will now be coordinated within the federal government .

18 , that wealthy nations are spending far more money on education than they did 12 years ago .
however , in its annual " education at a glance survey " presented in berlin , the organization also said that inefficient use of resources is impeding efforts to improve standards . oecd said that if current resources were employed more efficiently , learning levels could increase by 22 percent . " countries are collectively spending more than they ever have on education , " the oecd said .
" but the results gained from that investment are far from maximized . " the paris-based organization represents 30 industrialized countries .
it said that between 1995 and 2004 , spending on education had risen by an average of 42 percent , with more people than ever receiving secondary school and university degrees . more than half of high school students go on to college bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he attend university ?
" on average more than half of school-leavers are entering university-level education at some stage in their life , " oecd secretary general angel gurria said at tuesday 's press conference .
" the most striking thing is the astounding speed at which the education system continues to expand . " forty years ago , the number of university entrants stood at one in 10 pupils . according to the oecd web site , more than 40 percent of young people in countries such as denmark , australia , italy , the netherlands and poland complete university courses .
the organization noted , however , that graduation rates tended to be " highest in countries where programs are of short duration . " germany 's longer study programs hinder completion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's courses of study are longer than elsewhere " by contrast , in germany and austria , where programs are longer , only 20 percent of young people get degrees , " the oecd noted . the organization said that its findings confirmed that people who obtain an education from the upper-secondary level upwards earn considerably more than those with lesser degrees . the report also noted a significant historical change : female students are now more likely to complete secondary education than their male peers . in terms of graduation from education up to the age of 18 , female students exceed boys in all countries surveyed , with the exception of south korea , switzerland and turkey . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

those five current permanent members - the world war ii victors - have veto power over security matters .
the resolution calls for the 62nd general assembly , which begins work on tuesday , sept .
18 , to " take immediate steps to facilitate results-oriented inter-governmental negotiations " along the lines of discussions among un members in past years .
germany and japan , which also have aspirations for permanent seats on the security council , did not join in sponsoring the resolution .
but they stand to benefit if negotiations succeed in reforming the council .
after years of pushing for a permanent seat on the un security council , germany announced in july that it had scaled back its ambitions in the hope that a series of larger reforms would ultimately end with berlin as part of the body .
reforms could benefit germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier could make a case for a council spot over the summer , germany said it was going to change its course from calling for a seat on the council to looking for an " intelligent compromise . "
officials in berlin claimed that the un was suffering from " reform fatigue " and would restart its negotiations for a permanent seat once a viable reform package was under way .
the new resolution could be the first step in a larger reform process that could see germany and its so-called group of four partners - japan , brazil and india - admitted to the security council .
group of four opposed by regional rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's un aspirations were toned down , not quashed two years ago , the group of four issued a series of demands for permanent seats .
but each met fierce regional opposition : india was opposed by pakistan , japan was opposed by south korea and china , germany was opposed by italy , and brazil was opposed by several latin american nations .
in addition to the council 's five permanent members , there are also 10 members elected for a two-year term with the 10 seats rotating among the world 's five regions .
un members have for more than 15 years called for revamping the council to include more countries - as many as 20 or 25 members - and give more representation to developing nations . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , franco-german relations are maneuvering a patch of rough water : personality clashes between leaders and policy differences are the problem . when former french president jacques chirac would come calling on chancellor angela merkel , she seemed charmed by his gallant style , old world sensibility and those light kisses on the hand that got so much media play .
but his successor 's habit of familiarly kissing and hugging the german leader at their meetings has left her cold , even annoyed , according to reports , and has not helped strengthen a relationship that is seen as pivotal within the european union . were it just a matter of where to place a kiss , the issue might be solved with the intervention of a protocol officer .
but the differences between the two leaders are ones of both style and substance , which make them more difficult to bridge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel received many a kiss on the hand from france 's former president jacques chirac last week , france 's government spokesman said sarkozy told his cabinet his latest talks with merkel had been " very frank " - diplomatic speak for heated .
it comes after a series of low-level spats , including disagreements over the independence of the european central bank , the future of nuclear power , sarkozy 's protectionist murmurings , and even his stealing the spotlight over the freeing of bulgarian medics long held by libya . according to observers in both france and germany , merkel is not amused .
the french le figaro newspaper said the chancellor was irritated by sarkozy 's " rough and ready " manner .
the german rheinische post daily called the relationship one in " deep crisis . " " there is real annoyance , although i would n't use the word ' crisis , " ' said henrik uterwedde , deputy director of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg in southwestern germany .
" but it 's not peanuts and it should ring alarm bells . " styles : day and night when sarkozy became president in may , it was thought he and merkel would be the perfect couple .
both come from parties on the right-hand side of the political spectrum , both have an interest in economic reform and getting an eu reform treaty back on track .
they were even born just six months apart .
but , on closer examination , the fact that they have not hit it off personally might not be surprising .
their styles could not be more different . angela merkel , a pastor 's daughter who grew up in east germany , is cautious and reserved .
she has a down-to-earth style that dispenses with all flash .
but she has succeeded in finding a way to communicate her positions - even to foreign leaders on controversial topics like human rights in china or russian democracy - in a low-key but effective manner .
she is the quintessential team player . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he likes the crowd 's adulation and ministers who know their place nicolas sarkozy is a near opposite of that .
brash and in constant movement , he has been called hyperactive by many .
comparisons to bonaparte have been frequent , given his dismissive behavior towards his cabinet and his apparent love for showmanship and the spotlight . " france 's government system is much more hierarchical than germany 's , " said uterwedde .
" under sarkozy , it is even more so . " sarkozy recently crashed a meeting of finance ministers in brussels and explained his country 's short-term economic strategy while france 's own finance minister christine lagarde " sat there like a schoolgirl , " according to uterwedde . when german finance minister peer steinbrück accusing the french president of " giving fiscal handouts to voters " instead of keeping his european budgetary promises , sarkozy became incensed . " how dare you speak to me in that tone , " sarkozy is said to have replied , and was later furious with merkel for not rapping her finance minister 's knuckles as he requested . l 'état , c 'est moi ? while observers say the franco-german situation has not reached the breaking point , sarkozy would be wise to calm his style and become more of a player on team eu , or he could risk alienating more than just angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is accused of taking credit for initiatives that were n't his own , such as the release of medics held by libya " sarkozy has to learn that france is not playing alone but is part of a team called europe , " said isabelle bourgeois , a researcher at cirac , a paris-based think tank that studies franco-german relations . as far as the symbolic relationship of the french and german leaders goes , the current situation is bad , she says , although she 's careful to add that on the economic level , the two countries are integrated more than ever .
so far , the merkel-sarkozy irritation has caused little serious collateral damage . but other key areas , such as reforms of european markets , the constitution and the euro require close , high-level franco-german cooperation .
the fact that the two leaders might have a difficult time being in the same room together could hinder european progress on those fronts . wider irritation just this weekend , tensions over economic policy between sarkozy and other european leaders burst into the open . the head of the german bundesbank , axel weber , called sarkozy 's understanding of economic realities " zero " in the wake of the french leader 's constant criticism of the european central bank .
jean-claude juncker , luxembourg 's prime minister , suggested the french leader focus on france 's own economic woes instead of constantly carping on the bank 's management of the euro . " on the eu stage , his showmanship will be forgiven once , " said uterwedde .
" but if he continues playing this role , he 'll have problems . he says sarkozy 's recent spats with eu leaders and his sometimes contrarian views are a combination of his wanting to score political points at home and his own personality . " i think the biggest danger for sarkozy is sarkozy himself , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

following nine days of treatment , the man had improved enough that he could leave intensive care and be moved to a rehabilitation center . the therapy involved extracting adult stem cells from the patient 's bone marrow and then inserting them , with the help of a balloon catheter , into the artery damaged by the infarction . the procedure took about a half hour . stauer called it a " global innovation " in that cardiogenic shock - inadequate delivery of oxygen to the heart tissues - could be treated with stem cell therapy for the first time ever . embryonic stem cell research banned in germany such stem cell therapy , however , has enlivened the debate on embryonic stem cell research . recently , the german government said it would allocate five million euros -lrb- $ 6.9 million -rrb- over the next three years for non-embryonic stem cell research . stem cells can develop into different cell types , including those for bones , blood and the brain .
specialists say they can help in treating illnesses such as parkinson 's , and can help to regenerate damaged organs or tissue . researchers say embryonic stem cells - cells taken from days-old human embryos - are the most promising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minor heart attacks often go unnoticed however , genetic research is highly contested in germany due to its nazi history of experimentation to create a " master race . " since 2002 , the production of embryonic cells from pre-existing stem cell lines is prohibited in germany .
scientists are also not permitted to research on any lines produced after jan .
1 , 2002 to ensure that foreign laboratories do not create new lines for the german market . critics have said that such prohibitions put german scientists at a disadvantage . critics of embryonic stem cell research , however , say that progress with adult stem cell treatment , such as with the cardiac patient in düsseldorf , nullifies the need for cells derived from human embryos . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an explosion at the nuclear power plant in 1986 caused one of the world 's most disastrous nuclear meltdowns . the french consortium novarka on monday entered an agreement with ukraine to construct a massive shield around chernobyl over the next four to five years .
the structure will seal the radioactive remnants on the site . the arch-shaped metal covering , measuring 105 meters -lrb- 345 feet -rrb- tall by 150 meters -lrb- 490 -rrb- long , should entirely enclose the existing sarcophagus .
it had been hastily constructed in the months following the april 26 , 1986 accident and has shown signs of leakage . meant to last a hundred years , the shield is to provide an environment suitable for the disassembly of the nuclear power plant within . " chernobyl will not exist anymore " by the end of the shell 's lifespan , said yves-thibault de silguy , chairmen of vinci , one of the french firms in the novarka consortium .

yet greenpeace said that most of the radioactivity was released at the time of the accident and in the following years . the environmental organization has also disputed the number of deaths directly related to the meltdown over two decades ago .

in the future , preparing an attack or receiving explicit training for a violent act will be punishable by up to 10 years in prison . the worldwide threat of terrorist attacks includes germany , according to the country 's justice minister brigitte zypries . " we can not exclude a terrorist attack in our country , " zypries told reporters in berlin on tuesday , sept .
18 .
" as regrettable as this realization is , it is unfortunately by no means new . " the justice ministry has therefore proposed new legislation , which would make the preparation of terrorist acts , as well as the instruction of such actions , a criminal offence .
if convicted , offenders would face up to 10 years in prison . existing anti-terrorist laws no longer timely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the men arrested in germany were planning bombs using hydrogen peroxide the proposal comes after authorities arrested three men earlier this month for planning massive terrorist attacks targeting us nationals in germany . the justice ministry has been reviewing germany 's criminal law over the past few months to determine whether loopholes existed .
the planned legislation would allow preparations ahead of terrorist attacks to be legally dealt with more systematically , zypries said . existing german laws against terrorism could not be applied to terrorist acts today , the ministry said .
laws introduced to battle the militant , left-wing red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- in the 1970s stipulated that a terrorist organization must have at least three members before its formation - or support of the organization - can be deemed illegal . but terrorist structures have changed since then , the ministry said . " as opposed to the raf , islamic offenders are often active without any firm connection to a hierarchically based group , " it said in a statement . yet the related danger was nonetheless " considerable " and therefore needed to be punishable by law , it said . only explicit training for a terrorist act will be a crime the first proposal to the new legislation stipulated that preparing a terrorist attack would be punishable by six months to 10 years in prison .
this included acquiring weapons , chemicals or other substances in order to commit a violent offense .
the proposal would also outlaw financing a terrorist attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries wants more legal means to fight terrorism this legislation would also cover , for example , a suspect charged with carrying out a bombing in germany who had previously traveled to a terrorist camp to receive explosives training , or a person who took flight training in order to hijack an aircraft . the ministry said , however , that the law would apply only to training with the specific intent to carry out a terrorist attack .
this means that attending a training camp in itself would not necessarily be a crime .
prosecutors said the three men arrested in germany on sept .
4 trained at camps in pakistan run by the islamic jihad union . the second proposal in the new legislation would criminalize publishing or acquiring instructions for attacks or bombs , for example , via the internet .
if the instructions were deemed to motivate others to commit attacks , the crime would carry a prison sentence of up to three years . zypries ' proposals will now be coordinated within the federal government .
a ministry draft will then be sent to germany 's 16 federal states before formulating a bill in parliament . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the dalai lama is not simply a religious figure , he is a long-time political exile engaged in separatist activities , " said chinese spokeswoman jiang yu on tuesday , sept .

she added that china was against any contact with the dalai lama by any country 's officials . " we hope that germany will consider the higher interest of chinese-german relationships and not allow the dalai lama 's visit , " jiang yu said . but there has been no change to chancellor angela merkel 's agenda since the chinese request . china has consistently spoken out against politicians ' visits with the 72-year-old dalai lama , who has led a tibetan government-in-exile in india since 1959 .
his advocacy for greater autonomy for tibet has found great international response . the statement from the chinese government came in response to an announcement last week that merkel would meet with the dalai lama on sunday , sept .

it was koch who brought the dalai lama and merkel together in 2005 , reported the online version of germany 's mass-circulation daily bild . german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said sunday 's meeting was part of a series of private visits between the chancellor and religious leaders . human rights in tibet , as well as german-chinese policy issues were likely to be topics of the discussions , wilhelm said .
he added that merkel also addressed the same issues with chinese leaders .

18 , franco-german relations are maneuvering a patch of rough water : personality clashes between leaders and policy differences are the problem . when former french president jacques chirac would come calling on chancellor angela merkel , she seemed charmed by his gallant style , old world sensibility and those light kisses on the hand that got so much media play .
but his successor 's habit of familiarly kissing and hugging the german leader at their meetings has left her cold , even annoyed , according to reports , and has not helped strengthen a relationship that is seen as pivotal within the european union . were it just a matter of where to place a kiss , the issue might be solved with the intervention of a protocol officer .
but the differences between the two leaders are ones of both style and substance , which make them more difficult to bridge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel received many a kiss on the hand from france 's former president jacques chirac last week , france 's government spokesman said sarkozy told his cabinet his latest talks with merkel had been " very frank " - diplomatic speak for heated .
it comes after a series of low-level spats , including disagreements over the independence of the european central bank , the future of nuclear power , sarkozy 's protectionist murmurings , and even his stealing the spotlight over the freeing of bulgarian medics long held by libya . according to observers in both france and germany , merkel is not amused .
the french le figaro newspaper said the chancellor was irritated by sarkozy 's " rough and ready " manner .
the german rheinische post daily called the relationship one in " deep crisis . " " there is real annoyance , although i would n't use the word ' crisis , " ' said henrik uterwedde , deputy director of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg in southwestern germany .

but , on closer examination , the fact that they have not hit it off personally might not be surprising .
their styles could not be more different . angela merkel , a pastor 's daughter who grew up in east germany , is cautious and reserved .
she has a down-to-earth style that dispenses with all flash .

brash and in constant movement , he has been called hyperactive by many .
comparisons to bonaparte have been frequent , given his dismissive behavior towards his cabinet and his apparent love for showmanship and the spotlight . " france 's government system is much more hierarchical than germany 's , " said uterwedde .
" under sarkozy , it is even more so . " sarkozy recently crashed a meeting of finance ministers in brussels and explained his country 's short-term economic strategy while france 's own finance minister christine lagarde " sat there like a schoolgirl , " according to uterwedde . when german finance minister peer steinbrück accusing the french president of " giving fiscal handouts to voters " instead of keeping his european budgetary promises , sarkozy became incensed . " how dare you speak to me in that tone , " sarkozy is said to have replied , and was later furious with merkel for not rapping her finance minister 's knuckles as he requested . l 'état , c 'est moi ? while observers say the franco-german situation has not reached the breaking point , sarkozy would be wise to calm his style and become more of a player on team eu , or he could risk alienating more than just angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is accused of taking credit for initiatives that were n't his own , such as the release of medics held by libya " sarkozy has to learn that france is not playing alone but is part of a team called europe , " said isabelle bourgeois , a researcher at cirac , a paris-based think tank that studies franco-german relations . as far as the symbolic relationship of the french and german leaders goes , the current situation is bad , she says , although she 's careful to add that on the economic level , the two countries are integrated more than ever .

the man spent seven weeks in the intensive care unit with no sign of improvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany draws the line at embryonic stem cell research stauer decided to apply stem cell therapy on the patient .
following nine days of treatment , the man had improved enough that he could leave intensive care and be moved to a rehabilitation center . the therapy involved extracting adult stem cells from the patient 's bone marrow and then inserting them , with the help of a balloon catheter , into the artery damaged by the infarction . the procedure took about a half hour . stauer called it a " global innovation " in that cardiogenic shock - inadequate delivery of oxygen to the heart tissues - could be treated with stem cell therapy for the first time ever . embryonic stem cell research banned in germany such stem cell therapy , however , has enlivened the debate on embryonic stem cell research . recently , the german government said it would allocate five million euros -lrb- $ 6.9 million -rrb- over the next three years for non-embryonic stem cell research . stem cells can develop into different cell types , including those for bones , blood and the brain .
specialists say they can help in treating illnesses such as parkinson 's , and can help to regenerate damaged organs or tissue . researchers say embryonic stem cells - cells taken from days-old human embryos - are the most promising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minor heart attacks often go unnoticed however , genetic research is highly contested in germany due to its nazi history of experimentation to create a " master race . " since 2002 , the production of embryonic cells from pre-existing stem cell lines is prohibited in germany .

18 , franco-german relations are maneuvering a patch of rough water : personality clashes between leaders and policy differences are the problem . when former french president jacques chirac would come calling on chancellor angela merkel , she seemed charmed by his gallant style , old world sensibility and those light kisses on the hand that got so much media play .
but his successor 's habit of familiarly kissing and hugging the german leader at their meetings has left her cold , even annoyed , according to reports , and has not helped strengthen a relationship that is seen as pivotal within the european union . were it just a matter of where to place a kiss , the issue might be solved with the intervention of a protocol officer .
but the differences between the two leaders are ones of both style and substance , which make them more difficult to bridge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel received many a kiss on the hand from france 's former president jacques chirac last week , france 's government spokesman said sarkozy told his cabinet his latest talks with merkel had been " very frank " - diplomatic speak for heated .
it comes after a series of low-level spats , including disagreements over the independence of the european central bank , the future of nuclear power , sarkozy 's protectionist murmurings , and even his stealing the spotlight over the freeing of bulgarian medics long held by libya . according to observers in both france and germany , merkel is not amused .
the french le figaro newspaper said the chancellor was irritated by sarkozy 's " rough and ready " manner .
the german rheinische post daily called the relationship one in " deep crisis . " " there is real annoyance , although i would n't use the word ' crisis , " ' said henrik uterwedde , deputy director of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg in southwestern germany .
" but it 's not peanuts and it should ring alarm bells . " styles : day and night when sarkozy became president in may , it was thought he and merkel would be the perfect couple .
both come from parties on the right-hand side of the political spectrum , both have an interest in economic reform and getting an eu reform treaty back on track .
they were even born just six months apart .
but , on closer examination , the fact that they have not hit it off personally might not be surprising .
their styles could not be more different . angela merkel , a pastor 's daughter who grew up in east germany , is cautious and reserved .
she has a down-to-earth style that dispenses with all flash .
but she has succeeded in finding a way to communicate her positions - even to foreign leaders on controversial topics like human rights in china or russian democracy - in a low-key but effective manner .
she is the quintessential team player . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he likes the crowd 's adulation and ministers who know their place nicolas sarkozy is a near opposite of that .
brash and in constant movement , he has been called hyperactive by many .
comparisons to bonaparte have been frequent , given his dismissive behavior towards his cabinet and his apparent love for showmanship and the spotlight . " france 's government system is much more hierarchical than germany 's , " said uterwedde .
" under sarkozy , it is even more so . " sarkozy recently crashed a meeting of finance ministers in brussels and explained his country 's short-term economic strategy while france 's own finance minister christine lagarde " sat there like a schoolgirl , " according to uterwedde . when german finance minister peer steinbrück accusing the french president of " giving fiscal handouts to voters " instead of keeping his european budgetary promises , sarkozy became incensed . " how dare you speak to me in that tone , " sarkozy is said to have replied , and was later furious with merkel for not rapping her finance minister 's knuckles as he requested . l 'état , c 'est moi ? while observers say the franco-german situation has not reached the breaking point , sarkozy would be wise to calm his style and become more of a player on team eu , or he could risk alienating more than just angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is accused of taking credit for initiatives that were n't his own , such as the release of medics held by libya " sarkozy has to learn that france is not playing alone but is part of a team called europe , " said isabelle bourgeois , a researcher at cirac , a paris-based think tank that studies franco-german relations . as far as the symbolic relationship of the french and german leaders goes , the current situation is bad , she says , although she 's careful to add that on the economic level , the two countries are integrated more than ever .
so far , the merkel-sarkozy irritation has caused little serious collateral damage . but other key areas , such as reforms of european markets , the constitution and the euro require close , high-level franco-german cooperation .
the fact that the two leaders might have a difficult time being in the same room together could hinder european progress on those fronts . wider irritation just this weekend , tensions over economic policy between sarkozy and other european leaders burst into the open . the head of the german bundesbank , axel weber , called sarkozy 's understanding of economic realities " zero " in the wake of the french leader 's constant criticism of the european central bank .
jean-claude juncker , luxembourg 's prime minister , suggested the french leader focus on france 's own economic woes instead of constantly carping on the bank 's management of the euro . " on the eu stage , his showmanship will be forgiven once , " said uterwedde .
" but if he continues playing this role , he 'll have problems . he says sarkozy 's recent spats with eu leaders and his sometimes contrarian views are a combination of his wanting to score political points at home and his own personality . " i think the biggest danger for sarkozy is sarkozy himself , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , franco-german relations are maneuvering a patch of rough water : personality clashes between leaders and policy differences are the problem . when former french president jacques chirac would come calling on chancellor angela merkel , she seemed charmed by his gallant style , old world sensibility and those light kisses on the hand that got so much media play .
but his successor 's habit of familiarly kissing and hugging the german leader at their meetings has left her cold , even annoyed , according to reports , and has not helped strengthen a relationship that is seen as pivotal within the european union . were it just a matter of where to place a kiss , the issue might be solved with the intervention of a protocol officer .
but the differences between the two leaders are ones of both style and substance , which make them more difficult to bridge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel received many a kiss on the hand from france 's former president jacques chirac last week , france 's government spokesman said sarkozy told his cabinet his latest talks with merkel had been " very frank " - diplomatic speak for heated .
it comes after a series of low-level spats , including disagreements over the independence of the european central bank , the future of nuclear power , sarkozy 's protectionist murmurings , and even his stealing the spotlight over the freeing of bulgarian medics long held by libya . according to observers in both france and germany , merkel is not amused .
the french le figaro newspaper said the chancellor was irritated by sarkozy 's " rough and ready " manner .
the german rheinische post daily called the relationship one in " deep crisis . " " there is real annoyance , although i would n't use the word ' crisis , " ' said henrik uterwedde , deputy director of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg in southwestern germany .
" but it 's not peanuts and it should ring alarm bells . " styles : day and night when sarkozy became president in may , it was thought he and merkel would be the perfect couple .
both come from parties on the right-hand side of the political spectrum , both have an interest in economic reform and getting an eu reform treaty back on track .
they were even born just six months apart .
but , on closer examination , the fact that they have not hit it off personally might not be surprising .
their styles could not be more different . angela merkel , a pastor 's daughter who grew up in east germany , is cautious and reserved .
she has a down-to-earth style that dispenses with all flash .
but she has succeeded in finding a way to communicate her positions - even to foreign leaders on controversial topics like human rights in china or russian democracy - in a low-key but effective manner .
she is the quintessential team player . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he likes the crowd 's adulation and ministers who know their place nicolas sarkozy is a near opposite of that .
brash and in constant movement , he has been called hyperactive by many .
comparisons to bonaparte have been frequent , given his dismissive behavior towards his cabinet and his apparent love for showmanship and the spotlight . " france 's government system is much more hierarchical than germany 's , " said uterwedde .
" under sarkozy , it is even more so . " sarkozy recently crashed a meeting of finance ministers in brussels and explained his country 's short-term economic strategy while france 's own finance minister christine lagarde " sat there like a schoolgirl , " according to uterwedde . when german finance minister peer steinbrück accusing the french president of " giving fiscal handouts to voters " instead of keeping his european budgetary promises , sarkozy became incensed . " how dare you speak to me in that tone , " sarkozy is said to have replied , and was later furious with merkel for not rapping her finance minister 's knuckles as he requested . l 'état , c 'est moi ? while observers say the franco-german situation has not reached the breaking point , sarkozy would be wise to calm his style and become more of a player on team eu , or he could risk alienating more than just angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is accused of taking credit for initiatives that were n't his own , such as the release of medics held by libya " sarkozy has to learn that france is not playing alone but is part of a team called europe , " said isabelle bourgeois , a researcher at cirac , a paris-based think tank that studies franco-german relations . as far as the symbolic relationship of the french and german leaders goes , the current situation is bad , she says , although she 's careful to add that on the economic level , the two countries are integrated more than ever .
so far , the merkel-sarkozy irritation has caused little serious collateral damage . but other key areas , such as reforms of european markets , the constitution and the euro require close , high-level franco-german cooperation .
the fact that the two leaders might have a difficult time being in the same room together could hinder european progress on those fronts . wider irritation just this weekend , tensions over economic policy between sarkozy and other european leaders burst into the open . the head of the german bundesbank , axel weber , called sarkozy 's understanding of economic realities " zero " in the wake of the french leader 's constant criticism of the european central bank .
jean-claude juncker , luxembourg 's prime minister , suggested the french leader focus on france 's own economic woes instead of constantly carping on the bank 's management of the euro . " on the eu stage , his showmanship will be forgiven once , " said uterwedde .
" but if he continues playing this role , he 'll have problems . he says sarkozy 's recent spats with eu leaders and his sometimes contrarian views are a combination of his wanting to score political points at home and his own personality . " i think the biggest danger for sarkozy is sarkozy himself , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , franco-german relations are maneuvering a patch of rough water : personality clashes between leaders and policy differences are the problem . when former french president jacques chirac would come calling on chancellor angela merkel , she seemed charmed by his gallant style , old world sensibility and those light kisses on the hand that got so much media play .
but his successor 's habit of familiarly kissing and hugging the german leader at their meetings has left her cold , even annoyed , according to reports , and has not helped strengthen a relationship that is seen as pivotal within the european union . were it just a matter of where to place a kiss , the issue might be solved with the intervention of a protocol officer .
but the differences between the two leaders are ones of both style and substance , which make them more difficult to bridge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel received many a kiss on the hand from france 's former president jacques chirac last week , france 's government spokesman said sarkozy told his cabinet his latest talks with merkel had been " very frank " - diplomatic speak for heated .
it comes after a series of low-level spats , including disagreements over the independence of the european central bank , the future of nuclear power , sarkozy 's protectionist murmurings , and even his stealing the spotlight over the freeing of bulgarian medics long held by libya . according to observers in both france and germany , merkel is not amused .
the french le figaro newspaper said the chancellor was irritated by sarkozy 's " rough and ready " manner .
the german rheinische post daily called the relationship one in " deep crisis . " " there is real annoyance , although i would n't use the word ' crisis , " ' said henrik uterwedde , deputy director of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg in southwestern germany .
" but it 's not peanuts and it should ring alarm bells . " styles : day and night when sarkozy became president in may , it was thought he and merkel would be the perfect couple .
both come from parties on the right-hand side of the political spectrum , both have an interest in economic reform and getting an eu reform treaty back on track .
they were even born just six months apart .
but , on closer examination , the fact that they have not hit it off personally might not be surprising .
their styles could not be more different . angela merkel , a pastor 's daughter who grew up in east germany , is cautious and reserved .
she has a down-to-earth style that dispenses with all flash .
but she has succeeded in finding a way to communicate her positions - even to foreign leaders on controversial topics like human rights in china or russian democracy - in a low-key but effective manner .
she is the quintessential team player . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he likes the crowd 's adulation and ministers who know their place nicolas sarkozy is a near opposite of that .
brash and in constant movement , he has been called hyperactive by many .
comparisons to bonaparte have been frequent , given his dismissive behavior towards his cabinet and his apparent love for showmanship and the spotlight . " france 's government system is much more hierarchical than germany 's , " said uterwedde .
" under sarkozy , it is even more so . " sarkozy recently crashed a meeting of finance ministers in brussels and explained his country 's short-term economic strategy while france 's own finance minister christine lagarde " sat there like a schoolgirl , " according to uterwedde . when german finance minister peer steinbrück accusing the french president of " giving fiscal handouts to voters " instead of keeping his european budgetary promises , sarkozy became incensed .

those five current permanent members - the world war ii victors - have veto power over security matters .
the resolution calls for the 62nd general assembly , which begins work on tuesday , sept .
18 , to " take immediate steps to facilitate results-oriented inter-governmental negotiations " along the lines of discussions among un members in past years .
germany and japan , which also have aspirations for permanent seats on the security council , did not join in sponsoring the resolution .
but they stand to benefit if negotiations succeed in reforming the council .
after years of pushing for a permanent seat on the un security council , germany announced in july that it had scaled back its ambitions in the hope that a series of larger reforms would ultimately end with berlin as part of the body .
reforms could benefit germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier could make a case for a council spot over the summer , germany said it was going to change its course from calling for a seat on the council to looking for an " intelligent compromise . "
officials in berlin claimed that the un was suffering from " reform fatigue " and would restart its negotiations for a permanent seat once a viable reform package was under way .
the new resolution could be the first step in a larger reform process that could see germany and its so-called group of four partners - japan , brazil and india - admitted to the security council .
group of four opposed by regional rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's un aspirations were toned down , not quashed two years ago , the group of four issued a series of demands for permanent seats .
but each met fierce regional opposition : india was opposed by pakistan , japan was opposed by south korea and china , germany was opposed by italy , and brazil was opposed by several latin american nations .
in addition to the council 's five permanent members , there are also 10 members elected for a two-year term with the 10 seats rotating among the world 's five regions .
un members have for more than 15 years called for revamping the council to include more countries - as many as 20 or 25 members - and give more representation to developing nations . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , that wealthy nations are spending far more money on education than they did 12 years ago .
however , in its annual " education at a glance survey " presented in berlin , the organization also said that inefficient use of resources is impeding efforts to improve standards . oecd said that if current resources were employed more efficiently , learning levels could increase by 22 percent . " countries are collectively spending more than they ever have on education , " the oecd said .
" but the results gained from that investment are far from maximized . " the paris-based organization represents 30 industrialized countries .
it said that between 1995 and 2004 , spending on education had risen by an average of 42 percent , with more people than ever receiving secondary school and university degrees . more than half of high school students go on to college bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he attend university ?
" on average more than half of school-leavers are entering university-level education at some stage in their life , " oecd secretary general angel gurria said at tuesday 's press conference .
" the most striking thing is the astounding speed at which the education system continues to expand . " forty years ago , the number of university entrants stood at one in 10 pupils . according to the oecd web site , more than 40 percent of young people in countries such as denmark , australia , italy , the netherlands and poland complete university courses .

it had been hastily constructed in the months following the april 26 , 1986 accident and has shown signs of leakage . meant to last a hundred years , the shield is to provide an environment suitable for the disassembly of the nuclear power plant within .

still , the case could have been handled better and competition will remain tight in the sector , several papers wrote . " it 's a victory for the customer and the free market , " the munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung wrote of the microsoft court decision , while conceding that " some of the effects of the microsoft expansion can not be reversed . " the eu decision will ensure greater competition , which the customers can only benefit from , " the paper continued .
" as we read in economics textbooks , monopolies lead to expensive goods and bad service . " the microsoft conflict is the most important case the eu has been through , wrote oslo 's aftenpost : " it is comparable to the trial where us oil magnate john d. rockefeller was forced to break up the standard oil company nearly a hundred years ago . " the current trial is essential to the credibility and penetrating power of the eu court .
thanks to the eu , small and mid-sized software companies around the world have won a decisive partial victory for more competition on the computer systems market . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say competition on the software market will remain tight the financial times deutschland , writing from hamburg , agreed that " yesterday 's decision significantly bolsters the -lsb- european -rsb- commission now in ensuring competition , " though the commission 's reputation had been damaged by unsuccessful merger bans over the course of the nine-year conflict , the paper noted . " despite protection from brussels , microsoft 's competitors will still have a hard time standing up to the sector 's giants in the future , " added the paper . commission under fire other news sources were more critical of the way the eu commission handled the case . " the commission overstepped its authority and showed that the conflict had become extremely emotional , " wrote der standard from vienna .
" the european commission is supposed to ensure competition .
how the market shares then develop should be left to the consumers and the companies . " der bund in bern commented that " it 's problematic that the case took so long and may not even be closed yet .
while highly paid lawyers on both sides are having it out , technology is developing at a rapid pace . " despite the newest regulations from luxembourg , it will be difficult in the next case to find a balance between consumers ' interest in competition and the equally justifiable protection of a market-dominating company 's innovation and intellectual capital , " concluded the swiss paper . compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 18.09.2007 style and substance have german , french leaders at odds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putting on a brave face - merkel apparently is not crazy about this kissing as france 's president unveils a major welfare reform package tuesday , sept .
18 , franco-german relations are maneuvering a patch of rough water : personality clashes between leaders and policy differences are the problem . when former french president jacques chirac would come calling on chancellor angela merkel , she seemed charmed by his gallant style , old world sensibility and those light kisses on the hand that got so much media play .
but his successor 's habit of familiarly kissing and hugging the german leader at their meetings has left her cold , even annoyed , according to reports , and has not helped strengthen a relationship that is seen as pivotal within the european union . were it just a matter of where to place a kiss , the issue might be solved with the intervention of a protocol officer .
but the differences between the two leaders are ones of both style and substance , which make them more difficult to bridge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel received many a kiss on the hand from france 's former president jacques chirac last week , france 's government spokesman said sarkozy told his cabinet his latest talks with merkel had been " very frank " - diplomatic speak for heated .
it comes after a series of low-level spats , including disagreements over the independence of the european central bank , the future of nuclear power , sarkozy 's protectionist murmurings , and even his stealing the spotlight over the freeing of bulgarian medics long held by libya . according to observers in both france and germany , merkel is not amused .
the french le figaro newspaper said the chancellor was irritated by sarkozy 's " rough and ready " manner .
the german rheinische post daily called the relationship one in " deep crisis . " " there is real annoyance , although i would n't use the word ' crisis , " ' said henrik uterwedde , deputy director of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg in southwestern germany .
" but it 's not peanuts and it should ring alarm bells . " styles : day and night when sarkozy became president in may , it was thought he and merkel would be the perfect couple .
both come from parties on the right-hand side of the political spectrum , both have an interest in economic reform and getting an eu reform treaty back on track .
they were even born just six months apart .
but , on closer examination , the fact that they have not hit it off personally might not be surprising .
their styles could not be more different . angela merkel , a pastor 's daughter who grew up in east germany , is cautious and reserved .
she has a down-to-earth style that dispenses with all flash .
but she has succeeded in finding a way to communicate her positions - even to foreign leaders on controversial topics like human rights in china or russian democracy - in a low-key but effective manner .
she is the quintessential team player . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he likes the crowd 's adulation and ministers who know their place nicolas sarkozy is a near opposite of that .
brash and in constant movement , he has been called hyperactive by many .
comparisons to bonaparte have been frequent , given his dismissive behavior towards his cabinet and his apparent love for showmanship and the spotlight . " france 's government system is much more hierarchical than germany 's , " said uterwedde .
" under sarkozy , it is even more so . " sarkozy recently crashed a meeting of finance ministers in brussels and explained his country 's short-term economic strategy while france 's own finance minister christine lagarde " sat there like a schoolgirl , " according to uterwedde . when german finance minister peer steinbrück accusing the french president of " giving fiscal handouts to voters " instead of keeping his european budgetary promises , sarkozy became incensed . " how dare you speak to me in that tone , " sarkozy is said to have replied , and was later furious with merkel for not rapping her finance minister 's knuckles as he requested . l 'état , c 'est moi ? while observers say the franco-german situation has not reached the breaking point , sarkozy would be wise to calm his style and become more of a player on team eu , or he could risk alienating more than just angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is accused of taking credit for initiatives that were n't his own , such as the release of medics held by libya " sarkozy has to learn that france is not playing alone but is part of a team called europe , " said isabelle bourgeois , a researcher at cirac , a paris-based think tank that studies franco-german relations . as far as the symbolic relationship of the french and german leaders goes , the current situation is bad , she says , although she 's careful to add that on the economic level , the two countries are integrated more than ever .
so far , the merkel-sarkozy irritation has caused little serious collateral damage . but other key areas , such as reforms of european markets , the constitution and the euro require close , high-level franco-german cooperation .
the fact that the two leaders might have a difficult time being in the same room together could hinder european progress on those fronts . wider irritation just this weekend , tensions over economic policy between sarkozy and other european leaders burst into the open . the head of the german bundesbank , axel weber , called sarkozy 's understanding of economic realities " zero " in the wake of the french leader 's constant criticism of the european central bank .
jean-claude juncker , luxembourg 's prime minister , suggested the french leader focus on france 's own economic woes instead of constantly carping on the bank 's management of the euro . " on the eu stage , his showmanship will be forgiven once , " said uterwedde .
" but if he continues playing this role , he 'll have problems . he says sarkozy 's recent spats with eu leaders and his sometimes contrarian views are a combination of his wanting to score political points at home and his own personality .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 18.09.2007 germany intends to criminalize terrorist preparation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is tightening its laws to battle terrorism germany 's justice minister plans to extend the country 's anti-terror laws .
in the future , preparing an attack or receiving explicit training for a violent act will be punishable by up to 10 years in prison . the worldwide threat of terrorist attacks includes germany , according to the country 's justice minister brigitte zypries . " we can not exclude a terrorist attack in our country , " zypries told reporters in berlin on tuesday , sept .
18 .
" as regrettable as this realization is , it is unfortunately by no means new . " the justice ministry has therefore proposed new legislation , which would make the preparation of terrorist acts , as well as the instruction of such actions , a criminal offence .
if convicted , offenders would face up to 10 years in prison . existing anti-terrorist laws no longer timely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the men arrested in germany were planning bombs using hydrogen peroxide the proposal comes after authorities arrested three men earlier this month for planning massive terrorist attacks targeting us nationals in germany . the justice ministry has been reviewing germany 's criminal law over the past few months to determine whether loopholes existed .
the planned legislation would allow preparations ahead of terrorist attacks to be legally dealt with more systematically , zypries said . existing german laws against terrorism could not be applied to terrorist acts today , the ministry said .
laws introduced to battle the militant , left-wing red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- in the 1970s stipulated that a terrorist organization must have at least three members before its formation - or support of the organization - can be deemed illegal . but terrorist structures have changed since then , the ministry said . " as opposed to the raf , islamic offenders are often active without any firm connection to a hierarchically based group , " it said in a statement . yet the related danger was nonetheless " considerable " and therefore needed to be punishable by law , it said . only explicit training for a terrorist act will be a crime the first proposal to the new legislation stipulated that preparing a terrorist attack would be punishable by six months to 10 years in prison .
this included acquiring weapons , chemicals or other substances in order to commit a violent offense .
the proposal would also outlaw financing a terrorist attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries wants more legal means to fight terrorism this legislation would also cover , for example , a suspect charged with carrying out a bombing in germany who had previously traveled to a terrorist camp to receive explosives training , or a person who took flight training in order to hijack an aircraft . the ministry said , however , that the law would apply only to training with the specific intent to carry out a terrorist attack .
this means that attending a training camp in itself would not necessarily be a crime .
prosecutors said the three men arrested in germany on sept .
4 trained at camps in pakistan run by the islamic jihad union . the second proposal in the new legislation would criminalize publishing or acquiring instructions for attacks or bombs , for example , via the internet .
if the instructions were deemed to motivate others to commit attacks , the crime would carry a prison sentence of up to three years . zypries ' proposals will now be coordinated within the federal government .
a ministry draft will then be sent to germany 's 16 federal states before formulating a bill in parliament . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an explosion at the nuclear power plant in 1986 caused one of the world 's most disastrous nuclear meltdowns . the french consortium novarka on monday entered an agreement with ukraine to construct a massive shield around chernobyl over the next four to five years .
the structure will seal the radioactive remnants on the site . the arch-shaped metal covering , measuring 105 meters -lrb- 345 feet -rrb- tall by 150 meters -lrb- 490 -rrb- long , should entirely enclose the existing sarcophagus .
it had been hastily constructed in the months following the april 26 , 1986 accident and has shown signs of leakage . meant to last a hundred years , the shield is to provide an environment suitable for the disassembly of the nuclear power plant within . " chernobyl will not exist anymore " by the end of the shell 's lifespan , said yves-thibault de silguy , chairmen of vinci , one of the french firms in the novarka consortium .
" the end goal of the shield is to allow for -lsb- chernobyl 's -rsb- dismantling . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " liquidators " were the first to enter the plant after it exploded in a second deal also signed monday , ukraine commissioned us-based nuclear specialist holtec international to build containers for radioactive fuel still on the site . " we are talking about a unique project for this planet , " said ukrainian president victor yushchenko .
" the danger linked to the site of the accident is not confined to ukraine 's borders . " in a statement , yushchenko called the multi-million dollar project " a great historic event . " greenpeace has qualms over shield environmentalists disagreed with the plans , however . " the biggest problem for us is stopping the flow of contaminated coolant into the environment , " tobias münchmeyer from greenpeace told dw-world.de. in his opinion , the planned metal dome was not the best use of funds , he said . the ukrainian government and the european bank for reconstruction and development -lrb- ebrd -rrb- have estimated that as much as 95 percent of the original radioactive material still exists within the reactors .
yet greenpeace said that most of the radioactivity was released at the time of the accident and in the following years . the environmental organization has also disputed the number of deaths directly related to the meltdown over two decades ago .
according to greenpeace estimates , 93,000 people have died or will die of cancer caused by the chernobyl accident .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , on the other hand , has counted only 4,000 deaths . shared financial burden the ebrd will primarily finance and oversee the sarcophagus project .
the bank will administer grants from 28 donor countries and the european union . nearly $ 2.5 billion have been committed to the project already , according to german news agency dpa .

an explosion at the nuclear power plant in 1986 caused one of the world 's most disastrous nuclear meltdowns . the french consortium novarka on monday entered an agreement with ukraine to construct a massive shield around chernobyl over the next four to five years .
the structure will seal the radioactive remnants on the site . the arch-shaped metal covering , measuring 105 meters -lrb- 345 feet -rrb- tall by 150 meters -lrb- 490 -rrb- long , should entirely enclose the existing sarcophagus .
it had been hastily constructed in the months following the april 26 , 1986 accident and has shown signs of leakage . meant to last a hundred years , the shield is to provide an environment suitable for the disassembly of the nuclear power plant within . " chernobyl will not exist anymore " by the end of the shell 's lifespan , said yves-thibault de silguy , chairmen of vinci , one of the french firms in the novarka consortium .

" the biggest problem for us is stopping the flow of contaminated coolant into the environment , " tobias münchmeyer from greenpeace told dw-world.de. in his opinion , the planned metal dome was not the best use of funds , he said . the ukrainian government and the european bank for reconstruction and development -lrb- ebrd -rrb- have estimated that as much as 95 percent of the original radioactive material still exists within the reactors .
yet greenpeace said that most of the radioactivity was released at the time of the accident and in the following years . the environmental organization has also disputed the number of deaths directly related to the meltdown over two decades ago .
according to greenpeace estimates , 93,000 people have died or will die of cancer caused by the chernobyl accident .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , on the other hand , has counted only 4,000 deaths . shared financial burden the ebrd will primarily finance and oversee the sarcophagus project .

still , the case could have been handled better and competition will remain tight in the sector , several papers wrote . " it 's a victory for the customer and the free market , " the munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung wrote of the microsoft court decision , while conceding that " some of the effects of the microsoft expansion can not be reversed . " the eu decision will ensure greater competition , which the customers can only benefit from , " the paper continued .
" as we read in economics textbooks , monopolies lead to expensive goods and bad service . " the microsoft conflict is the most important case the eu has been through , wrote oslo 's aftenpost : " it is comparable to the trial where us oil magnate john d. rockefeller was forced to break up the standard oil company nearly a hundred years ago . " the current trial is essential to the credibility and penetrating power of the eu court .
thanks to the eu , small and mid-sized software companies around the world have won a decisive partial victory for more competition on the computer systems market . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say competition on the software market will remain tight the financial times deutschland , writing from hamburg , agreed that " yesterday 's decision significantly bolsters the -lsb- european -rsb- commission now in ensuring competition , " though the commission 's reputation had been damaged by unsuccessful merger bans over the course of the nine-year conflict , the paper noted . " despite protection from brussels , microsoft 's competitors will still have a hard time standing up to the sector 's giants in the future , " added the paper . commission under fire other news sources were more critical of the way the eu commission handled the case . " the commission overstepped its authority and showed that the conflict had become extremely emotional , " wrote der standard from vienna .
" the european commission is supposed to ensure competition .
how the market shares then develop should be left to the consumers and the companies . " der bund in bern commented that " it 's problematic that the case took so long and may not even be closed yet .
while highly paid lawyers on both sides are having it out , technology is developing at a rapid pace . " despite the newest regulations from luxembourg , it will be difficult in the next case to find a balance between consumers ' interest in competition and the equally justifiable protection of a market-dominating company 's innovation and intellectual capital , " concluded the swiss paper . compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

those five current permanent members - the world war ii victors - have veto power over security matters .
the resolution calls for the 62nd general assembly , which begins work on tuesday , sept .
18 , to " take immediate steps to facilitate results-oriented inter-governmental negotiations " along the lines of discussions among un members in past years .
germany and japan , which also have aspirations for permanent seats on the security council , did not join in sponsoring the resolution .
but they stand to benefit if negotiations succeed in reforming the council .
after years of pushing for a permanent seat on the un security council , germany announced in july that it had scaled back its ambitions in the hope that a series of larger reforms would ultimately end with berlin as part of the body .
reforms could benefit germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier could make a case for a council spot over the summer , germany said it was going to change its course from calling for a seat on the council to looking for an " intelligent compromise . "
officials in berlin claimed that the un was suffering from " reform fatigue " and would restart its negotiations for a permanent seat once a viable reform package was under way .
the new resolution could be the first step in a larger reform process that could see germany and its so-called group of four partners - japan , brazil and india - admitted to the security council .
group of four opposed by regional rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's un aspirations were toned down , not quashed two years ago , the group of four issued a series of demands for permanent seats .
but each met fierce regional opposition : india was opposed by pakistan , japan was opposed by south korea and china , germany was opposed by italy , and brazil was opposed by several latin american nations .
in addition to the council 's five permanent members , there are also 10 members elected for a two-year term with the 10 seats rotating among the world 's five regions .
un members have for more than 15 years called for revamping the council to include more countries - as many as 20 or 25 members - and give more representation to developing nations . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , franco-german relations are maneuvering a patch of rough water : personality clashes between leaders and policy differences are the problem . when former french president jacques chirac would come calling on chancellor angela merkel , she seemed charmed by his gallant style , old world sensibility and those light kisses on the hand that got so much media play .
but his successor 's habit of familiarly kissing and hugging the german leader at their meetings has left her cold , even annoyed , according to reports , and has not helped strengthen a relationship that is seen as pivotal within the european union . were it just a matter of where to place a kiss , the issue might be solved with the intervention of a protocol officer .
but the differences between the two leaders are ones of both style and substance , which make them more difficult to bridge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel received many a kiss on the hand from france 's former president jacques chirac last week , france 's government spokesman said sarkozy told his cabinet his latest talks with merkel had been " very frank " - diplomatic speak for heated .
it comes after a series of low-level spats , including disagreements over the independence of the european central bank , the future of nuclear power , sarkozy 's protectionist murmurings , and even his stealing the spotlight over the freeing of bulgarian medics long held by libya . according to observers in both france and germany , merkel is not amused .
the french le figaro newspaper said the chancellor was irritated by sarkozy 's " rough and ready " manner .
the german rheinische post daily called the relationship one in " deep crisis . " " there is real annoyance , although i would n't use the word ' crisis , " ' said henrik uterwedde , deputy director of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg in southwestern germany .
" but it 's not peanuts and it should ring alarm bells . " styles : day and night when sarkozy became president in may , it was thought he and merkel would be the perfect couple .
both come from parties on the right-hand side of the political spectrum , both have an interest in economic reform and getting an eu reform treaty back on track .
they were even born just six months apart .
but , on closer examination , the fact that they have not hit it off personally might not be surprising .
their styles could not be more different . angela merkel , a pastor 's daughter who grew up in east germany , is cautious and reserved .
she has a down-to-earth style that dispenses with all flash .
but she has succeeded in finding a way to communicate her positions - even to foreign leaders on controversial topics like human rights in china or russian democracy - in a low-key but effective manner .
she is the quintessential team player . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he likes the crowd 's adulation and ministers who know their place nicolas sarkozy is a near opposite of that .
brash and in constant movement , he has been called hyperactive by many .
comparisons to bonaparte have been frequent , given his dismissive behavior towards his cabinet and his apparent love for showmanship and the spotlight . " france 's government system is much more hierarchical than germany 's , " said uterwedde .
" under sarkozy , it is even more so . " sarkozy recently crashed a meeting of finance ministers in brussels and explained his country 's short-term economic strategy while france 's own finance minister christine lagarde " sat there like a schoolgirl , " according to uterwedde . when german finance minister peer steinbrück accusing the french president of " giving fiscal handouts to voters " instead of keeping his european budgetary promises , sarkozy became incensed . " how dare you speak to me in that tone , " sarkozy is said to have replied , and was later furious with merkel for not rapping her finance minister 's knuckles as he requested . l 'état , c 'est moi ? while observers say the franco-german situation has not reached the breaking point , sarkozy would be wise to calm his style and become more of a player on team eu , or he could risk alienating more than just angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is accused of taking credit for initiatives that were n't his own , such as the release of medics held by libya " sarkozy has to learn that france is not playing alone but is part of a team called europe , " said isabelle bourgeois , a researcher at cirac , a paris-based think tank that studies franco-german relations . as far as the symbolic relationship of the french and german leaders goes , the current situation is bad , she says , although she 's careful to add that on the economic level , the two countries are integrated more than ever .
so far , the merkel-sarkozy irritation has caused little serious collateral damage . but other key areas , such as reforms of european markets , the constitution and the euro require close , high-level franco-german cooperation .
the fact that the two leaders might have a difficult time being in the same room together could hinder european progress on those fronts . wider irritation just this weekend , tensions over economic policy between sarkozy and other european leaders burst into the open . the head of the german bundesbank , axel weber , called sarkozy 's understanding of economic realities " zero " in the wake of the french leader 's constant criticism of the european central bank .

18 , franco-german relations are maneuvering a patch of rough water : personality clashes between leaders and policy differences are the problem . when former french president jacques chirac would come calling on chancellor angela merkel , she seemed charmed by his gallant style , old world sensibility and those light kisses on the hand that got so much media play .
but his successor 's habit of familiarly kissing and hugging the german leader at their meetings has left her cold , even annoyed , according to reports , and has not helped strengthen a relationship that is seen as pivotal within the european union . were it just a matter of where to place a kiss , the issue might be solved with the intervention of a protocol officer .
but the differences between the two leaders are ones of both style and substance , which make them more difficult to bridge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel received many a kiss on the hand from france 's former president jacques chirac last week , france 's government spokesman said sarkozy told his cabinet his latest talks with merkel had been " very frank " - diplomatic speak for heated .
it comes after a series of low-level spats , including disagreements over the independence of the european central bank , the future of nuclear power , sarkozy 's protectionist murmurings , and even his stealing the spotlight over the freeing of bulgarian medics long held by libya . according to observers in both france and germany , merkel is not amused .
the french le figaro newspaper said the chancellor was irritated by sarkozy 's " rough and ready " manner .
the german rheinische post daily called the relationship one in " deep crisis . " " there is real annoyance , although i would n't use the word ' crisis , " ' said henrik uterwedde , deputy director of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg in southwestern germany .
" but it 's not peanuts and it should ring alarm bells . " styles : day and night when sarkozy became president in may , it was thought he and merkel would be the perfect couple .
both come from parties on the right-hand side of the political spectrum , both have an interest in economic reform and getting an eu reform treaty back on track .
they were even born just six months apart .
but , on closer examination , the fact that they have not hit it off personally might not be surprising .
their styles could not be more different . angela merkel , a pastor 's daughter who grew up in east germany , is cautious and reserved .
she has a down-to-earth style that dispenses with all flash .
but she has succeeded in finding a way to communicate her positions - even to foreign leaders on controversial topics like human rights in china or russian democracy - in a low-key but effective manner .
she is the quintessential team player . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he likes the crowd 's adulation and ministers who know their place nicolas sarkozy is a near opposite of that .
brash and in constant movement , he has been called hyperactive by many .
comparisons to bonaparte have been frequent , given his dismissive behavior towards his cabinet and his apparent love for showmanship and the spotlight . " france 's government system is much more hierarchical than germany 's , " said uterwedde .
" under sarkozy , it is even more so . " sarkozy recently crashed a meeting of finance ministers in brussels and explained his country 's short-term economic strategy while france 's own finance minister christine lagarde " sat there like a schoolgirl , " according to uterwedde . when german finance minister peer steinbrück accusing the french president of " giving fiscal handouts to voters " instead of keeping his european budgetary promises , sarkozy became incensed . " how dare you speak to me in that tone , " sarkozy is said to have replied , and was later furious with merkel for not rapping her finance minister 's knuckles as he requested . l 'état , c 'est moi ? while observers say the franco-german situation has not reached the breaking point , sarkozy would be wise to calm his style and become more of a player on team eu , or he could risk alienating more than just angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is accused of taking credit for initiatives that were n't his own , such as the release of medics held by libya " sarkozy has to learn that france is not playing alone but is part of a team called europe , " said isabelle bourgeois , a researcher at cirac , a paris-based think tank that studies franco-german relations . as far as the symbolic relationship of the french and german leaders goes , the current situation is bad , she says , although she 's careful to add that on the economic level , the two countries are integrated more than ever .
so far , the merkel-sarkozy irritation has caused little serious collateral damage . but other key areas , such as reforms of european markets , the constitution and the euro require close , high-level franco-german cooperation .
the fact that the two leaders might have a difficult time being in the same room together could hinder european progress on those fronts . wider irritation just this weekend , tensions over economic policy between sarkozy and other european leaders burst into the open . the head of the german bundesbank , axel weber , called sarkozy 's understanding of economic realities " zero " in the wake of the french leader 's constant criticism of the european central bank .
jean-claude juncker , luxembourg 's prime minister , suggested the french leader focus on france 's own economic woes instead of constantly carping on the bank 's management of the euro . " on the eu stage , his showmanship will be forgiven once , " said uterwedde .
" but if he continues playing this role , he 'll have problems . he says sarkozy 's recent spats with eu leaders and his sometimes contrarian views are a combination of his wanting to score political points at home and his own personality . " i think the biggest danger for sarkozy is sarkozy himself , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , franco-german relations are maneuvering a patch of rough water : personality clashes between leaders and policy differences are the problem . when former french president jacques chirac would come calling on chancellor angela merkel , she seemed charmed by his gallant style , old world sensibility and those light kisses on the hand that got so much media play .
but his successor 's habit of familiarly kissing and hugging the german leader at their meetings has left her cold , even annoyed , according to reports , and has not helped strengthen a relationship that is seen as pivotal within the european union . were it just a matter of where to place a kiss , the issue might be solved with the intervention of a protocol officer .
but the differences between the two leaders are ones of both style and substance , which make them more difficult to bridge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel received many a kiss on the hand from france 's former president jacques chirac last week , france 's government spokesman said sarkozy told his cabinet his latest talks with merkel had been " very frank " - diplomatic speak for heated .
it comes after a series of low-level spats , including disagreements over the independence of the european central bank , the future of nuclear power , sarkozy 's protectionist murmurings , and even his stealing the spotlight over the freeing of bulgarian medics long held by libya . according to observers in both france and germany , merkel is not amused .
the french le figaro newspaper said the chancellor was irritated by sarkozy 's " rough and ready " manner .
the german rheinische post daily called the relationship one in " deep crisis . " " there is real annoyance , although i would n't use the word ' crisis , " ' said henrik uterwedde , deputy director of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg in southwestern germany .
" but it 's not peanuts and it should ring alarm bells . " styles : day and night when sarkozy became president in may , it was thought he and merkel would be the perfect couple .
both come from parties on the right-hand side of the political spectrum , both have an interest in economic reform and getting an eu reform treaty back on track .
they were even born just six months apart .
but , on closer examination , the fact that they have not hit it off personally might not be surprising .
their styles could not be more different . angela merkel , a pastor 's daughter who grew up in east germany , is cautious and reserved .
she has a down-to-earth style that dispenses with all flash .
but she has succeeded in finding a way to communicate her positions - even to foreign leaders on controversial topics like human rights in china or russian democracy - in a low-key but effective manner .
she is the quintessential team player . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he likes the crowd 's adulation and ministers who know their place nicolas sarkozy is a near opposite of that .
brash and in constant movement , he has been called hyperactive by many .
comparisons to bonaparte have been frequent , given his dismissive behavior towards his cabinet and his apparent love for showmanship and the spotlight . " france 's government system is much more hierarchical than germany 's , " said uterwedde .
" under sarkozy , it is even more so . " sarkozy recently crashed a meeting of finance ministers in brussels and explained his country 's short-term economic strategy while france 's own finance minister christine lagarde " sat there like a schoolgirl , " according to uterwedde . when german finance minister peer steinbrück accusing the french president of " giving fiscal handouts to voters " instead of keeping his european budgetary promises , sarkozy became incensed . " how dare you speak to me in that tone , " sarkozy is said to have replied , and was later furious with merkel for not rapping her finance minister 's knuckles as he requested . l 'état , c 'est moi ? while observers say the franco-german situation has not reached the breaking point , sarkozy would be wise to calm his style and become more of a player on team eu , or he could risk alienating more than just angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is accused of taking credit for initiatives that were n't his own , such as the release of medics held by libya " sarkozy has to learn that france is not playing alone but is part of a team called europe , " said isabelle bourgeois , a researcher at cirac , a paris-based think tank that studies franco-german relations . as far as the symbolic relationship of the french and german leaders goes , the current situation is bad , she says , although she 's careful to add that on the economic level , the two countries are integrated more than ever .
so far , the merkel-sarkozy irritation has caused little serious collateral damage . but other key areas , such as reforms of european markets , the constitution and the euro require close , high-level franco-german cooperation .
the fact that the two leaders might have a difficult time being in the same room together could hinder european progress on those fronts . wider irritation just this weekend , tensions over economic policy between sarkozy and other european leaders burst into the open . the head of the german bundesbank , axel weber , called sarkozy 's understanding of economic realities " zero " in the wake of the french leader 's constant criticism of the european central bank .
jean-claude juncker , luxembourg 's prime minister , suggested the french leader focus on france 's own economic woes instead of constantly carping on the bank 's management of the euro . " on the eu stage , his showmanship will be forgiven once , " said uterwedde .
" but if he continues playing this role , he 'll have problems . he says sarkozy 's recent spats with eu leaders and his sometimes contrarian views are a combination of his wanting to score political points at home and his own personality . " i think the biggest danger for sarkozy is sarkozy himself , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , that wealthy nations are spending far more money on education than they did 12 years ago .
however , in its annual " education at a glance survey " presented in berlin , the organization also said that inefficient use of resources is impeding efforts to improve standards . oecd said that if current resources were employed more efficiently , learning levels could increase by 22 percent . " countries are collectively spending more than they ever have on education , " the oecd said .
" but the results gained from that investment are far from maximized . " the paris-based organization represents 30 industrialized countries .
it said that between 1995 and 2004 , spending on education had risen by an average of 42 percent , with more people than ever receiving secondary school and university degrees . more than half of high school students go on to college bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he attend university ?
" on average more than half of school-leavers are entering university-level education at some stage in their life , " oecd secretary general angel gurria said at tuesday 's press conference .
" the most striking thing is the astounding speed at which the education system continues to expand . " forty years ago , the number of university entrants stood at one in 10 pupils . according to the oecd web site , more than 40 percent of young people in countries such as denmark , australia , italy , the netherlands and poland complete university courses .
the organization noted , however , that graduation rates tended to be " highest in countries where programs are of short duration . " germany 's longer study programs hinder completion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's courses of study are longer than elsewhere " by contrast , in germany and austria , where programs are longer , only 20 percent of young people get degrees , " the oecd noted . the organization said that its findings confirmed that people who obtain an education from the upper-secondary level upwards earn considerably more than those with lesser degrees . the report also noted a significant historical change : female students are now more likely to complete secondary education than their male peers . in terms of graduation from education up to the age of 18 , female students exceed boys in all countries surveyed , with the exception of south korea , switzerland and turkey . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , franco-german relations are maneuvering a patch of rough water : personality clashes between leaders and policy differences are the problem . when former french president jacques chirac would come calling on chancellor angela merkel , she seemed charmed by his gallant style , old world sensibility and those light kisses on the hand that got so much media play .
but his successor 's habit of familiarly kissing and hugging the german leader at their meetings has left her cold , even annoyed , according to reports , and has not helped strengthen a relationship that is seen as pivotal within the european union . were it just a matter of where to place a kiss , the issue might be solved with the intervention of a protocol officer .
but the differences between the two leaders are ones of both style and substance , which make them more difficult to bridge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel received many a kiss on the hand from france 's former president jacques chirac last week , france 's government spokesman said sarkozy told his cabinet his latest talks with merkel had been " very frank " - diplomatic speak for heated .
it comes after a series of low-level spats , including disagreements over the independence of the european central bank , the future of nuclear power , sarkozy 's protectionist murmurings , and even his stealing the spotlight over the freeing of bulgarian medics long held by libya . according to observers in both france and germany , merkel is not amused .
the french le figaro newspaper said the chancellor was irritated by sarkozy 's " rough and ready " manner .
the german rheinische post daily called the relationship one in " deep crisis . " " there is real annoyance , although i would n't use the word ' crisis , " ' said henrik uterwedde , deputy director of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg in southwestern germany .
" but it 's not peanuts and it should ring alarm bells . " styles : day and night when sarkozy became president in may , it was thought he and merkel would be the perfect couple .
both come from parties on the right-hand side of the political spectrum , both have an interest in economic reform and getting an eu reform treaty back on track .
they were even born just six months apart .
but , on closer examination , the fact that they have not hit it off personally might not be surprising .
their styles could not be more different . angela merkel , a pastor 's daughter who grew up in east germany , is cautious and reserved .
she has a down-to-earth style that dispenses with all flash .
but she has succeeded in finding a way to communicate her positions - even to foreign leaders on controversial topics like human rights in china or russian democracy - in a low-key but effective manner .
she is the quintessential team player . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he likes the crowd 's adulation and ministers who know their place nicolas sarkozy is a near opposite of that .
brash and in constant movement , he has been called hyperactive by many .
comparisons to bonaparte have been frequent , given his dismissive behavior towards his cabinet and his apparent love for showmanship and the spotlight . " france 's government system is much more hierarchical than germany 's , " said uterwedde .
" under sarkozy , it is even more so . " sarkozy recently crashed a meeting of finance ministers in brussels and explained his country 's short-term economic strategy while france 's own finance minister christine lagarde " sat there like a schoolgirl , " according to uterwedde . when german finance minister peer steinbrück accusing the french president of " giving fiscal handouts to voters " instead of keeping his european budgetary promises , sarkozy became incensed . " how dare you speak to me in that tone , " sarkozy is said to have replied , and was later furious with merkel for not rapping her finance minister 's knuckles as he requested . l 'état , c 'est moi ? while observers say the franco-german situation has not reached the breaking point , sarkozy would be wise to calm his style and become more of a player on team eu , or he could risk alienating more than just angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is accused of taking credit for initiatives that were n't his own , such as the release of medics held by libya " sarkozy has to learn that france is not playing alone but is part of a team called europe , " said isabelle bourgeois , a researcher at cirac , a paris-based think tank that studies franco-german relations . as far as the symbolic relationship of the french and german leaders goes , the current situation is bad , she says , although she 's careful to add that on the economic level , the two countries are integrated more than ever .
so far , the merkel-sarkozy irritation has caused little serious collateral damage . but other key areas , such as reforms of european markets , the constitution and the euro require close , high-level franco-german cooperation .
the fact that the two leaders might have a difficult time being in the same room together could hinder european progress on those fronts . wider irritation just this weekend , tensions over economic policy between sarkozy and other european leaders burst into the open . the head of the german bundesbank , axel weber , called sarkozy 's understanding of economic realities " zero " in the wake of the french leader 's constant criticism of the european central bank .
jean-claude juncker , luxembourg 's prime minister , suggested the french leader focus on france 's own economic woes instead of constantly carping on the bank 's management of the euro . " on the eu stage , his showmanship will be forgiven once , " said uterwedde .
" but if he continues playing this role , he 'll have problems . he says sarkozy 's recent spats with eu leaders and his sometimes contrarian views are a combination of his wanting to score political points at home and his own personality . " i think the biggest danger for sarkozy is sarkozy himself , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the position 's limited power , however , means the " czar " will have to work closely with national governments . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble told the ap news agency that he and his european colleagues had agreed in brussels on tuesday , sept .
18 , that they would find " the proper expert " to fill the post . schäuble , however , did not confirm reports that a belgium diplomat was to take up the post . the german dpa news agency reported that the new eu anti-terrorism coordinator would be gilles de kerchove d 'ousselghem , a belgian law professor and high-ranking official at the eu 's justice and home affairs directorate . portuguese interior minister rui pereira , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said eu foreign policy chief javier solana would name the new counter-terrorism coordinator " very soon , " according to european media reports . the counter-terrorism chief will be responsible for coordinating the application of the eu 's " anti-terror strategy " in the bloc 's 27 member nations , as well as in working groups and at meetings of the various eu ministers . new terror czar must be more effective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrests of three alleged bombers has added fuel to the terrorism debate in germany schäuble also said the eu must clarify how the new coordinator can be " more effective " in fulfilling his tasks . gijs de vries , the bloc 's first counter-terrorism chief , resigned in march .
he gave personal reasons for his departure , but many observers said the dutchman was frustrated by the lack of cooperation from national interior and justice ministers . despite widespread acceptance that crime , and especially terrorism , must be fought internationally , national governments have been reluctant to give eu officials power over issues of justice and domestic security . no additional powers solana said the new counter-terrorism head would not receive more powers than de vries had . " it will be powers that will be - i do n't have to call them expanded - they will be deeper and in a much closer relation with the ministers and the different countries that have a lot to say on the fight against terrorism , " he told reporters . pereira said that during an informal meeting , he , solana and other eu ministers had discussed the profile and powers of a new anti-terrorism coordinator . " we concluded that -lsb- he -rsb- should have a largely technical profile , and that he should be particularly concerned with pooling resources between member states and ensuring smooth cooperation between all eu institutions , " said pereira . post vacant during the past six months bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former eu counter-terrorism coordinator de vries the anti-terrorism coordinator 's post was created in 2004 following the train bombings in madrid which killed nearly 200 people .
the position has remained vacant since march , when de vries resigned . " i think the first coordinator was named during the circumstances of the times , " solana told afp news agency .
" the situation has evolved , relations between countries are closer , deeper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 18.09.2007 germany intends to criminalize terrorist preparation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is tightening its laws to battle terrorism germany 's justice minister plans to extend the country 's anti-terror laws .
in the future , preparing an attack or receiving explicit training for a violent act will be punishable by up to 10 years in prison . the worldwide threat of terrorist attacks includes germany , according to the country 's justice minister brigitte zypries . " we can not exclude a terrorist attack in our country , " zypries told reporters in berlin on tuesday , sept .
18 .
" as regrettable as this realization is , it is unfortunately by no means new . " the justice ministry has therefore proposed new legislation , which would make the preparation of terrorist acts , as well as the instruction of such actions , a criminal offence .
if convicted , offenders would face up to 10 years in prison . existing anti-terrorist laws no longer timely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the men arrested in germany were planning bombs using hydrogen peroxide the proposal comes after authorities arrested three men earlier this month for planning massive terrorist attacks targeting us nationals in germany . the justice ministry has been reviewing germany 's criminal law over the past few months to determine whether loopholes existed .
the planned legislation would allow preparations ahead of terrorist attacks to be legally dealt with more systematically , zypries said . existing german laws against terrorism could not be applied to terrorist acts today , the ministry said .
laws introduced to battle the militant , left-wing red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- in the 1970s stipulated that a terrorist organization must have at least three members before its formation - or support of the organization - can be deemed illegal . but terrorist structures have changed since then , the ministry said . " as opposed to the raf , islamic offenders are often active without any firm connection to a hierarchically based group , " it said in a statement . yet the related danger was nonetheless " considerable " and therefore needed to be punishable by law , it said . only explicit training for a terrorist act will be a crime the first proposal to the new legislation stipulated that preparing a terrorist attack would be punishable by six months to 10 years in prison .
this included acquiring weapons , chemicals or other substances in order to commit a violent offense .
the proposal would also outlaw financing a terrorist attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries wants more legal means to fight terrorism this legislation would also cover , for example , a suspect charged with carrying out a bombing in germany who had previously traveled to a terrorist camp to receive explosives training , or a person who took flight training in order to hijack an aircraft . the ministry said , however , that the law would apply only to training with the specific intent to carry out a terrorist attack .
this means that attending a training camp in itself would not necessarily be a crime .
prosecutors said the three men arrested in germany on sept .
4 trained at camps in pakistan run by the islamic jihad union . the second proposal in the new legislation would criminalize publishing or acquiring instructions for attacks or bombs , for example , via the internet .
if the instructions were deemed to motivate others to commit attacks , the crime would carry a prison sentence of up to three years . zypries ' proposals will now be coordinated within the federal government .
a ministry draft will then be sent to germany 's 16 federal states before formulating a bill in parliament . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , that wealthy nations are spending far more money on education than they did 12 years ago .
however , in its annual " education at a glance survey " presented in berlin , the organization also said that inefficient use of resources is impeding efforts to improve standards . oecd said that if current resources were employed more efficiently , learning levels could increase by 22 percent . " countries are collectively spending more than they ever have on education , " the oecd said .
" but the results gained from that investment are far from maximized . " the paris-based organization represents 30 industrialized countries .
it said that between 1995 and 2004 , spending on education had risen by an average of 42 percent , with more people than ever receiving secondary school and university degrees . more than half of high school students go on to college bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he attend university ?
" on average more than half of school-leavers are entering university-level education at some stage in their life , " oecd secretary general angel gurria said at tuesday 's press conference .
" the most striking thing is the astounding speed at which the education system continues to expand . " forty years ago , the number of university entrants stood at one in 10 pupils . according to the oecd web site , more than 40 percent of young people in countries such as denmark , australia , italy , the netherlands and poland complete university courses .
the organization noted , however , that graduation rates tended to be " highest in countries where programs are of short duration . " germany 's longer study programs hinder completion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's courses of study are longer than elsewhere " by contrast , in germany and austria , where programs are longer , only 20 percent of young people get degrees , " the oecd noted . the organization said that its findings confirmed that people who obtain an education from the upper-secondary level upwards earn considerably more than those with lesser degrees . the report also noted a significant historical change : female students are now more likely to complete secondary education than their male peers . in terms of graduation from education up to the age of 18 , female students exceed boys in all countries surveyed , with the exception of south korea , switzerland and turkey . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the position 's limited power , however , means the " czar " will have to work closely with national governments . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble told the ap news agency that he and his european colleagues had agreed in brussels on tuesday , sept .

the man spent seven weeks in the intensive care unit with no sign of improvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany draws the line at embryonic stem cell research stauer decided to apply stem cell therapy on the patient .
following nine days of treatment , the man had improved enough that he could leave intensive care and be moved to a rehabilitation center . the therapy involved extracting adult stem cells from the patient 's bone marrow and then inserting them , with the help of a balloon catheter , into the artery damaged by the infarction . the procedure took about a half hour . stauer called it a " global innovation " in that cardiogenic shock - inadequate delivery of oxygen to the heart tissues - could be treated with stem cell therapy for the first time ever . embryonic stem cell research banned in germany such stem cell therapy , however , has enlivened the debate on embryonic stem cell research . recently , the german government said it would allocate five million euros -lrb- $ 6.9 million -rrb- over the next three years for non-embryonic stem cell research . stem cells can develop into different cell types , including those for bones , blood and the brain .
specialists say they can help in treating illnesses such as parkinson 's , and can help to regenerate damaged organs or tissue . researchers say embryonic stem cells - cells taken from days-old human embryos - are the most promising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minor heart attacks often go unnoticed however , genetic research is highly contested in germany due to its nazi history of experimentation to create a " master race . " since 2002 , the production of embryonic cells from pre-existing stem cell lines is prohibited in germany .
scientists are also not permitted to research on any lines produced after jan .
1 , 2002 to ensure that foreign laboratories do not create new lines for the german market . critics have said that such prohibitions put german scientists at a disadvantage . critics of embryonic stem cell research , however , say that progress with adult stem cell treatment , such as with the cardiac patient in düsseldorf , nullifies the need for cells derived from human embryos . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 18.09.2007 germany intends to criminalize terrorist preparation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is tightening its laws to battle terrorism germany 's justice minister plans to extend the country 's anti-terror laws .
in the future , preparing an attack or receiving explicit training for a violent act will be punishable by up to 10 years in prison . the worldwide threat of terrorist attacks includes germany , according to the country 's justice minister brigitte zypries . " we can not exclude a terrorist attack in our country , " zypries told reporters in berlin on tuesday , sept .
18 .
" as regrettable as this realization is , it is unfortunately by no means new . " the justice ministry has therefore proposed new legislation , which would make the preparation of terrorist acts , as well as the instruction of such actions , a criminal offence .
if convicted , offenders would face up to 10 years in prison . existing anti-terrorist laws no longer timely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the men arrested in germany were planning bombs using hydrogen peroxide the proposal comes after authorities arrested three men earlier this month for planning massive terrorist attacks targeting us nationals in germany . the justice ministry has been reviewing germany 's criminal law over the past few months to determine whether loopholes existed .
the planned legislation would allow preparations ahead of terrorist attacks to be legally dealt with more systematically , zypries said . existing german laws against terrorism could not be applied to terrorist acts today , the ministry said .
laws introduced to battle the militant , left-wing red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- in the 1970s stipulated that a terrorist organization must have at least three members before its formation - or support of the organization - can be deemed illegal . but terrorist structures have changed since then , the ministry said .

18 , to " take immediate steps to facilitate results-oriented inter-governmental negotiations " along the lines of discussions among un members in past years .
germany and japan , which also have aspirations for permanent seats on the security council , did not join in sponsoring the resolution .
but they stand to benefit if negotiations succeed in reforming the council .
after years of pushing for a permanent seat on the un security council , germany announced in july that it had scaled back its ambitions in the hope that a series of larger reforms would ultimately end with berlin as part of the body .
reforms could benefit germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier could make a case for a council spot over the summer , germany said it was going to change its course from calling for a seat on the council to looking for an " intelligent compromise . "
officials in berlin claimed that the un was suffering from " reform fatigue " and would restart its negotiations for a permanent seat once a viable reform package was under way .
the new resolution could be the first step in a larger reform process that could see germany and its so-called group of four partners - japan , brazil and india - admitted to the security council .
group of four opposed by regional rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's un aspirations were toned down , not quashed two years ago , the group of four issued a series of demands for permanent seats .
but each met fierce regional opposition : india was opposed by pakistan , japan was opposed by south korea and china , germany was opposed by italy , and brazil was opposed by several latin american nations .
in addition to the council 's five permanent members , there are also 10 members elected for a two-year term with the 10 seats rotating among the world 's five regions .
un members have for more than 15 years called for revamping the council to include more countries - as many as 20 or 25 members - and give more representation to developing nations . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the differences between the two leaders are ones of both style and substance , which make them more difficult to bridge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel received many a kiss on the hand from france 's former president jacques chirac last week , france 's government spokesman said sarkozy told his cabinet his latest talks with merkel had been " very frank " - diplomatic speak for heated .

their styles could not be more different . angela merkel , a pastor 's daughter who grew up in east germany , is cautious and reserved .

comparisons to bonaparte have been frequent , given his dismissive behavior towards his cabinet and his apparent love for showmanship and the spotlight . " france 's government system is much more hierarchical than germany 's , " said uterwedde .
" under sarkozy , it is even more so . " sarkozy recently crashed a meeting of finance ministers in brussels and explained his country 's short-term economic strategy while france 's own finance minister christine lagarde " sat there like a schoolgirl , " according to uterwedde . when german finance minister peer steinbrück accusing the french president of " giving fiscal handouts to voters " instead of keeping his european budgetary promises , sarkozy became incensed . " how dare you speak to me in that tone , " sarkozy is said to have replied , and was later furious with merkel for not rapping her finance minister 's knuckles as he requested . l 'état , c 'est moi ? while observers say the franco-german situation has not reached the breaking point , sarkozy would be wise to calm his style and become more of a player on team eu , or he could risk alienating more than just angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is accused of taking credit for initiatives that were n't his own , such as the release of medics held by libya " sarkozy has to learn that france is not playing alone but is part of a team called europe , " said isabelle bourgeois , a researcher at cirac , a paris-based think tank that studies franco-german relations . as far as the symbolic relationship of the french and german leaders goes , the current situation is bad , she says , although she 's careful to add that on the economic level , the two countries are integrated more than ever .
so far , the merkel-sarkozy irritation has caused little serious collateral damage . but other key areas , such as reforms of european markets , the constitution and the euro require close , high-level franco-german cooperation .

18 , franco-german relations are maneuvering a patch of rough water : personality clashes between leaders and policy differences are the problem . when former french president jacques chirac would come calling on chancellor angela merkel , she seemed charmed by his gallant style , old world sensibility and those light kisses on the hand that got so much media play .
but his successor 's habit of familiarly kissing and hugging the german leader at their meetings has left her cold , even annoyed , according to reports , and has not helped strengthen a relationship that is seen as pivotal within the european union . were it just a matter of where to place a kiss , the issue might be solved with the intervention of a protocol officer .
but the differences between the two leaders are ones of both style and substance , which make them more difficult to bridge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel received many a kiss on the hand from france 's former president jacques chirac last week , france 's government spokesman said sarkozy told his cabinet his latest talks with merkel had been " very frank " - diplomatic speak for heated .
it comes after a series of low-level spats , including disagreements over the independence of the european central bank , the future of nuclear power , sarkozy 's protectionist murmurings , and even his stealing the spotlight over the freeing of bulgarian medics long held by libya . according to observers in both france and germany , merkel is not amused .
the french le figaro newspaper said the chancellor was irritated by sarkozy 's " rough and ready " manner .
the german rheinische post daily called the relationship one in " deep crisis . " " there is real annoyance , although i would n't use the word ' crisis , " ' said henrik uterwedde , deputy director of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg in southwestern germany .
" but it 's not peanuts and it should ring alarm bells . " styles : day and night when sarkozy became president in may , it was thought he and merkel would be the perfect couple .
both come from parties on the right-hand side of the political spectrum , both have an interest in economic reform and getting an eu reform treaty back on track .
they were even born just six months apart .
but , on closer examination , the fact that they have not hit it off personally might not be surprising .
their styles could not be more different . angela merkel , a pastor 's daughter who grew up in east germany , is cautious and reserved .
she has a down-to-earth style that dispenses with all flash .
but she has succeeded in finding a way to communicate her positions - even to foreign leaders on controversial topics like human rights in china or russian democracy - in a low-key but effective manner .
she is the quintessential team player . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he likes the crowd 's adulation and ministers who know their place nicolas sarkozy is a near opposite of that .
brash and in constant movement , he has been called hyperactive by many .
comparisons to bonaparte have been frequent , given his dismissive behavior towards his cabinet and his apparent love for showmanship and the spotlight . " france 's government system is much more hierarchical than germany 's , " said uterwedde .
" under sarkozy , it is even more so . " sarkozy recently crashed a meeting of finance ministers in brussels and explained his country 's short-term economic strategy while france 's own finance minister christine lagarde " sat there like a schoolgirl , " according to uterwedde . when german finance minister peer steinbrück accusing the french president of " giving fiscal handouts to voters " instead of keeping his european budgetary promises , sarkozy became incensed . " how dare you speak to me in that tone , " sarkozy is said to have replied , and was later furious with merkel for not rapping her finance minister 's knuckles as he requested . l 'état , c 'est moi ? while observers say the franco-german situation has not reached the breaking point , sarkozy would be wise to calm his style and become more of a player on team eu , or he could risk alienating more than just angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is accused of taking credit for initiatives that were n't his own , such as the release of medics held by libya " sarkozy has to learn that france is not playing alone but is part of a team called europe , " said isabelle bourgeois , a researcher at cirac , a paris-based think tank that studies franco-german relations . as far as the symbolic relationship of the french and german leaders goes , the current situation is bad , she says , although she 's careful to add that on the economic level , the two countries are integrated more than ever .
so far , the merkel-sarkozy irritation has caused little serious collateral damage . but other key areas , such as reforms of european markets , the constitution and the euro require close , high-level franco-german cooperation .
the fact that the two leaders might have a difficult time being in the same room together could hinder european progress on those fronts . wider irritation just this weekend , tensions over economic policy between sarkozy and other european leaders burst into the open . the head of the german bundesbank , axel weber , called sarkozy 's understanding of economic realities " zero " in the wake of the french leader 's constant criticism of the european central bank .
jean-claude juncker , luxembourg 's prime minister , suggested the french leader focus on france 's own economic woes instead of constantly carping on the bank 's management of the euro . " on the eu stage , his showmanship will be forgiven once , " said uterwedde .
" but if he continues playing this role , he 'll have problems . he says sarkozy 's recent spats with eu leaders and his sometimes contrarian views are a combination of his wanting to score political points at home and his own personality . " i think the biggest danger for sarkozy is sarkozy himself , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

still , the case could have been handled better and competition will remain tight in the sector , several papers wrote . " it 's a victory for the customer and the free market , " the munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung wrote of the microsoft court decision , while conceding that " some of the effects of the microsoft expansion can not be reversed . " the eu decision will ensure greater competition , which the customers can only benefit from , " the paper continued .
" as we read in economics textbooks , monopolies lead to expensive goods and bad service . " the microsoft conflict is the most important case the eu has been through , wrote oslo 's aftenpost : " it is comparable to the trial where us oil magnate john d. rockefeller was forced to break up the standard oil company nearly a hundred years ago . " the current trial is essential to the credibility and penetrating power of the eu court .
thanks to the eu , small and mid-sized software companies around the world have won a decisive partial victory for more competition on the computer systems market . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say competition on the software market will remain tight the financial times deutschland , writing from hamburg , agreed that " yesterday 's decision significantly bolsters the -lsb- european -rsb- commission now in ensuring competition , " though the commission 's reputation had been damaged by unsuccessful merger bans over the course of the nine-year conflict , the paper noted . " despite protection from brussels , microsoft 's competitors will still have a hard time standing up to the sector 's giants in the future , " added the paper . commission under fire other news sources were more critical of the way the eu commission handled the case . " the commission overstepped its authority and showed that the conflict had become extremely emotional , " wrote der standard from vienna .
" the european commission is supposed to ensure competition .
how the market shares then develop should be left to the consumers and the companies . " der bund in bern commented that " it 's problematic that the case took so long and may not even be closed yet .
while highly paid lawyers on both sides are having it out , technology is developing at a rapid pace . " despite the newest regulations from luxembourg , it will be difficult in the next case to find a balance between consumers ' interest in competition and the equally justifiable protection of a market-dominating company 's innovation and intellectual capital , " concluded the swiss paper . compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , franco-german relations are maneuvering a patch of rough water : personality clashes between leaders and policy differences are the problem . when former french president jacques chirac would come calling on chancellor angela merkel , she seemed charmed by his gallant style , old world sensibility and those light kisses on the hand that got so much media play .
but his successor 's habit of familiarly kissing and hugging the german leader at their meetings has left her cold , even annoyed , according to reports , and has not helped strengthen a relationship that is seen as pivotal within the european union . were it just a matter of where to place a kiss , the issue might be solved with the intervention of a protocol officer .
but the differences between the two leaders are ones of both style and substance , which make them more difficult to bridge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel received many a kiss on the hand from france 's former president jacques chirac last week , france 's government spokesman said sarkozy told his cabinet his latest talks with merkel had been " very frank " - diplomatic speak for heated .
it comes after a series of low-level spats , including disagreements over the independence of the european central bank , the future of nuclear power , sarkozy 's protectionist murmurings , and even his stealing the spotlight over the freeing of bulgarian medics long held by libya . according to observers in both france and germany , merkel is not amused .
the french le figaro newspaper said the chancellor was irritated by sarkozy 's " rough and ready " manner .
the german rheinische post daily called the relationship one in " deep crisis . " " there is real annoyance , although i would n't use the word ' crisis , " ' said henrik uterwedde , deputy director of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg in southwestern germany .
" but it 's not peanuts and it should ring alarm bells . " styles : day and night when sarkozy became president in may , it was thought he and merkel would be the perfect couple .
both come from parties on the right-hand side of the political spectrum , both have an interest in economic reform and getting an eu reform treaty back on track .
they were even born just six months apart .
but , on closer examination , the fact that they have not hit it off personally might not be surprising .
their styles could not be more different . angela merkel , a pastor 's daughter who grew up in east germany , is cautious and reserved .
she has a down-to-earth style that dispenses with all flash .
but she has succeeded in finding a way to communicate her positions - even to foreign leaders on controversial topics like human rights in china or russian democracy - in a low-key but effective manner .
she is the quintessential team player . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he likes the crowd 's adulation and ministers who know their place nicolas sarkozy is a near opposite of that .
brash and in constant movement , he has been called hyperactive by many .
comparisons to bonaparte have been frequent , given his dismissive behavior towards his cabinet and his apparent love for showmanship and the spotlight . " france 's government system is much more hierarchical than germany 's , " said uterwedde .
" under sarkozy , it is even more so . " sarkozy recently crashed a meeting of finance ministers in brussels and explained his country 's short-term economic strategy while france 's own finance minister christine lagarde " sat there like a schoolgirl , " according to uterwedde . when german finance minister peer steinbrück accusing the french president of " giving fiscal handouts to voters " instead of keeping his european budgetary promises , sarkozy became incensed . " how dare you speak to me in that tone , " sarkozy is said to have replied , and was later furious with merkel for not rapping her finance minister 's knuckles as he requested . l 'état , c 'est moi ? while observers say the franco-german situation has not reached the breaking point , sarkozy would be wise to calm his style and become more of a player on team eu , or he could risk alienating more than just angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is accused of taking credit for initiatives that were n't his own , such as the release of medics held by libya " sarkozy has to learn that france is not playing alone but is part of a team called europe , " said isabelle bourgeois , a researcher at cirac , a paris-based think tank that studies franco-german relations . as far as the symbolic relationship of the french and german leaders goes , the current situation is bad , she says , although she 's careful to add that on the economic level , the two countries are integrated more than ever .
so far , the merkel-sarkozy irritation has caused little serious collateral damage . but other key areas , such as reforms of european markets , the constitution and the euro require close , high-level franco-german cooperation .
the fact that the two leaders might have a difficult time being in the same room together could hinder european progress on those fronts . wider irritation just this weekend , tensions over economic policy between sarkozy and other european leaders burst into the open . the head of the german bundesbank , axel weber , called sarkozy 's understanding of economic realities " zero " in the wake of the french leader 's constant criticism of the european central bank .

those five current permanent members - the world war ii victors - have veto power over security matters .
the resolution calls for the 62nd general assembly , which begins work on tuesday , sept .
18 , to " take immediate steps to facilitate results-oriented inter-governmental negotiations " along the lines of discussions among un members in past years .
germany and japan , which also have aspirations for permanent seats on the security council , did not join in sponsoring the resolution .
but they stand to benefit if negotiations succeed in reforming the council .
after years of pushing for a permanent seat on the un security council , germany announced in july that it had scaled back its ambitions in the hope that a series of larger reforms would ultimately end with berlin as part of the body .
reforms could benefit germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier could make a case for a council spot over the summer , germany said it was going to change its course from calling for a seat on the council to looking for an " intelligent compromise . "
officials in berlin claimed that the un was suffering from " reform fatigue " and would restart its negotiations for a permanent seat once a viable reform package was under way .
the new resolution could be the first step in a larger reform process that could see germany and its so-called group of four partners - japan , brazil and india - admitted to the security council .
group of four opposed by regional rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's un aspirations were toned down , not quashed two years ago , the group of four issued a series of demands for permanent seats .
but each met fierce regional opposition : india was opposed by pakistan , japan was opposed by south korea and china , germany was opposed by italy , and brazil was opposed by several latin american nations .
in addition to the council 's five permanent members , there are also 10 members elected for a two-year term with the 10 seats rotating among the world 's five regions .
un members have for more than 15 years called for revamping the council to include more countries - as many as 20 or 25 members - and give more representation to developing nations . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

still , the case could have been handled better and competition will remain tight in the sector , several papers wrote . " it 's a victory for the customer and the free market , " the munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung wrote of the microsoft court decision , while conceding that " some of the effects of the microsoft expansion can not be reversed . " the eu decision will ensure greater competition , which the customers can only benefit from , " the paper continued .
" as we read in economics textbooks , monopolies lead to expensive goods and bad service . " the microsoft conflict is the most important case the eu has been through , wrote oslo 's aftenpost : " it is comparable to the trial where us oil magnate john d. rockefeller was forced to break up the standard oil company nearly a hundred years ago . " the current trial is essential to the credibility and penetrating power of the eu court .

" despite protection from brussels , microsoft 's competitors will still have a hard time standing up to the sector 's giants in the future , " added the paper . commission under fire other news sources were more critical of the way the eu commission handled the case . " the commission overstepped its authority and showed that the conflict had become extremely emotional , " wrote der standard from vienna .
" the european commission is supposed to ensure competition .
how the market shares then develop should be left to the consumers and the companies . " der bund in bern commented that " it 's problematic that the case took so long and may not even be closed yet .
while highly paid lawyers on both sides are having it out , technology is developing at a rapid pace . " despite the newest regulations from luxembourg , it will be difficult in the next case to find a balance between consumers ' interest in competition and the equally justifiable protection of a market-dominating company 's innovation and intellectual capital , " concluded the swiss paper . compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 18.09.2007 style and substance have german , french leaders at odds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putting on a brave face - merkel apparently is not crazy about this kissing as france 's president unveils a major welfare reform package tuesday , sept .
18 , franco-german relations are maneuvering a patch of rough water : personality clashes between leaders and policy differences are the problem . when former french president jacques chirac would come calling on chancellor angela merkel , she seemed charmed by his gallant style , old world sensibility and those light kisses on the hand that got so much media play .
but his successor 's habit of familiarly kissing and hugging the german leader at their meetings has left her cold , even annoyed , according to reports , and has not helped strengthen a relationship that is seen as pivotal within the european union . were it just a matter of where to place a kiss , the issue might be solved with the intervention of a protocol officer .
but the differences between the two leaders are ones of both style and substance , which make them more difficult to bridge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel received many a kiss on the hand from france 's former president jacques chirac last week , france 's government spokesman said sarkozy told his cabinet his latest talks with merkel had been " very frank " - diplomatic speak for heated .
it comes after a series of low-level spats , including disagreements over the independence of the european central bank , the future of nuclear power , sarkozy 's protectionist murmurings , and even his stealing the spotlight over the freeing of bulgarian medics long held by libya . according to observers in both france and germany , merkel is not amused .
the french le figaro newspaper said the chancellor was irritated by sarkozy 's " rough and ready " manner .
the german rheinische post daily called the relationship one in " deep crisis . " " there is real annoyance , although i would n't use the word ' crisis , " ' said henrik uterwedde , deputy director of the german-french institute in ludwigsburg in southwestern germany .
" but it 's not peanuts and it should ring alarm bells . " styles : day and night when sarkozy became president in may , it was thought he and merkel would be the perfect couple .
both come from parties on the right-hand side of the political spectrum , both have an interest in economic reform and getting an eu reform treaty back on track .
they were even born just six months apart .
but , on closer examination , the fact that they have not hit it off personally might not be surprising .
their styles could not be more different . angela merkel , a pastor 's daughter who grew up in east germany , is cautious and reserved .
she has a down-to-earth style that dispenses with all flash .
but she has succeeded in finding a way to communicate her positions - even to foreign leaders on controversial topics like human rights in china or russian democracy - in a low-key but effective manner .
she is the quintessential team player . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he likes the crowd 's adulation and ministers who know their place nicolas sarkozy is a near opposite of that .
brash and in constant movement , he has been called hyperactive by many .
comparisons to bonaparte have been frequent , given his dismissive behavior towards his cabinet and his apparent love for showmanship and the spotlight . " france 's government system is much more hierarchical than germany 's , " said uterwedde .
" under sarkozy , it is even more so . " sarkozy recently crashed a meeting of finance ministers in brussels and explained his country 's short-term economic strategy while france 's own finance minister christine lagarde " sat there like a schoolgirl , " according to uterwedde . when german finance minister peer steinbrück accusing the french president of " giving fiscal handouts to voters " instead of keeping his european budgetary promises , sarkozy became incensed . " how dare you speak to me in that tone , " sarkozy is said to have replied , and was later furious with merkel for not rapping her finance minister 's knuckles as he requested . l 'état , c 'est moi ? while observers say the franco-german situation has not reached the breaking point , sarkozy would be wise to calm his style and become more of a player on team eu , or he could risk alienating more than just angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is accused of taking credit for initiatives that were n't his own , such as the release of medics held by libya " sarkozy has to learn that france is not playing alone but is part of a team called europe , " said isabelle bourgeois , a researcher at cirac , a paris-based think tank that studies franco-german relations . as far as the symbolic relationship of the french and german leaders goes , the current situation is bad , she says , although she 's careful to add that on the economic level , the two countries are integrated more than ever .
so far , the merkel-sarkozy irritation has caused little serious collateral damage . but other key areas , such as reforms of european markets , the constitution and the euro require close , high-level franco-german cooperation .
the fact that the two leaders might have a difficult time being in the same room together could hinder european progress on those fronts . wider irritation just this weekend , tensions over economic policy between sarkozy and other european leaders burst into the open . the head of the german bundesbank , axel weber , called sarkozy 's understanding of economic realities " zero " in the wake of the french leader 's constant criticism of the european central bank .
jean-claude juncker , luxembourg 's prime minister , suggested the french leader focus on france 's own economic woes instead of constantly carping on the bank 's management of the euro . " on the eu stage , his showmanship will be forgiven once , " said uterwedde .
" but if he continues playing this role , he 'll have problems . he says sarkozy 's recent spats with eu leaders and his sometimes contrarian views are a combination of his wanting to score political points at home and his own personality . " i think the biggest danger for sarkozy is sarkozy himself , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

those five current permanent members - the world war ii victors - have veto power over security matters .

" the dalai lama is not simply a religious figure , he is a long-time political exile engaged in separatist activities , " said chinese spokeswoman jiang yu on tuesday , sept .
18 .
she added that china was against any contact with the dalai lama by any country 's officials . " we hope that germany will consider the higher interest of chinese-german relationships and not allow the dalai lama 's visit , " jiang yu said . but there has been no change to chancellor angela merkel 's agenda since the chinese request . china has consistently spoken out against politicians ' visits with the 72-year-old dalai lama , who has led a tibetan government-in-exile in india since 1959 .
his advocacy for greater autonomy for tibet has found great international response . the statement from the chinese government came in response to an announcement last week that merkel would meet with the dalai lama on sunday , sept .
23 in berlin .
it will be the nobel prize winner 's first visit to the chancellery , though he met with merkel in 2005 while she was opposition leader . chinese protests have n't been heard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch , right , has met with the dalai lama , despite chinese disapproval two of germany 's former foreign ministers , joschka fischer and klaus kinkel , have also brushed with chinese disapproval by meeting with the dalai lama - fischer in 2005 and kinkel in 1995 . also to the dismay of the chinese government , christian democrat roland koch , premier of the german state of hesse , has developed a friendship with the tibetan leader since their first meeting 20 years ago .
it was koch who brought the dalai lama and merkel together in 2005 , reported the online version of germany 's mass-circulation daily bild . german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said sunday 's meeting was part of a series of private visits between the chancellor and religious leaders . human rights in tibet , as well as german-chinese policy issues were likely to be topics of the discussions , wilhelm said .
he added that merkel also addressed the same issues with chinese leaders . " tibet is a human rights issue that we have brought up with china , " wilhelm said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the future , preparing an attack or receiving explicit training for a violent act will be punishable by up to 10 years in prison . the worldwide threat of terrorist attacks includes germany , according to the country 's justice minister brigitte zypries . " we can not exclude a terrorist attack in our country , " zypries told reporters in berlin on tuesday , sept .
18 .
" as regrettable as this realization is , it is unfortunately by no means new . " the justice ministry has therefore proposed new legislation , which would make the preparation of terrorist acts , as well as the instruction of such actions , a criminal offence .
if convicted , offenders would face up to 10 years in prison . existing anti-terrorist laws no longer timely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the men arrested in germany were planning bombs using hydrogen peroxide the proposal comes after authorities arrested three men earlier this month for planning massive terrorist attacks targeting us nationals in germany . the justice ministry has been reviewing germany 's criminal law over the past few months to determine whether loopholes existed .
the planned legislation would allow preparations ahead of terrorist attacks to be legally dealt with more systematically , zypries said . existing german laws against terrorism could not be applied to terrorist acts today , the ministry said .
laws introduced to battle the militant , left-wing red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- in the 1970s stipulated that a terrorist organization must have at least three members before its formation - or support of the organization - can be deemed illegal . but terrorist structures have changed since then , the ministry said . " as opposed to the raf , islamic offenders are often active without any firm connection to a hierarchically based group , " it said in a statement . yet the related danger was nonetheless " considerable " and therefore needed to be punishable by law , it said . only explicit training for a terrorist act will be a crime the first proposal to the new legislation stipulated that preparing a terrorist attack would be punishable by six months to 10 years in prison .
this included acquiring weapons , chemicals or other substances in order to commit a violent offense .
the proposal would also outlaw financing a terrorist attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries wants more legal means to fight terrorism this legislation would also cover , for example , a suspect charged with carrying out a bombing in germany who had previously traveled to a terrorist camp to receive explosives training , or a person who took flight training in order to hijack an aircraft . the ministry said , however , that the law would apply only to training with the specific intent to carry out a terrorist attack .
this means that attending a training camp in itself would not necessarily be a crime .
prosecutors said the three men arrested in germany on sept .
4 trained at camps in pakistan run by the islamic jihad union . the second proposal in the new legislation would criminalize publishing or acquiring instructions for attacks or bombs , for example , via the internet .
if the instructions were deemed to motivate others to commit attacks , the crime would carry a prison sentence of up to three years . zypries ' proposals will now be coordinated within the federal government .

an explosion at the nuclear power plant in 1986 caused one of the world 's most disastrous nuclear meltdowns . the french consortium novarka on monday entered an agreement with ukraine to construct a massive shield around chernobyl over the next four to five years .
the structure will seal the radioactive remnants on the site . the arch-shaped metal covering , measuring 105 meters -lrb- 345 feet -rrb- tall by 150 meters -lrb- 490 -rrb- long , should entirely enclose the existing sarcophagus .
it had been hastily constructed in the months following the april 26 , 1986 accident and has shown signs of leakage . meant to last a hundred years , the shield is to provide an environment suitable for the disassembly of the nuclear power plant within . " chernobyl will not exist anymore " by the end of the shell 's lifespan , said yves-thibault de silguy , chairmen of vinci , one of the french firms in the novarka consortium .
" the end goal of the shield is to allow for -lsb- chernobyl 's -rsb- dismantling . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " liquidators " were the first to enter the plant after it exploded in a second deal also signed monday , ukraine commissioned us-based nuclear specialist holtec international to build containers for radioactive fuel still on the site . " we are talking about a unique project for this planet , " said ukrainian president victor yushchenko .
" the danger linked to the site of the accident is not confined to ukraine 's borders . " in a statement , yushchenko called the multi-million dollar project " a great historic event . " greenpeace has qualms over shield environmentalists disagreed with the plans , however . " the biggest problem for us is stopping the flow of contaminated coolant into the environment , " tobias münchmeyer from greenpeace told dw-world.de. in his opinion , the planned metal dome was not the best use of funds , he said . the ukrainian government and the european bank for reconstruction and development -lrb- ebrd -rrb- have estimated that as much as 95 percent of the original radioactive material still exists within the reactors .
yet greenpeace said that most of the radioactivity was released at the time of the accident and in the following years . the environmental organization has also disputed the number of deaths directly related to the meltdown over two decades ago .
according to greenpeace estimates , 93,000 people have died or will die of cancer caused by the chernobyl accident .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , on the other hand , has counted only 4,000 deaths . shared financial burden the ebrd will primarily finance and oversee the sarcophagus project .
the bank will administer grants from 28 donor countries and the european union . nearly $ 2.5 billion have been committed to the project already , according to german news agency dpa .
the exact price of the project is still unclear . bildunterschrift : the chernobyl accident site is pictured here in 1996 click for a map of ukraine . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an explosion at the nuclear power plant in 1986 caused one of the world 's most disastrous nuclear meltdowns . the french consortium novarka on monday entered an agreement with ukraine to construct a massive shield around chernobyl over the next four to five years .
the structure will seal the radioactive remnants on the site . the arch-shaped metal covering , measuring 105 meters -lrb- 345 feet -rrb- tall by 150 meters -lrb- 490 -rrb- long , should entirely enclose the existing sarcophagus .
it had been hastily constructed in the months following the april 26 , 1986 accident and has shown signs of leakage . meant to last a hundred years , the shield is to provide an environment suitable for the disassembly of the nuclear power plant within . " chernobyl will not exist anymore " by the end of the shell 's lifespan , said yves-thibault de silguy , chairmen of vinci , one of the french firms in the novarka consortium .

" the biggest problem for us is stopping the flow of contaminated coolant into the environment , " tobias münchmeyer from greenpeace told dw-world.de. in his opinion , the planned metal dome was not the best use of funds , he said . the ukrainian government and the european bank for reconstruction and development -lrb- ebrd -rrb- have estimated that as much as 95 percent of the original radioactive material still exists within the reactors .
yet greenpeace said that most of the radioactivity was released at the time of the accident and in the following years . the environmental organization has also disputed the number of deaths directly related to the meltdown over two decades ago .
according to greenpeace estimates , 93,000 people have died or will die of cancer caused by the chernobyl accident .

the man spent seven weeks in the intensive care unit with no sign of improvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany draws the line at embryonic stem cell research stauer decided to apply stem cell therapy on the patient .
following nine days of treatment , the man had improved enough that he could leave intensive care and be moved to a rehabilitation center . the therapy involved extracting adult stem cells from the patient 's bone marrow and then inserting them , with the help of a balloon catheter , into the artery damaged by the infarction . the procedure took about a half hour . stauer called it a " global innovation " in that cardiogenic shock - inadequate delivery of oxygen to the heart tissues - could be treated with stem cell therapy for the first time ever . embryonic stem cell research banned in germany such stem cell therapy , however , has enlivened the debate on embryonic stem cell research . recently , the german government said it would allocate five million euros -lrb- $ 6.9 million -rrb- over the next three years for non-embryonic stem cell research . stem cells can develop into different cell types , including those for bones , blood and the brain .
specialists say they can help in treating illnesses such as parkinson 's , and can help to regenerate damaged organs or tissue . researchers say embryonic stem cells - cells taken from days-old human embryos - are the most promising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minor heart attacks often go unnoticed however , genetic research is highly contested in germany due to its nazi history of experimentation to create a " master race . " since 2002 , the production of embryonic cells from pre-existing stem cell lines is prohibited in germany .
scientists are also not permitted to research on any lines produced after jan .
1 , 2002 to ensure that foreign laboratories do not create new lines for the german market . critics have said that such prohibitions put german scientists at a disadvantage . critics of embryonic stem cell research , however , say that progress with adult stem cell treatment , such as with the cardiac patient in düsseldorf , nullifies the need for cells derived from human embryos . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , that wealthy nations are spending far more money on education than they did 12 years ago .
however , in its annual " education at a glance survey " presented in berlin , the organization also said that inefficient use of resources is impeding efforts to improve standards . oecd said that if current resources were employed more efficiently , learning levels could increase by 22 percent . " countries are collectively spending more than they ever have on education , " the oecd said .
" but the results gained from that investment are far from maximized . " the paris-based organization represents 30 industrialized countries .
it said that between 1995 and 2004 , spending on education had risen by an average of 42 percent , with more people than ever receiving secondary school and university degrees . more than half of high school students go on to college bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he attend university ?
" on average more than half of school-leavers are entering university-level education at some stage in their life , " oecd secretary general angel gurria said at tuesday 's press conference .
" the most striking thing is the astounding speed at which the education system continues to expand . " forty years ago , the number of university entrants stood at one in 10 pupils . according to the oecd web site , more than 40 percent of young people in countries such as denmark , australia , italy , the netherlands and poland complete university courses .
the organization noted , however , that graduation rates tended to be " highest in countries where programs are of short duration . " germany 's longer study programs hinder completion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's courses of study are longer than elsewhere " by contrast , in germany and austria , where programs are longer , only 20 percent of young people get degrees , " the oecd noted . the organization said that its findings confirmed that people who obtain an education from the upper-secondary level upwards earn considerably more than those with lesser degrees . the report also noted a significant historical change : female students are now more likely to complete secondary education than their male peers . in terms of graduation from education up to the age of 18 , female students exceed boys in all countries surveyed , with the exception of south korea , switzerland and turkey . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government said it expected farmers to grow 15.5m tons of wheat , a 30 % reduction from its previous forecast .
the news will put further pressure on the global price of wheat , which is already at record highs .
the problems have been compounded by crop failures in the northern hemisphere and an increase in demand from developing countries .
australia is normally second only to america in the amount of wheat it exports .
so when farmers harvest less than they expect it has a knock-on effect around the world , prompting things like food protests over the price of pasta in italy .
global shortage after one of the best starts to a growing season for years , dry weather in recent weeks has forced the australian government to slash its crop forecasts .
it said the amount of wheat harvested would be 30 % lower than it originally predicted .
even that might prove an optimistic assessment with farmers warning that if there is not heavy rain over the next few weeks , their crops will be even more meagre .
up until now , september 's rainfall has been below average and adverse weather has already reduced harvests in europe and north america .
international wheat prices have risen by over 350 % in the past five years , with global reserves now at their lowest level since the early 1980s .
at a time of shortened supply , the world is also experiencing an increase in demand .
eating habits are changing in emerging countries like china with improved diets and a greater preference for meat , which drives up the demand for feed for livestock .
the growing popularity of biofuels which can be made from wheat has added to the pressure on prices .
cars are now competing with cattle and consumers for access to these dwindling crops .

the government said it expected farmers to grow 15.5m tons of wheat , a 30 % reduction from its previous forecast .
the news will put further pressure on the global price of wheat , which is already at record highs .
the problems have been compounded by crop failures in the northern hemisphere and an increase in demand from developing countries .
australia is normally second only to america in the amount of wheat it exports .
so when farmers harvest less than they expect it has a knock-on effect around the world , prompting things like food protests over the price of pasta in italy .
global shortage after one of the best starts to a growing season for years , dry weather in recent weeks has forced the australian government to slash its crop forecasts .
it said the amount of wheat harvested would be 30 % lower than it originally predicted .
even that might prove an optimistic assessment with farmers warning that if there is not heavy rain over the next few weeks , their crops will be even more meagre .
up until now , september 's rainfall has been below average and adverse weather has already reduced harvests in europe and north america .
international wheat prices have risen by over 350 % in the past five years , with global reserves now at their lowest level since the early 1980s .
at a time of shortened supply , the world is also experiencing an increase in demand .
eating habits are changing in emerging countries like china with improved diets and a greater preference for meat , which drives up the demand for feed for livestock .
the growing popularity of biofuels which can be made from wheat has added to the pressure on prices .
cars are now competing with cattle and consumers for access to these dwindling crops .

the two sides broke off talks in detroit on monday evening and will resume later on tuesday .
gm 's 73,000 uaw employees worked as usual on monday , despite their contract having expired on friday night .
the talks are important because the uaw 's contracts with ford and chrysler will be based on the gm agreement .
the three detroit-based carmakers are trying to cut costs as they attempt to recover from combined losses of $ 15bn -lrb- £ 7.5bn -rrb- last year .
competitiveness gm , ford and chrysler say that their workers , on average , cost them more than $ 30 an hour more than toyota 's .
they want staff to give up some of their expensive benefits such as pensions and health insurance to improve their overall competitiveness .
any tentative agreement between gm and the uaw will have to be ratified by a majority of gm 's 73,000 hourly workers .
if no agreement can be reached , union leaders might tell their members to walk out , but they are seen as more likely to set a deadline for strike action some time in the future .

the company said that it is keen to ensure that blind people are not excluded from an environment that sighted people will take for granted .
the students have designed an audio equivalent of the virtual world using 3d sound to create a sense of space .
they were working as part of the company 's extreme blue research initiative which brings groups of students together for 12 weeks to solve problem set by senior researchers .
the project - called accessibility in virtual worlds - is what the company describes as " a proof of concept " at this stage , but it will be passed on to ibm 's human ability and accessibility centre in texas for further development .
for their work the irish team decided to use the active worlds online environment rather than the more popular second life -lrb- which has almost 9.5m accounts -rrb- because it allowed them more flexibility .
active worlds is a collection of user-made virtual worlds that people can visit via a web browser plug-in .
like many other virtual spaces they let people make many of the artefacts , including buildings , found in them .
audible cues the research team exploited this ability to tinker with objects in the online world to make it more hospitable to the blind .
" when the user comes into the world , the items are described as well as their positions , " explained colm o 'brien , one of the team of four researchers who worked on the project .
" there is also sound attached - for example , if there 's a tree nearby you will hear a rustling of leaves , " said mr o 'brien .
the work also developed tools which uses text to speech software that reads out any chat from fellow avatars in the virtual world that appears in a text box .
characters in the virtual world can have a " sonar " attached to them so that the user gets audible cues to alert them to when they are approaching , from which direction and how near they are .
a number of blind mentors have given advice and feedback to the team - one in ibm 's dublin lab and two based at ibm 's research centre in texas .
the students have also liaised with the national council for the blind of ireland on their work .
as well as proving that the idea is feasible , the team has made a number of recommendations about accessibility standards for virtual worlds which should help the developers of the future .

some estimates predict that 80 % of active internet users will be using a virtual world in four years ' time .
the company said that it is keen to ensure that blind people are not excluded from an environment that sighted people will take for granted .
the students have designed an audio equivalent of the virtual world using 3d sound to create a sense of space .
they were working as part of the company 's extreme blue research initiative which brings groups of students together for 12 weeks to solve problem set by senior researchers .
the project - called accessibility in virtual worlds - is what the company describes as " a proof of concept " at this stage , but it will be passed on to ibm 's human ability and accessibility centre in texas for further development .
for their work the irish team decided to use the active worlds online environment rather than the more popular second life -lrb- which has almost 9.5m accounts -rrb- because it allowed them more flexibility .
active worlds is a collection of user-made virtual worlds that people can visit via a web browser plug-in .
like many other virtual spaces they let people make many of the artefacts , including buildings , found in them .
audible cues the research team exploited this ability to tinker with objects in the online world to make it more hospitable to the blind .
" when the user comes into the world , the items are described as well as their positions , " explained colm o 'brien , one of the team of four researchers who worked on the project .
" there is also sound attached - for example , if there 's a tree nearby you will hear a rustling of leaves , " said mr o 'brien .
the work also developed tools which uses text to speech software that reads out any chat from fellow avatars in the virtual world that appears in a text box .
characters in the virtual world can have a " sonar " attached to them so that the user gets audible cues to alert them to when they are approaching , from which direction and how near they are .
a number of blind mentors have given advice and feedback to the team - one in ibm 's dublin lab and two based at ibm 's research centre in texas .
the students have also liaised with the national council for the blind of ireland on their work .
as well as proving that the idea is feasible , the team has made a number of recommendations about accessibility standards for virtual worlds which should help the developers of the future .

the foreign ministry in pyongyang called the claims an " unskilful conspiracy " and " groundless " .
there were allegations last week that syria was holding technology or materials relating to north korea 's nuclear programme .
this follows reports that israeli jets entered syrian air space earlier this month and hit an unknown target .
" recently some us media including the new york times have been spreading allegations that we are secretly helping syria with its nuclear programme .
such reports are groundless and misleading , " a ministry spokesman said .
he also dismissed reports that north korea could be helping syria build a nuclear weapons facility .
" we , as a responsible nuclear power , already declared in october 2006 that we will never allow the transfer of nuclear materials , and we have been sticking to this declaration , " the spokesman said in a statement published by the official korean central news agency .
the suspicions were " nothing but an unskilful conspiracy " fabricated again by " impure forces " who do not want to see " progress in six-party talks and in relations between washington and pyongyang " , the spokesman added .
no comment syria has formally complained to the united nations about the alleged raid by israeli aircraft over its territory .
israel has repeatedly refused to comment on the alleged raid .
there has been speculation over what the likely targets of the israeli raid may have been .
one , cited by the new york times newspaper quoting a us source , suggests that the attack was in some way linked to north korea .
the former us ambassador to the un , john bolton , in a recent article in the wall street journal , raised the possibility that syria was sheltering technology or materials relating to north korea 's nuclear programme .
another suggestion is that maybe a missile store or factory with weaponry heading to hezbollah in lebanon was hit , says bbc diplomatic correspondent jonathan marcus .
israel has long complained the damascus government is at the very least turning a blind eye to such weapons supplies coming from iran , our correspondent adds .
syria and israel remain technically in a state of war .
peace talks broke down in 2000 over the fate of the golan heights , the strategic plateau captured by israel during the 1967 middle east war .

the foreign ministry in pyongyang called the claims an " unskilful conspiracy " and " groundless " .
there were allegations last week that syria was holding technology or materials relating to north korea 's nuclear programme .
this follows reports that israeli jets entered syrian air space earlier this month and hit an unknown target .
" recently some us media including the new york times have been spreading allegations that we are secretly helping syria with its nuclear programme .
such reports are groundless and misleading , " a ministry spokesman said .
he also dismissed reports that north korea could be helping syria build a nuclear weapons facility .
" we , as a responsible nuclear power , already declared in october 2006 that we will never allow the transfer of nuclear materials , and we have been sticking to this declaration , " the spokesman said in a statement published by the official korean central news agency .
the suspicions were " nothing but an unskilful conspiracy " fabricated again by " impure forces " who do not want to see " progress in six-party talks and in relations between washington and pyongyang " , the spokesman added .
no comment syria has formally complained to the united nations about the alleged raid by israeli aircraft over its territory .
israel has repeatedly refused to comment on the alleged raid .
there has been speculation over what the likely targets of the israeli raid may have been .
one , cited by the new york times newspaper quoting a us source , suggests that the attack was in some way linked to north korea .
the former us ambassador to the un , john bolton , in a recent article in the wall street journal , raised the possibility that syria was sheltering technology or materials relating to north korea 's nuclear programme .
another suggestion is that maybe a missile store or factory with weaponry heading to hezbollah in lebanon was hit , says bbc diplomatic correspondent jonathan marcus .
israel has long complained the damascus government is at the very least turning a blind eye to such weapons supplies coming from iran , our correspondent adds .
syria and israel remain technically in a state of war .
peace talks broke down in 2000 over the fate of the golan heights , the strategic plateau captured by israel during the 1967 middle east war .
