but it 's no easy task as violence , drugs and poverty remain even as the country has entered a relatively peaceful time . cartagena , its graceful city center hugging the caribbean coast , is a colonial-era jewel encircled by modern day poverty and persistent violence .
home to more than 1 million people , the city illustrates the complex situation faced by colombia as it tries to return to normalcy after decades of armed conflict . the united nations world tourism organization met in cartagena this week and colombia officials were eager to change perceptions of the country .
colombian president alvaro uribe , whose law-and-order policies have brought some stability to the country , bore the message that his country was ready for european and american tourists to arrive and open their wallets . " you are visiting a country that has suffered greatly , but has a tremendous amount of hope , " he said . real world problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cartagena 's historic city center is a unesco world heritage site but even as delegates met , the reality of life outside cartagena 's heavily-guarded convention center seeped in and painted a bleak picture of life with few public services and no police protection . between 2 million and 3 million colombians have fled their homes to escape ongoing paramilitary hostilities and are living in extreme poverty in the suburbs of cities such as cartagena .
newspapers also regularly carry reports of murders and other drug-related violence . uribe said he knows it 's news like this which has kept the number of europeans who visit colombia each year small : about 125,700 arrived in the first nine months of 2007 .
most came from former colonial power spain . " terrorism puts a stop to all our possibilities , " he said referring to fighting between left-wing guerillas , right-wing paramilitaries , the military and drug lords .
" without terrorism , we 'll have tourism .
without terrorism , we 'll be happy . " some positives , many problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the growing economy has led to a building boom in cartagena the colombian government points to statistics which show that in recent years the murder rate has been cut in half and kidnappings are down 75 percent .
the country is also experiencing an economic boom officials hope will help bring in tourist dollars and help meet an ambitious goal of attracting 4 million foreign tourists to the country by 2010 . the economy had 6.8 percent growth in 2006 and is headed for 7.48 percent this year .
in cartagena , luxury hotels are springing up and it 's become a routine stop on the caribbean cruise circuit . but even as the tourist industry proclaims its slogan , " colombia , the only risk is wanting to stay , " and luxury hotels spring up along the country 's beaches and growth heads to 7.48 percent this year , the government acknowledges that parts of the country are not safe for visitors . eu aid a lifeline to locals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cartagena looks very different from outside the convention center while the colombian government said that eventually tourism will improve people 's lives , it will remain dependent on international development aid . the european union will provide 160 million euros -lrb- $ 216 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to colombia between 2007-2013 .
but unlike the united states , which focuses on giving money to fight colombia 's illicit drug trade , the eu will direct aid directly to victims and non-governmental organizations which help them . european donors are a lifeline for many local aid organizations in the country , but money - from both tourism and the government - does n't always appear as promised , said maria amparo gomez , a dominican nun who runs a school in cartagena . " there are two cartagenas that are very well separated from each other , " she said . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 30.11.2007 eu agrees on galileo contract award scheme großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only one test satellite has gone up in orbit with 1 billion euros in taxpayer money after agreeing to pay for galileo entirely from public funds , eu transport ministers decided how contracts for the satellite navigation system would be parceled out to european companies . european union ministers reached an agreement on friday , nov .
30 , on how the work for the long-delayed satellite navigation project galileo would be divided up among the 27 member countries . at an eu meeting of the bloc 's transport ministers , spain , which had made demands to host a ground station for a network of some 30 satellites , first dissented , but later agreed . under the current deal , the galileo program , which is budgeted at 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- and intended to reduce the eu 's reliance on the us global position system -lrb- gps -rrb- , plans to install only two ground control stations : one near munich and one in rome . no money for third ground station bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo should be fully operable by 2013 , barrot said " we just do n't have the money for a third ground station , " an unidentified eu diplomat told the associated press .
dominique bussereau , france 's deputy transport minister , however , suggested to the ap that spain ought to be awarded a galileo test center . under the compromise reached friday , spain 's " safety of life " center could " evolve into a fully qualified " control center by 2013 , allowing madrid to supervise operation of the satellites and their transmissions to earth .
" the spanish center , once it is up and running from a technical point of view , would act as a control center along with the others " in germany and italy , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot explained .
after a consortium of private companies abandoned galileo earlier this year due to a financing dispute , the european commission agreed last friday to fund the entire program , with most of the additional 2.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- in funding coming from leftover agricultural funds and the rest from research , transport and administration budgets .
germany wants its fair share of galileo projects as the biggest contributor to the eu budget , germany wants astrium , a german-dominated subsidiary of the european aerospace giant eads , to have a proportionate share of galileo contracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite images can pinpoint the precise location of iranian nuclear sites - or anywhere else the main issue hacked out by the transport ministers was how to slice the galileo pie among european companies .
while competition rules would normally dictate that contracts be awarded on a best-offer basis , the european space industry is concentrated into a few main groups which have demanded a higher share of the lucrative business . the agreement , however , does not allow a single company to obtain an inordinately large portion of the project 's contracts . " galileo will become the spearhead for european technology , " barrot told reporters .
" we are on the way towards putting galileo into operation for 2013 and to offer europeans very many services . " the galileo project has been plagued by delays and is already running five years behind schedule with only one test satellite up in orbit .
at least 1 billion euros of taxpayer money have already been spent . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 , a voice thought to belong to al qaeda chief osama bin laden called on europeans to pull out of afghanistan , where they are standing in the shadow of the white house . " according to a recording aired on thursday by qatar-based al jazeera television , osama bin laden purportedly warned europe to end its participation in the nato and us-led missions there . he said his message was addressed to the european people and not the politicians , who he accused of " standing in the shadow of the white house " and of being forced to participate in the us-led " war on terror . " " the american tide is receding and they would eventually return to their home across the atlantic , " he said .
" it is in your interest to force the hand of your politicians -lsb- away from -rsb- the white house . " europe went along with it because they had no other alternative except to be followers , " he added . bin laden said taliban did n't plan 9/11 in addition , bin laden said the taliban knew nothing about the sept .

america knows that , " he said .
" i am the only one responsible . " in his latest recorded message , the al qaeda leader accused the foreign troops of acting unethically in afghanistan by targeting women and children .
it also warned that " the american tide was ebbing " and that us troops would soon leave the country , leaving afghanistan 's neighbors to " settle scores . " no immediate threat , says us a us official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said that the tape likely came from bin laden , though no initial confirmation had been issued . " the statement does not appear to contain any specific or credible threats , but it will be analyzed , " the official said . us state department spokesman sean mccormack said attempts to drive a wedge between the us and its allies was " not a new tactic " of terrorists and added that europe continues to make a strong commitment to development in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bin laden accused western forces of targeting women and children in afghanistan the us has encouraged its european allies to send even more troops to afghanistan , while lawmakers in europe , influenced by public opinion , have been hesitant to expand their military commitment . afghanistan dismissed the terror leader 's call for europe to break ranks with the us . " security in afghanistan means security in europe and is an international responsibility , " afghan foreign ministry spokesman sultan ahmad baheen told the afp news agency .
" we think this is an international responsibility for afghanistan and their own countries .
nothing will deter the international unity on the war on terror . " earlier this month , the german government decided to extend its afghan mission by one year , upping the maximum number of available troops from 3,000 to 3,500 .
the dutch government on friday was also expected to prolong the mandate for its 1,650 troops in afghanistan . france has sent about 1,000 soldiers , while britain is set to increase its involvement to 7,700 troops by the end of the year . bin laden still at large despite a $ 25 million -lrb- 17 million euro -rrb- bounty on his head , bin laden have managed to elude capture . since 2001 , he has sent some 50 audio and video messages , all broadcast by al jazeera television . in his last message on oct .

in the bundesliga , simunic has been playing for berlin since 2000 .
his teammates call him “ joe . ” dw-tv : now you 've been in berlin since 2000 - what 's it like living here on the other side of the world ?
josip simunic : it 's different .
the longer i 'm away from australia , the more i see how much australia is a beautiful country , probably the best country in the world .
the people here are very different to australia .
in australia the people are more friendly .
here also , but not to the extent that they are in australia .
when you think back to the last round of the bundesliga we saw ivan klasnic come back , one of your countrymen .
what emotions did that bring ?
i just got goosebumps now .
i 'm happy for ivan .
i hope he stays healthy , i hope that he has no more problems with his kidneys or anything else .
he 's a great example to show that when someone really wants to achieve something , they can achieve it .
like i said , i hope he stays healthy and scores a lot of goals for werder bremen .
you said at the start when you first came here that you were here to win the german championship .
that success has n't come in the last 7 years - why has n't it happened ?
in the past we 've had very good teams , but there were better teams than us .
you have to play 34 games in a season .
i think we had too many games where we were up there , we needed the win , but because of the added pressure , we did n't put in a good performance and get the result .
we also have the problem that a lot of players come and then they get better offers from other clubs , more money .
that 's also a problem , when you get offered three times as much to play in england .
football is not only about money but you have to try and situate yourself quickly .
to be too aggressive is sometimes not good for the team .
you have to pick the right moment where you are going to be aggressive in the interests of the team , in order to show the younger players in the team that they should get involved .
that takes also a little bit of time .
the body language is also important .
i 'm getting more used to it and learning when to make the right challenge at the right time .
at the moment , it seems sometimes the aggression goes too far ?
would you agree with that ?
i agree with that .
sometimes it does go too far .
but i have to say : the refereeing in germany is a bit soft .
when i compare it - i watch a lot of english games - it 's a big , big difference .
when i see how people go in to challenges in england .
here in germany , it 's a very big difference - unfortunately .
with the success that you gained in the bundesliga you then became a member of the croatian national team .
what was it like winning against england in london last week ?
it was a great feeling .
how can i explain it to you ?
in the world cup against australia , when we did n't make it through , it was a very , very drained feeling .
against england , to win at wembley , was the total opposite .
it was probably the nicest feeling i have had in my life , when it comes to football .
these sorts of moments , in the headlines in europe , is this the reason why you opted to play for croatia and not the country of your birth , australia ?
i 'm a proud australian .
but i also know where i come from , my heritage , my background .
and i 'm very proud of that .
i feel more croatian than australian .
another reason is the long flight to australia for games - that 's also a very big problem .
we have that problem now with some of our brazilian players .
what are your plans for 2008 ?
how do you see it going for you ?
always when someone asks me what my plans are , the most important plan is to stay healthy .
football wise : the biggest thing is to try to get in to the top half of the table for hertha bsc and to become european champions for croatia .
thanks very much for your time .
thank you , thanks .
are you living in berlin ?

but i also know where i come from , my heritage , my background .
and i 'm very proud of that .
i feel more croatian than australian .
another reason is the long flight to australia for games - that 's also a very big problem .
we have that problem now with some of our brazilian players .
what are your plans for 2008 ?
how do you see it going for you ?
always when someone asks me what my plans are , the most important plan is to stay healthy .
football wise : the biggest thing is to try to get in to the top half of the table for hertha bsc and to become european champions for croatia .
thanks very much for your time .
thank you , thanks .

he will be succeeding the 79-year-old archbishop friedrich wetter , who retired last february due to his advanced age , but has stayed in office until his replacement takes over .
the munich archdiocese numbers around 2 million catholics and is considered one of the most important one in germany .
pope benedict xvi was himself the archbishop of munich before moving to rome to head the congregation for the doctrine of the faith in 1981 .
bavarian premier günther beckstein , who is a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - sister party to angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- - welcomed marx ' appointment and described him as a " highly convincing and principled man of the cloth who is , at the same time , eager to debate and humorous .

"
marx ' main idea was " that people are there for the intuition of the church , and not the other way around , " hasenhüttl told the saarländischer rundfunk radio .

" let us put it very simply : man needs god , otherwise he remains without hope , " benedict wrote in the 70-page document , entitled in latin " spe salvi facti sumus " -lrb- in hope we are saved -rrb- .

marxism , the pope wrote , had left behind " a trail of appalling destruction " because it failed to realize that man could not be " merely the product of economic conditions . "

30 , overwhelmingly approved the federal budget of 283.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 417.4 billion -rrb- for 2008 , an increase of 4 percent from 2007 . lawmakers voted 408-144 in favor of the budget , which has provided for a slight increase in outlays for defense and economic assistance . defense spending will go up to 29.45 billion euros , up from 28.39 billion in 2007 .
the ministry for economic assistance , which is responsible for the distribution of germany 's overseas development aid , sees its share of the budget go up to 5.13 billion euros , an increase from 4.5 billion euros last year . the biggest slice , accounting for about 30 percent of the overall budget , has been earmarked for labor and social affairs . weak dollar blamed for slowdown in euro zone exports during the final day of the four-day debate , german economics minister michael glos appealed to the united states to slow down the dollar 's slide as european exporters come under growing exchange-rate pressure . glos said washington should not try to fix structural problems in the us economy by devaluing the dollar . " if the resulting economic boom is not underpinned by structural adjustment in the us economy itself , but is achieved purely as the result of a weak currency , then the americans have gotten a bad deal , " he said . huge deficit spending has led to a free fall of the dollar , pushing the value of the euro to higher levels and was partly responsible for setting off turmoil in the world financial markets . earlier , german finance minister peer steinbrück said he did not expect the german economy to suffer too much from the current credit squeeze triggered by the us mortgage crisis . eu exports elsewhere to offset slack in us he told the financial times newspaper that he expected the german economy to perform well next year even if were to grow at a slower pace than 2007 . steinbrück said domestic demand was picking up and exports would remain brisk , with demand from russia , eastern europe and asia offsetting a slowdown in us imports from the euro zone . referring to the strength of the euro against the dollar , he acknowledged that it would have an effect on germany , but said the stronger currency would curb the impact of higher oil prices , since crude is dollar-based . " for us europeans , we prefer a stronger euro to a weak one , " he told the financial daily . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's making the cracks in the german coalition government increasingly visible . the premier of the central german state of hesse , roland koch , on friday , nov .
30 , accused german foreign minister and vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier of pursuing a harmful foreign policy that is based solely on economic interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse premier roland koch has spared no words in lashing out at the foreign minister " germany has a historical obligation not to keep quiet about moral questions , " roland koch told the bild newspaper .
" we have no right to put economics above human rights . "
koch , who is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , passed judgment on steinmeier , a social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- , for " creating the impression in russia and china that we germans are ready to do any kind of business , even when human rights are being trampled on . "
" in doing so , the foreign minister is harming our country , " koch said .
the unusually strong rhetoric from the cdu politician is not only a sign of the strained relations in the grand coalition , but an indicator that foreign policy may play an important role in the campaigns leading up to the 2009 elections .
the right way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spd foreign policy expert rolf mützenich dismissed the criticism directed at the foreign minister .
" we advocate the anchoring of human rights in the international law , " mützenich told the dpa news agency .
the spd politician pointed out that china signed the most important human rights conventions and proved itself to be a responsible partner in the nuclear row with iran and north korea .
" those are the points of reference for a moral foreign policy , " he said .
during a visit to paris earlier in november , steinmeier told journalists he was " worried " about the escalating diplomatic tension between germany and china in the wake of the dalai lama 's visit with merkel .
in september , the chancellor met with the tibetan spiritual leader , whom chinese officials see as a dangerous separatist .
consequently , china axed a series of high level exchanges with germany , including a trip to beijing by finance minister peer steinbrück , planned for december .
the russian question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama has had a chilling effect on the relations with beijing china , however , is not the only foreign-policy wedge between the coalition partners .
german-russian relations were much more cordial during the previous german government , boosted by the flaunting camaraderie between the then chancellor , gerhard schröder , and russian president vladimir putin .
in a speech delivered in stuttgart on thursday , schröder - who was himself often criticized for turning a blind eye to putin 's human rights record , lashed out at germany 's foreign policy by saying he had the impression he was back " in the cold war era . "
some politicians were promoting a " distancing , even opposition to russia , " the former leader of the social democratic party said .
" i regard this approach as wrong , if not even dangerous , " he added .
less than a month after leaving the chancellor 's office in november 2005 , schröder was voted in as head of the supervisory board for a company that 's closely linked to the state-owned russian energy giant gazprom .
this move was seen by many in germany as ethically questionable if not complete unacceptable .
pursuing an ethical foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-russian relations were much closer under gerhard schröder merkel , on the other hand , said in a speech to the german parliament on wednesday that there was no difference between a foreign policy based on values and one pursuing german economic interests .
" human rights policy and representation of economic interests are two sides of the same coin , " merkel said .
" they should never be opposed to each another . "
merkel will get to test her diplomatic skills and her role as a champion of human rights at a summit between leaders of the european union and african states that is taking place in the portuguese capital of lisbon from dec .
7 - 9 .
the summit will also be attended by zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe , a dictator whose controversial policies of seizing white-owned commercial farms and threats to nationalize foreign-owned firms make him an uncomfortable politician to deal with in the eu .
unlike british prime minister gordon brown , who decided not to attend the summit because of the presence of the zimbabwean head of state , merkel declined to back calls for mugabe to be barred from the summit . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" -lrb- 28.11.2007 -rrb- merkel 's government shows the strain at halfway mark nov .

in the bundesliga , simunic has been playing for berlin since 2000 .
his teammates call him “ joe . ” dw-tv : now you 've been in berlin since 2000 - what 's it like living here on the other side of the world ?
josip simunic : it 's different .
the longer i 'm away from australia , the more i see how much australia is a beautiful country , probably the best country in the world .
the people here are very different to australia .
in australia the people are more friendly .
here also , but not to the extent that they are in australia .
when you think back to the last round of the bundesliga we saw ivan klasnic come back , one of your countrymen .
what emotions did that bring ?
i just got goosebumps now .
i 'm happy for ivan .
i hope he stays healthy , i hope that he has no more problems with his kidneys or anything else .
he 's a great example to show that when someone really wants to achieve something , they can achieve it .
like i said , i hope he stays healthy and scores a lot of goals for werder bremen .
you said at the start when you first came here that you were here to win the german championship .
that success has n't come in the last 7 years - why has n't it happened ?
in the past we 've had very good teams , but there were better teams than us .
you have to play 34 games in a season .
i think we had too many games where we were up there , we needed the win , but because of the added pressure , we did n't put in a good performance and get the result .
we also have the problem that a lot of players come and then they get better offers from other clubs , more money .
that 's also a problem , when you get offered three times as much to play in england .
football is not only about money but you have to try and situate yourself quickly .
to be too aggressive is sometimes not good for the team .
you have to pick the right moment where you are going to be aggressive in the interests of the team , in order to show the younger players in the team that they should get involved .
that takes also a little bit of time .
the body language is also important .
i 'm getting more used to it and learning when to make the right challenge at the right time .
at the moment , it seems sometimes the aggression goes too far ?
would you agree with that ?
i agree with that .
sometimes it does go too far .
but i have to say : the refereeing in germany is a bit soft .
when i compare it - i watch a lot of english games - it 's a big , big difference .
when i see how people go in to challenges in england .
here in germany , it 's a very big difference - unfortunately .
with the success that you gained in the bundesliga you then became a member of the croatian national team .
what was it like winning against england in london last week ?
it was a great feeling .
how can i explain it to you ?
in the world cup against australia , when we did n't make it through , it was a very , very drained feeling .
against england , to win at wembley , was the total opposite .
it was probably the nicest feeling i have had in my life , when it comes to football .
these sorts of moments , in the headlines in europe , is this the reason why you opted to play for croatia and not the country of your birth , australia ?
i 'm a proud australian .
but i also know where i come from , my heritage , my background .
and i 'm very proud of that .
i feel more croatian than australian .
another reason is the long flight to australia for games - that 's also a very big problem .
we have that problem now with some of our brazilian players .
what are your plans for 2008 ?
how do you see it going for you ?
always when someone asks me what my plans are , the most important plan is to stay healthy .
football wise : the biggest thing is to try to get in to the top half of the table for hertha bsc and to become european champions for croatia .
thanks very much for your time .
thank you , thanks .
are you living in berlin ?
i am living in berlin .
how long have you been here for ?
for two and a half years .
do you like berlin ?
yeah , i like berlin , otherwise i would n't hold out the temperatures . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 , on how the work for the long-delayed satellite navigation project galileo would be divided up among the 27 member countries . at an eu meeting of the bloc 's transport ministers , spain , which had made demands to host a ground station for a network of some 30 satellites , first dissented , but later agreed . under the current deal , the galileo program , which is budgeted at 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- and intended to reduce the eu 's reliance on the us global position system -lrb- gps -rrb- , plans to install only two ground control stations : one near munich and one in rome . no money for third ground station bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo should be fully operable by 2013 , barrot said " we just do n't have the money for a third ground station , " an unidentified eu diplomat told the associated press .
dominique bussereau , france 's deputy transport minister , however , suggested to the ap that spain ought to be awarded a galileo test center . under the compromise reached friday , spain 's " safety of life " center could " evolve into a fully qualified " control center by 2013 , allowing madrid to supervise operation of the satellites and their transmissions to earth .
" the spanish center , once it is up and running from a technical point of view , would act as a control center along with the others " in germany and italy , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot explained .
after a consortium of private companies abandoned galileo earlier this year due to a financing dispute , the european commission agreed last friday to fund the entire program , with most of the additional 2.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- in funding coming from leftover agricultural funds and the rest from research , transport and administration budgets .
germany wants its fair share of galileo projects as the biggest contributor to the eu budget , germany wants astrium , a german-dominated subsidiary of the european aerospace giant eads , to have a proportionate share of galileo contracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite images can pinpoint the precise location of iranian nuclear sites - or anywhere else the main issue hacked out by the transport ministers was how to slice the galileo pie among european companies .
while competition rules would normally dictate that contracts be awarded on a best-offer basis , the european space industry is concentrated into a few main groups which have demanded a higher share of the lucrative business . the agreement , however , does not allow a single company to obtain an inordinately large portion of the project 's contracts . " galileo will become the spearhead for european technology , " barrot told reporters .
" we are on the way towards putting galileo into operation for 2013 and to offer europeans very many services . " the galileo project has been plagued by delays and is already running five years behind schedule with only one test satellite up in orbit .

30 , on how the work for the long-delayed satellite navigation project galileo would be divided up among the 27 member countries . at an eu meeting of the bloc 's transport ministers , spain , which had made demands to host a ground station for a network of some 30 satellites , first dissented , but later agreed . under the current deal , the galileo program , which is budgeted at 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- and intended to reduce the eu 's reliance on the us global position system -lrb- gps -rrb- , plans to install only two ground control stations : one near munich and one in rome . no money for third ground station bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo should be fully operable by 2013 , barrot said " we just do n't have the money for a third ground station , " an unidentified eu diplomat told the associated press .
dominique bussereau , france 's deputy transport minister , however , suggested to the ap that spain ought to be awarded a galileo test center . under the compromise reached friday , spain 's " safety of life " center could " evolve into a fully qualified " control center by 2013 , allowing madrid to supervise operation of the satellites and their transmissions to earth .
" the spanish center , once it is up and running from a technical point of view , would act as a control center along with the others " in germany and italy , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot explained .
after a consortium of private companies abandoned galileo earlier this year due to a financing dispute , the european commission agreed last friday to fund the entire program , with most of the additional 2.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- in funding coming from leftover agricultural funds and the rest from research , transport and administration budgets .
germany wants its fair share of galileo projects as the biggest contributor to the eu budget , germany wants astrium , a german-dominated subsidiary of the european aerospace giant eads , to have a proportionate share of galileo contracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite images can pinpoint the precise location of iranian nuclear sites - or anywhere else the main issue hacked out by the transport ministers was how to slice the galileo pie among european companies .
while competition rules would normally dictate that contracts be awarded on a best-offer basis , the european space industry is concentrated into a few main groups which have demanded a higher share of the lucrative business . the agreement , however , does not allow a single company to obtain an inordinately large portion of the project 's contracts . " galileo will become the spearhead for european technology , " barrot told reporters .
" we are on the way towards putting galileo into operation for 2013 and to offer europeans very many services . " the galileo project has been plagued by delays and is already running five years behind schedule with only one test satellite up in orbit .
at least 1 billion euros of taxpayer money have already been spent . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it 's no easy task as violence , drugs and poverty remain even as the country has entered a relatively peaceful time . cartagena , its graceful city center hugging the caribbean coast , is a colonial-era jewel encircled by modern day poverty and persistent violence .
home to more than 1 million people , the city illustrates the complex situation faced by colombia as it tries to return to normalcy after decades of armed conflict . the united nations world tourism organization met in cartagena this week and colombia officials were eager to change perceptions of the country .
colombian president alvaro uribe , whose law-and-order policies have brought some stability to the country , bore the message that his country was ready for european and american tourists to arrive and open their wallets . " you are visiting a country that has suffered greatly , but has a tremendous amount of hope , " he said . real world problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cartagena 's historic city center is a unesco world heritage site but even as delegates met , the reality of life outside cartagena 's heavily-guarded convention center seeped in and painted a bleak picture of life with few public services and no police protection . between 2 million and 3 million colombians have fled their homes to escape ongoing paramilitary hostilities and are living in extreme poverty in the suburbs of cities such as cartagena .
newspapers also regularly carry reports of murders and other drug-related violence . uribe said he knows it 's news like this which has kept the number of europeans who visit colombia each year small : about 125,700 arrived in the first nine months of 2007 .
most came from former colonial power spain . " terrorism puts a stop to all our possibilities , " he said referring to fighting between left-wing guerillas , right-wing paramilitaries , the military and drug lords .
" without terrorism , we 'll have tourism .
without terrorism , we 'll be happy . " some positives , many problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the growing economy has led to a building boom in cartagena the colombian government points to statistics which show that in recent years the murder rate has been cut in half and kidnappings are down 75 percent .
the country is also experiencing an economic boom officials hope will help bring in tourist dollars and help meet an ambitious goal of attracting 4 million foreign tourists to the country by 2010 . the economy had 6.8 percent growth in 2006 and is headed for 7.48 percent this year .
in cartagena , luxury hotels are springing up and it 's become a routine stop on the caribbean cruise circuit . but even as the tourist industry proclaims its slogan , " colombia , the only risk is wanting to stay , " and luxury hotels spring up along the country 's beaches and growth heads to 7.48 percent this year , the government acknowledges that parts of the country are not safe for visitors . eu aid a lifeline to locals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cartagena looks very different from outside the convention center while the colombian government said that eventually tourism will improve people 's lives , it will remain dependent on international development aid . the european union will provide 160 million euros -lrb- $ 216 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to colombia between 2007-2013 .
but unlike the united states , which focuses on giving money to fight colombia 's illicit drug trade , the eu will direct aid directly to victims and non-governmental organizations which help them . european donors are a lifeline for many local aid organizations in the country , but money - from both tourism and the government - does n't always appear as promised , said maria amparo gomez , a dominican nun who runs a school in cartagena .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 30.11.2007 foreign policy causing a rift in german coalition government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german leaders seem split on which red carpets they should step on a row has erupted over what should be the driving force behind germany 's foreign policy - economics or ethics .
it 's making the cracks in the german coalition government increasingly visible . the premier of the central german state of hesse , roland koch , on friday , nov .
30 , accused german foreign minister and vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier of pursuing a harmful foreign policy that is based solely on economic interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse premier roland koch has spared no words in lashing out at the foreign minister " germany has a historical obligation not to keep quiet about moral questions , " roland koch told the bild newspaper .
" we have no right to put economics above human rights . "
koch , who is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , passed judgment on steinmeier , a social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- , for " creating the impression in russia and china that we germans are ready to do any kind of business , even when human rights are being trampled on . "
" in doing so , the foreign minister is harming our country , " koch said .
the unusually strong rhetoric from the cdu politician is not only a sign of the strained relations in the grand coalition , but an indicator that foreign policy may play an important role in the campaigns leading up to the 2009 elections .
the right way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spd foreign policy expert rolf mützenich dismissed the criticism directed at the foreign minister .
" we advocate the anchoring of human rights in the international law , " mützenich told the dpa news agency .
the spd politician pointed out that china signed the most important human rights conventions and proved itself to be a responsible partner in the nuclear row with iran and north korea .
" those are the points of reference for a moral foreign policy , " he said .
during a visit to paris earlier in november , steinmeier told journalists he was " worried " about the escalating diplomatic tension between germany and china in the wake of the dalai lama 's visit with merkel .
in september , the chancellor met with the tibetan spiritual leader , whom chinese officials see as a dangerous separatist .
consequently , china axed a series of high level exchanges with germany , including a trip to beijing by finance minister peer steinbrück , planned for december .
the russian question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama has had a chilling effect on the relations with beijing china , however , is not the only foreign-policy wedge between the coalition partners .
german-russian relations were much more cordial during the previous german government , boosted by the flaunting camaraderie between the then chancellor , gerhard schröder , and russian president vladimir putin .
in a speech delivered in stuttgart on thursday , schröder - who was himself often criticized for turning a blind eye to putin 's human rights record , lashed out at germany 's foreign policy by saying he had the impression he was back " in the cold war era . "

he will be succeeding the 79-year-old archbishop friedrich wetter , who retired last february due to his advanced age , but has stayed in office until his replacement takes over .
the munich archdiocese numbers around 2 million catholics and is considered one of the most important one in germany .
pope benedict xvi was himself the archbishop of munich before moving to rome to head the congregation for the doctrine of the faith in 1981 .
bavarian premier günther beckstein , who is a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - sister party to angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- - welcomed marx ' appointment and described him as a " highly convincing and principled man of the cloth who is , at the same time , eager to debate and humorous .

it 's making the cracks in the german coalition government increasingly visible . the premier of the central german state of hesse , roland koch , on friday , nov .
30 , accused german foreign minister and vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier of pursuing a harmful foreign policy that is based solely on economic interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse premier roland koch has spared no words in lashing out at the foreign minister " germany has a historical obligation not to keep quiet about moral questions , " roland koch told the bild newspaper .
" we have no right to put economics above human rights . "
koch , who is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , passed judgment on steinmeier , a social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- , for " creating the impression in russia and china that we germans are ready to do any kind of business , even when human rights are being trampled on . "
" in doing so , the foreign minister is harming our country , " koch said .
the unusually strong rhetoric from the cdu politician is not only a sign of the strained relations in the grand coalition , but an indicator that foreign policy may play an important role in the campaigns leading up to the 2009 elections .
the right way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spd foreign policy expert rolf mützenich dismissed the criticism directed at the foreign minister .
" we advocate the anchoring of human rights in the international law , " mützenich told the dpa news agency .
the spd politician pointed out that china signed the most important human rights conventions and proved itself to be a responsible partner in the nuclear row with iran and north korea .
" those are the points of reference for a moral foreign policy , " he said .
during a visit to paris earlier in november , steinmeier told journalists he was " worried " about the escalating diplomatic tension between germany and china in the wake of the dalai lama 's visit with merkel .
in september , the chancellor met with the tibetan spiritual leader , whom chinese officials see as a dangerous separatist .
consequently , china axed a series of high level exchanges with germany , including a trip to beijing by finance minister peer steinbrück , planned for december .
the russian question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama has had a chilling effect on the relations with beijing china , however , is not the only foreign-policy wedge between the coalition partners .
german-russian relations were much more cordial during the previous german government , boosted by the flaunting camaraderie between the then chancellor , gerhard schröder , and russian president vladimir putin .
in a speech delivered in stuttgart on thursday , schröder - who was himself often criticized for turning a blind eye to putin 's human rights record , lashed out at germany 's foreign policy by saying he had the impression he was back " in the cold war era . "
some politicians were promoting a " distancing , even opposition to russia , " the former leader of the social democratic party said .
" i regard this approach as wrong , if not even dangerous , " he added .
less than a month after leaving the chancellor 's office in november 2005 , schröder was voted in as head of the supervisory board for a company that 's closely linked to the state-owned russian energy giant gazprom .

he added that india and the eu were working towards pragmatic solutions with industrialized nations and developing countries sharing the burden in accordance with population size and level of economic development . " in order to achieve this , global action is needed by all parties , according to their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities , with developed countries taking the lead , " said singh and portuguese prime minister jose socrates in a joint statement .

" this compromise must be obtained within common but different responsibilities , " socrates said . bilateral trade pact to greatly boost india-eu trade the meeting marked the eighth eu-india summit and seeks to forge a closer strategic alliance and deepen cooperation on trade issues as well .
trade talks covered both a comprehensive bilateral eu-india trade agreement and the comprehensive doha round of international trade talks under the umbrella of the world trade organization . singh indicated that he hoped that the trade and investment agreement that was negotiated could be in place by the next annual summit in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is the world 's fastest growing economy after china european commission president jose manuel barroso , who was also present at the summit , said that the trade pact was an ambitious one and would boost bilateral trade tremendously .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 30.11.2007 european aid still trumps tourism in colombia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the image colombia is promoting , but for millions reality is very different the colombian government has launched a charm offensive aimed at luring international tourists .
but it 's no easy task as violence , drugs and poverty remain even as the country has entered a relatively peaceful time . cartagena , its graceful city center hugging the caribbean coast , is a colonial-era jewel encircled by modern day poverty and persistent violence .
home to more than 1 million people , the city illustrates the complex situation faced by colombia as it tries to return to normalcy after decades of armed conflict . the united nations world tourism organization met in cartagena this week and colombia officials were eager to change perceptions of the country .
colombian president alvaro uribe , whose law-and-order policies have brought some stability to the country , bore the message that his country was ready for european and american tourists to arrive and open their wallets . " you are visiting a country that has suffered greatly , but has a tremendous amount of hope , " he said . real world problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cartagena 's historic city center is a unesco world heritage site but even as delegates met , the reality of life outside cartagena 's heavily-guarded convention center seeped in and painted a bleak picture of life with few public services and no police protection . between 2 million and 3 million colombians have fled their homes to escape ongoing paramilitary hostilities and are living in extreme poverty in the suburbs of cities such as cartagena .
newspapers also regularly carry reports of murders and other drug-related violence . uribe said he knows it 's news like this which has kept the number of europeans who visit colombia each year small : about 125,700 arrived in the first nine months of 2007 .
most came from former colonial power spain . " terrorism puts a stop to all our possibilities , " he said referring to fighting between left-wing guerillas , right-wing paramilitaries , the military and drug lords .
" without terrorism , we 'll have tourism .
without terrorism , we 'll be happy . " some positives , many problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the growing economy has led to a building boom in cartagena the colombian government points to statistics which show that in recent years the murder rate has been cut in half and kidnappings are down 75 percent .
the country is also experiencing an economic boom officials hope will help bring in tourist dollars and help meet an ambitious goal of attracting 4 million foreign tourists to the country by 2010 . the economy had 6.8 percent growth in 2006 and is headed for 7.48 percent this year .
in cartagena , luxury hotels are springing up and it 's become a routine stop on the caribbean cruise circuit . but even as the tourist industry proclaims its slogan , " colombia , the only risk is wanting to stay , " and luxury hotels spring up along the country 's beaches and growth heads to 7.48 percent this year , the government acknowledges that parts of the country are not safe for visitors . eu aid a lifeline to locals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cartagena looks very different from outside the convention center while the colombian government said that eventually tourism will improve people 's lives , it will remain dependent on international development aid . the european union will provide 160 million euros -lrb- $ 216 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to colombia between 2007-2013 .
but unlike the united states , which focuses on giving money to fight colombia 's illicit drug trade , the eu will direct aid directly to victims and non-governmental organizations which help them . european donors are a lifeline for many local aid organizations in the country , but money - from both tourism and the government - does n't always appear as promised , said maria amparo gomez , a dominican nun who runs a school in cartagena .

it 's making the cracks in the german coalition government increasingly visible . the premier of the central german state of hesse , roland koch , on friday , nov .
30 , accused german foreign minister and vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier of pursuing a harmful foreign policy that is based solely on economic interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse premier roland koch has spared no words in lashing out at the foreign minister " germany has a historical obligation not to keep quiet about moral questions , " roland koch told the bild newspaper .
" we have no right to put economics above human rights . "
koch , who is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , passed judgment on steinmeier , a social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- , for " creating the impression in russia and china that we germans are ready to do any kind of business , even when human rights are being trampled on . "
" in doing so , the foreign minister is harming our country , " koch said .
the unusually strong rhetoric from the cdu politician is not only a sign of the strained relations in the grand coalition , but an indicator that foreign policy may play an important role in the campaigns leading up to the 2009 elections .

" we advocate the anchoring of human rights in the international law , " mützenich told the dpa news agency .
the spd politician pointed out that china signed the most important human rights conventions and proved itself to be a responsible partner in the nuclear row with iran and north korea .
" those are the points of reference for a moral foreign policy , " he said .
during a visit to paris earlier in november , steinmeier told journalists he was " worried " about the escalating diplomatic tension between germany and china in the wake of the dalai lama 's visit with merkel .
in september , the chancellor met with the tibetan spiritual leader , whom chinese officials see as a dangerous separatist .
consequently , china axed a series of high level exchanges with germany , including a trip to beijing by finance minister peer steinbrück , planned for december .
the russian question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama has had a chilling effect on the relations with beijing china , however , is not the only foreign-policy wedge between the coalition partners .
german-russian relations were much more cordial during the previous german government , boosted by the flaunting camaraderie between the then chancellor , gerhard schröder , and russian president vladimir putin .
in a speech delivered in stuttgart on thursday , schröder - who was himself often criticized for turning a blind eye to putin 's human rights record , lashed out at germany 's foreign policy by saying he had the impression he was back " in the cold war era . "
some politicians were promoting a " distancing , even opposition to russia , " the former leader of the social democratic party said .
" i regard this approach as wrong , if not even dangerous , " he added .
less than a month after leaving the chancellor 's office in november 2005 , schröder was voted in as head of the supervisory board for a company that 's closely linked to the state-owned russian energy giant gazprom .
this move was seen by many in germany as ethically questionable if not complete unacceptable .
pursuing an ethical foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-russian relations were much closer under gerhard schröder merkel , on the other hand , said in a speech to the german parliament on wednesday that there was no difference between a foreign policy based on values and one pursuing german economic interests .
" human rights policy and representation of economic interests are two sides of the same coin , " merkel said .
" they should never be opposed to each another . "
merkel will get to test her diplomatic skills and her role as a champion of human rights at a summit between leaders of the european union and african states that is taking place in the portuguese capital of lisbon from dec .

the summit will also be attended by zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe , a dictator whose controversial policies of seizing white-owned commercial farms and threats to nationalize foreign-owned firms make him an uncomfortable politician to deal with in the eu .

it 's making the cracks in the german coalition government increasingly visible . the premier of the central german state of hesse , roland koch , on friday , nov .
30 , accused german foreign minister and vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier of pursuing a harmful foreign policy that is based solely on economic interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse premier roland koch has spared no words in lashing out at the foreign minister " germany has a historical obligation not to keep quiet about moral questions , " roland koch told the bild newspaper .
" we have no right to put economics above human rights . "
koch , who is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , passed judgment on steinmeier , a social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- , for " creating the impression in russia and china that we germans are ready to do any kind of business , even when human rights are being trampled on . "
" in doing so , the foreign minister is harming our country , " koch said .
the unusually strong rhetoric from the cdu politician is not only a sign of the strained relations in the grand coalition , but an indicator that foreign policy may play an important role in the campaigns leading up to the 2009 elections .
the right way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spd foreign policy expert rolf mützenich dismissed the criticism directed at the foreign minister .
" we advocate the anchoring of human rights in the international law , " mützenich told the dpa news agency .
the spd politician pointed out that china signed the most important human rights conventions and proved itself to be a responsible partner in the nuclear row with iran and north korea .
" those are the points of reference for a moral foreign policy , " he said .
during a visit to paris earlier in november , steinmeier told journalists he was " worried " about the escalating diplomatic tension between germany and china in the wake of the dalai lama 's visit with merkel .
in september , the chancellor met with the tibetan spiritual leader , whom chinese officials see as a dangerous separatist .
consequently , china axed a series of high level exchanges with germany , including a trip to beijing by finance minister peer steinbrück , planned for december .

german-russian relations were much more cordial during the previous german government , boosted by the flaunting camaraderie between the then chancellor , gerhard schröder , and russian president vladimir putin .
in a speech delivered in stuttgart on thursday , schröder - who was himself often criticized for turning a blind eye to putin 's human rights record , lashed out at germany 's foreign policy by saying he had the impression he was back " in the cold war era . "
some politicians were promoting a " distancing , even opposition to russia , " the former leader of the social democratic party said .
" i regard this approach as wrong , if not even dangerous , " he added .
less than a month after leaving the chancellor 's office in november 2005 , schröder was voted in as head of the supervisory board for a company that 's closely linked to the state-owned russian energy giant gazprom .
this move was seen by many in germany as ethically questionable if not complete unacceptable .
pursuing an ethical foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-russian relations were much closer under gerhard schröder merkel , on the other hand , said in a speech to the german parliament on wednesday that there was no difference between a foreign policy based on values and one pursuing german economic interests .
" human rights policy and representation of economic interests are two sides of the same coin , " merkel said .
" they should never be opposed to each another . "

in the bundesliga , simunic has been playing for berlin since 2000 .
his teammates call him “ joe . ” dw-tv : now you 've been in berlin since 2000 - what 's it like living here on the other side of the world ?
josip simunic : it 's different .
the longer i 'm away from australia , the more i see how much australia is a beautiful country , probably the best country in the world .
the people here are very different to australia .
in australia the people are more friendly .
here also , but not to the extent that they are in australia .
when you think back to the last round of the bundesliga we saw ivan klasnic come back , one of your countrymen .
what emotions did that bring ?
i just got goosebumps now .
i 'm happy for ivan .
i hope he stays healthy , i hope that he has no more problems with his kidneys or anything else .
he 's a great example to show that when someone really wants to achieve something , they can achieve it .
like i said , i hope he stays healthy and scores a lot of goals for werder bremen .
you said at the start when you first came here that you were here to win the german championship .
that success has n't come in the last 7 years - why has n't it happened ?
in the past we 've had very good teams , but there were better teams than us .
you have to play 34 games in a season .
i think we had too many games where we were up there , we needed the win , but because of the added pressure , we did n't put in a good performance and get the result .
we also have the problem that a lot of players come and then they get better offers from other clubs , more money .
that 's also a problem , when you get offered three times as much to play in england .
football is not only about money but you have to try and situate yourself quickly .
to be too aggressive is sometimes not good for the team .
you have to pick the right moment where you are going to be aggressive in the interests of the team , in order to show the younger players in the team that they should get involved .
that takes also a little bit of time .
the body language is also important .
i 'm getting more used to it and learning when to make the right challenge at the right time .
at the moment , it seems sometimes the aggression goes too far ?
would you agree with that ?
i agree with that .
sometimes it does go too far .
but i have to say : the refereeing in germany is a bit soft .
when i compare it - i watch a lot of english games - it 's a big , big difference .
when i see how people go in to challenges in england .
here in germany , it 's a very big difference - unfortunately .
with the success that you gained in the bundesliga you then became a member of the croatian national team .
what was it like winning against england in london last week ?
it was a great feeling .
how can i explain it to you ?
in the world cup against australia , when we did n't make it through , it was a very , very drained feeling .
against england , to win at wembley , was the total opposite .
it was probably the nicest feeling i have had in my life , when it comes to football .
these sorts of moments , in the headlines in europe , is this the reason why you opted to play for croatia and not the country of your birth , australia ?
i 'm a proud australian .
but i also know where i come from , my heritage , my background .
and i 'm very proud of that .
i feel more croatian than australian .
another reason is the long flight to australia for games - that 's also a very big problem .
we have that problem now with some of our brazilian players .
what are your plans for 2008 ?
how do you see it going for you ?
always when someone asks me what my plans are , the most important plan is to stay healthy .
football wise : the biggest thing is to try to get in to the top half of the table for hertha bsc and to become european champions for croatia .
thanks very much for your time .
thank you , thanks .
are you living in berlin ?
i am living in berlin .
how long have you been here for ?

in the world cup against australia , when we did n't make it through , it was a very , very drained feeling .
against england , to win at wembley , was the total opposite .
it was probably the nicest feeling i have had in my life , when it comes to football .
these sorts of moments , in the headlines in europe , is this the reason why you opted to play for croatia and not the country of your birth , australia ?
i 'm a proud australian .
but i also know where i come from , my heritage , my background .
and i 'm very proud of that .
i feel more croatian than australian .
another reason is the long flight to australia for games - that 's also a very big problem .
we have that problem now with some of our brazilian players .
what are your plans for 2008 ?
how do you see it going for you ?
always when someone asks me what my plans are , the most important plan is to stay healthy .
football wise : the biggest thing is to try to get in to the top half of the table for hertha bsc and to become european champions for croatia .
thanks very much for your time .
thank you , thanks .
are you living in berlin ?
i am living in berlin .
how long have you been here for ?
for two and a half years .
do you like berlin ?
yeah , i like berlin , otherwise i would n't hold out the temperatures . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 , on how the work for the long-delayed satellite navigation project galileo would be divided up among the 27 member countries . at an eu meeting of the bloc 's transport ministers , spain , which had made demands to host a ground station for a network of some 30 satellites , first dissented , but later agreed . under the current deal , the galileo program , which is budgeted at 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- and intended to reduce the eu 's reliance on the us global position system -lrb- gps -rrb- , plans to install only two ground control stations : one near munich and one in rome . no money for third ground station bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo should be fully operable by 2013 , barrot said " we just do n't have the money for a third ground station , " an unidentified eu diplomat told the associated press .
dominique bussereau , france 's deputy transport minister , however , suggested to the ap that spain ought to be awarded a galileo test center . under the compromise reached friday , spain 's " safety of life " center could " evolve into a fully qualified " control center by 2013 , allowing madrid to supervise operation of the satellites and their transmissions to earth .
" the spanish center , once it is up and running from a technical point of view , would act as a control center along with the others " in germany and italy , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot explained .
after a consortium of private companies abandoned galileo earlier this year due to a financing dispute , the european commission agreed last friday to fund the entire program , with most of the additional 2.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- in funding coming from leftover agricultural funds and the rest from research , transport and administration budgets .
germany wants its fair share of galileo projects as the biggest contributor to the eu budget , germany wants astrium , a german-dominated subsidiary of the european aerospace giant eads , to have a proportionate share of galileo contracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite images can pinpoint the precise location of iranian nuclear sites - or anywhere else the main issue hacked out by the transport ministers was how to slice the galileo pie among european companies .
while competition rules would normally dictate that contracts be awarded on a best-offer basis , the european space industry is concentrated into a few main groups which have demanded a higher share of the lucrative business . the agreement , however , does not allow a single company to obtain an inordinately large portion of the project 's contracts . " galileo will become the spearhead for european technology , " barrot told reporters .
" we are on the way towards putting galileo into operation for 2013 and to offer europeans very many services . " the galileo project has been plagued by delays and is already running five years behind schedule with only one test satellite up in orbit .

but it 's no easy task as violence , drugs and poverty remain even as the country has entered a relatively peaceful time . cartagena , its graceful city center hugging the caribbean coast , is a colonial-era jewel encircled by modern day poverty and persistent violence .
home to more than 1 million people , the city illustrates the complex situation faced by colombia as it tries to return to normalcy after decades of armed conflict . the united nations world tourism organization met in cartagena this week and colombia officials were eager to change perceptions of the country .
colombian president alvaro uribe , whose law-and-order policies have brought some stability to the country , bore the message that his country was ready for european and american tourists to arrive and open their wallets . " you are visiting a country that has suffered greatly , but has a tremendous amount of hope , " he said . real world problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cartagena 's historic city center is a unesco world heritage site but even as delegates met , the reality of life outside cartagena 's heavily-guarded convention center seeped in and painted a bleak picture of life with few public services and no police protection . between 2 million and 3 million colombians have fled their homes to escape ongoing paramilitary hostilities and are living in extreme poverty in the suburbs of cities such as cartagena .
newspapers also regularly carry reports of murders and other drug-related violence . uribe said he knows it 's news like this which has kept the number of europeans who visit colombia each year small : about 125,700 arrived in the first nine months of 2007 .
most came from former colonial power spain . " terrorism puts a stop to all our possibilities , " he said referring to fighting between left-wing guerillas , right-wing paramilitaries , the military and drug lords .
" without terrorism , we 'll have tourism .
without terrorism , we 'll be happy . " some positives , many problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the growing economy has led to a building boom in cartagena the colombian government points to statistics which show that in recent years the murder rate has been cut in half and kidnappings are down 75 percent .
the country is also experiencing an economic boom officials hope will help bring in tourist dollars and help meet an ambitious goal of attracting 4 million foreign tourists to the country by 2010 . the economy had 6.8 percent growth in 2006 and is headed for 7.48 percent this year .
in cartagena , luxury hotels are springing up and it 's become a routine stop on the caribbean cruise circuit . but even as the tourist industry proclaims its slogan , " colombia , the only risk is wanting to stay , " and luxury hotels spring up along the country 's beaches and growth heads to 7.48 percent this year , the government acknowledges that parts of the country are not safe for visitors . eu aid a lifeline to locals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cartagena looks very different from outside the convention center while the colombian government said that eventually tourism will improve people 's lives , it will remain dependent on international development aid . the european union will provide 160 million euros -lrb- $ 216 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to colombia between 2007-2013 .
but unlike the united states , which focuses on giving money to fight colombia 's illicit drug trade , the eu will direct aid directly to victims and non-governmental organizations which help them . european donors are a lifeline for many local aid organizations in the country , but money - from both tourism and the government - does n't always appear as promised , said maria amparo gomez , a dominican nun who runs a school in cartagena .

" according to a recording aired on thursday by qatar-based al jazeera television , osama bin laden purportedly warned europe to end its participation in the nato and us-led missions there . he said his message was addressed to the european people and not the politicians , who he accused of " standing in the shadow of the white house " and of being forced to participate in the us-led " war on terror . " " the american tide is receding and they would eventually return to their home across the atlantic , " he said .
" it is in your interest to force the hand of your politicians -lsb- away from -rsb- the white house .

it also warned that " the american tide was ebbing " and that us troops would soon leave the country , leaving afghanistan 's neighbors to " settle scores . " no immediate threat , says us a us official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said that the tape likely came from bin laden , though no initial confirmation had been issued . " the statement does not appear to contain any specific or credible threats , but it will be analyzed , " the official said . us state department spokesman sean mccormack said attempts to drive a wedge between the us and its allies was " not a new tactic " of terrorists and added that europe continues to make a strong commitment to development in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bin laden accused western forces of targeting women and children in afghanistan the us has encouraged its european allies to send even more troops to afghanistan , while lawmakers in europe , influenced by public opinion , have been hesitant to expand their military commitment . afghanistan dismissed the terror leader 's call for europe to break ranks with the us . " security in afghanistan means security in europe and is an international responsibility , " afghan foreign ministry spokesman sultan ahmad baheen told the afp news agency .
" we think this is an international responsibility for afghanistan and their own countries .
nothing will deter the international unity on the war on terror . " earlier this month , the german government decided to extend its afghan mission by one year , upping the maximum number of available troops from 3,000 to 3,500 .

in the bundesliga , simunic has been playing for berlin since 2000 .
his teammates call him “ joe . ” dw-tv : now you 've been in berlin since 2000 - what 's it like living here on the other side of the world ?
josip simunic : it 's different .
the longer i 'm away from australia , the more i see how much australia is a beautiful country , probably the best country in the world .
the people here are very different to australia .
in australia the people are more friendly .
here also , but not to the extent that they are in australia .
when you think back to the last round of the bundesliga we saw ivan klasnic come back , one of your countrymen .
what emotions did that bring ?
i just got goosebumps now .
i 'm happy for ivan .
i hope he stays healthy , i hope that he has no more problems with his kidneys or anything else .
he 's a great example to show that when someone really wants to achieve something , they can achieve it .
like i said , i hope he stays healthy and scores a lot of goals for werder bremen .
you said at the start when you first came here that you were here to win the german championship .
that success has n't come in the last 7 years - why has n't it happened ?
in the past we 've had very good teams , but there were better teams than us .
you have to play 34 games in a season .
i think we had too many games where we were up there , we needed the win , but because of the added pressure , we did n't put in a good performance and get the result .
we also have the problem that a lot of players come and then they get better offers from other clubs , more money .
that 's also a problem , when you get offered three times as much to play in england .
football is not only about money but you have to try and situate yourself quickly .
to be too aggressive is sometimes not good for the team .
you have to pick the right moment where you are going to be aggressive in the interests of the team , in order to show the younger players in the team that they should get involved .
that takes also a little bit of time .
the body language is also important .
i 'm getting more used to it and learning when to make the right challenge at the right time .
at the moment , it seems sometimes the aggression goes too far ?
would you agree with that ?
i agree with that .
sometimes it does go too far .
but i have to say : the refereeing in germany is a bit soft .
when i compare it - i watch a lot of english games - it 's a big , big difference .
when i see how people go in to challenges in england .
here in germany , it 's a very big difference - unfortunately .
with the success that you gained in the bundesliga you then became a member of the croatian national team .
what was it like winning against england in london last week ?
it was a great feeling .
how can i explain it to you ?
in the world cup against australia , when we did n't make it through , it was a very , very drained feeling .
against england , to win at wembley , was the total opposite .
it was probably the nicest feeling i have had in my life , when it comes to football .
these sorts of moments , in the headlines in europe , is this the reason why you opted to play for croatia and not the country of your birth , australia ?
i 'm a proud australian .
but i also know where i come from , my heritage , my background .
and i 'm very proud of that .
i feel more croatian than australian .
another reason is the long flight to australia for games - that 's also a very big problem .
we have that problem now with some of our brazilian players .
what are your plans for 2008 ?
how do you see it going for you ?
always when someone asks me what my plans are , the most important plan is to stay healthy .
football wise : the biggest thing is to try to get in to the top half of the table for hertha bsc and to become european champions for croatia .
thanks very much for your time .
thank you , thanks .
are you living in berlin ?
i am living in berlin .
how long have you been here for ?
for two and a half years .
do you like berlin ?
yeah , i like berlin , otherwise i would n't hold out the temperatures . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home : dw-tv arabia bundesliga -pipe- 30.11.2007 josip simunic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josip simunic was born and raised in australia , but plays his international football for his parents ' homeland , croatia .
in the bundesliga , simunic has been playing for berlin since 2000 .
his teammates call him “ joe . ” dw-tv : now you 've been in berlin since 2000 - what 's it like living here on the other side of the world ?
josip simunic : it 's different .
the longer i 'm away from australia , the more i see how much australia is a beautiful country , probably the best country in the world .
the people here are very different to australia .
in australia the people are more friendly .
here also , but not to the extent that they are in australia .
when you think back to the last round of the bundesliga we saw ivan klasnic come back , one of your countrymen .
what emotions did that bring ?
i just got goosebumps now .
i 'm happy for ivan .
i hope he stays healthy , i hope that he has no more problems with his kidneys or anything else .
he 's a great example to show that when someone really wants to achieve something , they can achieve it .
like i said , i hope he stays healthy and scores a lot of goals for werder bremen .
you said at the start when you first came here that you were here to win the german championship .
that success has n't come in the last 7 years - why has n't it happened ?
in the past we 've had very good teams , but there were better teams than us .
you have to play 34 games in a season .
i think we had too many games where we were up there , we needed the win , but because of the added pressure , we did n't put in a good performance and get the result .
we also have the problem that a lot of players come and then they get better offers from other clubs , more money .
that 's also a problem , when you get offered three times as much to play in england .
football is not only about money but you have to try and situate yourself quickly .
to be too aggressive is sometimes not good for the team .
you have to pick the right moment where you are going to be aggressive in the interests of the team , in order to show the younger players in the team that they should get involved .
that takes also a little bit of time .
the body language is also important .
i 'm getting more used to it and learning when to make the right challenge at the right time .
at the moment , it seems sometimes the aggression goes too far ?
would you agree with that ?
i agree with that .
sometimes it does go too far .
but i have to say : the refereeing in germany is a bit soft .
when i compare it - i watch a lot of english games - it 's a big , big difference .
when i see how people go in to challenges in england .
here in germany , it 's a very big difference - unfortunately .
with the success that you gained in the bundesliga you then became a member of the croatian national team .
what was it like winning against england in london last week ?
it was a great feeling .
how can i explain it to you ?
in the world cup against australia , when we did n't make it through , it was a very , very drained feeling .
against england , to win at wembley , was the total opposite .
it was probably the nicest feeling i have had in my life , when it comes to football .
these sorts of moments , in the headlines in europe , is this the reason why you opted to play for croatia and not the country of your birth , australia ?
i 'm a proud australian .
but i also know where i come from , my heritage , my background .
and i 'm very proud of that .
i feel more croatian than australian .
another reason is the long flight to australia for games - that 's also a very big problem .
we have that problem now with some of our brazilian players .
what are your plans for 2008 ?
how do you see it going for you ?
always when someone asks me what my plans are , the most important plan is to stay healthy .
football wise : the biggest thing is to try to get in to the top half of the table for hertha bsc and to become european champions for croatia .
thanks very much for your time .
thank you , thanks .
are you living in berlin ?
i am living in berlin .
how long have you been here for ?
for two and a half years .
do you like berlin ?
yeah , i like berlin , otherwise i would n't hold out the temperatures . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 , on how the work for the long-delayed satellite navigation project galileo would be divided up among the 27 member countries . at an eu meeting of the bloc 's transport ministers , spain , which had made demands to host a ground station for a network of some 30 satellites , first dissented , but later agreed . under the current deal , the galileo program , which is budgeted at 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- and intended to reduce the eu 's reliance on the us global position system -lrb- gps -rrb- , plans to install only two ground control stations : one near munich and one in rome . no money for third ground station bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo should be fully operable by 2013 , barrot said " we just do n't have the money for a third ground station , " an unidentified eu diplomat told the associated press .
dominique bussereau , france 's deputy transport minister , however , suggested to the ap that spain ought to be awarded a galileo test center . under the compromise reached friday , spain 's " safety of life " center could " evolve into a fully qualified " control center by 2013 , allowing madrid to supervise operation of the satellites and their transmissions to earth .
" the spanish center , once it is up and running from a technical point of view , would act as a control center along with the others " in germany and italy , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot explained .
after a consortium of private companies abandoned galileo earlier this year due to a financing dispute , the european commission agreed last friday to fund the entire program , with most of the additional 2.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- in funding coming from leftover agricultural funds and the rest from research , transport and administration budgets .
germany wants its fair share of galileo projects as the biggest contributor to the eu budget , germany wants astrium , a german-dominated subsidiary of the european aerospace giant eads , to have a proportionate share of galileo contracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite images can pinpoint the precise location of iranian nuclear sites - or anywhere else the main issue hacked out by the transport ministers was how to slice the galileo pie among european companies .
while competition rules would normally dictate that contracts be awarded on a best-offer basis , the european space industry is concentrated into a few main groups which have demanded a higher share of the lucrative business . the agreement , however , does not allow a single company to obtain an inordinately large portion of the project 's contracts . " galileo will become the spearhead for european technology , " barrot told reporters .
" we are on the way towards putting galileo into operation for 2013 and to offer europeans very many services . " the galileo project has been plagued by delays and is already running five years behind schedule with only one test satellite up in orbit .

30 , overwhelmingly approved the federal budget of 283.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 417.4 billion -rrb- for 2008 , an increase of 4 percent from 2007 . lawmakers voted 408-144 in favor of the budget , which has provided for a slight increase in outlays for defense and economic assistance . defense spending will go up to 29.45 billion euros , up from 28.39 billion in 2007 .
the ministry for economic assistance , which is responsible for the distribution of germany 's overseas development aid , sees its share of the budget go up to 5.13 billion euros , an increase from 4.5 billion euros last year . the biggest slice , accounting for about 30 percent of the overall budget , has been earmarked for labor and social affairs . weak dollar blamed for slowdown in euro zone exports during the final day of the four-day debate , german economics minister michael glos appealed to the united states to slow down the dollar 's slide as european exporters come under growing exchange-rate pressure . glos said washington should not try to fix structural problems in the us economy by devaluing the dollar . " if the resulting economic boom is not underpinned by structural adjustment in the us economy itself , but is achieved purely as the result of a weak currency , then the americans have gotten a bad deal , " he said . huge deficit spending has led to a free fall of the dollar , pushing the value of the euro to higher levels and was partly responsible for setting off turmoil in the world financial markets . earlier , german finance minister peer steinbrück said he did not expect the german economy to suffer too much from the current credit squeeze triggered by the us mortgage crisis . eu exports elsewhere to offset slack in us he told the financial times newspaper that he expected the german economy to perform well next year even if were to grow at a slower pace than 2007 . steinbrück said domestic demand was picking up and exports would remain brisk , with demand from russia , eastern europe and asia offsetting a slowdown in us imports from the euro zone . referring to the strength of the euro against the dollar , he acknowledged that it would have an effect on germany , but said the stronger currency would curb the impact of higher oil prices , since crude is dollar-based . " for us europeans , we prefer a stronger euro to a weak one , " he told the financial daily . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 . indian prime minister manmohan singh announced that both sides were committed to controlling global emissions .
he added that india and the eu were working towards pragmatic solutions with industrialized nations and developing countries sharing the burden in accordance with population size and level of economic development . " in order to achieve this , global action is needed by all parties , according to their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities , with developed countries taking the lead , " said singh and portuguese prime minister jose socrates in a joint statement .
portugal holds the six-month eu presidency until the end of this year . measures provide allowances for developing nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is especially vulnerable to floods and monsoons exacerbated by climate change as a huge developing country , india , which is one of the world 's biggest polluters , is not obliged to make cuts in greenhouse gas emissions under the kyoto protocol .
singh emphasized that developing nations should not be held to the same standard on emissions as europe , and called for measures on climate change that do not " perpetuate poverty . " india and the eu agreed that the upcoming climate change conference in bali , indonesia , which runs from dec .
3-14 , should come up with a clear roadmap for controlling emissions beyond 2012 within a united nations framework when kyoto expires . " this compromise must be obtained within common but different responsibilities , " socrates said . bilateral trade pact to greatly boost india-eu trade the meeting marked the eighth eu-india summit and seeks to forge a closer strategic alliance and deepen cooperation on trade issues as well .
trade talks covered both a comprehensive bilateral eu-india trade agreement and the comprehensive doha round of international trade talks under the umbrella of the world trade organization . singh indicated that he hoped that the trade and investment agreement that was negotiated could be in place by the next annual summit in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is the world 's fastest growing economy after china european commission president jose manuel barroso , who was also present at the summit , said that the trade pact was an ambitious one and would boost bilateral trade tremendously .
india-eu trade stood at about 47 billion euros last year . the eu is india 's largest trading partner accounting for nearly 20 percent of the south asian nation 's total trade .
it is also largest source of direct foreign investment .
the total investment flow from the eu into india amounted to nearly $ 11 billion in the period from august 1991 to february 2007 according to indian government sources . the eu has earmarked 470 million euros -lrb- $ 690 million -rrb- to promote economic development over the next five years , according to an article that barroso wrote in the indian media on friday . both sides also signed an agreement to strengthen cooperation in science and technology .
the eu agreed to provide seven million euros for setting up the european business and technology center in new delhi in order to promote further links between the business and scientific communities . deal to lower trade barriers may be reached at end of 2008 india , the world 's fastest growing economy after china , needs new export markets to maintain its record growth .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , who was also in attendance , said an agreement with the european union to lower tariffs and increase trade may be reached in one year 's time . india 's exports , however , account for less than 2 percent of overall eu imports , and european companies have invested 10 times more in china than in india over the last five years . other topics on the summit agenda were a possible civilian nuclear cooperation accord with the united states , which would provide india with access to american technology after a 30 year embargo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 30.11.2007 foreign policy causing a rift in german coalition government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german leaders seem split on which red carpets they should step on a row has erupted over what should be the driving force behind germany 's foreign policy - economics or ethics .
it 's making the cracks in the german coalition government increasingly visible . the premier of the central german state of hesse , roland koch , on friday , nov .
30 , accused german foreign minister and vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier of pursuing a harmful foreign policy that is based solely on economic interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse premier roland koch has spared no words in lashing out at the foreign minister " germany has a historical obligation not to keep quiet about moral questions , " roland koch told the bild newspaper .
" we have no right to put economics above human rights . "
koch , who is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , passed judgment on steinmeier , a social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- , for " creating the impression in russia and china that we germans are ready to do any kind of business , even when human rights are being trampled on . "
" in doing so , the foreign minister is harming our country , " koch said .
the unusually strong rhetoric from the cdu politician is not only a sign of the strained relations in the grand coalition , but an indicator that foreign policy may play an important role in the campaigns leading up to the 2009 elections .
the right way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spd foreign policy expert rolf mützenich dismissed the criticism directed at the foreign minister .
" we advocate the anchoring of human rights in the international law , " mützenich told the dpa news agency .
the spd politician pointed out that china signed the most important human rights conventions and proved itself to be a responsible partner in the nuclear row with iran and north korea .
" those are the points of reference for a moral foreign policy , " he said .
during a visit to paris earlier in november , steinmeier told journalists he was " worried " about the escalating diplomatic tension between germany and china in the wake of the dalai lama 's visit with merkel .
in september , the chancellor met with the tibetan spiritual leader , whom chinese officials see as a dangerous separatist .
consequently , china axed a series of high level exchanges with germany , including a trip to beijing by finance minister peer steinbrück , planned for december .
the russian question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama has had a chilling effect on the relations with beijing china , however , is not the only foreign-policy wedge between the coalition partners .
german-russian relations were much more cordial during the previous german government , boosted by the flaunting camaraderie between the then chancellor , gerhard schröder , and russian president vladimir putin .
in a speech delivered in stuttgart on thursday , schröder - who was himself often criticized for turning a blind eye to putin 's human rights record , lashed out at germany 's foreign policy by saying he had the impression he was back " in the cold war era . "
some politicians were promoting a " distancing , even opposition to russia , " the former leader of the social democratic party said .
" i regard this approach as wrong , if not even dangerous , " he added .
less than a month after leaving the chancellor 's office in november 2005 , schröder was voted in as head of the supervisory board for a company that 's closely linked to the state-owned russian energy giant gazprom .
this move was seen by many in germany as ethically questionable if not complete unacceptable .
pursuing an ethical foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-russian relations were much closer under gerhard schröder merkel , on the other hand , said in a speech to the german parliament on wednesday that there was no difference between a foreign policy based on values and one pursuing german economic interests .
" human rights policy and representation of economic interests are two sides of the same coin , " merkel said .
" they should never be opposed to each another . "
merkel will get to test her diplomatic skills and her role as a champion of human rights at a summit between leaders of the european union and african states that is taking place in the portuguese capital of lisbon from dec .
7 - 9 .
the summit will also be attended by zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe , a dictator whose controversial policies of seizing white-owned commercial farms and threats to nationalize foreign-owned firms make him an uncomfortable politician to deal with in the eu .
unlike british prime minister gordon brown , who decided not to attend the summit because of the presence of the zimbabwean head of state , merkel declined to back calls for mugabe to be barred from the summit . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 , on how the work for the long-delayed satellite navigation project galileo would be divided up among the 27 member countries . at an eu meeting of the bloc 's transport ministers , spain , which had made demands to host a ground station for a network of some 30 satellites , first dissented , but later agreed . under the current deal , the galileo program , which is budgeted at 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- and intended to reduce the eu 's reliance on the us global position system -lrb- gps -rrb- , plans to install only two ground control stations : one near munich and one in rome . no money for third ground station bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo should be fully operable by 2013 , barrot said " we just do n't have the money for a third ground station , " an unidentified eu diplomat told the associated press .
dominique bussereau , france 's deputy transport minister , however , suggested to the ap that spain ought to be awarded a galileo test center . under the compromise reached friday , spain 's " safety of life " center could " evolve into a fully qualified " control center by 2013 , allowing madrid to supervise operation of the satellites and their transmissions to earth .
" the spanish center , once it is up and running from a technical point of view , would act as a control center along with the others " in germany and italy , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot explained .
after a consortium of private companies abandoned galileo earlier this year due to a financing dispute , the european commission agreed last friday to fund the entire program , with most of the additional 2.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- in funding coming from leftover agricultural funds and the rest from research , transport and administration budgets .
germany wants its fair share of galileo projects as the biggest contributor to the eu budget , germany wants astrium , a german-dominated subsidiary of the european aerospace giant eads , to have a proportionate share of galileo contracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite images can pinpoint the precise location of iranian nuclear sites - or anywhere else the main issue hacked out by the transport ministers was how to slice the galileo pie among european companies .
while competition rules would normally dictate that contracts be awarded on a best-offer basis , the european space industry is concentrated into a few main groups which have demanded a higher share of the lucrative business . the agreement , however , does not allow a single company to obtain an inordinately large portion of the project 's contracts . " galileo will become the spearhead for european technology , " barrot told reporters .
" we are on the way towards putting galileo into operation for 2013 and to offer europeans very many services . " the galileo project has been plagued by delays and is already running five years behind schedule with only one test satellite up in orbit .
at least 1 billion euros of taxpayer money have already been spent . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it 's no easy task as violence , drugs and poverty remain even as the country has entered a relatively peaceful time . cartagena , its graceful city center hugging the caribbean coast , is a colonial-era jewel encircled by modern day poverty and persistent violence .
home to more than 1 million people , the city illustrates the complex situation faced by colombia as it tries to return to normalcy after decades of armed conflict . the united nations world tourism organization met in cartagena this week and colombia officials were eager to change perceptions of the country .
colombian president alvaro uribe , whose law-and-order policies have brought some stability to the country , bore the message that his country was ready for european and american tourists to arrive and open their wallets . " you are visiting a country that has suffered greatly , but has a tremendous amount of hope , " he said . real world problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cartagena 's historic city center is a unesco world heritage site but even as delegates met , the reality of life outside cartagena 's heavily-guarded convention center seeped in and painted a bleak picture of life with few public services and no police protection . between 2 million and 3 million colombians have fled their homes to escape ongoing paramilitary hostilities and are living in extreme poverty in the suburbs of cities such as cartagena .
newspapers also regularly carry reports of murders and other drug-related violence . uribe said he knows it 's news like this which has kept the number of europeans who visit colombia each year small : about 125,700 arrived in the first nine months of 2007 .
most came from former colonial power spain . " terrorism puts a stop to all our possibilities , " he said referring to fighting between left-wing guerillas , right-wing paramilitaries , the military and drug lords .

in cartagena , luxury hotels are springing up and it 's become a routine stop on the caribbean cruise circuit . but even as the tourist industry proclaims its slogan , " colombia , the only risk is wanting to stay , " and luxury hotels spring up along the country 's beaches and growth heads to 7.48 percent this year , the government acknowledges that parts of the country are not safe for visitors . eu aid a lifeline to locals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cartagena looks very different from outside the convention center while the colombian government said that eventually tourism will improve people 's lives , it will remain dependent on international development aid . the european union will provide 160 million euros -lrb- $ 216 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to colombia between 2007-2013 .
but unlike the united states , which focuses on giving money to fight colombia 's illicit drug trade , the eu will direct aid directly to victims and non-governmental organizations which help them . european donors are a lifeline for many local aid organizations in the country , but money - from both tourism and the government - does n't always appear as promised , said maria amparo gomez , a dominican nun who runs a school in cartagena .

30 . indian prime minister manmohan singh announced that both sides were committed to controlling global emissions .
he added that india and the eu were working towards pragmatic solutions with industrialized nations and developing countries sharing the burden in accordance with population size and level of economic development . " in order to achieve this , global action is needed by all parties , according to their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities , with developed countries taking the lead , " said singh and portuguese prime minister jose socrates in a joint statement .
portugal holds the six-month eu presidency until the end of this year . measures provide allowances for developing nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is especially vulnerable to floods and monsoons exacerbated by climate change as a huge developing country , india , which is one of the world 's biggest polluters , is not obliged to make cuts in greenhouse gas emissions under the kyoto protocol .
singh emphasized that developing nations should not be held to the same standard on emissions as europe , and called for measures on climate change that do not " perpetuate poverty . " india and the eu agreed that the upcoming climate change conference in bali , indonesia , which runs from dec .
3-14 , should come up with a clear roadmap for controlling emissions beyond 2012 within a united nations framework when kyoto expires . " this compromise must be obtained within common but different responsibilities , " socrates said . bilateral trade pact to greatly boost india-eu trade the meeting marked the eighth eu-india summit and seeks to forge a closer strategic alliance and deepen cooperation on trade issues as well .
trade talks covered both a comprehensive bilateral eu-india trade agreement and the comprehensive doha round of international trade talks under the umbrella of the world trade organization . singh indicated that he hoped that the trade and investment agreement that was negotiated could be in place by the next annual summit in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is the world 's fastest growing economy after china european commission president jose manuel barroso , who was also present at the summit , said that the trade pact was an ambitious one and would boost bilateral trade tremendously .
india-eu trade stood at about 47 billion euros last year . the eu is india 's largest trading partner accounting for nearly 20 percent of the south asian nation 's total trade .
it is also largest source of direct foreign investment .
the total investment flow from the eu into india amounted to nearly $ 11 billion in the period from august 1991 to february 2007 according to indian government sources . the eu has earmarked 470 million euros -lrb- $ 690 million -rrb- to promote economic development over the next five years , according to an article that barroso wrote in the indian media on friday . both sides also signed an agreement to strengthen cooperation in science and technology .
the eu agreed to provide seven million euros for setting up the european business and technology center in new delhi in order to promote further links between the business and scientific communities . deal to lower trade barriers may be reached at end of 2008 india , the world 's fastest growing economy after china , needs new export markets to maintain its record growth .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , who was also in attendance , said an agreement with the european union to lower tariffs and increase trade may be reached in one year 's time . india 's exports , however , account for less than 2 percent of overall eu imports , and european companies have invested 10 times more in china than in india over the last five years . other topics on the summit agenda were a possible civilian nuclear cooperation accord with the united states , which would provide india with access to american technology after a 30 year embargo .
india would first need to negotiate a safeguards agreement with the international atomic energy agency before us president bush can seek approval from congress to make such an agreement operational . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it 's no easy task as violence , drugs and poverty remain even as the country has entered a relatively peaceful time . cartagena , its graceful city center hugging the caribbean coast , is a colonial-era jewel encircled by modern day poverty and persistent violence .
home to more than 1 million people , the city illustrates the complex situation faced by colombia as it tries to return to normalcy after decades of armed conflict . the united nations world tourism organization met in cartagena this week and colombia officials were eager to change perceptions of the country .
colombian president alvaro uribe , whose law-and-order policies have brought some stability to the country , bore the message that his country was ready for european and american tourists to arrive and open their wallets . " you are visiting a country that has suffered greatly , but has a tremendous amount of hope , " he said . real world problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cartagena 's historic city center is a unesco world heritage site but even as delegates met , the reality of life outside cartagena 's heavily-guarded convention center seeped in and painted a bleak picture of life with few public services and no police protection . between 2 million and 3 million colombians have fled their homes to escape ongoing paramilitary hostilities and are living in extreme poverty in the suburbs of cities such as cartagena .
newspapers also regularly carry reports of murders and other drug-related violence . uribe said he knows it 's news like this which has kept the number of europeans who visit colombia each year small : about 125,700 arrived in the first nine months of 2007 .
most came from former colonial power spain . " terrorism puts a stop to all our possibilities , " he said referring to fighting between left-wing guerillas , right-wing paramilitaries , the military and drug lords .
" without terrorism , we 'll have tourism .
without terrorism , we 'll be happy . " some positives , many problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the growing economy has led to a building boom in cartagena the colombian government points to statistics which show that in recent years the murder rate has been cut in half and kidnappings are down 75 percent .
the country is also experiencing an economic boom officials hope will help bring in tourist dollars and help meet an ambitious goal of attracting 4 million foreign tourists to the country by 2010 . the economy had 6.8 percent growth in 2006 and is headed for 7.48 percent this year .
in cartagena , luxury hotels are springing up and it 's become a routine stop on the caribbean cruise circuit . but even as the tourist industry proclaims its slogan , " colombia , the only risk is wanting to stay , " and luxury hotels spring up along the country 's beaches and growth heads to 7.48 percent this year , the government acknowledges that parts of the country are not safe for visitors . eu aid a lifeline to locals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cartagena looks very different from outside the convention center while the colombian government said that eventually tourism will improve people 's lives , it will remain dependent on international development aid . the european union will provide 160 million euros -lrb- $ 216 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to colombia between 2007-2013 .
but unlike the united states , which focuses on giving money to fight colombia 's illicit drug trade , the eu will direct aid directly to victims and non-governmental organizations which help them . european donors are a lifeline for many local aid organizations in the country , but money - from both tourism and the government - does n't always appear as promised , said maria amparo gomez , a dominican nun who runs a school in cartagena . " there are two cartagenas that are very well separated from each other , " she said . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 , overwhelmingly approved the federal budget of 283.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 417.4 billion -rrb- for 2008 , an increase of 4 percent from 2007 . lawmakers voted 408-144 in favor of the budget , which has provided for a slight increase in outlays for defense and economic assistance . defense spending will go up to 29.45 billion euros , up from 28.39 billion in 2007 .
the ministry for economic assistance , which is responsible for the distribution of germany 's overseas development aid , sees its share of the budget go up to 5.13 billion euros , an increase from 4.5 billion euros last year . the biggest slice , accounting for about 30 percent of the overall budget , has been earmarked for labor and social affairs . weak dollar blamed for slowdown in euro zone exports during the final day of the four-day debate , german economics minister michael glos appealed to the united states to slow down the dollar 's slide as european exporters come under growing exchange-rate pressure . glos said washington should not try to fix structural problems in the us economy by devaluing the dollar . " if the resulting economic boom is not underpinned by structural adjustment in the us economy itself , but is achieved purely as the result of a weak currency , then the americans have gotten a bad deal , " he said . huge deficit spending has led to a free fall of the dollar , pushing the value of the euro to higher levels and was partly responsible for setting off turmoil in the world financial markets . earlier , german finance minister peer steinbrück said he did not expect the german economy to suffer too much from the current credit squeeze triggered by the us mortgage crisis . eu exports elsewhere to offset slack in us he told the financial times newspaper that he expected the german economy to perform well next year even if were to grow at a slower pace than 2007 . steinbrück said domestic demand was picking up and exports would remain brisk , with demand from russia , eastern europe and asia offsetting a slowdown in us imports from the euro zone . referring to the strength of the euro against the dollar , he acknowledged that it would have an effect on germany , but said the stronger currency would curb the impact of higher oil prices , since crude is dollar-based . " for us europeans , we prefer a stronger euro to a weak one , " he told the financial daily . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 , named the socially outspoken bishop of trier , reinhard marx , as the new archbishop of munich . marx , 54 , is also head of the committee for social issues at the german bishops ' conference .
he will be succeeding the 79-year-old archbishop friedrich wetter , who retired last february due to his advanced age , but has stayed in office until his replacement takes over .
the munich archdiocese numbers around 2 million catholics and is considered one of the most important one in germany .
pope benedict xvi was himself the archbishop of munich before moving to rome to head the congregation for the doctrine of the faith in 1981 .
bavarian premier günther beckstein , who is a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - sister party to angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- - welcomed marx ' appointment and described him as a " highly convincing and principled man of the cloth who is , at the same time , eager to debate and humorous . "
a socially outspoken clergyman considered conservative in terms of the catholic doctrine , marx has been outspoken on social issues , demanding from german politicians to act against poverty , create jobs and accept refugees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gotthold hasenhüttl was suspended of his priesthood in 2003 while numerous church officials in germany welcomed marx ' appointment , praising his personal and professional qualities , theologian gotthold hasenhüttl criticized marx for " trying with all means to pursue a totally reactionary line in the catholic church . "
marx ' main idea was " that people are there for the intuition of the church , and not the other way around , " hasenhüttl told the saarländischer rundfunk radio .
hasenhüttl was stripped of his priesthood by marx in 2003 after he invited protestants to take part in the catholic eucharist during the ecumenical church day despite the vatican 's explicit prohibition of intercommunion .
the pope lashes out at atheism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict xvi strongly criticized modern-day atheism in his second enclytical meanwhile , pope benedict xvi on friday issued the second encyclical of his pontificate , using the story of st. josephine bakhita -lrb- 1869-1947 -rrb- - a former slave and later catholic nun and saint from darfur , sudan - to illustrate the theme of christian hope .
" let us put it very simply : man needs god , otherwise he remains without hope , " benedict wrote in the 70-page document , entitled in latin " spe salvi facti sumus " -lrb- in hope we are saved -rrb- .
the pope warned against what he sees as false hope based on " faith in progress , " tracing its origins to the french revolution and later , the communist ideology inspired by karl marx -lrb- not related to munich 's new archbishop -rrb- , who " forgot man and forgot man 's freedom . "
marxism , the pope wrote , had left behind " a trail of appalling destruction " because it failed to realize that man could not be " merely the product of economic conditions . "
italy 's union of atheists , agnostics and rationalists -lrb- uaar -rrb- criticized the pope for lashing out at atheists .
" the existence of a billion non-believers in the world should be enough to make the pope understand that man can live very well without god , but with reason , " the uaar said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 30.11.2007 foreign policy causing a rift in german coalition government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german leaders seem split on which red carpets they should step on a row has erupted over what should be the driving force behind germany 's foreign policy - economics or ethics .
it 's making the cracks in the german coalition government increasingly visible . the premier of the central german state of hesse , roland koch , on friday , nov .
30 , accused german foreign minister and vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier of pursuing a harmful foreign policy that is based solely on economic interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse premier roland koch has spared no words in lashing out at the foreign minister " germany has a historical obligation not to keep quiet about moral questions , " roland koch told the bild newspaper .
" we have no right to put economics above human rights . "
koch , who is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , passed judgment on steinmeier , a social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- , for " creating the impression in russia and china that we germans are ready to do any kind of business , even when human rights are being trampled on . "
" in doing so , the foreign minister is harming our country , " koch said .
the unusually strong rhetoric from the cdu politician is not only a sign of the strained relations in the grand coalition , but an indicator that foreign policy may play an important role in the campaigns leading up to the 2009 elections .
the right way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spd foreign policy expert rolf mützenich dismissed the criticism directed at the foreign minister .
" we advocate the anchoring of human rights in the international law , " mützenich told the dpa news agency .
the spd politician pointed out that china signed the most important human rights conventions and proved itself to be a responsible partner in the nuclear row with iran and north korea .
" those are the points of reference for a moral foreign policy , " he said .
during a visit to paris earlier in november , steinmeier told journalists he was " worried " about the escalating diplomatic tension between germany and china in the wake of the dalai lama 's visit with merkel .
in september , the chancellor met with the tibetan spiritual leader , whom chinese officials see as a dangerous separatist .
consequently , china axed a series of high level exchanges with germany , including a trip to beijing by finance minister peer steinbrück , planned for december .
the russian question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama has had a chilling effect on the relations with beijing china , however , is not the only foreign-policy wedge between the coalition partners .
german-russian relations were much more cordial during the previous german government , boosted by the flaunting camaraderie between the then chancellor , gerhard schröder , and russian president vladimir putin .
in a speech delivered in stuttgart on thursday , schröder - who was himself often criticized for turning a blind eye to putin 's human rights record , lashed out at germany 's foreign policy by saying he had the impression he was back " in the cold war era . "
some politicians were promoting a " distancing , even opposition to russia , " the former leader of the social democratic party said .
" i regard this approach as wrong , if not even dangerous , " he added .
less than a month after leaving the chancellor 's office in november 2005 , schröder was voted in as head of the supervisory board for a company that 's closely linked to the state-owned russian energy giant gazprom .
this move was seen by many in germany as ethically questionable if not complete unacceptable .
pursuing an ethical foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-russian relations were much closer under gerhard schröder merkel , on the other hand , said in a speech to the german parliament on wednesday that there was no difference between a foreign policy based on values and one pursuing german economic interests .
" human rights policy and representation of economic interests are two sides of the same coin , " merkel said .
" they should never be opposed to each another . "
merkel will get to test her diplomatic skills and her role as a champion of human rights at a summit between leaders of the european union and african states that is taking place in the portuguese capital of lisbon from dec .
7 - 9 .
the summit will also be attended by zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe , a dictator whose controversial policies of seizing white-owned commercial farms and threats to nationalize foreign-owned firms make him an uncomfortable politician to deal with in the eu .
unlike british prime minister gordon brown , who decided not to attend the summit because of the presence of the zimbabwean head of state , merkel declined to back calls for mugabe to be barred from the summit . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 marks the two-year anniversary of chancellor angela merkel 's arrival in office .

in the bundesliga , simunic has been playing for berlin since 2000 .
his teammates call him “ joe . ” dw-tv : now you 've been in berlin since 2000 - what 's it like living here on the other side of the world ?
josip simunic : it 's different .
the longer i 'm away from australia , the more i see how much australia is a beautiful country , probably the best country in the world .
the people here are very different to australia .
in australia the people are more friendly .
here also , but not to the extent that they are in australia .
when you think back to the last round of the bundesliga we saw ivan klasnic come back , one of your countrymen .
what emotions did that bring ?
i just got goosebumps now .
i 'm happy for ivan .
i hope he stays healthy , i hope that he has no more problems with his kidneys or anything else .
he 's a great example to show that when someone really wants to achieve something , they can achieve it .
like i said , i hope he stays healthy and scores a lot of goals for werder bremen .
you said at the start when you first came here that you were here to win the german championship .
that success has n't come in the last 7 years - why has n't it happened ?
in the past we 've had very good teams , but there were better teams than us .
you have to play 34 games in a season .
i think we had too many games where we were up there , we needed the win , but because of the added pressure , we did n't put in a good performance and get the result .
we also have the problem that a lot of players come and then they get better offers from other clubs , more money .
that 's also a problem , when you get offered three times as much to play in england .
football is not only about money but you have to try and situate yourself quickly .
to be too aggressive is sometimes not good for the team .
you have to pick the right moment where you are going to be aggressive in the interests of the team , in order to show the younger players in the team that they should get involved .
that takes also a little bit of time .
the body language is also important .
i 'm getting more used to it and learning when to make the right challenge at the right time .
at the moment , it seems sometimes the aggression goes too far ?
would you agree with that ?
i agree with that .
sometimes it does go too far .
but i have to say : the refereeing in germany is a bit soft .
when i compare it - i watch a lot of english games - it 's a big , big difference .
when i see how people go in to challenges in england .
here in germany , it 's a very big difference - unfortunately .
with the success that you gained in the bundesliga you then became a member of the croatian national team .
what was it like winning against england in london last week ?
it was a great feeling .
how can i explain it to you ?
in the world cup against australia , when we did n't make it through , it was a very , very drained feeling .
against england , to win at wembley , was the total opposite .
it was probably the nicest feeling i have had in my life , when it comes to football .
these sorts of moments , in the headlines in europe , is this the reason why you opted to play for croatia and not the country of your birth , australia ?
i 'm a proud australian .
but i also know where i come from , my heritage , my background .
and i 'm very proud of that .
i feel more croatian than australian .
another reason is the long flight to australia for games - that 's also a very big problem .
we have that problem now with some of our brazilian players .
what are your plans for 2008 ?
how do you see it going for you ?
always when someone asks me what my plans are , the most important plan is to stay healthy .
football wise : the biggest thing is to try to get in to the top half of the table for hertha bsc and to become european champions for croatia .
thanks very much for your time .
thank you , thanks .
are you living in berlin ?
i am living in berlin .
how long have you been here for ?
for two and a half years .

" if the resulting economic boom is not underpinned by structural adjustment in the us economy itself , but is achieved purely as the result of a weak currency , then the americans have gotten a bad deal , " he said . huge deficit spending has led to a free fall of the dollar , pushing the value of the euro to higher levels and was partly responsible for setting off turmoil in the world financial markets . earlier , german finance minister peer steinbrück said he did not expect the german economy to suffer too much from the current credit squeeze triggered by the us mortgage crisis . eu exports elsewhere to offset slack in us he told the financial times newspaper that he expected the german economy to perform well next year even if were to grow at a slower pace than 2007 . steinbrück said domestic demand was picking up and exports would remain brisk , with demand from russia , eastern europe and asia offsetting a slowdown in us imports from the euro zone . referring to the strength of the euro against the dollar , he acknowledged that it would have an effect on germany , but said the stronger currency would curb the impact of higher oil prices , since crude is dollar-based .

" if the resulting economic boom is not underpinned by structural adjustment in the us economy itself , but is achieved purely as the result of a weak currency , then the americans have gotten a bad deal , " he said . huge deficit spending has led to a free fall of the dollar , pushing the value of the euro to higher levels and was partly responsible for setting off turmoil in the world financial markets . earlier , german finance minister peer steinbrück said he did not expect the german economy to suffer too much from the current credit squeeze triggered by the us mortgage crisis . eu exports elsewhere to offset slack in us he told the financial times newspaper that he expected the german economy to perform well next year even if were to grow at a slower pace than 2007 . steinbrück said domestic demand was picking up and exports would remain brisk , with demand from russia , eastern europe and asia offsetting a slowdown in us imports from the euro zone . referring to the strength of the euro against the dollar , he acknowledged that it would have an effect on germany , but said the stronger currency would curb the impact of higher oil prices , since crude is dollar-based . " for us europeans , we prefer a stronger euro to a weak one , " he told the financial daily . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have no right to put economics above human rights . "
koch , who is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , passed judgment on steinmeier , a social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- , for " creating the impression in russia and china that we germans are ready to do any kind of business , even when human rights are being trampled on . "
" in doing so , the foreign minister is harming our country , " koch said .
the unusually strong rhetoric from the cdu politician is not only a sign of the strained relations in the grand coalition , but an indicator that foreign policy may play an important role in the campaigns leading up to the 2009 elections .

the spd politician pointed out that china signed the most important human rights conventions and proved itself to be a responsible partner in the nuclear row with iran and north korea .
" those are the points of reference for a moral foreign policy , " he said .
during a visit to paris earlier in november , steinmeier told journalists he was " worried " about the escalating diplomatic tension between germany and china in the wake of the dalai lama 's visit with merkel .
in september , the chancellor met with the tibetan spiritual leader , whom chinese officials see as a dangerous separatist .

some politicians were promoting a " distancing , even opposition to russia , " the former leader of the social democratic party said .
" i regard this approach as wrong , if not even dangerous , " he added .
less than a month after leaving the chancellor 's office in november 2005 , schröder was voted in as head of the supervisory board for a company that 's closely linked to the state-owned russian energy giant gazprom .
this move was seen by many in germany as ethically questionable if not complete unacceptable .

30 , overwhelmingly approved the federal budget of 283.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 417.4 billion -rrb- for 2008 , an increase of 4 percent from 2007 . lawmakers voted 408-144 in favor of the budget , which has provided for a slight increase in outlays for defense and economic assistance . defense spending will go up to 29.45 billion euros , up from 28.39 billion in 2007 .
the ministry for economic assistance , which is responsible for the distribution of germany 's overseas development aid , sees its share of the budget go up to 5.13 billion euros , an increase from 4.5 billion euros last year . the biggest slice , accounting for about 30 percent of the overall budget , has been earmarked for labor and social affairs . weak dollar blamed for slowdown in euro zone exports during the final day of the four-day debate , german economics minister michael glos appealed to the united states to slow down the dollar 's slide as european exporters come under growing exchange-rate pressure . glos said washington should not try to fix structural problems in the us economy by devaluing the dollar . " if the resulting economic boom is not underpinned by structural adjustment in the us economy itself , but is achieved purely as the result of a weak currency , then the americans have gotten a bad deal , " he said . huge deficit spending has led to a free fall of the dollar , pushing the value of the euro to higher levels and was partly responsible for setting off turmoil in the world financial markets . earlier , german finance minister peer steinbrück said he did not expect the german economy to suffer too much from the current credit squeeze triggered by the us mortgage crisis . eu exports elsewhere to offset slack in us he told the financial times newspaper that he expected the german economy to perform well next year even if were to grow at a slower pace than 2007 . steinbrück said domestic demand was picking up and exports would remain brisk , with demand from russia , eastern europe and asia offsetting a slowdown in us imports from the euro zone . referring to the strength of the euro against the dollar , he acknowledged that it would have an effect on germany , but said the stronger currency would curb the impact of higher oil prices , since crude is dollar-based . " for us europeans , we prefer a stronger euro to a weak one , " he told the financial daily . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 , on how the work for the long-delayed satellite navigation project galileo would be divided up among the 27 member countries . at an eu meeting of the bloc 's transport ministers , spain , which had made demands to host a ground station for a network of some 30 satellites , first dissented , but later agreed . under the current deal , the galileo program , which is budgeted at 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- and intended to reduce the eu 's reliance on the us global position system -lrb- gps -rrb- , plans to install only two ground control stations : one near munich and one in rome . no money for third ground station bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo should be fully operable by 2013 , barrot said " we just do n't have the money for a third ground station , " an unidentified eu diplomat told the associated press .
dominique bussereau , france 's deputy transport minister , however , suggested to the ap that spain ought to be awarded a galileo test center . under the compromise reached friday , spain 's " safety of life " center could " evolve into a fully qualified " control center by 2013 , allowing madrid to supervise operation of the satellites and their transmissions to earth .
" the spanish center , once it is up and running from a technical point of view , would act as a control center along with the others " in germany and italy , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot explained .
after a consortium of private companies abandoned galileo earlier this year due to a financing dispute , the european commission agreed last friday to fund the entire program , with most of the additional 2.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- in funding coming from leftover agricultural funds and the rest from research , transport and administration budgets .
germany wants its fair share of galileo projects as the biggest contributor to the eu budget , germany wants astrium , a german-dominated subsidiary of the european aerospace giant eads , to have a proportionate share of galileo contracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite images can pinpoint the precise location of iranian nuclear sites - or anywhere else the main issue hacked out by the transport ministers was how to slice the galileo pie among european companies .
while competition rules would normally dictate that contracts be awarded on a best-offer basis , the european space industry is concentrated into a few main groups which have demanded a higher share of the lucrative business . the agreement , however , does not allow a single company to obtain an inordinately large portion of the project 's contracts . " galileo will become the spearhead for european technology , " barrot told reporters .
" we are on the way towards putting galileo into operation for 2013 and to offer europeans very many services . " the galileo project has been plagued by delays and is already running five years behind schedule with only one test satellite up in orbit .

" " the american tide is receding and they would eventually return to their home across the atlantic , " he said .

30 , overwhelmingly approved the federal budget of 283.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 417.4 billion -rrb- for 2008 , an increase of 4 percent from 2007 . lawmakers voted 408-144 in favor of the budget , which has provided for a slight increase in outlays for defense and economic assistance . defense spending will go up to 29.45 billion euros , up from 28.39 billion in 2007 .
the ministry for economic assistance , which is responsible for the distribution of germany 's overseas development aid , sees its share of the budget go up to 5.13 billion euros , an increase from 4.5 billion euros last year . the biggest slice , accounting for about 30 percent of the overall budget , has been earmarked for labor and social affairs . weak dollar blamed for slowdown in euro zone exports during the final day of the four-day debate , german economics minister michael glos appealed to the united states to slow down the dollar 's slide as european exporters come under growing exchange-rate pressure . glos said washington should not try to fix structural problems in the us economy by devaluing the dollar . " if the resulting economic boom is not underpinned by structural adjustment in the us economy itself , but is achieved purely as the result of a weak currency , then the americans have gotten a bad deal , " he said . huge deficit spending has led to a free fall of the dollar , pushing the value of the euro to higher levels and was partly responsible for setting off turmoil in the world financial markets . earlier , german finance minister peer steinbrück said he did not expect the german economy to suffer too much from the current credit squeeze triggered by the us mortgage crisis . eu exports elsewhere to offset slack in us he told the financial times newspaper that he expected the german economy to perform well next year even if were to grow at a slower pace than 2007 . steinbrück said domestic demand was picking up and exports would remain brisk , with demand from russia , eastern europe and asia offsetting a slowdown in us imports from the euro zone . referring to the strength of the euro against the dollar , he acknowledged that it would have an effect on germany , but said the stronger currency would curb the impact of higher oil prices , since crude is dollar-based . " for us europeans , we prefer a stronger euro to a weak one , " he told the financial daily . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the people here are very different to australia .
in australia the people are more friendly .

what emotions did that bring ?
i just got goosebumps now .
i 'm happy for ivan .
i hope he stays healthy , i hope that he has no more problems with his kidneys or anything else .
he 's a great example to show that when someone really wants to achieve something , they can achieve it .
like i said , i hope he stays healthy and scores a lot of goals for werder bremen .
you said at the start when you first came here that you were here to win the german championship .
that success has n't come in the last 7 years - why has n't it happened ?
in the past we 've had very good teams , but there were better teams than us .
you have to play 34 games in a season .
i think we had too many games where we were up there , we needed the win , but because of the added pressure , we did n't put in a good performance and get the result .
we also have the problem that a lot of players come and then they get better offers from other clubs , more money .
that 's also a problem , when you get offered three times as much to play in england .
football is not only about money but you have to try and situate yourself quickly .
to be too aggressive is sometimes not good for the team .
you have to pick the right moment where you are going to be aggressive in the interests of the team , in order to show the younger players in the team that they should get involved .
that takes also a little bit of time .
the body language is also important .
i 'm getting more used to it and learning when to make the right challenge at the right time .
at the moment , it seems sometimes the aggression goes too far ?
would you agree with that ?
i agree with that .
sometimes it does go too far .
but i have to say : the refereeing in germany is a bit soft .
when i compare it - i watch a lot of english games - it 's a big , big difference .
when i see how people go in to challenges in england .
here in germany , it 's a very big difference - unfortunately .
with the success that you gained in the bundesliga you then became a member of the croatian national team .
what was it like winning against england in london last week ?
it was a great feeling .
how can i explain it to you ?
in the world cup against australia , when we did n't make it through , it was a very , very drained feeling .
against england , to win at wembley , was the total opposite .
it was probably the nicest feeling i have had in my life , when it comes to football .
these sorts of moments , in the headlines in europe , is this the reason why you opted to play for croatia and not the country of your birth , australia ?
i 'm a proud australian .
but i also know where i come from , my heritage , my background .
and i 'm very proud of that .
i feel more croatian than australian .
another reason is the long flight to australia for games - that 's also a very big problem .
we have that problem now with some of our brazilian players .
what are your plans for 2008 ?
how do you see it going for you ?
always when someone asks me what my plans are , the most important plan is to stay healthy .
football wise : the biggest thing is to try to get in to the top half of the table for hertha bsc and to become european champions for croatia .
thanks very much for your time .
thank you , thanks .

i am living in berlin .

30 , on how the work for the long-delayed satellite navigation project galileo would be divided up among the 27 member countries . at an eu meeting of the bloc 's transport ministers , spain , which had made demands to host a ground station for a network of some 30 satellites , first dissented , but later agreed . under the current deal , the galileo program , which is budgeted at 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- and intended to reduce the eu 's reliance on the us global position system -lrb- gps -rrb- , plans to install only two ground control stations : one near munich and one in rome . no money for third ground station bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo should be fully operable by 2013 , barrot said " we just do n't have the money for a third ground station , " an unidentified eu diplomat told the associated press .
dominique bussereau , france 's deputy transport minister , however , suggested to the ap that spain ought to be awarded a galileo test center . under the compromise reached friday , spain 's " safety of life " center could " evolve into a fully qualified " control center by 2013 , allowing madrid to supervise operation of the satellites and their transmissions to earth .
" the spanish center , once it is up and running from a technical point of view , would act as a control center along with the others " in germany and italy , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot explained .
after a consortium of private companies abandoned galileo earlier this year due to a financing dispute , the european commission agreed last friday to fund the entire program , with most of the additional 2.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- in funding coming from leftover agricultural funds and the rest from research , transport and administration budgets .
germany wants its fair share of galileo projects as the biggest contributor to the eu budget , germany wants astrium , a german-dominated subsidiary of the european aerospace giant eads , to have a proportionate share of galileo contracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite images can pinpoint the precise location of iranian nuclear sites - or anywhere else the main issue hacked out by the transport ministers was how to slice the galileo pie among european companies .
while competition rules would normally dictate that contracts be awarded on a best-offer basis , the european space industry is concentrated into a few main groups which have demanded a higher share of the lucrative business . the agreement , however , does not allow a single company to obtain an inordinately large portion of the project 's contracts . " galileo will become the spearhead for european technology , " barrot told reporters .
" we are on the way towards putting galileo into operation for 2013 and to offer europeans very many services . " the galileo project has been plagued by delays and is already running five years behind schedule with only one test satellite up in orbit .
at least 1 billion euros of taxpayer money have already been spent . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bavarian premier günther beckstein , who is a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - sister party to angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- - welcomed marx ' appointment and described him as a " highly convincing and principled man of the cloth who is , at the same time , eager to debate and humorous .

30 , overwhelmingly approved the federal budget of 283.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 417.4 billion -rrb- for 2008 , an increase of 4 percent from 2007 . lawmakers voted 408-144 in favor of the budget , which has provided for a slight increase in outlays for defense and economic assistance . defense spending will go up to 29.45 billion euros , up from 28.39 billion in 2007 .
the ministry for economic assistance , which is responsible for the distribution of germany 's overseas development aid , sees its share of the budget go up to 5.13 billion euros , an increase from 4.5 billion euros last year . the biggest slice , accounting for about 30 percent of the overall budget , has been earmarked for labor and social affairs . weak dollar blamed for slowdown in euro zone exports during the final day of the four-day debate , german economics minister michael glos appealed to the united states to slow down the dollar 's slide as european exporters come under growing exchange-rate pressure . glos said washington should not try to fix structural problems in the us economy by devaluing the dollar . " if the resulting economic boom is not underpinned by structural adjustment in the us economy itself , but is achieved purely as the result of a weak currency , then the americans have gotten a bad deal , " he said . huge deficit spending has led to a free fall of the dollar , pushing the value of the euro to higher levels and was partly responsible for setting off turmoil in the world financial markets . earlier , german finance minister peer steinbrück said he did not expect the german economy to suffer too much from the current credit squeeze triggered by the us mortgage crisis . eu exports elsewhere to offset slack in us he told the financial times newspaper that he expected the german economy to perform well next year even if were to grow at a slower pace than 2007 . steinbrück said domestic demand was picking up and exports would remain brisk , with demand from russia , eastern europe and asia offsetting a slowdown in us imports from the euro zone . referring to the strength of the euro against the dollar , he acknowledged that it would have an effect on germany , but said the stronger currency would curb the impact of higher oil prices , since crude is dollar-based . " for us europeans , we prefer a stronger euro to a weak one , " he told the financial daily . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it 's no easy task as violence , drugs and poverty remain even as the country has entered a relatively peaceful time . cartagena , its graceful city center hugging the caribbean coast , is a colonial-era jewel encircled by modern day poverty and persistent violence .
home to more than 1 million people , the city illustrates the complex situation faced by colombia as it tries to return to normalcy after decades of armed conflict . the united nations world tourism organization met in cartagena this week and colombia officials were eager to change perceptions of the country .
colombian president alvaro uribe , whose law-and-order policies have brought some stability to the country , bore the message that his country was ready for european and american tourists to arrive and open their wallets . " you are visiting a country that has suffered greatly , but has a tremendous amount of hope , " he said . real world problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cartagena 's historic city center is a unesco world heritage site but even as delegates met , the reality of life outside cartagena 's heavily-guarded convention center seeped in and painted a bleak picture of life with few public services and no police protection . between 2 million and 3 million colombians have fled their homes to escape ongoing paramilitary hostilities and are living in extreme poverty in the suburbs of cities such as cartagena .
newspapers also regularly carry reports of murders and other drug-related violence . uribe said he knows it 's news like this which has kept the number of europeans who visit colombia each year small : about 125,700 arrived in the first nine months of 2007 .
most came from former colonial power spain . " terrorism puts a stop to all our possibilities , " he said referring to fighting between left-wing guerillas , right-wing paramilitaries , the military and drug lords .
" without terrorism , we 'll have tourism .
without terrorism , we 'll be happy . " some positives , many problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the growing economy has led to a building boom in cartagena the colombian government points to statistics which show that in recent years the murder rate has been cut in half and kidnappings are down 75 percent .
the country is also experiencing an economic boom officials hope will help bring in tourist dollars and help meet an ambitious goal of attracting 4 million foreign tourists to the country by 2010 . the economy had 6.8 percent growth in 2006 and is headed for 7.48 percent this year .
in cartagena , luxury hotels are springing up and it 's become a routine stop on the caribbean cruise circuit . but even as the tourist industry proclaims its slogan , " colombia , the only risk is wanting to stay , " and luxury hotels spring up along the country 's beaches and growth heads to 7.48 percent this year , the government acknowledges that parts of the country are not safe for visitors . eu aid a lifeline to locals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cartagena looks very different from outside the convention center while the colombian government said that eventually tourism will improve people 's lives , it will remain dependent on international development aid . the european union will provide 160 million euros -lrb- $ 216 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to colombia between 2007-2013 .
but unlike the united states , which focuses on giving money to fight colombia 's illicit drug trade , the eu will direct aid directly to victims and non-governmental organizations which help them . european donors are a lifeline for many local aid organizations in the country , but money - from both tourism and the government - does n't always appear as promised , said maria amparo gomez , a dominican nun who runs a school in cartagena . " there are two cartagenas that are very well separated from each other , " she said . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

marxism , the pope wrote , had left behind " a trail of appalling destruction " because it failed to realize that man could not be " merely the product of economic conditions . "
italy 's union of atheists , agnostics and rationalists -lrb- uaar -rrb- criticized the pope for lashing out at atheists .
" the existence of a billion non-believers in the world should be enough to make the pope understand that man can live very well without god , but with reason , " the uaar said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 . indian prime minister manmohan singh announced that both sides were committed to controlling global emissions .
he added that india and the eu were working towards pragmatic solutions with industrialized nations and developing countries sharing the burden in accordance with population size and level of economic development . " in order to achieve this , global action is needed by all parties , according to their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities , with developed countries taking the lead , " said singh and portuguese prime minister jose socrates in a joint statement .
portugal holds the six-month eu presidency until the end of this year . measures provide allowances for developing nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is especially vulnerable to floods and monsoons exacerbated by climate change as a huge developing country , india , which is one of the world 's biggest polluters , is not obliged to make cuts in greenhouse gas emissions under the kyoto protocol .
singh emphasized that developing nations should not be held to the same standard on emissions as europe , and called for measures on climate change that do not " perpetuate poverty . " india and the eu agreed that the upcoming climate change conference in bali , indonesia , which runs from dec .
3-14 , should come up with a clear roadmap for controlling emissions beyond 2012 within a united nations framework when kyoto expires . " this compromise must be obtained within common but different responsibilities , " socrates said . bilateral trade pact to greatly boost india-eu trade the meeting marked the eighth eu-india summit and seeks to forge a closer strategic alliance and deepen cooperation on trade issues as well .
trade talks covered both a comprehensive bilateral eu-india trade agreement and the comprehensive doha round of international trade talks under the umbrella of the world trade organization . singh indicated that he hoped that the trade and investment agreement that was negotiated could be in place by the next annual summit in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is the world 's fastest growing economy after china european commission president jose manuel barroso , who was also present at the summit , said that the trade pact was an ambitious one and would boost bilateral trade tremendously .
india-eu trade stood at about 47 billion euros last year . the eu is india 's largest trading partner accounting for nearly 20 percent of the south asian nation 's total trade .
it is also largest source of direct foreign investment .
the total investment flow from the eu into india amounted to nearly $ 11 billion in the period from august 1991 to february 2007 according to indian government sources . the eu has earmarked 470 million euros -lrb- $ 690 million -rrb- to promote economic development over the next five years , according to an article that barroso wrote in the indian media on friday . both sides also signed an agreement to strengthen cooperation in science and technology .
the eu agreed to provide seven million euros for setting up the european business and technology center in new delhi in order to promote further links between the business and scientific communities . deal to lower trade barriers may be reached at end of 2008 india , the world 's fastest growing economy after china , needs new export markets to maintain its record growth .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , who was also in attendance , said an agreement with the european union to lower tariffs and increase trade may be reached in one year 's time . india 's exports , however , account for less than 2 percent of overall eu imports , and european companies have invested 10 times more in china than in india over the last five years . other topics on the summit agenda were a possible civilian nuclear cooperation accord with the united states , which would provide india with access to american technology after a 30 year embargo .
india would first need to negotiate a safeguards agreement with the international atomic energy agency before us president bush can seek approval from congress to make such an agreement operational . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 , on how the work for the long-delayed satellite navigation project galileo would be divided up among the 27 member countries . at an eu meeting of the bloc 's transport ministers , spain , which had made demands to host a ground station for a network of some 30 satellites , first dissented , but later agreed . under the current deal , the galileo program , which is budgeted at 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- and intended to reduce the eu 's reliance on the us global position system -lrb- gps -rrb- , plans to install only two ground control stations : one near munich and one in rome . no money for third ground station bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo should be fully operable by 2013 , barrot said " we just do n't have the money for a third ground station , " an unidentified eu diplomat told the associated press .
dominique bussereau , france 's deputy transport minister , however , suggested to the ap that spain ought to be awarded a galileo test center . under the compromise reached friday , spain 's " safety of life " center could " evolve into a fully qualified " control center by 2013 , allowing madrid to supervise operation of the satellites and their transmissions to earth .
" the spanish center , once it is up and running from a technical point of view , would act as a control center along with the others " in germany and italy , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot explained .
after a consortium of private companies abandoned galileo earlier this year due to a financing dispute , the european commission agreed last friday to fund the entire program , with most of the additional 2.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- in funding coming from leftover agricultural funds and the rest from research , transport and administration budgets .

while competition rules would normally dictate that contracts be awarded on a best-offer basis , the european space industry is concentrated into a few main groups which have demanded a higher share of the lucrative business . the agreement , however , does not allow a single company to obtain an inordinately large portion of the project 's contracts . " galileo will become the spearhead for european technology , " barrot told reporters .
" we are on the way towards putting galileo into operation for 2013 and to offer europeans very many services . " the galileo project has been plagued by delays and is already running five years behind schedule with only one test satellite up in orbit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home : dw-tv asien bundesliga -pipe- 30.11.2007 josip simunic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josip simunic was born and raised in australia , but plays his international football for his parents ' homeland , croatia .
in the bundesliga , simunic has been playing for berlin since 2000 .
his teammates call him “ joe . ” dw-tv : now you 've been in berlin since 2000 - what 's it like living here on the other side of the world ?
josip simunic : it 's different .
the longer i 'm away from australia , the more i see how much australia is a beautiful country , probably the best country in the world .
the people here are very different to australia .
in australia the people are more friendly .
here also , but not to the extent that they are in australia .
when you think back to the last round of the bundesliga we saw ivan klasnic come back , one of your countrymen .
what emotions did that bring ?
i just got goosebumps now .
i 'm happy for ivan .
i hope he stays healthy , i hope that he has no more problems with his kidneys or anything else .
he 's a great example to show that when someone really wants to achieve something , they can achieve it .
like i said , i hope he stays healthy and scores a lot of goals for werder bremen .
you said at the start when you first came here that you were here to win the german championship .
that success has n't come in the last 7 years - why has n't it happened ?
in the past we 've had very good teams , but there were better teams than us .
you have to play 34 games in a season .
i think we had too many games where we were up there , we needed the win , but because of the added pressure , we did n't put in a good performance and get the result .
we also have the problem that a lot of players come and then they get better offers from other clubs , more money .
that 's also a problem , when you get offered three times as much to play in england .
football is not only about money but you have to try and situate yourself quickly .
to be too aggressive is sometimes not good for the team .
you have to pick the right moment where you are going to be aggressive in the interests of the team , in order to show the younger players in the team that they should get involved .
that takes also a little bit of time .
the body language is also important .
i 'm getting more used to it and learning when to make the right challenge at the right time .
at the moment , it seems sometimes the aggression goes too far ?
would you agree with that ?
i agree with that .
sometimes it does go too far .
but i have to say : the refereeing in germany is a bit soft .
when i compare it - i watch a lot of english games - it 's a big , big difference .
when i see how people go in to challenges in england .
here in germany , it 's a very big difference - unfortunately .
with the success that you gained in the bundesliga you then became a member of the croatian national team .
what was it like winning against england in london last week ?
it was a great feeling .
how can i explain it to you ?
in the world cup against australia , when we did n't make it through , it was a very , very drained feeling .
against england , to win at wembley , was the total opposite .
it was probably the nicest feeling i have had in my life , when it comes to football .
these sorts of moments , in the headlines in europe , is this the reason why you opted to play for croatia and not the country of your birth , australia ?
i 'm a proud australian .
but i also know where i come from , my heritage , my background .
and i 'm very proud of that .
i feel more croatian than australian .
another reason is the long flight to australia for games - that 's also a very big problem .
we have that problem now with some of our brazilian players .
what are your plans for 2008 ?

in the bundesliga , simunic has been playing for berlin since 2000 .
his teammates call him “ joe . ” dw-tv : now you 've been in berlin since 2000 - what 's it like living here on the other side of the world ?
josip simunic : it 's different .
the longer i 'm away from australia , the more i see how much australia is a beautiful country , probably the best country in the world .
the people here are very different to australia .
in australia the people are more friendly .
here also , but not to the extent that they are in australia .
when you think back to the last round of the bundesliga we saw ivan klasnic come back , one of your countrymen .
what emotions did that bring ?
i just got goosebumps now .
i 'm happy for ivan .
i hope he stays healthy , i hope that he has no more problems with his kidneys or anything else .
he 's a great example to show that when someone really wants to achieve something , they can achieve it .
like i said , i hope he stays healthy and scores a lot of goals for werder bremen .
you said at the start when you first came here that you were here to win the german championship .
that success has n't come in the last 7 years - why has n't it happened ?
in the past we 've had very good teams , but there were better teams than us .
you have to play 34 games in a season .
i think we had too many games where we were up there , we needed the win , but because of the added pressure , we did n't put in a good performance and get the result .
we also have the problem that a lot of players come and then they get better offers from other clubs , more money .
that 's also a problem , when you get offered three times as much to play in england .
football is not only about money but you have to try and situate yourself quickly .
to be too aggressive is sometimes not good for the team .
you have to pick the right moment where you are going to be aggressive in the interests of the team , in order to show the younger players in the team that they should get involved .
that takes also a little bit of time .
the body language is also important .
i 'm getting more used to it and learning when to make the right challenge at the right time .
at the moment , it seems sometimes the aggression goes too far ?
would you agree with that ?
i agree with that .
sometimes it does go too far .
but i have to say : the refereeing in germany is a bit soft .
when i compare it - i watch a lot of english games - it 's a big , big difference .
when i see how people go in to challenges in england .
here in germany , it 's a very big difference - unfortunately .
with the success that you gained in the bundesliga you then became a member of the croatian national team .
what was it like winning against england in london last week ?
it was a great feeling .
how can i explain it to you ?
in the world cup against australia , when we did n't make it through , it was a very , very drained feeling .
against england , to win at wembley , was the total opposite .
it was probably the nicest feeling i have had in my life , when it comes to football .
these sorts of moments , in the headlines in europe , is this the reason why you opted to play for croatia and not the country of your birth , australia ?
i 'm a proud australian .
but i also know where i come from , my heritage , my background .
and i 'm very proud of that .
i feel more croatian than australian .
another reason is the long flight to australia for games - that 's also a very big problem .
we have that problem now with some of our brazilian players .
what are your plans for 2008 ?
how do you see it going for you ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 30.11.2007 eu agrees on galileo contract award scheme großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only one test satellite has gone up in orbit with 1 billion euros in taxpayer money after agreeing to pay for galileo entirely from public funds , eu transport ministers decided how contracts for the satellite navigation system would be parceled out to european companies . european union ministers reached an agreement on friday , nov .
30 , on how the work for the long-delayed satellite navigation project galileo would be divided up among the 27 member countries . at an eu meeting of the bloc 's transport ministers , spain , which had made demands to host a ground station for a network of some 30 satellites , first dissented , but later agreed . under the current deal , the galileo program , which is budgeted at 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- and intended to reduce the eu 's reliance on the us global position system -lrb- gps -rrb- , plans to install only two ground control stations : one near munich and one in rome . no money for third ground station bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo should be fully operable by 2013 , barrot said " we just do n't have the money for a third ground station , " an unidentified eu diplomat told the associated press .
dominique bussereau , france 's deputy transport minister , however , suggested to the ap that spain ought to be awarded a galileo test center . under the compromise reached friday , spain 's " safety of life " center could " evolve into a fully qualified " control center by 2013 , allowing madrid to supervise operation of the satellites and their transmissions to earth .
" the spanish center , once it is up and running from a technical point of view , would act as a control center along with the others " in germany and italy , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot explained .
after a consortium of private companies abandoned galileo earlier this year due to a financing dispute , the european commission agreed last friday to fund the entire program , with most of the additional 2.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- in funding coming from leftover agricultural funds and the rest from research , transport and administration budgets .
germany wants its fair share of galileo projects as the biggest contributor to the eu budget , germany wants astrium , a german-dominated subsidiary of the european aerospace giant eads , to have a proportionate share of galileo contracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite images can pinpoint the precise location of iranian nuclear sites - or anywhere else the main issue hacked out by the transport ministers was how to slice the galileo pie among european companies .
while competition rules would normally dictate that contracts be awarded on a best-offer basis , the european space industry is concentrated into a few main groups which have demanded a higher share of the lucrative business . the agreement , however , does not allow a single company to obtain an inordinately large portion of the project 's contracts . " galileo will become the spearhead for european technology , " barrot told reporters .
" we are on the way towards putting galileo into operation for 2013 and to offer europeans very many services . " the galileo project has been plagued by delays and is already running five years behind schedule with only one test satellite up in orbit .
at least 1 billion euros of taxpayer money have already been spent . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 . indian prime minister manmohan singh announced that both sides were committed to controlling global emissions .
he added that india and the eu were working towards pragmatic solutions with industrialized nations and developing countries sharing the burden in accordance with population size and level of economic development . " in order to achieve this , global action is needed by all parties , according to their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities , with developed countries taking the lead , " said singh and portuguese prime minister jose socrates in a joint statement .
portugal holds the six-month eu presidency until the end of this year . measures provide allowances for developing nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is especially vulnerable to floods and monsoons exacerbated by climate change as a huge developing country , india , which is one of the world 's biggest polluters , is not obliged to make cuts in greenhouse gas emissions under the kyoto protocol .
singh emphasized that developing nations should not be held to the same standard on emissions as europe , and called for measures on climate change that do not " perpetuate poverty . " india and the eu agreed that the upcoming climate change conference in bali , indonesia , which runs from dec .
3-14 , should come up with a clear roadmap for controlling emissions beyond 2012 within a united nations framework when kyoto expires . " this compromise must be obtained within common but different responsibilities , " socrates said . bilateral trade pact to greatly boost india-eu trade the meeting marked the eighth eu-india summit and seeks to forge a closer strategic alliance and deepen cooperation on trade issues as well .
trade talks covered both a comprehensive bilateral eu-india trade agreement and the comprehensive doha round of international trade talks under the umbrella of the world trade organization . singh indicated that he hoped that the trade and investment agreement that was negotiated could be in place by the next annual summit in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is the world 's fastest growing economy after china european commission president jose manuel barroso , who was also present at the summit , said that the trade pact was an ambitious one and would boost bilateral trade tremendously .

it is also largest source of direct foreign investment .

eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , who was also in attendance , said an agreement with the european union to lower tariffs and increase trade may be reached in one year 's time . india 's exports , however , account for less than 2 percent of overall eu imports , and european companies have invested 10 times more in china than in india over the last five years . other topics on the summit agenda were a possible civilian nuclear cooperation accord with the united states , which would provide india with access to american technology after a 30 year embargo .
india would first need to negotiate a safeguards agreement with the international atomic energy agency before us president bush can seek approval from congress to make such an agreement operational . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 , named the socially outspoken bishop of trier , reinhard marx , as the new archbishop of munich . marx , 54 , is also head of the committee for social issues at the german bishops ' conference .
he will be succeeding the 79-year-old archbishop friedrich wetter , who retired last february due to his advanced age , but has stayed in office until his replacement takes over .
the munich archdiocese numbers around 2 million catholics and is considered one of the most important one in germany .
pope benedict xvi was himself the archbishop of munich before moving to rome to head the congregation for the doctrine of the faith in 1981 .
bavarian premier günther beckstein , who is a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - sister party to angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- - welcomed marx ' appointment and described him as a " highly convincing and principled man of the cloth who is , at the same time , eager to debate and humorous . "
a socially outspoken clergyman considered conservative in terms of the catholic doctrine , marx has been outspoken on social issues , demanding from german politicians to act against poverty , create jobs and accept refugees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gotthold hasenhüttl was suspended of his priesthood in 2003 while numerous church officials in germany welcomed marx ' appointment , praising his personal and professional qualities , theologian gotthold hasenhüttl criticized marx for " trying with all means to pursue a totally reactionary line in the catholic church . "
marx ' main idea was " that people are there for the intuition of the church , and not the other way around , " hasenhüttl told the saarländischer rundfunk radio .
hasenhüttl was stripped of his priesthood by marx in 2003 after he invited protestants to take part in the catholic eucharist during the ecumenical church day despite the vatican 's explicit prohibition of intercommunion .
the pope lashes out at atheism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict xvi strongly criticized modern-day atheism in his second enclytical meanwhile , pope benedict xvi on friday issued the second encyclical of his pontificate , using the story of st. josephine bakhita -lrb- 1869-1947 -rrb- - a former slave and later catholic nun and saint from darfur , sudan - to illustrate the theme of christian hope .
" let us put it very simply : man needs god , otherwise he remains without hope , " benedict wrote in the 70-page document , entitled in latin " spe salvi facti sumus " -lrb- in hope we are saved -rrb- .
the pope warned against what he sees as false hope based on " faith in progress , " tracing its origins to the french revolution and later , the communist ideology inspired by karl marx -lrb- not related to munich 's new archbishop -rrb- , who " forgot man and forgot man 's freedom . "
marxism , the pope wrote , had left behind " a trail of appalling destruction " because it failed to realize that man could not be " merely the product of economic conditions . "
italy 's union of atheists , agnostics and rationalists -lrb- uaar -rrb- criticized the pope for lashing out at atheists .
" the existence of a billion non-believers in the world should be enough to make the pope understand that man can live very well without god , but with reason , " the uaar said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's making the cracks in the german coalition government increasingly visible . the premier of the central german state of hesse , roland koch , on friday , nov .
30 , accused german foreign minister and vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier of pursuing a harmful foreign policy that is based solely on economic interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse premier roland koch has spared no words in lashing out at the foreign minister " germany has a historical obligation not to keep quiet about moral questions , " roland koch told the bild newspaper .
" we have no right to put economics above human rights . "
koch , who is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , passed judgment on steinmeier , a social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- , for " creating the impression in russia and china that we germans are ready to do any kind of business , even when human rights are being trampled on . "
" in doing so , the foreign minister is harming our country , " koch said .
the unusually strong rhetoric from the cdu politician is not only a sign of the strained relations in the grand coalition , but an indicator that foreign policy may play an important role in the campaigns leading up to the 2009 elections .
the right way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spd foreign policy expert rolf mützenich dismissed the criticism directed at the foreign minister .
" we advocate the anchoring of human rights in the international law , " mützenich told the dpa news agency .
the spd politician pointed out that china signed the most important human rights conventions and proved itself to be a responsible partner in the nuclear row with iran and north korea .
" those are the points of reference for a moral foreign policy , " he said .
during a visit to paris earlier in november , steinmeier told journalists he was " worried " about the escalating diplomatic tension between germany and china in the wake of the dalai lama 's visit with merkel .
in september , the chancellor met with the tibetan spiritual leader , whom chinese officials see as a dangerous separatist .
consequently , china axed a series of high level exchanges with germany , including a trip to beijing by finance minister peer steinbrück , planned for december .
the russian question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama has had a chilling effect on the relations with beijing china , however , is not the only foreign-policy wedge between the coalition partners .
german-russian relations were much more cordial during the previous german government , boosted by the flaunting camaraderie between the then chancellor , gerhard schröder , and russian president vladimir putin .
in a speech delivered in stuttgart on thursday , schröder - who was himself often criticized for turning a blind eye to putin 's human rights record , lashed out at germany 's foreign policy by saying he had the impression he was back " in the cold war era . "
some politicians were promoting a " distancing , even opposition to russia , " the former leader of the social democratic party said .
" i regard this approach as wrong , if not even dangerous , " he added .
less than a month after leaving the chancellor 's office in november 2005 , schröder was voted in as head of the supervisory board for a company that 's closely linked to the state-owned russian energy giant gazprom .
this move was seen by many in germany as ethically questionable if not complete unacceptable .
pursuing an ethical foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-russian relations were much closer under gerhard schröder merkel , on the other hand , said in a speech to the german parliament on wednesday that there was no difference between a foreign policy based on values and one pursuing german economic interests .
" human rights policy and representation of economic interests are two sides of the same coin , " merkel said .
" they should never be opposed to each another . "
merkel will get to test her diplomatic skills and her role as a champion of human rights at a summit between leaders of the european union and african states that is taking place in the portuguese capital of lisbon from dec .
7 - 9 .
the summit will also be attended by zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe , a dictator whose controversial policies of seizing white-owned commercial farms and threats to nationalize foreign-owned firms make him an uncomfortable politician to deal with in the eu .
unlike british prime minister gordon brown , who decided not to attend the summit because of the presence of the zimbabwean head of state , merkel declined to back calls for mugabe to be barred from the summit . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" they should never be opposed to each another . "
merkel will get to test her diplomatic skills and her role as a champion of human rights at a summit between leaders of the european union and african states that is taking place in the portuguese capital of lisbon from dec .
7 - 9 .
the summit will also be attended by zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe , a dictator whose controversial policies of seizing white-owned commercial farms and threats to nationalize foreign-owned firms make him an uncomfortable politician to deal with in the eu .
unlike british prime minister gordon brown , who decided not to attend the summit because of the presence of the zimbabwean head of state , merkel declined to back calls for mugabe to be barred from the summit . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 , overwhelmingly approved the federal budget of 283.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 417.4 billion -rrb- for 2008 , an increase of 4 percent from 2007 . lawmakers voted 408-144 in favor of the budget , which has provided for a slight increase in outlays for defense and economic assistance . defense spending will go up to 29.45 billion euros , up from 28.39 billion in 2007 .
the ministry for economic assistance , which is responsible for the distribution of germany 's overseas development aid , sees its share of the budget go up to 5.13 billion euros , an increase from 4.5 billion euros last year . the biggest slice , accounting for about 30 percent of the overall budget , has been earmarked for labor and social affairs . weak dollar blamed for slowdown in euro zone exports during the final day of the four-day debate , german economics minister michael glos appealed to the united states to slow down the dollar 's slide as european exporters come under growing exchange-rate pressure . glos said washington should not try to fix structural problems in the us economy by devaluing the dollar . " if the resulting economic boom is not underpinned by structural adjustment in the us economy itself , but is achieved purely as the result of a weak currency , then the americans have gotten a bad deal , " he said . huge deficit spending has led to a free fall of the dollar , pushing the value of the euro to higher levels and was partly responsible for setting off turmoil in the world financial markets . earlier , german finance minister peer steinbrück said he did not expect the german economy to suffer too much from the current credit squeeze triggered by the us mortgage crisis . eu exports elsewhere to offset slack in us he told the financial times newspaper that he expected the german economy to perform well next year even if were to grow at a slower pace than 2007 . steinbrück said domestic demand was picking up and exports would remain brisk , with demand from russia , eastern europe and asia offsetting a slowdown in us imports from the euro zone . referring to the strength of the euro against the dollar , he acknowledged that it would have an effect on germany , but said the stronger currency would curb the impact of higher oil prices , since crude is dollar-based . " for us europeans , we prefer a stronger euro to a weak one , " he told the financial daily . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home : dw-tv asia + bundesliga -pipe- 30.11.2007 josip simunic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josip simunic was born and raised in australia , but plays his international football for his parents ' homeland , croatia .
in the bundesliga , simunic has been playing for berlin since 2000 .
his teammates call him “ joe . ” dw-tv : now you 've been in berlin since 2000 - what 's it like living here on the other side of the world ?
josip simunic : it 's different .
the longer i 'm away from australia , the more i see how much australia is a beautiful country , probably the best country in the world .
the people here are very different to australia .
in australia the people are more friendly .
here also , but not to the extent that they are in australia .
when you think back to the last round of the bundesliga we saw ivan klasnic come back , one of your countrymen .
what emotions did that bring ?
i just got goosebumps now .
i 'm happy for ivan .
i hope he stays healthy , i hope that he has no more problems with his kidneys or anything else .
he 's a great example to show that when someone really wants to achieve something , they can achieve it .
like i said , i hope he stays healthy and scores a lot of goals for werder bremen .
you said at the start when you first came here that you were here to win the german championship .
that success has n't come in the last 7 years - why has n't it happened ?
in the past we 've had very good teams , but there were better teams than us .
you have to play 34 games in a season .
i think we had too many games where we were up there , we needed the win , but because of the added pressure , we did n't put in a good performance and get the result .
we also have the problem that a lot of players come and then they get better offers from other clubs , more money .
that 's also a problem , when you get offered three times as much to play in england .
football is not only about money but you have to try and situate yourself quickly .
to be too aggressive is sometimes not good for the team .
you have to pick the right moment where you are going to be aggressive in the interests of the team , in order to show the younger players in the team that they should get involved .
that takes also a little bit of time .
the body language is also important .
i 'm getting more used to it and learning when to make the right challenge at the right time .
at the moment , it seems sometimes the aggression goes too far ?
would you agree with that ?
i agree with that .
sometimes it does go too far .
but i have to say : the refereeing in germany is a bit soft .
when i compare it - i watch a lot of english games - it 's a big , big difference .
when i see how people go in to challenges in england .
here in germany , it 's a very big difference - unfortunately .
with the success that you gained in the bundesliga you then became a member of the croatian national team .
what was it like winning against england in london last week ?
it was a great feeling .
how can i explain it to you ?
in the world cup against australia , when we did n't make it through , it was a very , very drained feeling .
against england , to win at wembley , was the total opposite .
it was probably the nicest feeling i have had in my life , when it comes to football .
these sorts of moments , in the headlines in europe , is this the reason why you opted to play for croatia and not the country of your birth , australia ?
i 'm a proud australian .
but i also know where i come from , my heritage , my background .
and i 'm very proud of that .
i feel more croatian than australian .
another reason is the long flight to australia for games - that 's also a very big problem .
we have that problem now with some of our brazilian players .
what are your plans for 2008 ?
how do you see it going for you ?
always when someone asks me what my plans are , the most important plan is to stay healthy .
football wise : the biggest thing is to try to get in to the top half of the table for hertha bsc and to become european champions for croatia .
thanks very much for your time .
thank you , thanks .
are you living in berlin ?
i am living in berlin .
how long have you been here for ?
for two and a half years .

in the bundesliga , simunic has been playing for berlin since 2000 .
his teammates call him “ joe . ” dw-tv : now you 've been in berlin since 2000 - what 's it like living here on the other side of the world ?
josip simunic : it 's different .
the longer i 'm away from australia , the more i see how much australia is a beautiful country , probably the best country in the world .
the people here are very different to australia .
in australia the people are more friendly .
here also , but not to the extent that they are in australia .
when you think back to the last round of the bundesliga we saw ivan klasnic come back , one of your countrymen .
what emotions did that bring ?
i just got goosebumps now .
i 'm happy for ivan .
i hope he stays healthy , i hope that he has no more problems with his kidneys or anything else .
he 's a great example to show that when someone really wants to achieve something , they can achieve it .
like i said , i hope he stays healthy and scores a lot of goals for werder bremen .
you said at the start when you first came here that you were here to win the german championship .
that success has n't come in the last 7 years - why has n't it happened ?
in the past we 've had very good teams , but there were better teams than us .
you have to play 34 games in a season .
i think we had too many games where we were up there , we needed the win , but because of the added pressure , we did n't put in a good performance and get the result .
we also have the problem that a lot of players come and then they get better offers from other clubs , more money .
that 's also a problem , when you get offered three times as much to play in england .
football is not only about money but you have to try and situate yourself quickly .
to be too aggressive is sometimes not good for the team .
you have to pick the right moment where you are going to be aggressive in the interests of the team , in order to show the younger players in the team that they should get involved .
that takes also a little bit of time .
the body language is also important .
i 'm getting more used to it and learning when to make the right challenge at the right time .
at the moment , it seems sometimes the aggression goes too far ?
would you agree with that ?
i agree with that .
sometimes it does go too far .
but i have to say : the refereeing in germany is a bit soft .
when i compare it - i watch a lot of english games - it 's a big , big difference .
when i see how people go in to challenges in england .
here in germany , it 's a very big difference - unfortunately .
with the success that you gained in the bundesliga you then became a member of the croatian national team .
what was it like winning against england in london last week ?
it was a great feeling .
how can i explain it to you ?
in the world cup against australia , when we did n't make it through , it was a very , very drained feeling .
against england , to win at wembley , was the total opposite .
it was probably the nicest feeling i have had in my life , when it comes to football .
these sorts of moments , in the headlines in europe , is this the reason why you opted to play for croatia and not the country of your birth , australia ?
i 'm a proud australian .
but i also know where i come from , my heritage , my background .
and i 'm very proud of that .
i feel more croatian than australian .
another reason is the long flight to australia for games - that 's also a very big problem .
we have that problem now with some of our brazilian players .
what are your plans for 2008 ?
how do you see it going for you ?
always when someone asks me what my plans are , the most important plan is to stay healthy .
football wise : the biggest thing is to try to get in to the top half of the table for hertha bsc and to become european champions for croatia .
thanks very much for your time .
thank you , thanks .
are you living in berlin ?
i am living in berlin .
how long have you been here for ?
for two and a half years .
do you like berlin ?
yeah , i like berlin , otherwise i would n't hold out the temperatures . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 30.11.2007 european aid still trumps tourism in colombia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the image colombia is promoting , but for millions reality is very different the colombian government has launched a charm offensive aimed at luring international tourists .
but it 's no easy task as violence , drugs and poverty remain even as the country has entered a relatively peaceful time . cartagena , its graceful city center hugging the caribbean coast , is a colonial-era jewel encircled by modern day poverty and persistent violence .
home to more than 1 million people , the city illustrates the complex situation faced by colombia as it tries to return to normalcy after decades of armed conflict . the united nations world tourism organization met in cartagena this week and colombia officials were eager to change perceptions of the country .
colombian president alvaro uribe , whose law-and-order policies have brought some stability to the country , bore the message that his country was ready for european and american tourists to arrive and open their wallets . " you are visiting a country that has suffered greatly , but has a tremendous amount of hope , " he said . real world problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cartagena 's historic city center is a unesco world heritage site but even as delegates met , the reality of life outside cartagena 's heavily-guarded convention center seeped in and painted a bleak picture of life with few public services and no police protection . between 2 million and 3 million colombians have fled their homes to escape ongoing paramilitary hostilities and are living in extreme poverty in the suburbs of cities such as cartagena .
newspapers also regularly carry reports of murders and other drug-related violence . uribe said he knows it 's news like this which has kept the number of europeans who visit colombia each year small : about 125,700 arrived in the first nine months of 2007 .
most came from former colonial power spain . " terrorism puts a stop to all our possibilities , " he said referring to fighting between left-wing guerillas , right-wing paramilitaries , the military and drug lords .
" without terrorism , we 'll have tourism .
without terrorism , we 'll be happy . " some positives , many problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the growing economy has led to a building boom in cartagena the colombian government points to statistics which show that in recent years the murder rate has been cut in half and kidnappings are down 75 percent .
the country is also experiencing an economic boom officials hope will help bring in tourist dollars and help meet an ambitious goal of attracting 4 million foreign tourists to the country by 2010 . the economy had 6.8 percent growth in 2006 and is headed for 7.48 percent this year .
in cartagena , luxury hotels are springing up and it 's become a routine stop on the caribbean cruise circuit . but even as the tourist industry proclaims its slogan , " colombia , the only risk is wanting to stay , " and luxury hotels spring up along the country 's beaches and growth heads to 7.48 percent this year , the government acknowledges that parts of the country are not safe for visitors . eu aid a lifeline to locals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cartagena looks very different from outside the convention center while the colombian government said that eventually tourism will improve people 's lives , it will remain dependent on international development aid . the european union will provide 160 million euros -lrb- $ 216 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to colombia between 2007-2013 .
but unlike the united states , which focuses on giving money to fight colombia 's illicit drug trade , the eu will direct aid directly to victims and non-governmental organizations which help them . european donors are a lifeline for many local aid organizations in the country , but money - from both tourism and the government - does n't always appear as promised , said maria amparo gomez , a dominican nun who runs a school in cartagena . " there are two cartagenas that are very well separated from each other , " she said . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the bundesliga , simunic has been playing for berlin since 2000 .
his teammates call him “ joe . ” dw-tv : now you 've been in berlin since 2000 - what 's it like living here on the other side of the world ?
josip simunic : it 's different .
the longer i 'm away from australia , the more i see how much australia is a beautiful country , probably the best country in the world .
the people here are very different to australia .
in australia the people are more friendly .
here also , but not to the extent that they are in australia .
when you think back to the last round of the bundesliga we saw ivan klasnic come back , one of your countrymen .
what emotions did that bring ?
i just got goosebumps now .
i 'm happy for ivan .
i hope he stays healthy , i hope that he has no more problems with his kidneys or anything else .
he 's a great example to show that when someone really wants to achieve something , they can achieve it .
like i said , i hope he stays healthy and scores a lot of goals for werder bremen .
you said at the start when you first came here that you were here to win the german championship .
that success has n't come in the last 7 years - why has n't it happened ?
in the past we 've had very good teams , but there were better teams than us .
you have to play 34 games in a season .
i think we had too many games where we were up there , we needed the win , but because of the added pressure , we did n't put in a good performance and get the result .
we also have the problem that a lot of players come and then they get better offers from other clubs , more money .
that 's also a problem , when you get offered three times as much to play in england .
football is not only about money but you have to try and situate yourself quickly .
to be too aggressive is sometimes not good for the team .
you have to pick the right moment where you are going to be aggressive in the interests of the team , in order to show the younger players in the team that they should get involved .
that takes also a little bit of time .
the body language is also important .
i 'm getting more used to it and learning when to make the right challenge at the right time .
at the moment , it seems sometimes the aggression goes too far ?
would you agree with that ?
i agree with that .
sometimes it does go too far .
but i have to say : the refereeing in germany is a bit soft .
when i compare it - i watch a lot of english games - it 's a big , big difference .
when i see how people go in to challenges in england .
here in germany , it 's a very big difference - unfortunately .
with the success that you gained in the bundesliga you then became a member of the croatian national team .
what was it like winning against england in london last week ?
it was a great feeling .
how can i explain it to you ?
in the world cup against australia , when we did n't make it through , it was a very , very drained feeling .
against england , to win at wembley , was the total opposite .
it was probably the nicest feeling i have had in my life , when it comes to football .
these sorts of moments , in the headlines in europe , is this the reason why you opted to play for croatia and not the country of your birth , australia ?
i 'm a proud australian .
but i also know where i come from , my heritage , my background .
and i 'm very proud of that .
i feel more croatian than australian .
another reason is the long flight to australia for games - that 's also a very big problem .
we have that problem now with some of our brazilian players .
what are your plans for 2008 ?
how do you see it going for you ?
always when someone asks me what my plans are , the most important plan is to stay healthy .
football wise : the biggest thing is to try to get in to the top half of the table for hertha bsc and to become european champions for croatia .
thanks very much for your time .
thank you , thanks .
are you living in berlin ?
i am living in berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 30.11.2007 european aid still trumps tourism in colombia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the image colombia is promoting , but for millions reality is very different the colombian government has launched a charm offensive aimed at luring international tourists .
but it 's no easy task as violence , drugs and poverty remain even as the country has entered a relatively peaceful time . cartagena , its graceful city center hugging the caribbean coast , is a colonial-era jewel encircled by modern day poverty and persistent violence .
home to more than 1 million people , the city illustrates the complex situation faced by colombia as it tries to return to normalcy after decades of armed conflict . the united nations world tourism organization met in cartagena this week and colombia officials were eager to change perceptions of the country .
colombian president alvaro uribe , whose law-and-order policies have brought some stability to the country , bore the message that his country was ready for european and american tourists to arrive and open their wallets . " you are visiting a country that has suffered greatly , but has a tremendous amount of hope , " he said . real world problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cartagena 's historic city center is a unesco world heritage site but even as delegates met , the reality of life outside cartagena 's heavily-guarded convention center seeped in and painted a bleak picture of life with few public services and no police protection . between 2 million and 3 million colombians have fled their homes to escape ongoing paramilitary hostilities and are living in extreme poverty in the suburbs of cities such as cartagena .
newspapers also regularly carry reports of murders and other drug-related violence . uribe said he knows it 's news like this which has kept the number of europeans who visit colombia each year small : about 125,700 arrived in the first nine months of 2007 .
most came from former colonial power spain . " terrorism puts a stop to all our possibilities , " he said referring to fighting between left-wing guerillas , right-wing paramilitaries , the military and drug lords .
" without terrorism , we 'll have tourism .
without terrorism , we 'll be happy . " some positives , many problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the growing economy has led to a building boom in cartagena the colombian government points to statistics which show that in recent years the murder rate has been cut in half and kidnappings are down 75 percent .
the country is also experiencing an economic boom officials hope will help bring in tourist dollars and help meet an ambitious goal of attracting 4 million foreign tourists to the country by 2010 . the economy had 6.8 percent growth in 2006 and is headed for 7.48 percent this year .
in cartagena , luxury hotels are springing up and it 's become a routine stop on the caribbean cruise circuit . but even as the tourist industry proclaims its slogan , " colombia , the only risk is wanting to stay , " and luxury hotels spring up along the country 's beaches and growth heads to 7.48 percent this year , the government acknowledges that parts of the country are not safe for visitors . eu aid a lifeline to locals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cartagena looks very different from outside the convention center while the colombian government said that eventually tourism will improve people 's lives , it will remain dependent on international development aid . the european union will provide 160 million euros -lrb- $ 216 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to colombia between 2007-2013 .
but unlike the united states , which focuses on giving money to fight colombia 's illicit drug trade , the eu will direct aid directly to victims and non-governmental organizations which help them . european donors are a lifeline for many local aid organizations in the country , but money - from both tourism and the government - does n't always appear as promised , said maria amparo gomez , a dominican nun who runs a school in cartagena . " there are two cartagenas that are very well separated from each other , " she said . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dominique bussereau , france 's deputy transport minister , however , suggested to the ap that spain ought to be awarded a galileo test center . under the compromise reached friday , spain 's " safety of life " center could " evolve into a fully qualified " control center by 2013 , allowing madrid to supervise operation of the satellites and their transmissions to earth .
" the spanish center , once it is up and running from a technical point of view , would act as a control center along with the others " in germany and italy , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot explained .
after a consortium of private companies abandoned galileo earlier this year due to a financing dispute , the european commission agreed last friday to fund the entire program , with most of the additional 2.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- in funding coming from leftover agricultural funds and the rest from research , transport and administration budgets .

30 . indian prime minister manmohan singh announced that both sides were committed to controlling global emissions .
he added that india and the eu were working towards pragmatic solutions with industrialized nations and developing countries sharing the burden in accordance with population size and level of economic development . " in order to achieve this , global action is needed by all parties , according to their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities , with developed countries taking the lead , " said singh and portuguese prime minister jose socrates in a joint statement .
portugal holds the six-month eu presidency until the end of this year . measures provide allowances for developing nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is especially vulnerable to floods and monsoons exacerbated by climate change as a huge developing country , india , which is one of the world 's biggest polluters , is not obliged to make cuts in greenhouse gas emissions under the kyoto protocol .
singh emphasized that developing nations should not be held to the same standard on emissions as europe , and called for measures on climate change that do not " perpetuate poverty . " india and the eu agreed that the upcoming climate change conference in bali , indonesia , which runs from dec .
3-14 , should come up with a clear roadmap for controlling emissions beyond 2012 within a united nations framework when kyoto expires . " this compromise must be obtained within common but different responsibilities , " socrates said . bilateral trade pact to greatly boost india-eu trade the meeting marked the eighth eu-india summit and seeks to forge a closer strategic alliance and deepen cooperation on trade issues as well .
trade talks covered both a comprehensive bilateral eu-india trade agreement and the comprehensive doha round of international trade talks under the umbrella of the world trade organization . singh indicated that he hoped that the trade and investment agreement that was negotiated could be in place by the next annual summit in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is the world 's fastest growing economy after china european commission president jose manuel barroso , who was also present at the summit , said that the trade pact was an ambitious one and would boost bilateral trade tremendously .

it is also largest source of direct foreign investment .
the total investment flow from the eu into india amounted to nearly $ 11 billion in the period from august 1991 to february 2007 according to indian government sources . the eu has earmarked 470 million euros -lrb- $ 690 million -rrb- to promote economic development over the next five years , according to an article that barroso wrote in the indian media on friday . both sides also signed an agreement to strengthen cooperation in science and technology .

eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , who was also in attendance , said an agreement with the european union to lower tariffs and increase trade may be reached in one year 's time . india 's exports , however , account for less than 2 percent of overall eu imports , and european companies have invested 10 times more in china than in india over the last five years . other topics on the summit agenda were a possible civilian nuclear cooperation accord with the united states , which would provide india with access to american technology after a 30 year embargo .

30 , named the socially outspoken bishop of trier , reinhard marx , as the new archbishop of munich . marx , 54 , is also head of the committee for social issues at the german bishops ' conference .
he will be succeeding the 79-year-old archbishop friedrich wetter , who retired last february due to his advanced age , but has stayed in office until his replacement takes over .
the munich archdiocese numbers around 2 million catholics and is considered one of the most important one in germany .
pope benedict xvi was himself the archbishop of munich before moving to rome to head the congregation for the doctrine of the faith in 1981 .
bavarian premier günther beckstein , who is a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - sister party to angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- - welcomed marx ' appointment and described him as a " highly convincing and principled man of the cloth who is , at the same time , eager to debate and humorous . "
a socially outspoken clergyman considered conservative in terms of the catholic doctrine , marx has been outspoken on social issues , demanding from german politicians to act against poverty , create jobs and accept refugees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gotthold hasenhüttl was suspended of his priesthood in 2003 while numerous church officials in germany welcomed marx ' appointment , praising his personal and professional qualities , theologian gotthold hasenhüttl criticized marx for " trying with all means to pursue a totally reactionary line in the catholic church . "

30 , named the socially outspoken bishop of trier , reinhard marx , as the new archbishop of munich . marx , 54 , is also head of the committee for social issues at the german bishops ' conference .
he will be succeeding the 79-year-old archbishop friedrich wetter , who retired last february due to his advanced age , but has stayed in office until his replacement takes over .
the munich archdiocese numbers around 2 million catholics and is considered one of the most important one in germany .
pope benedict xvi was himself the archbishop of munich before moving to rome to head the congregation for the doctrine of the faith in 1981 .
bavarian premier günther beckstein , who is a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - sister party to angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- - welcomed marx ' appointment and described him as a " highly convincing and principled man of the cloth who is , at the same time , eager to debate and humorous . "
a socially outspoken clergyman considered conservative in terms of the catholic doctrine , marx has been outspoken on social issues , demanding from german politicians to act against poverty , create jobs and accept refugees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gotthold hasenhüttl was suspended of his priesthood in 2003 while numerous church officials in germany welcomed marx ' appointment , praising his personal and professional qualities , theologian gotthold hasenhüttl criticized marx for " trying with all means to pursue a totally reactionary line in the catholic church . "
marx ' main idea was " that people are there for the intuition of the church , and not the other way around , " hasenhüttl told the saarländischer rundfunk radio .
hasenhüttl was stripped of his priesthood by marx in 2003 after he invited protestants to take part in the catholic eucharist during the ecumenical church day despite the vatican 's explicit prohibition of intercommunion .
the pope lashes out at atheism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict xvi strongly criticized modern-day atheism in his second enclytical meanwhile , pope benedict xvi on friday issued the second encyclical of his pontificate , using the story of st. josephine bakhita -lrb- 1869-1947 -rrb- - a former slave and later catholic nun and saint from darfur , sudan - to illustrate the theme of christian hope .
" let us put it very simply : man needs god , otherwise he remains without hope , " benedict wrote in the 70-page document , entitled in latin " spe salvi facti sumus " -lrb- in hope we are saved -rrb- .
the pope warned against what he sees as false hope based on " faith in progress , " tracing its origins to the french revolution and later , the communist ideology inspired by karl marx -lrb- not related to munich 's new archbishop -rrb- , who " forgot man and forgot man 's freedom . "
marxism , the pope wrote , had left behind " a trail of appalling destruction " because it failed to realize that man could not be " merely the product of economic conditions . "
italy 's union of atheists , agnostics and rationalists -lrb- uaar -rrb- criticized the pope for lashing out at atheists .
" the existence of a billion non-believers in the world should be enough to make the pope understand that man can live very well without god , but with reason , " the uaar said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 , on how the work for the long-delayed satellite navigation project galileo would be divided up among the 27 member countries . at an eu meeting of the bloc 's transport ministers , spain , which had made demands to host a ground station for a network of some 30 satellites , first dissented , but later agreed . under the current deal , the galileo program , which is budgeted at 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- and intended to reduce the eu 's reliance on the us global position system -lrb- gps -rrb- , plans to install only two ground control stations : one near munich and one in rome . no money for third ground station bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo should be fully operable by 2013 , barrot said " we just do n't have the money for a third ground station , " an unidentified eu diplomat told the associated press .
dominique bussereau , france 's deputy transport minister , however , suggested to the ap that spain ought to be awarded a galileo test center . under the compromise reached friday , spain 's " safety of life " center could " evolve into a fully qualified " control center by 2013 , allowing madrid to supervise operation of the satellites and their transmissions to earth .
" the spanish center , once it is up and running from a technical point of view , would act as a control center along with the others " in germany and italy , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot explained .
after a consortium of private companies abandoned galileo earlier this year due to a financing dispute , the european commission agreed last friday to fund the entire program , with most of the additional 2.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- in funding coming from leftover agricultural funds and the rest from research , transport and administration budgets .
germany wants its fair share of galileo projects as the biggest contributor to the eu budget , germany wants astrium , a german-dominated subsidiary of the european aerospace giant eads , to have a proportionate share of galileo contracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite images can pinpoint the precise location of iranian nuclear sites - or anywhere else the main issue hacked out by the transport ministers was how to slice the galileo pie among european companies .
while competition rules would normally dictate that contracts be awarded on a best-offer basis , the european space industry is concentrated into a few main groups which have demanded a higher share of the lucrative business . the agreement , however , does not allow a single company to obtain an inordinately large portion of the project 's contracts . " galileo will become the spearhead for european technology , " barrot told reporters .
" we are on the way towards putting galileo into operation for 2013 and to offer europeans very many services . " the galileo project has been plagued by delays and is already running five years behind schedule with only one test satellite up in orbit .
at least 1 billion euros of taxpayer money have already been spent . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's making the cracks in the german coalition government increasingly visible . the premier of the central german state of hesse , roland koch , on friday , nov .
30 , accused german foreign minister and vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier of pursuing a harmful foreign policy that is based solely on economic interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse premier roland koch has spared no words in lashing out at the foreign minister " germany has a historical obligation not to keep quiet about moral questions , " roland koch told the bild newspaper .
" we have no right to put economics above human rights . "
koch , who is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , passed judgment on steinmeier , a social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- , for " creating the impression in russia and china that we germans are ready to do any kind of business , even when human rights are being trampled on . "
" in doing so , the foreign minister is harming our country , " koch said .
the unusually strong rhetoric from the cdu politician is not only a sign of the strained relations in the grand coalition , but an indicator that foreign policy may play an important role in the campaigns leading up to the 2009 elections .
the right way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spd foreign policy expert rolf mützenich dismissed the criticism directed at the foreign minister .
" we advocate the anchoring of human rights in the international law , " mützenich told the dpa news agency .
the spd politician pointed out that china signed the most important human rights conventions and proved itself to be a responsible partner in the nuclear row with iran and north korea .
" those are the points of reference for a moral foreign policy , " he said .
during a visit to paris earlier in november , steinmeier told journalists he was " worried " about the escalating diplomatic tension between germany and china in the wake of the dalai lama 's visit with merkel .
in september , the chancellor met with the tibetan spiritual leader , whom chinese officials see as a dangerous separatist .
consequently , china axed a series of high level exchanges with germany , including a trip to beijing by finance minister peer steinbrück , planned for december .
the russian question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama has had a chilling effect on the relations with beijing china , however , is not the only foreign-policy wedge between the coalition partners .
german-russian relations were much more cordial during the previous german government , boosted by the flaunting camaraderie between the then chancellor , gerhard schröder , and russian president vladimir putin .
in a speech delivered in stuttgart on thursday , schröder - who was himself often criticized for turning a blind eye to putin 's human rights record , lashed out at germany 's foreign policy by saying he had the impression he was back " in the cold war era . "
some politicians were promoting a " distancing , even opposition to russia , " the former leader of the social democratic party said .
" i regard this approach as wrong , if not even dangerous , " he added .
less than a month after leaving the chancellor 's office in november 2005 , schröder was voted in as head of the supervisory board for a company that 's closely linked to the state-owned russian energy giant gazprom .
this move was seen by many in germany as ethically questionable if not complete unacceptable .
pursuing an ethical foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-russian relations were much closer under gerhard schröder merkel , on the other hand , said in a speech to the german parliament on wednesday that there was no difference between a foreign policy based on values and one pursuing german economic interests .
" human rights policy and representation of economic interests are two sides of the same coin , " merkel said .
" they should never be opposed to each another . "
merkel will get to test her diplomatic skills and her role as a champion of human rights at a summit between leaders of the european union and african states that is taking place in the portuguese capital of lisbon from dec .
7 - 9 .
the summit will also be attended by zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe , a dictator whose controversial policies of seizing white-owned commercial farms and threats to nationalize foreign-owned firms make him an uncomfortable politician to deal with in the eu .
unlike british prime minister gordon brown , who decided not to attend the summit because of the presence of the zimbabwean head of state , merkel declined to back calls for mugabe to be barred from the summit . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's making the cracks in the german coalition government increasingly visible . the premier of the central german state of hesse , roland koch , on friday , nov .
30 , accused german foreign minister and vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier of pursuing a harmful foreign policy that is based solely on economic interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse premier roland koch has spared no words in lashing out at the foreign minister " germany has a historical obligation not to keep quiet about moral questions , " roland koch told the bild newspaper .
" we have no right to put economics above human rights . "
koch , who is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , passed judgment on steinmeier , a social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- , for " creating the impression in russia and china that we germans are ready to do any kind of business , even when human rights are being trampled on . "
" in doing so , the foreign minister is harming our country , " koch said .
the unusually strong rhetoric from the cdu politician is not only a sign of the strained relations in the grand coalition , but an indicator that foreign policy may play an important role in the campaigns leading up to the 2009 elections .
the right way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spd foreign policy expert rolf mützenich dismissed the criticism directed at the foreign minister .
" we advocate the anchoring of human rights in the international law , " mützenich told the dpa news agency .
the spd politician pointed out that china signed the most important human rights conventions and proved itself to be a responsible partner in the nuclear row with iran and north korea .
" those are the points of reference for a moral foreign policy , " he said .
during a visit to paris earlier in november , steinmeier told journalists he was " worried " about the escalating diplomatic tension between germany and china in the wake of the dalai lama 's visit with merkel .
in september , the chancellor met with the tibetan spiritual leader , whom chinese officials see as a dangerous separatist .
consequently , china axed a series of high level exchanges with germany , including a trip to beijing by finance minister peer steinbrück , planned for december .
the russian question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama has had a chilling effect on the relations with beijing china , however , is not the only foreign-policy wedge between the coalition partners .
german-russian relations were much more cordial during the previous german government , boosted by the flaunting camaraderie between the then chancellor , gerhard schröder , and russian president vladimir putin .
in a speech delivered in stuttgart on thursday , schröder - who was himself often criticized for turning a blind eye to putin 's human rights record , lashed out at germany 's foreign policy by saying he had the impression he was back " in the cold war era . "
some politicians were promoting a " distancing , even opposition to russia , " the former leader of the social democratic party said .
" i regard this approach as wrong , if not even dangerous , " he added .
less than a month after leaving the chancellor 's office in november 2005 , schröder was voted in as head of the supervisory board for a company that 's closely linked to the state-owned russian energy giant gazprom .
this move was seen by many in germany as ethically questionable if not complete unacceptable .
pursuing an ethical foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-russian relations were much closer under gerhard schröder merkel , on the other hand , said in a speech to the german parliament on wednesday that there was no difference between a foreign policy based on values and one pursuing german economic interests .
" human rights policy and representation of economic interests are two sides of the same coin , " merkel said .
" they should never be opposed to each another . "
merkel will get to test her diplomatic skills and her role as a champion of human rights at a summit between leaders of the european union and african states that is taking place in the portuguese capital of lisbon from dec .

the summit will also be attended by zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe , a dictator whose controversial policies of seizing white-owned commercial farms and threats to nationalize foreign-owned firms make him an uncomfortable politician to deal with in the eu .

it 's making the cracks in the german coalition government increasingly visible . the premier of the central german state of hesse , roland koch , on friday , nov .
30 , accused german foreign minister and vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier of pursuing a harmful foreign policy that is based solely on economic interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse premier roland koch has spared no words in lashing out at the foreign minister " germany has a historical obligation not to keep quiet about moral questions , " roland koch told the bild newspaper .
" we have no right to put economics above human rights . "
koch , who is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , passed judgment on steinmeier , a social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- , for " creating the impression in russia and china that we germans are ready to do any kind of business , even when human rights are being trampled on . "
" in doing so , the foreign minister is harming our country , " koch said .
the unusually strong rhetoric from the cdu politician is not only a sign of the strained relations in the grand coalition , but an indicator that foreign policy may play an important role in the campaigns leading up to the 2009 elections .
the right way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spd foreign policy expert rolf mützenich dismissed the criticism directed at the foreign minister .
" we advocate the anchoring of human rights in the international law , " mützenich told the dpa news agency .
the spd politician pointed out that china signed the most important human rights conventions and proved itself to be a responsible partner in the nuclear row with iran and north korea .
" those are the points of reference for a moral foreign policy , " he said .
during a visit to paris earlier in november , steinmeier told journalists he was " worried " about the escalating diplomatic tension between germany and china in the wake of the dalai lama 's visit with merkel .
in september , the chancellor met with the tibetan spiritual leader , whom chinese officials see as a dangerous separatist .
consequently , china axed a series of high level exchanges with germany , including a trip to beijing by finance minister peer steinbrück , planned for december .
the russian question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama has had a chilling effect on the relations with beijing china , however , is not the only foreign-policy wedge between the coalition partners .
german-russian relations were much more cordial during the previous german government , boosted by the flaunting camaraderie between the then chancellor , gerhard schröder , and russian president vladimir putin .
in a speech delivered in stuttgart on thursday , schröder - who was himself often criticized for turning a blind eye to putin 's human rights record , lashed out at germany 's foreign policy by saying he had the impression he was back " in the cold war era . "
some politicians were promoting a " distancing , even opposition to russia , " the former leader of the social democratic party said .
" i regard this approach as wrong , if not even dangerous , " he added .
less than a month after leaving the chancellor 's office in november 2005 , schröder was voted in as head of the supervisory board for a company that 's closely linked to the state-owned russian energy giant gazprom .
this move was seen by many in germany as ethically questionable if not complete unacceptable .
pursuing an ethical foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-russian relations were much closer under gerhard schröder merkel , on the other hand , said in a speech to the german parliament on wednesday that there was no difference between a foreign policy based on values and one pursuing german economic interests .
" human rights policy and representation of economic interests are two sides of the same coin , " merkel said .
" they should never be opposed to each another . "
merkel will get to test her diplomatic skills and her role as a champion of human rights at a summit between leaders of the european union and african states that is taking place in the portuguese capital of lisbon from dec .
7 - 9 .
the summit will also be attended by zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe , a dictator whose controversial policies of seizing white-owned commercial farms and threats to nationalize foreign-owned firms make him an uncomfortable politician to deal with in the eu .
unlike british prime minister gordon brown , who decided not to attend the summit because of the presence of the zimbabwean head of state , merkel declined to back calls for mugabe to be barred from the summit . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 , on how the work for the long-delayed satellite navigation project galileo would be divided up among the 27 member countries . at an eu meeting of the bloc 's transport ministers , spain , which had made demands to host a ground station for a network of some 30 satellites , first dissented , but later agreed . under the current deal , the galileo program , which is budgeted at 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- and intended to reduce the eu 's reliance on the us global position system -lrb- gps -rrb- , plans to install only two ground control stations : one near munich and one in rome . no money for third ground station bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo should be fully operable by 2013 , barrot said " we just do n't have the money for a third ground station , " an unidentified eu diplomat told the associated press .
dominique bussereau , france 's deputy transport minister , however , suggested to the ap that spain ought to be awarded a galileo test center . under the compromise reached friday , spain 's " safety of life " center could " evolve into a fully qualified " control center by 2013 , allowing madrid to supervise operation of the satellites and their transmissions to earth .
" the spanish center , once it is up and running from a technical point of view , would act as a control center along with the others " in germany and italy , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot explained .
after a consortium of private companies abandoned galileo earlier this year due to a financing dispute , the european commission agreed last friday to fund the entire program , with most of the additional 2.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- in funding coming from leftover agricultural funds and the rest from research , transport and administration budgets .
germany wants its fair share of galileo projects as the biggest contributor to the eu budget , germany wants astrium , a german-dominated subsidiary of the european aerospace giant eads , to have a proportionate share of galileo contracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite images can pinpoint the precise location of iranian nuclear sites - or anywhere else the main issue hacked out by the transport ministers was how to slice the galileo pie among european companies .
while competition rules would normally dictate that contracts be awarded on a best-offer basis , the european space industry is concentrated into a few main groups which have demanded a higher share of the lucrative business . the agreement , however , does not allow a single company to obtain an inordinately large portion of the project 's contracts . " galileo will become the spearhead for european technology , " barrot told reporters .
" we are on the way towards putting galileo into operation for 2013 and to offer europeans very many services . " the galileo project has been plagued by delays and is already running five years behind schedule with only one test satellite up in orbit .

30 , overwhelmingly approved the federal budget of 283.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 417.4 billion -rrb- for 2008 , an increase of 4 percent from 2007 . lawmakers voted 408-144 in favor of the budget , which has provided for a slight increase in outlays for defense and economic assistance . defense spending will go up to 29.45 billion euros , up from 28.39 billion in 2007 .
the ministry for economic assistance , which is responsible for the distribution of germany 's overseas development aid , sees its share of the budget go up to 5.13 billion euros , an increase from 4.5 billion euros last year . the biggest slice , accounting for about 30 percent of the overall budget , has been earmarked for labor and social affairs . weak dollar blamed for slowdown in euro zone exports during the final day of the four-day debate , german economics minister michael glos appealed to the united states to slow down the dollar 's slide as european exporters come under growing exchange-rate pressure . glos said washington should not try to fix structural problems in the us economy by devaluing the dollar . " if the resulting economic boom is not underpinned by structural adjustment in the us economy itself , but is achieved purely as the result of a weak currency , then the americans have gotten a bad deal , " he said . huge deficit spending has led to a free fall of the dollar , pushing the value of the euro to higher levels and was partly responsible for setting off turmoil in the world financial markets . earlier , german finance minister peer steinbrück said he did not expect the german economy to suffer too much from the current credit squeeze triggered by the us mortgage crisis . eu exports elsewhere to offset slack in us he told the financial times newspaper that he expected the german economy to perform well next year even if were to grow at a slower pace than 2007 . steinbrück said domestic demand was picking up and exports would remain brisk , with demand from russia , eastern europe and asia offsetting a slowdown in us imports from the euro zone . referring to the strength of the euro against the dollar , he acknowledged that it would have an effect on germany , but said the stronger currency would curb the impact of higher oil prices , since crude is dollar-based .

30 , overwhelmingly approved the federal budget of 283.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 417.4 billion -rrb- for 2008 , an increase of 4 percent from 2007 . lawmakers voted 408-144 in favor of the budget , which has provided for a slight increase in outlays for defense and economic assistance . defense spending will go up to 29.45 billion euros , up from 28.39 billion in 2007 .
the ministry for economic assistance , which is responsible for the distribution of germany 's overseas development aid , sees its share of the budget go up to 5.13 billion euros , an increase from 4.5 billion euros last year . the biggest slice , accounting for about 30 percent of the overall budget , has been earmarked for labor and social affairs . weak dollar blamed for slowdown in euro zone exports during the final day of the four-day debate , german economics minister michael glos appealed to the united states to slow down the dollar 's slide as european exporters come under growing exchange-rate pressure . glos said washington should not try to fix structural problems in the us economy by devaluing the dollar . " if the resulting economic boom is not underpinned by structural adjustment in the us economy itself , but is achieved purely as the result of a weak currency , then the americans have gotten a bad deal , " he said . huge deficit spending has led to a free fall of the dollar , pushing the value of the euro to higher levels and was partly responsible for setting off turmoil in the world financial markets . earlier , german finance minister peer steinbrück said he did not expect the german economy to suffer too much from the current credit squeeze triggered by the us mortgage crisis . eu exports elsewhere to offset slack in us he told the financial times newspaper that he expected the german economy to perform well next year even if were to grow at a slower pace than 2007 . steinbrück said domestic demand was picking up and exports would remain brisk , with demand from russia , eastern europe and asia offsetting a slowdown in us imports from the euro zone . referring to the strength of the euro against the dollar , he acknowledged that it would have an effect on germany , but said the stronger currency would curb the impact of higher oil prices , since crude is dollar-based . " for us europeans , we prefer a stronger euro to a weak one , " he told the financial daily . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 30.11.2007 eu agrees on galileo contract award scheme großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only one test satellite has gone up in orbit with 1 billion euros in taxpayer money after agreeing to pay for galileo entirely from public funds , eu transport ministers decided how contracts for the satellite navigation system would be parceled out to european companies . european union ministers reached an agreement on friday , nov .
30 , on how the work for the long-delayed satellite navigation project galileo would be divided up among the 27 member countries . at an eu meeting of the bloc 's transport ministers , spain , which had made demands to host a ground station for a network of some 30 satellites , first dissented , but later agreed . under the current deal , the galileo program , which is budgeted at 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- and intended to reduce the eu 's reliance on the us global position system -lrb- gps -rrb- , plans to install only two ground control stations : one near munich and one in rome . no money for third ground station bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo should be fully operable by 2013 , barrot said " we just do n't have the money for a third ground station , " an unidentified eu diplomat told the associated press .
dominique bussereau , france 's deputy transport minister , however , suggested to the ap that spain ought to be awarded a galileo test center . under the compromise reached friday , spain 's " safety of life " center could " evolve into a fully qualified " control center by 2013 , allowing madrid to supervise operation of the satellites and their transmissions to earth .
" the spanish center , once it is up and running from a technical point of view , would act as a control center along with the others " in germany and italy , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot explained .
after a consortium of private companies abandoned galileo earlier this year due to a financing dispute , the european commission agreed last friday to fund the entire program , with most of the additional 2.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- in funding coming from leftover agricultural funds and the rest from research , transport and administration budgets .
germany wants its fair share of galileo projects as the biggest contributor to the eu budget , germany wants astrium , a german-dominated subsidiary of the european aerospace giant eads , to have a proportionate share of galileo contracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite images can pinpoint the precise location of iranian nuclear sites - or anywhere else the main issue hacked out by the transport ministers was how to slice the galileo pie among european companies .
while competition rules would normally dictate that contracts be awarded on a best-offer basis , the european space industry is concentrated into a few main groups which have demanded a higher share of the lucrative business . the agreement , however , does not allow a single company to obtain an inordinately large portion of the project 's contracts . " galileo will become the spearhead for european technology , " barrot told reporters .
" we are on the way towards putting galileo into operation for 2013 and to offer europeans very many services . " the galileo project has been plagued by delays and is already running five years behind schedule with only one test satellite up in orbit .
at least 1 billion euros of taxpayer money have already been spent . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it 's no easy task as violence , drugs and poverty remain even as the country has entered a relatively peaceful time . cartagena , its graceful city center hugging the caribbean coast , is a colonial-era jewel encircled by modern day poverty and persistent violence .
home to more than 1 million people , the city illustrates the complex situation faced by colombia as it tries to return to normalcy after decades of armed conflict . the united nations world tourism organization met in cartagena this week and colombia officials were eager to change perceptions of the country .
colombian president alvaro uribe , whose law-and-order policies have brought some stability to the country , bore the message that his country was ready for european and american tourists to arrive and open their wallets . " you are visiting a country that has suffered greatly , but has a tremendous amount of hope , " he said . real world problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cartagena 's historic city center is a unesco world heritage site but even as delegates met , the reality of life outside cartagena 's heavily-guarded convention center seeped in and painted a bleak picture of life with few public services and no police protection . between 2 million and 3 million colombians have fled their homes to escape ongoing paramilitary hostilities and are living in extreme poverty in the suburbs of cities such as cartagena .
newspapers also regularly carry reports of murders and other drug-related violence . uribe said he knows it 's news like this which has kept the number of europeans who visit colombia each year small : about 125,700 arrived in the first nine months of 2007 .
most came from former colonial power spain . " terrorism puts a stop to all our possibilities , " he said referring to fighting between left-wing guerillas , right-wing paramilitaries , the military and drug lords .

30 , overwhelmingly approved the federal budget of 283.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 417.4 billion -rrb- for 2008 , an increase of 4 percent from 2007 . lawmakers voted 408-144 in favor of the budget , which has provided for a slight increase in outlays for defense and economic assistance . defense spending will go up to 29.45 billion euros , up from 28.39 billion in 2007 .
the ministry for economic assistance , which is responsible for the distribution of germany 's overseas development aid , sees its share of the budget go up to 5.13 billion euros , an increase from 4.5 billion euros last year . the biggest slice , accounting for about 30 percent of the overall budget , has been earmarked for labor and social affairs . weak dollar blamed for slowdown in euro zone exports during the final day of the four-day debate , german economics minister michael glos appealed to the united states to slow down the dollar 's slide as european exporters come under growing exchange-rate pressure . glos said washington should not try to fix structural problems in the us economy by devaluing the dollar . " if the resulting economic boom is not underpinned by structural adjustment in the us economy itself , but is achieved purely as the result of a weak currency , then the americans have gotten a bad deal , " he said . huge deficit spending has led to a free fall of the dollar , pushing the value of the euro to higher levels and was partly responsible for setting off turmoil in the world financial markets . earlier , german finance minister peer steinbrück said he did not expect the german economy to suffer too much from the current credit squeeze triggered by the us mortgage crisis . eu exports elsewhere to offset slack in us he told the financial times newspaper that he expected the german economy to perform well next year even if were to grow at a slower pace than 2007 . steinbrück said domestic demand was picking up and exports would remain brisk , with demand from russia , eastern europe and asia offsetting a slowdown in us imports from the euro zone . referring to the strength of the euro against the dollar , he acknowledged that it would have an effect on germany , but said the stronger currency would curb the impact of higher oil prices , since crude is dollar-based . " for us europeans , we prefer a stronger euro to a weak one , " he told the financial daily . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he will be succeeding the 79-year-old archbishop friedrich wetter , who retired last february due to his advanced age , but has stayed in office until his replacement takes over .
the munich archdiocese numbers around 2 million catholics and is considered one of the most important one in germany .
pope benedict xvi was himself the archbishop of munich before moving to rome to head the congregation for the doctrine of the faith in 1981 .
bavarian premier günther beckstein , who is a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - sister party to angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- - welcomed marx ' appointment and described him as a " highly convincing and principled man of the cloth who is , at the same time , eager to debate and humorous .

"
marx ' main idea was " that people are there for the intuition of the church , and not the other way around , " hasenhüttl told the saarländischer rundfunk radio .

" let us put it very simply : man needs god , otherwise he remains without hope , " benedict wrote in the 70-page document , entitled in latin " spe salvi facti sumus " -lrb- in hope we are saved -rrb- .
the pope warned against what he sees as false hope based on " faith in progress , " tracing its origins to the french revolution and later , the communist ideology inspired by karl marx -lrb- not related to munich 's new archbishop -rrb- , who " forgot man and forgot man 's freedom . "
marxism , the pope wrote , had left behind " a trail of appalling destruction " because it failed to realize that man could not be " merely the product of economic conditions . "

30 , named the socially outspoken bishop of trier , reinhard marx , as the new archbishop of munich . marx , 54 , is also head of the committee for social issues at the german bishops ' conference .
he will be succeeding the 79-year-old archbishop friedrich wetter , who retired last february due to his advanced age , but has stayed in office until his replacement takes over .
the munich archdiocese numbers around 2 million catholics and is considered one of the most important one in germany .
pope benedict xvi was himself the archbishop of munich before moving to rome to head the congregation for the doctrine of the faith in 1981 .
bavarian premier günther beckstein , who is a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - sister party to angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- - welcomed marx ' appointment and described him as a " highly convincing and principled man of the cloth who is , at the same time , eager to debate and humorous . "
a socially outspoken clergyman considered conservative in terms of the catholic doctrine , marx has been outspoken on social issues , demanding from german politicians to act against poverty , create jobs and accept refugees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gotthold hasenhüttl was suspended of his priesthood in 2003 while numerous church officials in germany welcomed marx ' appointment , praising his personal and professional qualities , theologian gotthold hasenhüttl criticized marx for " trying with all means to pursue a totally reactionary line in the catholic church . "
marx ' main idea was " that people are there for the intuition of the church , and not the other way around , " hasenhüttl told the saarländischer rundfunk radio .
hasenhüttl was stripped of his priesthood by marx in 2003 after he invited protestants to take part in the catholic eucharist during the ecumenical church day despite the vatican 's explicit prohibition of intercommunion .
the pope lashes out at atheism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict xvi strongly criticized modern-day atheism in his second enclytical meanwhile , pope benedict xvi on friday issued the second encyclical of his pontificate , using the story of st. josephine bakhita -lrb- 1869-1947 -rrb- - a former slave and later catholic nun and saint from darfur , sudan - to illustrate the theme of christian hope .
" let us put it very simply : man needs god , otherwise he remains without hope , " benedict wrote in the 70-page document , entitled in latin " spe salvi facti sumus " -lrb- in hope we are saved -rrb- .
the pope warned against what he sees as false hope based on " faith in progress , " tracing its origins to the french revolution and later , the communist ideology inspired by karl marx -lrb- not related to munich 's new archbishop -rrb- , who " forgot man and forgot man 's freedom . "
marxism , the pope wrote , had left behind " a trail of appalling destruction " because it failed to realize that man could not be " merely the product of economic conditions . "
italy 's union of atheists , agnostics and rationalists -lrb- uaar -rrb- criticized the pope for lashing out at atheists .

portugal holds the six-month eu presidency until the end of this year . measures provide allowances for developing nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is especially vulnerable to floods and monsoons exacerbated by climate change as a huge developing country , india , which is one of the world 's biggest polluters , is not obliged to make cuts in greenhouse gas emissions under the kyoto protocol .
singh emphasized that developing nations should not be held to the same standard on emissions as europe , and called for measures on climate change that do not " perpetuate poverty . " india and the eu agreed that the upcoming climate change conference in bali , indonesia , which runs from dec .
3-14 , should come up with a clear roadmap for controlling emissions beyond 2012 within a united nations framework when kyoto expires . " this compromise must be obtained within common but different responsibilities , " socrates said . bilateral trade pact to greatly boost india-eu trade the meeting marked the eighth eu-india summit and seeks to forge a closer strategic alliance and deepen cooperation on trade issues as well .
trade talks covered both a comprehensive bilateral eu-india trade agreement and the comprehensive doha round of international trade talks under the umbrella of the world trade organization . singh indicated that he hoped that the trade and investment agreement that was negotiated could be in place by the next annual summit in 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is the world 's fastest growing economy after china european commission president jose manuel barroso , who was also present at the summit , said that the trade pact was an ambitious one and would boost bilateral trade tremendously .
india-eu trade stood at about 47 billion euros last year . the eu is india 's largest trading partner accounting for nearly 20 percent of the south asian nation 's total trade .
it is also largest source of direct foreign investment .
the total investment flow from the eu into india amounted to nearly $ 11 billion in the period from august 1991 to february 2007 according to indian government sources . the eu has earmarked 470 million euros -lrb- $ 690 million -rrb- to promote economic development over the next five years , according to an article that barroso wrote in the indian media on friday . both sides also signed an agreement to strengthen cooperation in science and technology .
the eu agreed to provide seven million euros for setting up the european business and technology center in new delhi in order to promote further links between the business and scientific communities . deal to lower trade barriers may be reached at end of 2008 india , the world 's fastest growing economy after china , needs new export markets to maintain its record growth .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , who was also in attendance , said an agreement with the european union to lower tariffs and increase trade may be reached in one year 's time . india 's exports , however , account for less than 2 percent of overall eu imports , and european companies have invested 10 times more in china than in india over the last five years . other topics on the summit agenda were a possible civilian nuclear cooperation accord with the united states , which would provide india with access to american technology after a 30 year embargo .
india would first need to negotiate a safeguards agreement with the international atomic energy agency before us president bush can seek approval from congress to make such an agreement operational . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the bundesliga , simunic has been playing for berlin since 2000 .
his teammates call him “ joe . ” dw-tv : now you 've been in berlin since 2000 - what 's it like living here on the other side of the world ?
josip simunic : it 's different .
the longer i 'm away from australia , the more i see how much australia is a beautiful country , probably the best country in the world .
the people here are very different to australia .
in australia the people are more friendly .
here also , but not to the extent that they are in australia .
when you think back to the last round of the bundesliga we saw ivan klasnic come back , one of your countrymen .
what emotions did that bring ?
i just got goosebumps now .
i 'm happy for ivan .
i hope he stays healthy , i hope that he has no more problems with his kidneys or anything else .
he 's a great example to show that when someone really wants to achieve something , they can achieve it .
like i said , i hope he stays healthy and scores a lot of goals for werder bremen .
you said at the start when you first came here that you were here to win the german championship .
that success has n't come in the last 7 years - why has n't it happened ?
in the past we 've had very good teams , but there were better teams than us .
you have to play 34 games in a season .
i think we had too many games where we were up there , we needed the win , but because of the added pressure , we did n't put in a good performance and get the result .
we also have the problem that a lot of players come and then they get better offers from other clubs , more money .
that 's also a problem , when you get offered three times as much to play in england .
football is not only about money but you have to try and situate yourself quickly .
to be too aggressive is sometimes not good for the team .
you have to pick the right moment where you are going to be aggressive in the interests of the team , in order to show the younger players in the team that they should get involved .
that takes also a little bit of time .
the body language is also important .
i 'm getting more used to it and learning when to make the right challenge at the right time .
at the moment , it seems sometimes the aggression goes too far ?
would you agree with that ?
i agree with that .
sometimes it does go too far .
but i have to say : the refereeing in germany is a bit soft .
when i compare it - i watch a lot of english games - it 's a big , big difference .
when i see how people go in to challenges in england .
here in germany , it 's a very big difference - unfortunately .
with the success that you gained in the bundesliga you then became a member of the croatian national team .
what was it like winning against england in london last week ?
it was a great feeling .
how can i explain it to you ?
in the world cup against australia , when we did n't make it through , it was a very , very drained feeling .
against england , to win at wembley , was the total opposite .
it was probably the nicest feeling i have had in my life , when it comes to football .
these sorts of moments , in the headlines in europe , is this the reason why you opted to play for croatia and not the country of your birth , australia ?
i 'm a proud australian .
but i also know where i come from , my heritage , my background .
and i 'm very proud of that .
i feel more croatian than australian .
another reason is the long flight to australia for games - that 's also a very big problem .
we have that problem now with some of our brazilian players .
what are your plans for 2008 ?
how do you see it going for you ?
always when someone asks me what my plans are , the most important plan is to stay healthy .
football wise : the biggest thing is to try to get in to the top half of the table for hertha bsc and to become european champions for croatia .
thanks very much for your time .
thank you , thanks .
are you living in berlin ?
i am living in berlin .
how long have you been here for ?
for two and a half years .
do you like berlin ?

when i see how people go in to challenges in england .
here in germany , it 's a very big difference - unfortunately .
with the success that you gained in the bundesliga you then became a member of the croatian national team .
what was it like winning against england in london last week ?
it was a great feeling .
how can i explain it to you ?
in the world cup against australia , when we did n't make it through , it was a very , very drained feeling .
against england , to win at wembley , was the total opposite .
it was probably the nicest feeling i have had in my life , when it comes to football .
these sorts of moments , in the headlines in europe , is this the reason why you opted to play for croatia and not the country of your birth , australia ?
i 'm a proud australian .
but i also know where i come from , my heritage , my background .
and i 'm very proud of that .
i feel more croatian than australian .
another reason is the long flight to australia for games - that 's also a very big problem .
we have that problem now with some of our brazilian players .
what are your plans for 2008 ?
how do you see it going for you ?
always when someone asks me what my plans are , the most important plan is to stay healthy .
football wise : the biggest thing is to try to get in to the top half of the table for hertha bsc and to become european champions for croatia .
thanks very much for your time .
thank you , thanks .

in the bundesliga , simunic has been playing for berlin since 2000 .
his teammates call him “ joe . ” dw-tv : now you 've been in berlin since 2000 - what 's it like living here on the other side of the world ?
josip simunic : it 's different .
the longer i 'm away from australia , the more i see how much australia is a beautiful country , probably the best country in the world .
the people here are very different to australia .
in australia the people are more friendly .
here also , but not to the extent that they are in australia .
when you think back to the last round of the bundesliga we saw ivan klasnic come back , one of your countrymen .
what emotions did that bring ?
i just got goosebumps now .
i 'm happy for ivan .
i hope he stays healthy , i hope that he has no more problems with his kidneys or anything else .
he 's a great example to show that when someone really wants to achieve something , they can achieve it .
like i said , i hope he stays healthy and scores a lot of goals for werder bremen .
you said at the start when you first came here that you were here to win the german championship .
that success has n't come in the last 7 years - why has n't it happened ?
in the past we 've had very good teams , but there were better teams than us .
you have to play 34 games in a season .
i think we had too many games where we were up there , we needed the win , but because of the added pressure , we did n't put in a good performance and get the result .
we also have the problem that a lot of players come and then they get better offers from other clubs , more money .
that 's also a problem , when you get offered three times as much to play in england .
football is not only about money but you have to try and situate yourself quickly .
to be too aggressive is sometimes not good for the team .
you have to pick the right moment where you are going to be aggressive in the interests of the team , in order to show the younger players in the team that they should get involved .
that takes also a little bit of time .
the body language is also important .
i 'm getting more used to it and learning when to make the right challenge at the right time .
at the moment , it seems sometimes the aggression goes too far ?
would you agree with that ?
i agree with that .
sometimes it does go too far .
but i have to say : the refereeing in germany is a bit soft .

30 , overwhelmingly approved the federal budget of 283.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 417.4 billion -rrb- for 2008 , an increase of 4 percent from 2007 . lawmakers voted 408-144 in favor of the budget , which has provided for a slight increase in outlays for defense and economic assistance . defense spending will go up to 29.45 billion euros , up from 28.39 billion in 2007 .

it 's making the cracks in the german coalition government increasingly visible . the premier of the central german state of hesse , roland koch , on friday , nov .
30 , accused german foreign minister and vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier of pursuing a harmful foreign policy that is based solely on economic interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse premier roland koch has spared no words in lashing out at the foreign minister " germany has a historical obligation not to keep quiet about moral questions , " roland koch told the bild newspaper .
" we have no right to put economics above human rights . "
koch , who is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , passed judgment on steinmeier , a social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- , for " creating the impression in russia and china that we germans are ready to do any kind of business , even when human rights are being trampled on . "
" in doing so , the foreign minister is harming our country , " koch said .
the unusually strong rhetoric from the cdu politician is not only a sign of the strained relations in the grand coalition , but an indicator that foreign policy may play an important role in the campaigns leading up to the 2009 elections .
the right way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spd foreign policy expert rolf mützenich dismissed the criticism directed at the foreign minister .
" we advocate the anchoring of human rights in the international law , " mützenich told the dpa news agency .
the spd politician pointed out that china signed the most important human rights conventions and proved itself to be a responsible partner in the nuclear row with iran and north korea .
" those are the points of reference for a moral foreign policy , " he said .
during a visit to paris earlier in november , steinmeier told journalists he was " worried " about the escalating diplomatic tension between germany and china in the wake of the dalai lama 's visit with merkel .
in september , the chancellor met with the tibetan spiritual leader , whom chinese officials see as a dangerous separatist .
consequently , china axed a series of high level exchanges with germany , including a trip to beijing by finance minister peer steinbrück , planned for december .
the russian question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama has had a chilling effect on the relations with beijing china , however , is not the only foreign-policy wedge between the coalition partners .
german-russian relations were much more cordial during the previous german government , boosted by the flaunting camaraderie between the then chancellor , gerhard schröder , and russian president vladimir putin .
in a speech delivered in stuttgart on thursday , schröder - who was himself often criticized for turning a blind eye to putin 's human rights record , lashed out at germany 's foreign policy by saying he had the impression he was back " in the cold war era . "
some politicians were promoting a " distancing , even opposition to russia , " the former leader of the social democratic party said .
" i regard this approach as wrong , if not even dangerous , " he added .
less than a month after leaving the chancellor 's office in november 2005 , schröder was voted in as head of the supervisory board for a company that 's closely linked to the state-owned russian energy giant gazprom .
this move was seen by many in germany as ethically questionable if not complete unacceptable .
pursuing an ethical foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-russian relations were much closer under gerhard schröder merkel , on the other hand , said in a speech to the german parliament on wednesday that there was no difference between a foreign policy based on values and one pursuing german economic interests .
" human rights policy and representation of economic interests are two sides of the same coin , " merkel said .
" they should never be opposed to each another . "
merkel will get to test her diplomatic skills and her role as a champion of human rights at a summit between leaders of the european union and african states that is taking place in the portuguese capital of lisbon from dec .
7 - 9 .
the summit will also be attended by zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe , a dictator whose controversial policies of seizing white-owned commercial farms and threats to nationalize foreign-owned firms make him an uncomfortable politician to deal with in the eu .
unlike british prime minister gordon brown , who decided not to attend the summit because of the presence of the zimbabwean head of state , merkel declined to back calls for mugabe to be barred from the summit . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german-russian relations were much more cordial during the previous german government , boosted by the flaunting camaraderie between the then chancellor , gerhard schröder , and russian president vladimir putin .
in a speech delivered in stuttgart on thursday , schröder - who was himself often criticized for turning a blind eye to putin 's human rights record , lashed out at germany 's foreign policy by saying he had the impression he was back " in the cold war era . "
some politicians were promoting a " distancing , even opposition to russia , " the former leader of the social democratic party said .
" i regard this approach as wrong , if not even dangerous , " he added .
less than a month after leaving the chancellor 's office in november 2005 , schröder was voted in as head of the supervisory board for a company that 's closely linked to the state-owned russian energy giant gazprom .
this move was seen by many in germany as ethically questionable if not complete unacceptable .
pursuing an ethical foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-russian relations were much closer under gerhard schröder merkel , on the other hand , said in a speech to the german parliament on wednesday that there was no difference between a foreign policy based on values and one pursuing german economic interests .
" human rights policy and representation of economic interests are two sides of the same coin , " merkel said .
" they should never be opposed to each another . "
merkel will get to test her diplomatic skills and her role as a champion of human rights at a summit between leaders of the european union and african states that is taking place in the portuguese capital of lisbon from dec .
7 - 9 .
the summit will also be attended by zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe , a dictator whose controversial policies of seizing white-owned commercial farms and threats to nationalize foreign-owned firms make him an uncomfortable politician to deal with in the eu .
unlike british prime minister gordon brown , who decided not to attend the summit because of the presence of the zimbabwean head of state , merkel declined to back calls for mugabe to be barred from the summit . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it 's no easy task as violence , drugs and poverty remain even as the country has entered a relatively peaceful time . cartagena , its graceful city center hugging the caribbean coast , is a colonial-era jewel encircled by modern day poverty and persistent violence .
home to more than 1 million people , the city illustrates the complex situation faced by colombia as it tries to return to normalcy after decades of armed conflict . the united nations world tourism organization met in cartagena this week and colombia officials were eager to change perceptions of the country .
colombian president alvaro uribe , whose law-and-order policies have brought some stability to the country , bore the message that his country was ready for european and american tourists to arrive and open their wallets . " you are visiting a country that has suffered greatly , but has a tremendous amount of hope , " he said . real world problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cartagena 's historic city center is a unesco world heritage site but even as delegates met , the reality of life outside cartagena 's heavily-guarded convention center seeped in and painted a bleak picture of life with few public services and no police protection . between 2 million and 3 million colombians have fled their homes to escape ongoing paramilitary hostilities and are living in extreme poverty in the suburbs of cities such as cartagena .
newspapers also regularly carry reports of murders and other drug-related violence . uribe said he knows it 's news like this which has kept the number of europeans who visit colombia each year small : about 125,700 arrived in the first nine months of 2007 .
most came from former colonial power spain . " terrorism puts a stop to all our possibilities , " he said referring to fighting between left-wing guerillas , right-wing paramilitaries , the military and drug lords .
" without terrorism , we 'll have tourism .
without terrorism , we 'll be happy . " some positives , many problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the growing economy has led to a building boom in cartagena the colombian government points to statistics which show that in recent years the murder rate has been cut in half and kidnappings are down 75 percent .
the country is also experiencing an economic boom officials hope will help bring in tourist dollars and help meet an ambitious goal of attracting 4 million foreign tourists to the country by 2010 . the economy had 6.8 percent growth in 2006 and is headed for 7.48 percent this year .
in cartagena , luxury hotels are springing up and it 's become a routine stop on the caribbean cruise circuit . but even as the tourist industry proclaims its slogan , " colombia , the only risk is wanting to stay , " and luxury hotels spring up along the country 's beaches and growth heads to 7.48 percent this year , the government acknowledges that parts of the country are not safe for visitors . eu aid a lifeline to locals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cartagena looks very different from outside the convention center while the colombian government said that eventually tourism will improve people 's lives , it will remain dependent on international development aid . the european union will provide 160 million euros -lrb- $ 216 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to colombia between 2007-2013 .
but unlike the united states , which focuses on giving money to fight colombia 's illicit drug trade , the eu will direct aid directly to victims and non-governmental organizations which help them . european donors are a lifeline for many local aid organizations in the country , but money - from both tourism and the government - does n't always appear as promised , said maria amparo gomez , a dominican nun who runs a school in cartagena . " there are two cartagenas that are very well separated from each other , " she said . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dominique bussereau , france 's deputy transport minister , however , suggested to the ap that spain ought to be awarded a galileo test center . under the compromise reached friday , spain 's " safety of life " center could " evolve into a fully qualified " control center by 2013 , allowing madrid to supervise operation of the satellites and their transmissions to earth .
" the spanish center , once it is up and running from a technical point of view , would act as a control center along with the others " in germany and italy , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot explained .
after a consortium of private companies abandoned galileo earlier this year due to a financing dispute , the european commission agreed last friday to fund the entire program , with most of the additional 2.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- in funding coming from leftover agricultural funds and the rest from research , transport and administration budgets .

while competition rules would normally dictate that contracts be awarded on a best-offer basis , the european space industry is concentrated into a few main groups which have demanded a higher share of the lucrative business . the agreement , however , does not allow a single company to obtain an inordinately large portion of the project 's contracts . " galileo will become the spearhead for european technology , " barrot told reporters .
" we are on the way towards putting galileo into operation for 2013 and to offer europeans very many services . " the galileo project has been plagued by delays and is already running five years behind schedule with only one test satellite up in orbit .

30 , on how the work for the long-delayed satellite navigation project galileo would be divided up among the 27 member countries . at an eu meeting of the bloc 's transport ministers , spain , which had made demands to host a ground station for a network of some 30 satellites , first dissented , but later agreed . under the current deal , the galileo program , which is budgeted at 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- and intended to reduce the eu 's reliance on the us global position system -lrb- gps -rrb- , plans to install only two ground control stations : one near munich and one in rome . no money for third ground station bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo should be fully operable by 2013 , barrot said " we just do n't have the money for a third ground station , " an unidentified eu diplomat told the associated press .
dominique bussereau , france 's deputy transport minister , however , suggested to the ap that spain ought to be awarded a galileo test center . under the compromise reached friday , spain 's " safety of life " center could " evolve into a fully qualified " control center by 2013 , allowing madrid to supervise operation of the satellites and their transmissions to earth .
" the spanish center , once it is up and running from a technical point of view , would act as a control center along with the others " in germany and italy , eu transport commissioner jacques barrot explained .
after a consortium of private companies abandoned galileo earlier this year due to a financing dispute , the european commission agreed last friday to fund the entire program , with most of the additional 2.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- in funding coming from leftover agricultural funds and the rest from research , transport and administration budgets .
germany wants its fair share of galileo projects as the biggest contributor to the eu budget , germany wants astrium , a german-dominated subsidiary of the european aerospace giant eads , to have a proportionate share of galileo contracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite images can pinpoint the precise location of iranian nuclear sites - or anywhere else the main issue hacked out by the transport ministers was how to slice the galileo pie among european companies .
while competition rules would normally dictate that contracts be awarded on a best-offer basis , the european space industry is concentrated into a few main groups which have demanded a higher share of the lucrative business . the agreement , however , does not allow a single company to obtain an inordinately large portion of the project 's contracts . " galileo will become the spearhead for european technology , " barrot told reporters .
" we are on the way towards putting galileo into operation for 2013 and to offer europeans very many services . " the galileo project has been plagued by delays and is already running five years behind schedule with only one test satellite up in orbit .

it 's making the cracks in the german coalition government increasingly visible . the premier of the central german state of hesse , roland koch , on friday , nov .
30 , accused german foreign minister and vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier of pursuing a harmful foreign policy that is based solely on economic interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse premier roland koch has spared no words in lashing out at the foreign minister " germany has a historical obligation not to keep quiet about moral questions , " roland koch told the bild newspaper .
" we have no right to put economics above human rights . "
koch , who is a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , passed judgment on steinmeier , a social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- , for " creating the impression in russia and china that we germans are ready to do any kind of business , even when human rights are being trampled on . "
" in doing so , the foreign minister is harming our country , " koch said .
the unusually strong rhetoric from the cdu politician is not only a sign of the strained relations in the grand coalition , but an indicator that foreign policy may play an important role in the campaigns leading up to the 2009 elections .
the right way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spd foreign policy expert rolf mützenich dismissed the criticism directed at the foreign minister .
" we advocate the anchoring of human rights in the international law , " mützenich told the dpa news agency .
the spd politician pointed out that china signed the most important human rights conventions and proved itself to be a responsible partner in the nuclear row with iran and north korea .
" those are the points of reference for a moral foreign policy , " he said .
during a visit to paris earlier in november , steinmeier told journalists he was " worried " about the escalating diplomatic tension between germany and china in the wake of the dalai lama 's visit with merkel .
in september , the chancellor met with the tibetan spiritual leader , whom chinese officials see as a dangerous separatist .
consequently , china axed a series of high level exchanges with germany , including a trip to beijing by finance minister peer steinbrück , planned for december .
the russian question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's meeting with the dalai lama has had a chilling effect on the relations with beijing china , however , is not the only foreign-policy wedge between the coalition partners .
german-russian relations were much more cordial during the previous german government , boosted by the flaunting camaraderie between the then chancellor , gerhard schröder , and russian president vladimir putin .
in a speech delivered in stuttgart on thursday , schröder - who was himself often criticized for turning a blind eye to putin 's human rights record , lashed out at germany 's foreign policy by saying he had the impression he was back " in the cold war era . "
some politicians were promoting a " distancing , even opposition to russia , " the former leader of the social democratic party said .
" i regard this approach as wrong , if not even dangerous , " he added .
less than a month after leaving the chancellor 's office in november 2005 , schröder was voted in as head of the supervisory board for a company that 's closely linked to the state-owned russian energy giant gazprom .
this move was seen by many in germany as ethically questionable if not complete unacceptable .
pursuing an ethical foreign policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-russian relations were much closer under gerhard schröder merkel , on the other hand , said in a speech to the german parliament on wednesday that there was no difference between a foreign policy based on values and one pursuing german economic interests .
" human rights policy and representation of economic interests are two sides of the same coin , " merkel said .
" they should never be opposed to each another . "
merkel will get to test her diplomatic skills and her role as a champion of human rights at a summit between leaders of the european union and african states that is taking place in the portuguese capital of lisbon from dec .
7 - 9 .
the summit will also be attended by zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe , a dictator whose controversial policies of seizing white-owned commercial farms and threats to nationalize foreign-owned firms make him an uncomfortable politician to deal with in the eu .
unlike british prime minister gordon brown , who decided not to attend the summit because of the presence of the zimbabwean head of state , merkel declined to back calls for mugabe to be barred from the summit . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the six-team , 17-day indian cricket league includes stars like brian lara , lance klusener and inzamam-ul-haq .

the $ 25m -lrb- £ 12.5m -rrb- competition is led by legendary indian cricketer and former captain kapil dev .
however , the board of control for cricket in india -lrb- bcci -rrb- has also refused to acknowledge the indian cricket league -lrb- icl -rrb- and has threatened players with lengthy bans .
a number of younger indian players have joined the tournament .
other national governing bodies are warning their players against taking part .
' serious cricket ' the first edition of the tournament will be restricted to 20-over contests - popularly known as twenty20 - and will feature teams named after six indian cities .

at the championship club 's annual general meeting on thursday a spokesman said a site in south bristol was already earmarked for the development .
the club hopes planning permission will be in place by the end of 2009 and the new stadium will be ready in time for the 2011/2012 season .
its aim is to be able to host world cup games , in which case capacity could increase to 40,000 if approved .
the club said it was legally bound not to give the exact location of the new stadium , but it is said to be " not too far " from the ashton gate ground .
chairman steve lansdown said : " i 've gone to the council , had conversations with all the party leaders , got their support for it , spoken to the planners .
" we 've got to go through the due process , but i 'm confident we 'll get the end result in a reasonable time frame . "
ashton gate could now be sold off for housing .

the fall from the 9.3 % growth seen between april and june was caused by a slowdown in manufacturing output .
factory output , a key driver of india 's past four years of rapid economic growth , grew 8.6 % in july to september , down from 11.9 % in april to june .
the slight slowdown will please delhi , which has sought to cool inflation .
services growth with the indian economy now the world 's second fastest-growing after china , india 's central bank has moved several times to cool this growth and reduce inflationary pressures .
in addition to five interest rate rises from mid-2006 to march of this year , the reserve bank of india has increased the amount of funds commercial lenders must keep in reserve rather than lend out .
the latest tightening of this so-called cash reserve ratio came at the end of last month .
such a move helps to reduce inflation , as it cuts the amount of rupees in circulation .
while manufacturing growth eased during july to september , the services sector grew by 10.2 % , and farming expanded by 3.6 % .
" we will see further moderation in the coming two quarters ... the impact of rate tightening is now being felt and it will intensify , " said dk joshi , principal economist at rating agency crisil .

the fall from the 9.3 % growth seen between april and june was caused by a slowdown in manufacturing output .
factory output , a key driver of india 's past four years of rapid economic growth , grew 8.6 % in july to september , down from 11.9 % in april to june .
the slight slowdown will please delhi , which has sought to cool inflation .
services growth with the indian economy now the world 's second fastest-growing after china , india 's central bank has moved several times to cool this growth and reduce inflationary pressures .
in addition to five interest rate rises from mid-2006 to march of this year , the reserve bank of india has increased the amount of funds commercial lenders must keep in reserve rather than lend out .
the latest tightening of this so-called cash reserve ratio came at the end of last month .
such a move helps to reduce inflation , as it cuts the amount of rupees in circulation .
while manufacturing growth eased during july to september , the services sector grew by 10.2 % , and farming expanded by 3.6 % .
" we will see further moderation in the coming two quarters ... the impact of rate tightening is now being felt and it will intensify , " said dk joshi , principal economist at rating agency crisil .

the men each pleaded guilty to one charge of wire fraud .
if the judge approves the plea bargain conducted between prosecution and defence , they are expected to face 37 months in prison .
they had each been charged with seven counts and if found guilty on all of them , could have been looking at sentences of up to 35 years .
and it this disparity which worries some legal experts .
sally ireland , senior legal officer of the organisation , justice , said : " you have to wonder about the degree of pressure put on defendants to change their plea when the incentive is such a huge reduction in sentence .
" that can catch the innocent in the net as well as the guilty . "
setting the sentence there is little doubt that formalised plea bargaining and the use of insider or employee witnesses explains why so many more us fraud trials are successful than in the uk .
about 95 % of cases are resolved in this way .
in the uk , informal discussions have taken place between prosecution and defence in some criminal cases for many years .
under the serious organised crime and police act , 2005 , the system by which a defendant can enter a guilty plea and offer queen 's evidence in return for a discounted sentence was , for the first time , placed on a statutory footing .
but it is the judge , rather than the prosecution , who sets the sentence .
in 2006 , a whitehall review set up to examine the prosecution of fraud trials , recommended that those facing fraud allegations should be able to reach a deal with prosecutors even before charges are brought . "
there will be intense interest in the outcome of their fight " jon silverman this would depend on defendants having a degree of certainty about the sentence they would face .
the director of the serious fraud office , robert wardle , supports such a move , as well as tougher sentences for fraud .
the case of the natwest three was notable for the storm of protest over the 2003 extradition act which , critics said , made it far easier for the us to extradite a suspect from britain than the other way round .
at the time the men were sent to texas to face trial , the us congress had not even ratified the treaty .
under pressure from the uk government , it has since done so .
but concerns remain that us prosecutors and courts are pursuing an expansionist strategy which will see more foreign-based suspects falling into the clutches of the us judicial process .
a british computer hacker , gary mckinnon , and a british financier , ian norris , are both resisting extradition requests through the courts here .
there will be intense interest in the outcome of their fight .

the men each pleaded guilty to one charge of wire fraud .
if the judge approves the plea bargain conducted between prosecution and defence , they are expected to face 37 months in prison .
they had each been charged with seven counts and if found guilty on all of them , could have been looking at sentences of up to 35 years .
and it this disparity which worries some legal experts .
sally ireland , senior legal officer of the organisation , justice , said : " you have to wonder about the degree of pressure put on defendants to change their plea when the incentive is such a huge reduction in sentence .
" that can catch the innocent in the net as well as the guilty . "
setting the sentence there is little doubt that formalised plea bargaining and the use of insider or employee witnesses explains why so many more us fraud trials are successful than in the uk .
about 95 % of cases are resolved in this way .
in the uk , informal discussions have taken place between prosecution and defence in some criminal cases for many years .
under the serious organised crime and police act , 2005 , the system by which a defendant can enter a guilty plea and offer queen 's evidence in return for a discounted sentence was , for the first time , placed on a statutory footing .
but it is the judge , rather than the prosecution , who sets the sentence .
in 2006 , a whitehall review set up to examine the prosecution of fraud trials , recommended that those facing fraud allegations should be able to reach a deal with prosecutors even before charges are brought .
there will be intense interest in the outcome of their fight jon silverman this would depend on defendants having a degree of certainty about the sentence they would face .
the director of the serious fraud office , robert wardle , supports such a move , as well as tougher sentences for fraud .
the case of the natwest three was notable for the storm of protest over the 2003 extradition act which , critics said , made it far easier for the us to extradite a suspect from britain than the other way round .
at the time the men were sent to texas to face trial , the us congress had not even ratified the treaty .
under pressure from the uk government , it has since done so .
but concerns remain that us prosecutors and courts are pursuing an expansionist strategy which will see more foreign-based suspects falling into the clutches of the us judicial process .
a british computer hacker , gary mckinnon , and a british financier , ian norris , are both resisting extradition requests through the courts here .

but it is the judge , rather than the prosecution , who sets the sentence .
in 2006 , a whitehall review set up to examine the prosecution of fraud trials , recommended that those facing fraud allegations should be able to reach a deal with prosecutors even before charges are brought .
there will be intense interest in the outcome of their fight jon silverman this would depend on defendants having a degree of certainty about the sentence they would face .
the director of the serious fraud office , robert wardle , supports such a move , as well as tougher sentences for fraud .
the case of the natwest three was notable for the storm of protest over the 2003 extradition act which , critics said , made it far easier for the us to extradite a suspect from britain than the other way round .
at the time the men were sent to texas to face trial , the us congress had not even ratified the treaty .
under pressure from the uk government , it has since done so .
but concerns remain that us prosecutors and courts are pursuing an expansionist strategy which will see more foreign-based suspects falling into the clutches of the us judicial process .
a british computer hacker , gary mckinnon , and a british financier , ian norris , are both resisting extradition requests through the courts here .

but this year , alnwick council has been warned that its insurance does not cover the tradition .
voluntary group alnwick lions , which organises the event , called the decision " frustrating " .
a council spokeswoman said : " our insurance company has told us that our insurance would not be valid as the alnwick lions ' use would not be classed as part of our core business .
" we always try to help with community projects , but regrettably , this is out of our hands . "
fortunately , local children will still be able to see santa , as a local firm has lent the lions a bus to replace the traditional sleigh .

one senior official tells a tale of the now deceased french president francois mitterrand being shown , but not being allowed to keep , top secret us satellite photos of iraqi military movements .
at the end of the meeting the images were safely tucked away into the us ambassador 's case mitterrand 's response ?
to demand of his officials that france build and launch its own spy satellite system .
nearly 20 years on and much of the talk that surrounds galileo is the need to be independent of us military technology - in this case the global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- that currently drives , for example , satellite navigation devices .
' trust issues ' " nobody can rely on somebody else 's system , " says javier benedicto , galileo 's project manager .
" this is why the russians , the chinese , the indians , the us , and also the europeans have to deploy their own system in order to match their own needs .
galileo under construction a european commission and european space agency project 30 satellites to be launched in batches by end of 2011-12 will work alongside us gps and russian glonass systems promises real-time positioning down to less than a metre guaranteed under all but most extreme circumstances suitable for safety-critical roles where lives depend on service europe lofts galileo satellite q & a : europe 's galileo project galileo puts uk on map " now , we should ensure that all these systems are interoperable and compatible with each other , but that does n't remove the need for europe to have its own system . "
a meeting on thursday of the 27 eu transport ministers in brussels gave the political green light to the project .
the usual eu suspects are unhappy about galileo and the budget shenanigans that have surrounded it .
worthy scandinavians worry about the propriety of unstitching a budget only recently agreed .
the dutch have long had misgivings .
support is lukewarm-bordering-on-downright-hostile in the uk .
in the downright-hostile camp is labour mp gwyneth dunwoody , who chairs the house of commons transport select committee , and is brutal about galileo .
the proposed system she describes as " a nonsense " which " no commercial firm wants anything to do because they do n't think they can make any money out of it , no obvious benefit is to be gathered , no really efficient service is to be delivered . "
white elephant in the lukewarm camp is the uk government .
officials talk about cost-efficiency and rigorous review in a forlorn way , as if they know in their hearts that the project is doomed already to mismanagement and overspend .
mr benedicto says there is strong rationale for a european system other diplomats acknowledge the lurking presence of the white elephant in the corner of the room .
" what concerns me , " says one , pausing , " is that the reasons -lsb- for galileo -rsb- keep changing " .
nothing like galileo has ever been done by the eu .
vast sums have been handed out to member states , and european flags adorn buildings and bridges from trieste to glasgow all attesting to the generosity of the european union .
but the eu has never managed and built anything like this before .
and for some , alongside the technological advantages , and the desire to be free from dependence on america , that 's the point .
european dream matthias reute , director general of the commission 's transport and energy departments , was one of those who helped dream up galileo as a european project in the late 1990s .
galileo , he says , will launch .
if it 's not the eu that does it , then a european consortium like the one that set up airbus , he thinks , would step in .
that , he says , " would be bad for europe . "
why , i ask ?
" because we have embarked on it together , we would to a certain extent be saying we can no longer take decisions because we 've become too big , and the sense of community will no longer be there . "
and so a small part of the european dream heads for space .
another global navigation satellite system is n't a giant technological leap ; but it is through small steps , not giant leaps , that the eu evolves and grows .

the proposed system she describes as " a nonsense " which " no commercial firm wants anything to do because they do n't think they can make any money out of it , no obvious benefit is to be gathered , no really efficient service is to be delivered . "
white elephant in the lukewarm camp is the uk government .
officials talk about cost-efficiency and rigorous review in a forlorn way , as if they know in their hearts that the project is doomed already to mismanagement and overspend .
mr benedicto says there is strong rationale for a european system other diplomats acknowledge the lurking presence of the white elephant in the corner of the room .
" what concerns me , " says one , pausing , " is that the reasons -lsb- for galileo -rsb- keep changing " .
nothing like galileo has ever been done by the eu .
vast sums have been handed out to member states , and european flags adorn buildings and bridges from trieste to glasgow all attesting to the generosity of the european union .
but the eu has never managed and built anything like this before .
and for some , alongside the technological advantages , and the desire to be free from dependence on america , that 's the point .
european dream matthias reute , director general of the commission 's transport and energy departments , was one of those who helped dream up galileo as a european project in the late 1990s .
galileo , he says , will launch .
if it 's not the eu that does it , then a european consortium like the one that set up airbus , he thinks , would step in .
that , he says , " would be bad for europe . "
why , i ask ?
" because we have embarked on it together , we would to a certain extent be saying we can no longer take decisions because we 've become too big , and the sense of community will no longer be there . "
and so a small part of the european dream heads for space .

set up a team to investigate and advise on the circumstances of the " hidden " donations to labour and pledged that all the monies would be paid back .
what he said : " i had no knowledge until saturday night , either of the donations or of the practice which had grown up where they were improperly declared to the electoral commission ...
the money was not lawfully declared . " hilary benn role : was offered £ 5,000 by janet kidd for his failed campaign to become labour 's deputy leader but turned the money down after being told by party colleague baroness jay that the money was in fact coming from mr abrahams .
what his spokesman said : " we did not accept it because we felt that if mr abrahams wanted to make a donation he should do so in his own name .
we returned the cheque . " harriet harman role : accepted a £ 5,000 donation from janet kidd for her successful campaign for the party deputy leadership , even though she did not know who mrs kidd was .
she wrote her a letter of thanks , but after the revelations that the money actually came from mr abrahams , she said she would return the money , which she said she had taken in good faith .
what she said : " my campaign understood -lsb- janet kidd -rsb- to be a pre-existing donor to the labour party ...
i do n't think there 's any question of me having broken either the letter or the spirit of the law . "
profile : harriet harman the party officials peter watt role : first casualty of the donations scandal , resigning as labour general secretary after admitting he was aware of the arrangement whereby mr abrahams donated hundreds of thousands of pounds to the party in the names of others .
what he said : " i believed at the time my reporting obligations had been appropriately complied with . "
profile : peter watt jon mendelsohn role : labour 's chief fundraiser was told by peter watt about the " hidden " donations in october but did not inform anyone else .
planned to tackle mr abrahams about the arrangement because he was concerned about a lack of transparency .
wrote to him , requesting a meeting , at which he intended to tell him his method of donating was unacceptable .
what he said : " " i was informed by peter watt , to whom i reported , that this was an arrangement ... which was long-standing and which was appropriately dealt with in relation to the party 's reporting requirements .
" he told me these donations fully complied with the law , and i had no reason to doubt that information . " chris leslie role : gordon brown 's labour leadership campaign co-ordinator passed on janet kidd 's details to harriet harman 's campaign team .
mr leslie has said he was initially contacted by mr abrahams in may , who referred him to mrs kidd as someone who wanted to make a donation .
mr leslie says the brown campaign was sent an " unprompted " cheque for £ 5,000 from mrs kidd .
mr leslie says he tore the cheque up because no one in the campaign team knew who she was .
what he said : " subsequently , when the leadership election was over , i was approached by members of harriet harman 's campaign team asking if i knew of any individuals who might donate to her deputy leadership campaign .
" i passed them the details of mrs kidd as someone whose offer of a donation we had not taken up . "
