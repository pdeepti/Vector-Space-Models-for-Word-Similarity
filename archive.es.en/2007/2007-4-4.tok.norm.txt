program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.04.2007 eu urges moderation in ukraine political standoff großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych supporters have been voicing their discontent in kiev the european union has urged the leaders of rival parties in ukraine to settle their political disputes .
but the bloc also said it considers the standoff a domestic issue that does n't warrant outside involvement . the eu 's statement came a day after ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said he was dissolving parliament and calling fresh elections in may .
the parliament , which is dominated by yushchenko 's rival , viktor yanukovych , rejected that announcement , saying it amounted to an attempted coup d 'etat . crisis talks tuesday between yushchenko and prime minister viktor yanukovych failed to yield a compromise between the two rivals , even after ukraine 's government and parliament voted to defy the president 's orders . the presidential office said in a statement that yushchenko had informed the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana of his intention to hold snap elections . but yanukovych , who favours ties with russia , said pro-western yushchenko had made " a fatal mistake " in issuing the order dissolving parliament after months of political impasse .
hundreds of anti-yushchenko activists meanwhile camped out overnight in central kiev to protest against the president and vowed to hold a mass protest on wednesday .
" no to the division of ukraine ! " and " the constitution is the law for everyone ! " read placards posted up by the activists outside more than 200 tents set up near the parliament building and on independence square . eu has no plans to intervene the german eu presidency expressed concern about the situation in ukraine .
in a written statement , the german foreign ministry called upon the two sides in the conflict " to settle their current differences on domestic policy in a manner which complies with the constitution and domestic rules . " but the eu does not plan to intervene .
" we do not consider the situation at the moment to need influence from outside , " european commission spokeswoman christiane hohmann said .

in milan , bayern battled to the end against ac , pulling out a 2-all draw thanks to van buyten 's last-second goal . belgian defender daniel van buyten has n't been having the best season at bayern , but he came up big at san siro on tuesday night , scoring both of munich 's goals .
the 2-all draw puts the bundesliga side in excellent position to qualify for the champions league semi-finals next week in munich . bayern had lost four straight games against ac in milan , but this time they hung tough to put a major dent in milan 's title ambitions .
playing without keeper ollie kahn and midfielder mark van bommel , both suspended , munich twice came from behind in the match . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's challenge against kaka led to milan 's disputed penalty the hosts opened the scoring in the 40th minute after bayern botched an off-side trap - alberto gilardino headed home from 7 meters .
bayern were able to equalize in the 78th minute after the ball landed at van buyten 's feet directly in front of the goal . the visitors looked to be doomed seven minutes from time , when milan converted a controversial penalty .
but bayern made the most of the remaining minutes and van buyten levelled things up just before the final whistle , getting his left foot on a cross by owen hargreaves . with neither side playing brilliantly at the moment , this is a match-up that will be decided by persistence , not genius .

site said the video extended the ultimatum for the withdrawal by 10 days . germany has nearly 3,000 troops in afghanistan serving with the nato-led force and austria has a token contingent of around five officers . krause warned in the video that a failure to comply with her captors ' demands would have consequences for both countries and her and her son . a first deadline for the pair 's execution came and went on march 20 with the german government unable to contact the kidnappers , german television reported at the time . berlin has made several appeals for the hostages ' release including a message from german president horst köhler , contained in a video distributed in germany and the arab world , urging the kidnappers " to return the hostages to their family .

they also know that the government is n't able to be blackmailed , " tophoven said .
the kidnappers must also realize that it 's unrealistic to demand germany pull out of afghanistan , the expert said , adding he thought it was a way for the kidnappers to up the ante , but that behind the scenes , the kidnapping is about money . terrorism expert guido steinberg agreed that the kidnappers likely want money . " i do n't really think that right now in baghdad people are actually interested about what is happening in afghanistan and that german troops are there , " steinberg said in a wednesday morning interview with the german public broadcaster ard . steinberg , a specialist on islamist terrorism , said he was not suggesting that negotiators dismiss the link to afghanistan .
kidnappers often make political demands as ways to get money . " from my point of view , this is an attempt to use public opinion here in germany to get attention and force the german government to follow the wishes of the german public , " steinberg said in the ard interview . if the kidnappers are actually trying to get money , the scare tactics will likely continue , tophoven predicted .

but will serbia , which considers kosovo as its territory , accept the idea ? the plan - which was drawn up by un special envoy martti ahtisaari of finland - would go a long way toward granting kosovo 's majority ethnic albanian populace independence form serbia while retaining international supervision over the province . at the same time , it would also allow serbian dominated municipalities to govern themselves in many respects and maintain existing ties to belgrade .
the goal is to create a multi-ethnic , democratic state under the rule of law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo was devasted by the 1998-1999 war and sporadic violence continues ahead of the closed-door debates in the security council , ahtisaari 's blueprint was endorsed by kosovo 's current president , fatmir sejdiu , and by the us and the eu , who see it as the only viable way to solve the problem of kosovo 's long-term status . kosovo has been under un control since 1999 when nato military forces intervened to stop a brutal serbian crackdown on the ethnic albanian independence movement in the province . russian scepticism any decision by the security council would be binding .
but russia , which has the power of veto on the council , has criticized the plan , saying any decisions on kosovo 's status must be accepted by all sides of the conflict . belgrade has flatly rejected ahtisaari 's blueprint , insisting that kosovo remain part of serbia and calling for fresh negotiations under a new un-appointed arbitrator . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un special envoy martti ahtisaari expects protracted negotiations britain 's un ambassador emyr jones parry - currently the security council president - said there was considerable support for the plan .
but he added , " i do n't think it 's likely there will be an early presentation of a security council resolution .

at the half-hour mark , david silva let loose a sharp shot from some 20 meters out that was unstoppable for chelsea keeper petr cech - valenica led 1-0 .
after the interval , chelsea stormed out of the locker room and quickly took control of the game .
in the 53rd minute , the blues ' top scorer , didier drogba , headed home the equalizer .
chelsea , however , retained the pressure for the remainder of the match but valencia showed little weakness in gaining the draw .

the one-sided nature of this contest was obvious as roma launched 26 total shots .

nuclear energy remains controversial and germany lacks a plan for storing its high-level radioactive waste . the federal administrative court in leipzig ruled tuesday that a plan to store atomic waste in an abandoned iron ore mine could go ahead .
work will begin as soon as possible , although it will likely take a number of years before atomic waste is transferred to the site . heinrich sander , lower saxony 's environment minister and a member of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- welcomed tuesday 's ruling , which comes after decades of legal challenges . " there 's finally legal certainty and clarity , " he said . germany 's federal government signalled it plans to go ahead with the storage project . " there 's no other alternative than to implement the decision , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel of the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . phasing out nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to close its nuclear power plants the underground site will hold up to 303,000 cubic meters of atomic waste .
communities and farmers near the site fought for years to stop the project , questioning the long-term safety of the storage facility and fearful of a possible terrorist attack .
the court dismissed those claims . at present , germany plans to phase out its use of nuclear power .
the previous coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder agreed to shut down all power plants by 2020 . but current chancellor angela merkel of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has questioned the phase-out plans .
she recently challenged opponents of nuclear energy in germany to come up with realistic solutions to the country 's energy needs while paying heed to environmental issues . " i 'm saying that those who want both the nuclear phase-out and climate protection are now , naturally , called upon to provide answers , " merkel said in an interview with german radio in january . current storage problems yet regardless of the future of nuclear energy , germany still has to find solutions for storing the high-level radioactive waste which already exists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are regular protests at the gorleben nuclear storage facility in germany in 2005 , an atomic waste storage facility near the city of hanau was closed .
since then , most toxic waste continues to be sent to a " temporary " storage facility in the eastern german town of gorleben . it will take five to six years after the decision for atomic waste to be transferred to the storage area , according to an article in the daily braunschweiger zeitung on wednesday .
the ruling did not change the debate over using gorleben as a storage place for highly radioactive atomic waste .
the gorleben site has not been proven to be safe in the long term , according to the newspaper . the german atomic council welcomed the ruling and asked the government to comply with its responsibility to prepare the storage place . dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel asks for realistic alternatives to nuclear energy german chancellor angela merkel asked the opponents of nuclear energy in germany to come up with realistic solutions to the country 's energy needs while paying heed to environmental issues .

" this is about the suggestion of the museum that there should be at least one reference to poland 's territorial status before and after the september 17 , 1939 , " he said . credibility question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photo of young survivors taken by red army soldiers " as is well known , a large part of the population of the eastern regions came under soviet rule .
that has to be taken into account if you want to remain credible to visitors to auschwitz , " mensfeld added . the russian part of the museum was closed three years ago for renovation and was originally meant to reopen in 2005 . several other countries have their own exhibition spaces in the former barracks of auschwitz that reflect the fate of their citizens at the hands of the nazis .
the belgian , czech , dutch , french , hungarian and slovak spaces have all been revamped in recent years . the decision to delay the opening of the russian block has sparked a political row that is stirring up deep-seated resentments between moscow and warsaw . technically correct while technically the description of victims from the annexed countries as soviet citizens is correct , the museum says they can not be regarded as such because they did not voluntarily renounce their original nationalities and freely assume soviet citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the anniversary of the liberation by soviet soldiers is commemorated each year russia stands accused of continuing to propagate a version of history that portrays the soviet union as a liberator and papers over its role as an aggressor . international auschwitz-birkenau council president wladyslaw bartoszewski said he ruled out the existence in poland of an exhibition that misrepresented history based on the criteria of the stalinist era . hitler-stalin pact the council president , who was himself a prisoner at the camp , is a famous resistance leader who took part in the 1944 warsaw uprising against the nazis and later went on to serve as a polish foreign minister after the end of communist rule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors are also getting embroiled in the dispute between the two nations " if they want to desecrate their own graves then so be it .
but we poles will not allow us to be misused in the framework of the hitler-stalin doctrine for the annexation of half of poland in 1939 or allow the jews and poles who died there to be declared soviet citizens , " said bartoszewski . " we protested against displays like that in the final inspection .
they wanted to talk to us straightaway about the matter back in 2005 , but they have still failed to do so , " he added . outrageous provocation moscow has responded angrily .
the russian daily kommersant this week quoted russian officials as saying poland was deliberately blocking the opening for political reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz was the largest nazi concentration camp konstantin kossatchov , the chairman of the foreign committee of the russian parliament , has accused poland of rewriting history . " an extraordinarily outrageous provocation is taking place right before our very eyes .
they are trying to describe history from today 's standpoint and in accordance with the interests of poland today , " he said . " i am not interested in commenting upon these interests , but it 's clear that they have nothing to do with the truth , " added kossatchov . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de plans to modernize auschwitz museum approved the museum housed in the original prison barracks at auschwitz , the former nazi extermination camp in southern poland , is to undergo urgent renovation , the museum 's new director , piotr cywinski , announced on wednesday .

" i can confirm that we are talking with some of the potential partners who have shown a clear interest , " daimlerchrysler chief executive dieter zetsche said in a speech prepared for delivery at the car maker 's annual shareholder meeting on wednesday in berlin . the prospect of daimlerchrysler jettisoning its detriot-based unit comes nine years after what is now the world 's fifth bigger carmaker was formed through a $ 36-billion -lrb- about 27 billion euros -rrb- merger of daimler and chrysler . shedding chrysler would also essentially take daimlerchrysler back to where it was in 1998 when its former chief jürgen schrempp launched his vision to transform the stuttgart-based company and maker of mercedes benz luxury cars into a welt ag or world inc .
but what schrempp hailed as " a marriage made in heaven " now looks like ending on the rocks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrylser boss dieter zetsche say he 's keeping all his options open the daimlerchrysler share price has largely fallen , resulting in growing stockholder anger that the group 's global expansion has not produced results . however , since the start of the year , the share price has climbed by more than 30 per cent on speculation that daimlerchrysler was now prepared to sell off its chrysler arm . " splitting off chrysler appears to us as appropriate , ' unio investment funds manager ingo speich told german business daily handelsblatt , reflecting the views of many other fund management groups attending wednesday 's shareholders ' meeting . no details as yet zetsche however said tuesday that he would not go into any detail about a possible sale of chrysler . " it is also true that we need to keep all options open and that i can not disclose any details because we need to have the maximum scope for maneuver , " zetsche said . management needed " the greatest possible flexibility so that we can identify and implement the best possible solution , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler is suffering from poor demand and high fuel prices speculation has been rife that chrysler would be put up for sale after it turned in an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros last year , despite repeated restructuring over recent years .
chrysler is suffering from high fuel prices and a consumer shift away from lucrative gasoline-guzzling trucks and large sports utility vehicles . in mid-february , daimlerchrysler unveiled plans to slash thousands more jobs and close two more plants at its loss-making us subsidiary in what observers believed could be a last-ditch attempt to turn the unit around . not too many takers the main aim was to steer chrysler back to profit , zetsche said . " this means , that after reviewing all options , we will finally decide for the option that best meets our criteria , " the ceo said .
" so far , i am satisfied with the process .
everything is going to plan . " a number of big institutional shareholders , such as union investment and seb , appear to be losing patience and want chrysler to put on the block as quickly as possible .
none of the other world 's leading car makers appear to be interested in chrysler , however .
us daily detroit news reported that only three candidates had submitted a firm offer by last week , private equity firms cerberus and blackstone , and canadian car parts maker magna , which is also likely to team up with an investment fund .
the newspaper said daimlerchrysler was aiming to start exclusive talks with a potential buyer by the end of this month , and hoped to raise around eight billion dollars -lrb- six billion euros -rrb- from the sale . outgoing boss says chrysler could stay on meanwhile , daimlerchrysler 's outgoing supervisory board chief hilmar kopper said in a newspaper interview wednesday that he could imagine chrysler remaining within the group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilmar kopper says daimlerchrysler may not need to shed chrysler right away " there is of course a chance that chrysler is still in the group in two years , " kopper told daily die welt . kopper , who was scheduled to retire as supervisory board chief at the agm on wednesday , defended the decision to merge daimler and chrysler in 1998 . " many of the arguments in favor of a merger back then are still valid today , " he said . and kopper rejected suggestions that the tie-up had destroyed value . " we created value for the shareholders .
we were better than half of the dax companies if you include the dividends , " he said . there was never any cross-subsidizing between chrysler and the group 's up-market mercedes-benz brand , kopper insisted . sales dropped in 2007 the beginning of the year has not been good for the car company . daimlerchrysler announced that first-quarter sales have fallen 2.8 percent from the same time period last year .
the company sold 286,800 mercedes-benz , maybach and smart-branded vehicles worldwide in the first three months of the year . sales dragged in germany and western europe , while in the us sales increased by 9.2 percent compared with a year ago .
sales also rose in asia .

nuclear energy remains controversial and germany lacks a plan for storing its high-level radioactive waste . the federal administrative court in leipzig ruled tuesday that a plan to store atomic waste in an abandoned iron ore mine could go ahead .
work will begin as soon as possible , although it will likely take a number of years before atomic waste is transferred to the site . heinrich sander , lower saxony 's environment minister and a member of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- welcomed tuesday 's ruling , which comes after decades of legal challenges . " there 's finally legal certainty and clarity , " he said . germany 's federal government signalled it plans to go ahead with the storage project . " there 's no other alternative than to implement the decision , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel of the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . phasing out nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to close its nuclear power plants the underground site will hold up to 303,000 cubic meters of atomic waste .
communities and farmers near the site fought for years to stop the project , questioning the long-term safety of the storage facility and fearful of a possible terrorist attack .
the court dismissed those claims . at present , germany plans to phase out its use of nuclear power .
the previous coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder agreed to shut down all power plants by 2020 . but current chancellor angela merkel of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has questioned the phase-out plans .
she recently challenged opponents of nuclear energy in germany to come up with realistic solutions to the country 's energy needs while paying heed to environmental issues . " i 'm saying that those who want both the nuclear phase-out and climate protection are now , naturally , called upon to provide answers , " merkel said in an interview with german radio in january . current storage problems yet regardless of the future of nuclear energy , germany still has to find solutions for storing the high-level radioactive waste which already exists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are regular protests at the gorleben nuclear storage facility in germany in 2005 , an atomic waste storage facility near the city of hanau was closed .
since then , most toxic waste continues to be sent to a " temporary " storage facility in the eastern german town of gorleben . it will take five to six years after the decision for atomic waste to be transferred to the storage area , according to an article in the daily braunschweiger zeitung on wednesday .
the ruling did not change the debate over using gorleben as a storage place for highly radioactive atomic waste .
the gorleben site has not been proven to be safe in the long term , according to the newspaper . the german atomic council welcomed the ruling and asked the government to comply with its responsibility to prepare the storage place . dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel asks for realistic alternatives to nuclear energy german chancellor angela merkel asked the opponents of nuclear energy in germany to come up with realistic solutions to the country 's energy needs while paying heed to environmental issues .

this is not only a paradox , but also a crime in itself . bildunterschrift : gert weisskirchen has been a member of the bundestag since 1976 how seriously should it be taken ? very seriously .

and we would like to see much more readiness to create better conditions - like working on public infrastructure , civil involvement and trying to give the afghani people all the instruments they need in order to create peace in the country . this week kurt beck proposed organizing a peace conference with moderate members of the taliban .

chelsea drew 1-1 against valencia while man u lost in rome .
meanwhile , bayern munich relishes their draw in milan . supporters of english soccer were hoping that liverpool 's demolition of eindhoven on tuesday would set the tone for fellow premiership sides chelsea and manchester united .
but after wednesday evening , the current top two clubs in english soccer find themselves in a pinch .
chelsea managed only a 1-1 draw at home against valencia .
the spaniards played better soccer for most of the first half as valencia parried the uncoordinated attacks of the english champs .
at the half-hour mark , david silva let loose a sharp shot from some 20 meters out that was unstoppable for chelsea keeper petr cech - valenica led 1-0 .
after the interval , chelsea stormed out of the locker room and quickly took control of the game .
in the 53rd minute , the blues ' top scorer , didier drogba , headed home the equalizer .
chelsea , however , retained the pressure for the remainder of the match but valencia showed little weakness in gaining the draw .
with the home result , chelsea leave themselves in a precarious position for next week 's second leg tie in valencia .
man u drop match at roma in rome , premiership leader manchester united fell to roma 2-1 .
manu coach sir alex ferguson should be satisfied with the result considering his team played for almost one hour with 10 men after german referee herbert fendel sent off paul scholes .
roma took advantage of the red card and one minute before halftime , their brazilian midfielder taddei scored from 11 metres out with some help from two manchester defenders who deflected the ball into their own net .
the one-sided nature of this contest was obvious as roma launched 26 total shots .
manchester waited for counter-attacks , and that 's how they scored when wayne rooney equalized at the hour mark .
six minutes later , though , mirko vucinic slotted home the ball after manu keeper edwin van der sar was unable to stop a shot .
manchester got the desired one goal that coach ferguson demanded but will nevertheless have a tough task next week at old trafford .
the match was marred by fighting between supporters from both teams before and during the contest .
italian media reported that five people were injured in the clashes .

the man of the match was most certainly bayern 's two-goal scoring defender daniel van buyten who has been oft maligned of late .
bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld was equally pleased with his side 's performance , specifically with that of the oft maligned defender .

chelsea drew 1-1 against valencia while man u lost in rome .
meanwhile , bayern munich relishes their draw in milan . supporters of english soccer were hoping that liverpool 's demolition of eindhoven on tuesday would set the tone for fellow premiership sides chelsea and manchester united .
but after wednesday evening , the current top two clubs in english soccer find themselves in a pinch .
chelsea managed only a 1-1 draw at home against valencia .
the spaniards played better soccer for most of the first half as valencia parried the uncoordinated attacks of the english champs .
at the half-hour mark , david silva let loose a sharp shot from some 20 meters out that was unstoppable for chelsea keeper petr cech - valenica led 1-0 .
after the interval , chelsea stormed out of the locker room and quickly took control of the game .
in the 53rd minute , the blues ' top scorer , didier drogba , headed home the equalizer .
chelsea , however , retained the pressure for the remainder of the match but valencia showed little weakness in gaining the draw .
with the home result , chelsea leave themselves in a precarious position for next week 's second leg tie in valencia .
man u drop match at roma in rome , premiership leader manchester united fell to roma 2-1 .
manu coach sir alex ferguson should be satisfied with the result considering his team played for almost one hour with 10 men after german referee herbert fendel sent off paul scholes .
roma took advantage of the red card and one minute before halftime , their brazilian midfielder taddei scored from 11 metres out with some help from two manchester defenders who deflected the ball into their own net .
the one-sided nature of this contest was obvious as roma launched 26 total shots .
manchester waited for counter-attacks , and that 's how they scored when wayne rooney equalized at the hour mark .
six minutes later , though , mirko vucinic slotted home the ball after manu keeper edwin van der sar was unable to stop a shot .
manchester got the desired one goal that coach ferguson demanded but will nevertheless have a tough task next week at old trafford .
the match was marred by fighting between supporters from both teams before and during the contest .
italian media reported that five people were injured in the clashes .

the man of the match was most certainly bayern 's two-goal scoring defender daniel van buyten who has been oft maligned of late .
bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld was equally pleased with his side 's performance , specifically with that of the oft maligned defender .

" my father told me in november before he died that he wanted to become a diamond .
his intentions should prevail , " the daughter said . her grandmother , 86 , disagreed , and sought an injunction to stop the cemetery releasing the funerary urn to a swiss diamond laboratory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a grave is more traditional - but you ca n't wear it round your neck the technique for turning the dead 's ashes into " memorial " diamonds originated in the united states but the practice is becoming popular in parts of europe . the ashes are placed in a press under intense pressure and heat , replicating the forces that create a natural diamond , over a period of several months .
synthetic diamonds have been manufactured from carbon since the mid-1950s .
the process costs around $ 17,000 . diamonds not the court 's best friend the court said the daughter 's views on the care of the remains took precedence over the wishes of the dead man 's mother but ruled that any decision had to be in accordance with the expressed wishes of the deceased .

nuclear energy remains controversial and germany lacks a plan for storing its high-level radioactive waste . the federal administrative court in leipzig ruled tuesday that a plan to store atomic waste in an abandoned iron ore mine could go ahead .
work will begin as soon as possible , although it will likely take a number of years before atomic waste is transferred to the site . heinrich sander , lower saxony 's environment minister and a member of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- welcomed tuesday 's ruling , which comes after decades of legal challenges . " there 's finally legal certainty and clarity , " he said . germany 's federal government signalled it plans to go ahead with the storage project .

communities and farmers near the site fought for years to stop the project , questioning the long-term safety of the storage facility and fearful of a possible terrorist attack .
the court dismissed those claims . at present , germany plans to phase out its use of nuclear power .
the previous coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder agreed to shut down all power plants by 2020 . but current chancellor angela merkel of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has questioned the phase-out plans .
she recently challenged opponents of nuclear energy in germany to come up with realistic solutions to the country 's energy needs while paying heed to environmental issues . " i 'm saying that those who want both the nuclear phase-out and climate protection are now , naturally , called upon to provide answers , " merkel said in an interview with german radio in january . current storage problems yet regardless of the future of nuclear energy , germany still has to find solutions for storing the high-level radioactive waste which already exists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are regular protests at the gorleben nuclear storage facility in germany in 2005 , an atomic waste storage facility near the city of hanau was closed .

but will serbia , which considers kosovo as its territory , accept the idea ? the plan - which was drawn up by un special envoy martti ahtisaari of finland - would go a long way toward granting kosovo 's majority ethnic albanian populace independence form serbia while retaining international supervision over the province . at the same time , it would also allow serbian dominated municipalities to govern themselves in many respects and maintain existing ties to belgrade .
the goal is to create a multi-ethnic , democratic state under the rule of law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo was devasted by the 1998-1999 war and sporadic violence continues ahead of the closed-door debates in the security council , ahtisaari 's blueprint was endorsed by kosovo 's current president , fatmir sejdiu , and by the us and the eu , who see it as the only viable way to solve the problem of kosovo 's long-term status . kosovo has been under un control since 1999 when nato military forces intervened to stop a brutal serbian crackdown on the ethnic albanian independence movement in the province . russian scepticism any decision by the security council would be binding .
but russia , which has the power of veto on the council , has criticized the plan , saying any decisions on kosovo 's status must be accepted by all sides of the conflict . belgrade has flatly rejected ahtisaari 's blueprint , insisting that kosovo remain part of serbia and calling for fresh negotiations under a new un-appointed arbitrator . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un special envoy martti ahtisaari expects protracted negotiations britain 's un ambassador emyr jones parry - currently the security council president - said there was considerable support for the plan .
but he added , " i do n't think it 's likely there will be an early presentation of a security council resolution . " meanwhile , france says the un must decide on kosovo 's status soon or run the risk that ethnic strife will flare up again . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu foreign ministers to quiz un envoy on kosovo 's future european foreign ministers will ask un envoy martti ahtisaari on monday how he intends to push forward his proposals for kosovo 's future as they seek their own formula to keep serbia engaged .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 04.04.2007 daimlerchrysler boss confirms talks on chrysler sale großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shine 's off the famous mercedes symbol german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler officially confirmed wednesday that it is in talks to sell its troubled us unit chrysler amid growing pressure for the transatlantic carmaker to set out its plans for the future . " i can confirm that we are talking with some of the potential partners who have shown a clear interest , " daimlerchrysler chief executive dieter zetsche said in a speech prepared for delivery at the car maker 's annual shareholder meeting on wednesday in berlin . the prospect of daimlerchrysler jettisoning its detriot-based unit comes nine years after what is now the world 's fifth bigger carmaker was formed through a $ 36-billion -lrb- about 27 billion euros -rrb- merger of daimler and chrysler . shedding chrysler would also essentially take daimlerchrysler back to where it was in 1998 when its former chief jürgen schrempp launched his vision to transform the stuttgart-based company and maker of mercedes benz luxury cars into a welt ag or world inc .
but what schrempp hailed as " a marriage made in heaven " now looks like ending on the rocks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrylser boss dieter zetsche say he 's keeping all his options open the daimlerchrysler share price has largely fallen , resulting in growing stockholder anger that the group 's global expansion has not produced results . however , since the start of the year , the share price has climbed by more than 30 per cent on speculation that daimlerchrysler was now prepared to sell off its chrysler arm . " splitting off chrysler appears to us as appropriate , ' unio investment funds manager ingo speich told german business daily handelsblatt , reflecting the views of many other fund management groups attending wednesday 's shareholders ' meeting . no details as yet zetsche however said tuesday that he would not go into any detail about a possible sale of chrysler . " it is also true that we need to keep all options open and that i can not disclose any details because we need to have the maximum scope for maneuver , " zetsche said . management needed " the greatest possible flexibility so that we can identify and implement the best possible solution , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler is suffering from poor demand and high fuel prices speculation has been rife that chrysler would be put up for sale after it turned in an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros last year , despite repeated restructuring over recent years .
chrysler is suffering from high fuel prices and a consumer shift away from lucrative gasoline-guzzling trucks and large sports utility vehicles . in mid-february , daimlerchrysler unveiled plans to slash thousands more jobs and close two more plants at its loss-making us subsidiary in what observers believed could be a last-ditch attempt to turn the unit around . not too many takers the main aim was to steer chrysler back to profit , zetsche said . " this means , that after reviewing all options , we will finally decide for the option that best meets our criteria , " the ceo said .
" so far , i am satisfied with the process .
everything is going to plan . " a number of big institutional shareholders , such as union investment and seb , appear to be losing patience and want chrysler to put on the block as quickly as possible .
none of the other world 's leading car makers appear to be interested in chrysler , however .
us daily detroit news reported that only three candidates had submitted a firm offer by last week , private equity firms cerberus and blackstone , and canadian car parts maker magna , which is also likely to team up with an investment fund .
the newspaper said daimlerchrysler was aiming to start exclusive talks with a potential buyer by the end of this month , and hoped to raise around eight billion dollars -lrb- six billion euros -rrb- from the sale . outgoing boss says chrysler could stay on meanwhile , daimlerchrysler 's outgoing supervisory board chief hilmar kopper said in a newspaper interview wednesday that he could imagine chrysler remaining within the group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilmar kopper says daimlerchrysler may not need to shed chrysler right away " there is of course a chance that chrysler is still in the group in two years , " kopper told daily die welt . kopper , who was scheduled to retire as supervisory board chief at the agm on wednesday , defended the decision to merge daimler and chrysler in 1998 . " many of the arguments in favor of a merger back then are still valid today , " he said . and kopper rejected suggestions that the tie-up had destroyed value . " we created value for the shareholders .
we were better than half of the dax companies if you include the dividends , " he said . there was never any cross-subsidizing between chrysler and the group 's up-market mercedes-benz brand , kopper insisted . sales dropped in 2007 the beginning of the year has not been good for the car company . daimlerchrysler announced that first-quarter sales have fallen 2.8 percent from the same time period last year .
the company sold 286,800 mercedes-benz , maybach and smart-branded vehicles worldwide in the first three months of the year . sales dragged in germany and western europe , while in the us sales increased by 9.2 percent compared with a year ago .
sales also rose in asia .
the company 's smart brand sales fell more than 57 percent , a drop the company said was caused by a model changeover . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers rev up effort to enter hybrid market amid increasing consumer awareness of global warming and other environmental issues , german carmakers have had to fight off growing criticism about their apparent lack of will to build environmentally friendly cars .

" many of the arguments in favor of a merger back then are still valid today , " he said . and kopper rejected suggestions that the tie-up had destroyed value . " we created value for the shareholders .
we were better than half of the dax companies if you include the dividends , " he said . there was never any cross-subsidizing between chrysler and the group 's up-market mercedes-benz brand , kopper insisted . sales dropped in 2007 the beginning of the year has not been good for the car company . daimlerchrysler announced that first-quarter sales have fallen 2.8 percent from the same time period last year .
the company sold 286,800 mercedes-benz , maybach and smart-branded vehicles worldwide in the first three months of the year . sales dragged in germany and western europe , while in the us sales increased by 9.2 percent compared with a year ago .

the parliament , which is dominated by yushchenko 's rival , viktor yanukovych , rejected that announcement , saying it amounted to an attempted coup d 'etat . crisis talks tuesday between yushchenko and prime minister viktor yanukovych failed to yield a compromise between the two rivals , even after ukraine 's government and parliament voted to defy the president 's orders . the presidential office said in a statement that yushchenko had informed the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana of his intention to hold snap elections . but yanukovych , who favours ties with russia , said pro-western yushchenko had made " a fatal mistake " in issuing the order dissolving parliament after months of political impasse .

but critics of yushchenko say he himself refuses to accept limitations on the power of the ukrainian presidency put in place in 2005 . the two men have clashed repeatedly since yanukovych became prime minister , and it is unclear whether a new election would do anything to end the impasse . political chaos in ukraine would be a major worry for the eu since it is one of the largest countries in eastern europe and one that is home to pipelines supplying western europe with russian gas . the eu presidency was careful to point out on tuesday that it hoped negotiations for closer ties between the eu and ukraine would not be affected by the current political stalemate . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nationalists , russia find ukraine 's eurovision song quite a drag ukraine 's eurovision song contest entry is causing friction at home and abroad .

but the bloc also said it considers the standoff a domestic issue that does n't warrant outside involvement . the eu 's statement came a day after ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said he was dissolving parliament and calling fresh elections in may .
the parliament , which is dominated by yushchenko 's rival , viktor yanukovych , rejected that announcement , saying it amounted to an attempted coup d 'etat . crisis talks tuesday between yushchenko and prime minister viktor yanukovych failed to yield a compromise between the two rivals , even after ukraine 's government and parliament voted to defy the president 's orders . the presidential office said in a statement that yushchenko had informed the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana of his intention to hold snap elections . but yanukovych , who favours ties with russia , said pro-western yushchenko had made " a fatal mistake " in issuing the order dissolving parliament after months of political impasse .
hundreds of anti-yushchenko activists meanwhile camped out overnight in central kiev to protest against the president and vowed to hold a mass protest on wednesday .
" no to the division of ukraine ! " and " the constitution is the law for everyone ! " read placards posted up by the activists outside more than 200 tents set up near the parliament building and on independence square . eu has no plans to intervene the german eu presidency expressed concern about the situation in ukraine .
in a written statement , the german foreign ministry called upon the two sides in the conflict " to settle their current differences on domestic policy in a manner which complies with the constitution and domestic rules . " but the eu does not plan to intervene .
" we do not consider the situation at the moment to need influence from outside , " european commission spokeswoman christiane hohmann said .
" we think it 's a domestic affair that needs to be sorted out in ukraine itself . " adherents of both the pro-western yushchenko and the more russia-oriented yanukovych continue to stage protests in the ukrainian capital kiev . unwieldy partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych , left , and yushchenko have not been able to work together yushchenko was swept to power in january 2005 after a bitterly contested election against yanukovych and waves of popular street demonstrations that became known as the orange revolution .
but he was forced to accept his rival as prime minister after he and his allies failed to secure a parliamentary majority in a national election in 2006 . yushchenko accuses yanukovych of trying to encourage individual parliamentary deputies to switch allegiances , something he says is forbidden under ukraine 's constitution .
but critics of yushchenko say he himself refuses to accept limitations on the power of the ukrainian presidency put in place in 2005 . the two men have clashed repeatedly since yanukovych became prime minister , and it is unclear whether a new election would do anything to end the impasse . political chaos in ukraine would be a major worry for the eu since it is one of the largest countries in eastern europe and one that is home to pipelines supplying western europe with russian gas . the eu presidency was careful to point out on tuesday that it hoped negotiations for closer ties between the eu and ukraine would not be affected by the current political stalemate . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nationalists , russia find ukraine 's eurovision song quite a drag ukraine 's eurovision song contest entry is causing friction at home and abroad .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrylser boss dieter zetsche say he 's keeping all his options open the daimlerchrysler share price has largely fallen , resulting in growing stockholder anger that the group 's global expansion has not produced results . however , since the start of the year , the share price has climbed by more than 30 per cent on speculation that daimlerchrysler was now prepared to sell off its chrysler arm . " splitting off chrysler appears to us as appropriate , ' unio investment funds manager ingo speich told german business daily handelsblatt , reflecting the views of many other fund management groups attending wednesday 's shareholders ' meeting . no details as yet zetsche however said tuesday that he would not go into any detail about a possible sale of chrysler . " it is also true that we need to keep all options open and that i can not disclose any details because we need to have the maximum scope for maneuver , " zetsche said . management needed " the greatest possible flexibility so that we can identify and implement the best possible solution , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler is suffering from poor demand and high fuel prices speculation has been rife that chrysler would be put up for sale after it turned in an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros last year , despite repeated restructuring over recent years .
chrysler is suffering from high fuel prices and a consumer shift away from lucrative gasoline-guzzling trucks and large sports utility vehicles . in mid-february , daimlerchrysler unveiled plans to slash thousands more jobs and close two more plants at its loss-making us subsidiary in what observers believed could be a last-ditch attempt to turn the unit around . not too many takers the main aim was to steer chrysler back to profit , zetsche said . " this means , that after reviewing all options , we will finally decide for the option that best meets our criteria , " the ceo said .
" so far , i am satisfied with the process .
everything is going to plan . " a number of big institutional shareholders , such as union investment and seb , appear to be losing patience and want chrysler to put on the block as quickly as possible .
none of the other world 's leading car makers appear to be interested in chrysler , however .
us daily detroit news reported that only three candidates had submitted a firm offer by last week , private equity firms cerberus and blackstone , and canadian car parts maker magna , which is also likely to team up with an investment fund .
the newspaper said daimlerchrysler was aiming to start exclusive talks with a potential buyer by the end of this month , and hoped to raise around eight billion dollars -lrb- six billion euros -rrb- from the sale . outgoing boss says chrysler could stay on meanwhile , daimlerchrysler 's outgoing supervisory board chief hilmar kopper said in a newspaper interview wednesday that he could imagine chrysler remaining within the group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilmar kopper says daimlerchrysler may not need to shed chrysler right away " there is of course a chance that chrysler is still in the group in two years , " kopper told daily die welt . kopper , who was scheduled to retire as supervisory board chief at the agm on wednesday , defended the decision to merge daimler and chrysler in 1998 . " many of the arguments in favor of a merger back then are still valid today , " he said . and kopper rejected suggestions that the tie-up had destroyed value . " we created value for the shareholders .
we were better than half of the dax companies if you include the dividends , " he said . there was never any cross-subsidizing between chrysler and the group 's up-market mercedes-benz brand , kopper insisted . sales dropped in 2007 the beginning of the year has not been good for the car company . daimlerchrysler announced that first-quarter sales have fallen 2.8 percent from the same time period last year .
the company sold 286,800 mercedes-benz , maybach and smart-branded vehicles worldwide in the first three months of the year . sales dragged in germany and western europe , while in the us sales increased by 9.2 percent compared with a year ago .
sales also rose in asia .
the company 's smart brand sales fell more than 57 percent , a drop the company said was caused by a model changeover . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers rev up effort to enter hybrid market amid increasing consumer awareness of global warming and other environmental issues , german carmakers have had to fight off growing criticism about their apparent lack of will to build environmentally friendly cars .

london welcomed the news , but tensions between the countries remain strong . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad was shown on state television chatting with british sailors wednesday .
the president said they would be released immediately .
iranian state media said the 15 had " shouted for joy " when told the news . the sailors will return home from tehran 's mehrabad airport on thursday , an aide to the president said . " they will leave tomorrow from mehrabad airport , " the aide , who declined to be named , told iranian reporters . iran seized the britons on march 23 after saying the ship they were on had trespassed into territorial waters .
britain insists the soldiers were on a routine anti-smuggling patrol in iraqi territory under a united nations mandate . ahmadinejad said britain had promised in a letter not to repeat the incident . " the blair government chose the path of media hype and sent the issue to the un security council , " ahmadinejad said .
" the british people can ask its government what the british soldiers are doing in iraq or in iranian waters . " britain should have been " brave enough " to admit they had made a mistake , ahmadinejad said . a " gift " to britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said wednesday he would release the british troops " although iran has the right to prosecute them by following the model of the prophet the 15 people were pardoned and their freedom given as a gift to the british people , " ahmadinejad said at the press conference . the britons were held in an undisclosed location since the standoff began two weeks ago .
they appeared occasionally on iranian television to offer " confessions " for trespassing and to apologize .
it is unknown whether the statements were coerced . the united kingdom froze most ties with iran after the soldiers were seized .
the european union also sent a strongly worded comdemnation to iran . a spokesman for british prime minister tony blair welcomed the unexpected news . nick summers , the brother of one captive nathan summers , said it was " brilliant news . " " it 's been a long , long 13 days , " he told britain 's sky news . white house said iran needs to change first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says british soldiers trespassed into territorial waters the latest developments coincided with the release in baghdad of an iranian diplomat kidnapped in iraq in early february .
iran had blamed the us military for the abduction . additionally , five iranian officials captured by us forces in northern iraq in january were expected to receive their first visit by an iranian diplomat . ahmadinejad also said on wednesday iran could reconsider its relations with the united states if president george w. bush and his administration changed its behavior . " if mr. bush and his government change their behaviour ... this side -lrb- iran -rrb- has the ability to reconsider " ahmadinejad said . the united states said on wednesday if iran wanted to change its relationship with washington it would first have to suspend uranium enrichment . " the behavior that needs to change is the iranians , not the united states , " state department spokesman tom casey said . ahmadinejad said there was no link between the release of the britons and five iranians held by us forces in iraq .
the us also denied the release was in any way linked . " there is no link whatsoever .
neither we nor the british nor anyone else , as far as i know , has made that link , " casey said .
" it would be pure speculation on my part to try and ascribe motive to any of this stuff .

chelsea drew 1-1 against valencia while man u lost in rome .
meanwhile , bayern munich relishes their draw in milan . supporters of english soccer were hoping that liverpool 's demolition of eindhoven on tuesday would set the tone for fellow premiership sides chelsea and manchester united .
but after wednesday evening , the current top two clubs in english soccer find themselves in a pinch .
chelsea managed only a 1-1 draw at home against valencia .
the spaniards played better soccer for most of the first half as valencia parried the uncoordinated attacks of the english champs .
at the half-hour mark , david silva let loose a sharp shot from some 20 meters out that was unstoppable for chelsea keeper petr cech - valenica led 1-0 .
after the interval , chelsea stormed out of the locker room and quickly took control of the game .
in the 53rd minute , the blues ' top scorer , didier drogba , headed home the equalizer .
chelsea , however , retained the pressure for the remainder of the match but valencia showed little weakness in gaining the draw .
with the home result , chelsea leave themselves in a precarious position for next week 's second leg tie in valencia .
man u drop match at roma in rome , premiership leader manchester united fell to roma 2-1 .
manu coach sir alex ferguson should be satisfied with the result considering his team played for almost one hour with 10 men after german referee herbert fendel sent off paul scholes .
roma took advantage of the red card and one minute before halftime , their brazilian midfielder taddei scored from 11 metres out with some help from two manchester defenders who deflected the ball into their own net .
the one-sided nature of this contest was obvious as roma launched 26 total shots .
manchester waited for counter-attacks , and that 's how they scored when wayne rooney equalized at the hour mark .
six minutes later , though , mirko vucinic slotted home the ball after manu keeper edwin van der sar was unable to stop a shot .
manchester got the desired one goal that coach ferguson demanded but will nevertheless have a tough task next week at old trafford .

this is not only a paradox , but also a crime in itself . bildunterschrift : gert weisskirchen has been a member of the bundestag since 1976 how seriously should it be taken ? very seriously .

we have to think about in what way we can pick up this idea in order to involve people living on the ground and being that kind of authority in order to create local peace from below .

but the bloc also said it considers the standoff a domestic issue that does n't warrant outside involvement . the eu 's statement came a day after ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said he was dissolving parliament and calling fresh elections in may .
the parliament , which is dominated by yushchenko 's rival , viktor yanukovych , rejected that announcement , saying it amounted to an attempted coup d 'etat . crisis talks tuesday between yushchenko and prime minister viktor yanukovych failed to yield a compromise between the two rivals , even after ukraine 's government and parliament voted to defy the president 's orders . the presidential office said in a statement that yushchenko had informed the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana of his intention to hold snap elections . but yanukovych , who favours ties with russia , said pro-western yushchenko had made " a fatal mistake " in issuing the order dissolving parliament after months of political impasse .
hundreds of anti-yushchenko activists meanwhile camped out overnight in central kiev to protest against the president and vowed to hold a mass protest on wednesday .
" no to the division of ukraine ! " and " the constitution is the law for everyone ! " read placards posted up by the activists outside more than 200 tents set up near the parliament building and on independence square . eu has no plans to intervene the german eu presidency expressed concern about the situation in ukraine .
in a written statement , the german foreign ministry called upon the two sides in the conflict " to settle their current differences on domestic policy in a manner which complies with the constitution and domestic rules . " but the eu does not plan to intervene .
" we do not consider the situation at the moment to need influence from outside , " european commission spokeswoman christiane hohmann said .
" we think it 's a domestic affair that needs to be sorted out in ukraine itself . " adherents of both the pro-western yushchenko and the more russia-oriented yanukovych continue to stage protests in the ukrainian capital kiev . unwieldy partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych , left , and yushchenko have not been able to work together yushchenko was swept to power in january 2005 after a bitterly contested election against yanukovych and waves of popular street demonstrations that became known as the orange revolution .
but he was forced to accept his rival as prime minister after he and his allies failed to secure a parliamentary majority in a national election in 2006 . yushchenko accuses yanukovych of trying to encourage individual parliamentary deputies to switch allegiances , something he says is forbidden under ukraine 's constitution .
but critics of yushchenko say he himself refuses to accept limitations on the power of the ukrainian presidency put in place in 2005 . the two men have clashed repeatedly since yanukovych became prime minister , and it is unclear whether a new election would do anything to end the impasse . political chaos in ukraine would be a major worry for the eu since it is one of the largest countries in eastern europe and one that is home to pipelines supplying western europe with russian gas . the eu presidency was careful to point out on tuesday that it hoped negotiations for closer ties between the eu and ukraine would not be affected by the current political stalemate . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nationalists , russia find ukraine 's eurovision song quite a drag ukraine 's eurovision song contest entry is causing friction at home and abroad .

but he was forced to accept his rival as prime minister after he and his allies failed to secure a parliamentary majority in a national election in 2006 . yushchenko accuses yanukovych of trying to encourage individual parliamentary deputies to switch allegiances , something he says is forbidden under ukraine 's constitution .
but critics of yushchenko say he himself refuses to accept limitations on the power of the ukrainian presidency put in place in 2005 . the two men have clashed repeatedly since yanukovych became prime minister , and it is unclear whether a new election would do anything to end the impasse . political chaos in ukraine would be a major worry for the eu since it is one of the largest countries in eastern europe and one that is home to pipelines supplying western europe with russian gas . the eu presidency was careful to point out on tuesday that it hoped negotiations for closer ties between the eu and ukraine would not be affected by the current political stalemate . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nationalists , russia find ukraine 's eurovision song quite a drag ukraine 's eurovision song contest entry is causing friction at home and abroad .

" my father told me in november before he died that he wanted to become a diamond .
his intentions should prevail , " the daughter said . her grandmother , 86 , disagreed , and sought an injunction to stop the cemetery releasing the funerary urn to a swiss diamond laboratory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a grave is more traditional - but you ca n't wear it round your neck the technique for turning the dead 's ashes into " memorial " diamonds originated in the united states but the practice is becoming popular in parts of europe . the ashes are placed in a press under intense pressure and heat , replicating the forces that create a natural diamond , over a period of several months .
synthetic diamonds have been manufactured from carbon since the mid-1950s .
the process costs around $ 17,000 . diamonds not the court 's best friend the court said the daughter 's views on the care of the remains took precedence over the wishes of the dead man 's mother but ruled that any decision had to be in accordance with the expressed wishes of the deceased .
testimony from the man 's brother-in-law who visited a family grave with him shortly before his death from cancer last year indicated he did not wish to be turned into a diamond . the deceased allegedly remarked that he too would soon be buried there , casting doubt on his daughter 's claim . judges said that in the absence of written instructions , they preferred to believe the man 's preferences were conventional . wishes went with him to the grave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this stone was made from the ashes of a pet dog " with such an exotic form of interment , and one that is illegal in germany , there is an onus to prove that the deceased really wanted this , " the court said in its judgement . the ashes remain in the custody of the court until the conclusion of all legal action .

" if mr. bush and his government change their behaviour ... this side -lrb- iran -rrb- has the ability to reconsider " ahmadinejad said . the united states said on wednesday if iran wanted to change its relationship with washington it would first have to suspend uranium enrichment .

neither we nor the british nor anyone else , as far as i know , has made that link , " casey said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.04.2007 " these people are ready to kill " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hostage-takers in iraq have demanded that germany withdraw its troops from afghanistan gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesperson for the social democratic party , told dw-world.de that germany is not ready to give in to the terrorists ’ 10-day ultimatum to withdraw troops from afghanistan . dw-world.de : professor weisskirchen , what do you think of the latest hostage video and 10-day ultimatum ? gert weisskirchen : this is a terrible sign that these criminals are ready to kill innocent people and they are claiming that they are criminals .
this is not only a paradox , but also a crime in itself . bildunterschrift : gert weisskirchen has been a member of the bundestag since 1976 how seriously should it be taken ? very seriously .
it ’ s really dangerous .
it shows that these people are ready to kill . how do you think the german government will respond to the ultimatum ? first of all , it ’ s clear that the government is trying to save the lives of these innocent people , but we are not ready to fulfil their claims . the tornado reconnaissance jets will arrive in northern afghanistan tomorrow .
the german government has maintained that its involvement in afghanistan is strictly a peacekeeping mission .
in light of the tornado mission and now the hostage-taking , do you think that germany will be able to stay out of danger or is it being drawn into more than it bargained for ? the point is that we are ready to give what we can , for instance to save the people of afghanistan , and we are ready to fulfill what they need , but we are working within a very restrictive mandate .
that means that the parliament is eagerly monitoring what is happening on the ground and we are not ready to enlarge the mandate militarily . how do you see the future of germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan ?
will it become more dangerous for german troops ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tornado reconnaissance jets arrive thursday in northern afghanistan no doubt the level of danger is increasing and that means we should be able to respond to this .
but it ’ s clear on the other hand that we are not ready to enlarge the mandate , which means that we are only fulfilling a restricted role .
and we would like to see much more readiness to create better conditions - like working on public infrastructure , civil involvement and trying to give the afghani people all the instruments they need in order to create peace in the country . this week kurt beck proposed organizing a peace conference with moderate members of the taliban .
what do you think of this idea ? as we have seen in musa kala , there is a kind of paradoxical consequence to this idea .
we have to think about in what way we can pick up this idea in order to involve people living on the ground and being that kind of authority in order to create local peace from below .
that means that it would be good to try and find out in what way we can get those people on board who are ready to create a kind of peace jerga , as they call it .
this is a good way forward . kate bowen interviewed gert weisskirchen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government says hostage video shocking and inhumane german government officials condemned a video in which two germans taken hostage in iraq plead for their lives .
terrorism experts said the video shows that the kidnappers want to grab attention and money .
-lrb- 04.04.2007 -rrb- senior social democrats suggest talking to the taliban the leader of germany 's social democrats has proposed staging a new peace conference on afghanistan that would include representatives of the taliban .
it 's a controversial idea that has met a mixed reception so far .
-lrb- 03.04.2007 -rrb- german jets head for afghanistan amid mounting concerns german tornado jets and their crews deploy to afghanistan monday .
despite their well-publicized surveillance role , the new troops may soon find the taliban does not see a difference between combat and support .

nuclear energy remains controversial and germany lacks a plan for storing its high-level radioactive waste . the federal administrative court in leipzig ruled tuesday that a plan to store atomic waste in an abandoned iron ore mine could go ahead .
work will begin as soon as possible , although it will likely take a number of years before atomic waste is transferred to the site . heinrich sander , lower saxony 's environment minister and a member of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- welcomed tuesday 's ruling , which comes after decades of legal challenges . " there 's finally legal certainty and clarity , " he said . germany 's federal government signalled it plans to go ahead with the storage project . " there 's no other alternative than to implement the decision , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel of the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . phasing out nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to close its nuclear power plants the underground site will hold up to 303,000 cubic meters of atomic waste .
communities and farmers near the site fought for years to stop the project , questioning the long-term safety of the storage facility and fearful of a possible terrorist attack .
the court dismissed those claims . at present , germany plans to phase out its use of nuclear power .
the previous coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder agreed to shut down all power plants by 2020 . but current chancellor angela merkel of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has questioned the phase-out plans .
she recently challenged opponents of nuclear energy in germany to come up with realistic solutions to the country 's energy needs while paying heed to environmental issues . " i 'm saying that those who want both the nuclear phase-out and climate protection are now , naturally , called upon to provide answers , " merkel said in an interview with german radio in january . current storage problems yet regardless of the future of nuclear energy , germany still has to find solutions for storing the high-level radioactive waste which already exists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are regular protests at the gorleben nuclear storage facility in germany in 2005 , an atomic waste storage facility near the city of hanau was closed .
since then , most toxic waste continues to be sent to a " temporary " storage facility in the eastern german town of gorleben . it will take five to six years after the decision for atomic waste to be transferred to the storage area , according to an article in the daily braunschweiger zeitung on wednesday .
the ruling did not change the debate over using gorleben as a storage place for highly radioactive atomic waste .

" i do n't really think that right now in baghdad people are actually interested about what is happening in afghanistan and that german troops are there , " steinberg said in a wednesday morning interview with the german public broadcaster ard . steinberg , a specialist on islamist terrorism , said he was not suggesting that negotiators dismiss the link to afghanistan .
kidnappers often make political demands as ways to get money . " from my point of view , this is an attempt to use public opinion here in germany to get attention and force the german government to follow the wishes of the german public , " steinberg said in the ard interview . if the kidnappers are actually trying to get money , the scare tactics will likely continue , tophoven predicted .

" i can confirm that we are talking with some of the potential partners who have shown a clear interest , " daimlerchrysler chief executive dieter zetsche said in a speech prepared for delivery at the car maker 's annual shareholder meeting on wednesday in berlin . the prospect of daimlerchrysler jettisoning its detriot-based unit comes nine years after what is now the world 's fifth bigger carmaker was formed through a $ 36-billion -lrb- about 27 billion euros -rrb- merger of daimler and chrysler . shedding chrysler would also essentially take daimlerchrysler back to where it was in 1998 when its former chief jürgen schrempp launched his vision to transform the stuttgart-based company and maker of mercedes benz luxury cars into a welt ag or world inc .
but what schrempp hailed as " a marriage made in heaven " now looks like ending on the rocks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrylser boss dieter zetsche say he 's keeping all his options open the daimlerchrysler share price has largely fallen , resulting in growing stockholder anger that the group 's global expansion has not produced results . however , since the start of the year , the share price has climbed by more than 30 per cent on speculation that daimlerchrysler was now prepared to sell off its chrysler arm . " splitting off chrysler appears to us as appropriate , ' unio investment funds manager ingo speich told german business daily handelsblatt , reflecting the views of many other fund management groups attending wednesday 's shareholders ' meeting . no details as yet zetsche however said tuesday that he would not go into any detail about a possible sale of chrysler . " it is also true that we need to keep all options open and that i can not disclose any details because we need to have the maximum scope for maneuver , " zetsche said . management needed " the greatest possible flexibility so that we can identify and implement the best possible solution , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler is suffering from poor demand and high fuel prices speculation has been rife that chrysler would be put up for sale after it turned in an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros last year , despite repeated restructuring over recent years .
chrysler is suffering from high fuel prices and a consumer shift away from lucrative gasoline-guzzling trucks and large sports utility vehicles . in mid-february , daimlerchrysler unveiled plans to slash thousands more jobs and close two more plants at its loss-making us subsidiary in what observers believed could be a last-ditch attempt to turn the unit around . not too many takers the main aim was to steer chrysler back to profit , zetsche said . " this means , that after reviewing all options , we will finally decide for the option that best meets our criteria , " the ceo said .
" so far , i am satisfied with the process .
everything is going to plan . " a number of big institutional shareholders , such as union investment and seb , appear to be losing patience and want chrysler to put on the block as quickly as possible .

" this is about the suggestion of the museum that there should be at least one reference to poland 's territorial status before and after the september 17 , 1939 , " he said . credibility question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photo of young survivors taken by red army soldiers " as is well known , a large part of the population of the eastern regions came under soviet rule .
that has to be taken into account if you want to remain credible to visitors to auschwitz , " mensfeld added . the russian part of the museum was closed three years ago for renovation and was originally meant to reopen in 2005 . several other countries have their own exhibition spaces in the former barracks of auschwitz that reflect the fate of their citizens at the hands of the nazis .
the belgian , czech , dutch , french , hungarian and slovak spaces have all been revamped in recent years . the decision to delay the opening of the russian block has sparked a political row that is stirring up deep-seated resentments between moscow and warsaw . technically correct while technically the description of victims from the annexed countries as soviet citizens is correct , the museum says they can not be regarded as such because they did not voluntarily renounce their original nationalities and freely assume soviet citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the anniversary of the liberation by soviet soldiers is commemorated each year russia stands accused of continuing to propagate a version of history that portrays the soviet union as a liberator and papers over its role as an aggressor . international auschwitz-birkenau council president wladyslaw bartoszewski said he ruled out the existence in poland of an exhibition that misrepresented history based on the criteria of the stalinist era . hitler-stalin pact the council president , who was himself a prisoner at the camp , is a famous resistance leader who took part in the 1944 warsaw uprising against the nazis and later went on to serve as a polish foreign minister after the end of communist rule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors are also getting embroiled in the dispute between the two nations " if they want to desecrate their own graves then so be it .
but we poles will not allow us to be misused in the framework of the hitler-stalin doctrine for the annexation of half of poland in 1939 or allow the jews and poles who died there to be declared soviet citizens , " said bartoszewski . " we protested against displays like that in the final inspection .
they wanted to talk to us straightaway about the matter back in 2005 , but they have still failed to do so , " he added . outrageous provocation moscow has responded angrily .
the russian daily kommersant this week quoted russian officials as saying poland was deliberately blocking the opening for political reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz was the largest nazi concentration camp konstantin kossatchov , the chairman of the foreign committee of the russian parliament , has accused poland of rewriting history . " an extraordinarily outrageous provocation is taking place right before our very eyes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.04.2007 eu urges moderation in ukraine political standoff großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych supporters have been voicing their discontent in kiev the european union has urged the leaders of rival parties in ukraine to settle their political disputes .
but the bloc also said it considers the standoff a domestic issue that does n't warrant outside involvement . the eu 's statement came a day after ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said he was dissolving parliament and calling fresh elections in may .
the parliament , which is dominated by yushchenko 's rival , viktor yanukovych , rejected that announcement , saying it amounted to an attempted coup d 'etat . crisis talks tuesday between yushchenko and prime minister viktor yanukovych failed to yield a compromise between the two rivals , even after ukraine 's government and parliament voted to defy the president 's orders . the presidential office said in a statement that yushchenko had informed the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana of his intention to hold snap elections . but yanukovych , who favours ties with russia , said pro-western yushchenko had made " a fatal mistake " in issuing the order dissolving parliament after months of political impasse .
hundreds of anti-yushchenko activists meanwhile camped out overnight in central kiev to protest against the president and vowed to hold a mass protest on wednesday .
" no to the division of ukraine ! " and " the constitution is the law for everyone ! " read placards posted up by the activists outside more than 200 tents set up near the parliament building and on independence square . eu has no plans to intervene the german eu presidency expressed concern about the situation in ukraine .
in a written statement , the german foreign ministry called upon the two sides in the conflict " to settle their current differences on domestic policy in a manner which complies with the constitution and domestic rules . " but the eu does not plan to intervene .
" we do not consider the situation at the moment to need influence from outside , " european commission spokeswoman christiane hohmann said .

but the bloc also said it considers the standoff a domestic issue that does n't warrant outside involvement . the eu 's statement came a day after ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said he was dissolving parliament and calling fresh elections in may .
the parliament , which is dominated by yushchenko 's rival , viktor yanukovych , rejected that announcement , saying it amounted to an attempted coup d 'etat . crisis talks tuesday between yushchenko and prime minister viktor yanukovych failed to yield a compromise between the two rivals , even after ukraine 's government and parliament voted to defy the president 's orders . the presidential office said in a statement that yushchenko had informed the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana of his intention to hold snap elections . but yanukovych , who favours ties with russia , said pro-western yushchenko had made " a fatal mistake " in issuing the order dissolving parliament after months of political impasse .
hundreds of anti-yushchenko activists meanwhile camped out overnight in central kiev to protest against the president and vowed to hold a mass protest on wednesday .

but will serbia , which considers kosovo as its territory , accept the idea ? the plan - which was drawn up by un special envoy martti ahtisaari of finland - would go a long way toward granting kosovo 's majority ethnic albanian populace independence form serbia while retaining international supervision over the province . at the same time , it would also allow serbian dominated municipalities to govern themselves in many respects and maintain existing ties to belgrade .
the goal is to create a multi-ethnic , democratic state under the rule of law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo was devasted by the 1998-1999 war and sporadic violence continues ahead of the closed-door debates in the security council , ahtisaari 's blueprint was endorsed by kosovo 's current president , fatmir sejdiu , and by the us and the eu , who see it as the only viable way to solve the problem of kosovo 's long-term status . kosovo has been under un control since 1999 when nato military forces intervened to stop a brutal serbian crackdown on the ethnic albanian independence movement in the province . russian scepticism any decision by the security council would be binding .
but russia , which has the power of veto on the council , has criticized the plan , saying any decisions on kosovo 's status must be accepted by all sides of the conflict . belgrade has flatly rejected ahtisaari 's blueprint , insisting that kosovo remain part of serbia and calling for fresh negotiations under a new un-appointed arbitrator . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un special envoy martti ahtisaari expects protracted negotiations britain 's un ambassador emyr jones parry - currently the security council president - said there was considerable support for the plan .
but he added , " i do n't think it 's likely there will be an early presentation of a security council resolution .

the spaniards played better soccer for most of the first half as valencia parried the uncoordinated attacks of the english champs .
at the half-hour mark , david silva let loose a sharp shot from some 20 meters out that was unstoppable for chelsea keeper petr cech - valenica led 1-0 .
after the interval , chelsea stormed out of the locker room and quickly took control of the game .
in the 53rd minute , the blues ' top scorer , didier drogba , headed home the equalizer .
chelsea , however , retained the pressure for the remainder of the match but valencia showed little weakness in gaining the draw .

roma took advantage of the red card and one minute before halftime , their brazilian midfielder taddei scored from 11 metres out with some help from two manchester defenders who deflected the ball into their own net .
the one-sided nature of this contest was obvious as roma launched 26 total shots .
manchester waited for counter-attacks , and that 's how they scored when wayne rooney equalized at the hour mark .
six minutes later , though , mirko vucinic slotted home the ball after manu keeper edwin van der sar was unable to stop a shot .

" this is about the suggestion of the museum that there should be at least one reference to poland 's territorial status before and after the september 17 , 1939 , " he said . credibility question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photo of young survivors taken by red army soldiers " as is well known , a large part of the population of the eastern regions came under soviet rule .
that has to be taken into account if you want to remain credible to visitors to auschwitz , " mensfeld added . the russian part of the museum was closed three years ago for renovation and was originally meant to reopen in 2005 . several other countries have their own exhibition spaces in the former barracks of auschwitz that reflect the fate of their citizens at the hands of the nazis .
the belgian , czech , dutch , french , hungarian and slovak spaces have all been revamped in recent years . the decision to delay the opening of the russian block has sparked a political row that is stirring up deep-seated resentments between moscow and warsaw . technically correct while technically the description of victims from the annexed countries as soviet citizens is correct , the museum says they can not be regarded as such because they did not voluntarily renounce their original nationalities and freely assume soviet citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the anniversary of the liberation by soviet soldiers is commemorated each year russia stands accused of continuing to propagate a version of history that portrays the soviet union as a liberator and papers over its role as an aggressor . international auschwitz-birkenau council president wladyslaw bartoszewski said he ruled out the existence in poland of an exhibition that misrepresented history based on the criteria of the stalinist era . hitler-stalin pact the council president , who was himself a prisoner at the camp , is a famous resistance leader who took part in the 1944 warsaw uprising against the nazis and later went on to serve as a polish foreign minister after the end of communist rule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors are also getting embroiled in the dispute between the two nations " if they want to desecrate their own graves then so be it .
but we poles will not allow us to be misused in the framework of the hitler-stalin doctrine for the annexation of half of poland in 1939 or allow the jews and poles who died there to be declared soviet citizens , " said bartoszewski . " we protested against displays like that in the final inspection .
they wanted to talk to us straightaway about the matter back in 2005 , but they have still failed to do so , " he added . outrageous provocation moscow has responded angrily .
the russian daily kommersant this week quoted russian officials as saying poland was deliberately blocking the opening for political reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz was the largest nazi concentration camp konstantin kossatchov , the chairman of the foreign committee of the russian parliament , has accused poland of rewriting history . " an extraordinarily outrageous provocation is taking place right before our very eyes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.04.2007 eu urges moderation in ukraine political standoff großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych supporters have been voicing their discontent in kiev the european union has urged the leaders of rival parties in ukraine to settle their political disputes .
but the bloc also said it considers the standoff a domestic issue that does n't warrant outside involvement . the eu 's statement came a day after ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said he was dissolving parliament and calling fresh elections in may .
the parliament , which is dominated by yushchenko 's rival , viktor yanukovych , rejected that announcement , saying it amounted to an attempted coup d 'etat . crisis talks tuesday between yushchenko and prime minister viktor yanukovych failed to yield a compromise between the two rivals , even after ukraine 's government and parliament voted to defy the president 's orders . the presidential office said in a statement that yushchenko had informed the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana of his intention to hold snap elections . but yanukovych , who favours ties with russia , said pro-western yushchenko had made " a fatal mistake " in issuing the order dissolving parliament after months of political impasse .
hundreds of anti-yushchenko activists meanwhile camped out overnight in central kiev to protest against the president and vowed to hold a mass protest on wednesday .
" no to the division of ukraine ! " and " the constitution is the law for everyone ! " read placards posted up by the activists outside more than 200 tents set up near the parliament building and on independence square . eu has no plans to intervene the german eu presidency expressed concern about the situation in ukraine .
in a written statement , the german foreign ministry called upon the two sides in the conflict " to settle their current differences on domestic policy in a manner which complies with the constitution and domestic rules . " but the eu does not plan to intervene .
" we do not consider the situation at the moment to need influence from outside , " european commission spokeswoman christiane hohmann said .
" we think it 's a domestic affair that needs to be sorted out in ukraine itself . " adherents of both the pro-western yushchenko and the more russia-oriented yanukovych continue to stage protests in the ukrainian capital kiev . unwieldy partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych , left , and yushchenko have not been able to work together yushchenko was swept to power in january 2005 after a bitterly contested election against yanukovych and waves of popular street demonstrations that became known as the orange revolution .
but he was forced to accept his rival as prime minister after he and his allies failed to secure a parliamentary majority in a national election in 2006 . yushchenko accuses yanukovych of trying to encourage individual parliamentary deputies to switch allegiances , something he says is forbidden under ukraine 's constitution .
but critics of yushchenko say he himself refuses to accept limitations on the power of the ukrainian presidency put in place in 2005 . the two men have clashed repeatedly since yanukovych became prime minister , and it is unclear whether a new election would do anything to end the impasse . political chaos in ukraine would be a major worry for the eu since it is one of the largest countries in eastern europe and one that is home to pipelines supplying western europe with russian gas . the eu presidency was careful to point out on tuesday that it hoped negotiations for closer ties between the eu and ukraine would not be affected by the current political stalemate . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nationalists , russia find ukraine 's eurovision song quite a drag ukraine 's eurovision song contest entry is causing friction at home and abroad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.04.2007 daimlerchrysler boss confirms talks on chrysler sale großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shine 's off the famous mercedes symbol german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler officially confirmed wednesday that it is in talks to sell its troubled us unit chrysler amid growing pressure for the transatlantic carmaker to set out its plans for the future . " i can confirm that we are talking with some of the potential partners who have shown a clear interest , " daimlerchrysler chief executive dieter zetsche said in a speech prepared for delivery at the car maker 's annual shareholder meeting on wednesday in berlin . the prospect of daimlerchrysler jettisoning its detriot-based unit comes nine years after what is now the world 's fifth bigger carmaker was formed through a $ 36-billion -lrb- about 27 billion euros -rrb- merger of daimler and chrysler . shedding chrysler would also essentially take daimlerchrysler back to where it was in 1998 when its former chief jürgen schrempp launched his vision to transform the stuttgart-based company and maker of mercedes benz luxury cars into a welt ag or world inc .
but what schrempp hailed as " a marriage made in heaven " now looks like ending on the rocks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrylser boss dieter zetsche say he 's keeping all his options open the daimlerchrysler share price has largely fallen , resulting in growing stockholder anger that the group 's global expansion has not produced results . however , since the start of the year , the share price has climbed by more than 30 per cent on speculation that daimlerchrysler was now prepared to sell off its chrysler arm . " splitting off chrysler appears to us as appropriate , ' unio investment funds manager ingo speich told german business daily handelsblatt , reflecting the views of many other fund management groups attending wednesday 's shareholders ' meeting . no details as yet zetsche however said tuesday that he would not go into any detail about a possible sale of chrysler . " it is also true that we need to keep all options open and that i can not disclose any details because we need to have the maximum scope for maneuver , " zetsche said . management needed " the greatest possible flexibility so that we can identify and implement the best possible solution , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler is suffering from poor demand and high fuel prices speculation has been rife that chrysler would be put up for sale after it turned in an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros last year , despite repeated restructuring over recent years .
chrysler is suffering from high fuel prices and a consumer shift away from lucrative gasoline-guzzling trucks and large sports utility vehicles . in mid-february , daimlerchrysler unveiled plans to slash thousands more jobs and close two more plants at its loss-making us subsidiary in what observers believed could be a last-ditch attempt to turn the unit around . not too many takers the main aim was to steer chrysler back to profit , zetsche said . " this means , that after reviewing all options , we will finally decide for the option that best meets our criteria , " the ceo said .
" so far , i am satisfied with the process .
everything is going to plan . " a number of big institutional shareholders , such as union investment and seb , appear to be losing patience and want chrysler to put on the block as quickly as possible .
none of the other world 's leading car makers appear to be interested in chrysler , however .
us daily detroit news reported that only three candidates had submitted a firm offer by last week , private equity firms cerberus and blackstone , and canadian car parts maker magna , which is also likely to team up with an investment fund .
the newspaper said daimlerchrysler was aiming to start exclusive talks with a potential buyer by the end of this month , and hoped to raise around eight billion dollars -lrb- six billion euros -rrb- from the sale . outgoing boss says chrysler could stay on meanwhile , daimlerchrysler 's outgoing supervisory board chief hilmar kopper said in a newspaper interview wednesday that he could imagine chrysler remaining within the group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilmar kopper says daimlerchrysler may not need to shed chrysler right away " there is of course a chance that chrysler is still in the group in two years , " kopper told daily die welt . kopper , who was scheduled to retire as supervisory board chief at the agm on wednesday , defended the decision to merge daimler and chrysler in 1998 . " many of the arguments in favor of a merger back then are still valid today , " he said . and kopper rejected suggestions that the tie-up had destroyed value . " we created value for the shareholders .
we were better than half of the dax companies if you include the dividends , " he said . there was never any cross-subsidizing between chrysler and the group 's up-market mercedes-benz brand , kopper insisted . sales dropped in 2007 the beginning of the year has not been good for the car company . daimlerchrysler announced that first-quarter sales have fallen 2.8 percent from the same time period last year .
the company sold 286,800 mercedes-benz , maybach and smart-branded vehicles worldwide in the first three months of the year . sales dragged in germany and western europe , while in the us sales increased by 9.2 percent compared with a year ago .

terrorism experts said the video shows that the kidnappers want to grab attention and money . the video shows a german woman hostage and her son pleading for help as their iraqi kidnappers threatened to execute them unless berlin withdraws its troops from afghanistan . hannelore krause , 61 , and her 20-year-old son sinan were sobbing and visibly distraught in the video picked up by the us-based site institute which monitors islamist websites . their captors extended by 10 days the deadline for germany to withdraw its troops from afghanistan or see the hostages executed , although the exact date of the new deadline was not immediately clear . " it is really very difficult to watch how these people are humiliated on video , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told a press briefing . he said ministry staff had studied the video overnight .
" many of us did not sleep much last night .
we will be meeting with the ministry 's crisis team this afternoon to give our interpretation of the video and try to draw final conclusions about it , " jäger said . hostage negotiators continue work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier briefs the media on the hostage situation germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called the video " shocking and inhumane " adding that " all hope had not been lost " thanks to the crisis team which he said was working on winning the release of the pair . krause , who is married to an iraqi doctor , and her son were seized on february 6 in baghdad where they have lived for several years . " i beg you , help me ...
i 'm so afraid and we only have a few days left , " krause said in the video , crying as she and her son sat in front of a green wall rug in the video that site said was posted on the al-hesbah internet forum . " i 'm completely at the end of my rope .
i 'm a complete mess , " said krause , wearing a headscarf and black robes . apparently addressing her husband , krause said : " you know that i would so much love to come home .
i miss you so much .
please find some way -lrb- to help -rrb- . " site said the five-minute and 27-second video was produced by an iraqi group called " kataeb siham al-haq -lrb- righteous arrows battalions -rrb- " that had threatened on march 10 to kill the germans . the group is seeking the withdrawal of german and austrian forces from afghanistan .

nuclear energy remains controversial and germany lacks a plan for storing its high-level radioactive waste . the federal administrative court in leipzig ruled tuesday that a plan to store atomic waste in an abandoned iron ore mine could go ahead .
work will begin as soon as possible , although it will likely take a number of years before atomic waste is transferred to the site . heinrich sander , lower saxony 's environment minister and a member of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- welcomed tuesday 's ruling , which comes after decades of legal challenges . " there 's finally legal certainty and clarity , " he said . germany 's federal government signalled it plans to go ahead with the storage project . " there 's no other alternative than to implement the decision , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel of the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . phasing out nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to close its nuclear power plants the underground site will hold up to 303,000 cubic meters of atomic waste .
communities and farmers near the site fought for years to stop the project , questioning the long-term safety of the storage facility and fearful of a possible terrorist attack .
the court dismissed those claims . at present , germany plans to phase out its use of nuclear power .
the previous coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder agreed to shut down all power plants by 2020 . but current chancellor angela merkel of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has questioned the phase-out plans .
she recently challenged opponents of nuclear energy in germany to come up with realistic solutions to the country 's energy needs while paying heed to environmental issues . " i 'm saying that those who want both the nuclear phase-out and climate protection are now , naturally , called upon to provide answers , " merkel said in an interview with german radio in january . current storage problems yet regardless of the future of nuclear energy , germany still has to find solutions for storing the high-level radioactive waste which already exists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are regular protests at the gorleben nuclear storage facility in germany in 2005 , an atomic waste storage facility near the city of hanau was closed .
since then , most toxic waste continues to be sent to a " temporary " storage facility in the eastern german town of gorleben . it will take five to six years after the decision for atomic waste to be transferred to the storage area , according to an article in the daily braunschweiger zeitung on wednesday .
the ruling did not change the debate over using gorleben as a storage place for highly radioactive atomic waste .
the gorleben site has not been proven to be safe in the long term , according to the newspaper . the german atomic council welcomed the ruling and asked the government to comply with its responsibility to prepare the storage place . dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel asks for realistic alternatives to nuclear energy german chancellor angela merkel asked the opponents of nuclear energy in germany to come up with realistic solutions to the country 's energy needs while paying heed to environmental issues .

nuclear energy remains controversial and germany lacks a plan for storing its high-level radioactive waste . the federal administrative court in leipzig ruled tuesday that a plan to store atomic waste in an abandoned iron ore mine could go ahead .
work will begin as soon as possible , although it will likely take a number of years before atomic waste is transferred to the site . heinrich sander , lower saxony 's environment minister and a member of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- welcomed tuesday 's ruling , which comes after decades of legal challenges . " there 's finally legal certainty and clarity , " he said . germany 's federal government signalled it plans to go ahead with the storage project . " there 's no other alternative than to implement the decision , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel of the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . phasing out nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to close its nuclear power plants the underground site will hold up to 303,000 cubic meters of atomic waste .
communities and farmers near the site fought for years to stop the project , questioning the long-term safety of the storage facility and fearful of a possible terrorist attack .
the court dismissed those claims . at present , germany plans to phase out its use of nuclear power .
the previous coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder agreed to shut down all power plants by 2020 . but current chancellor angela merkel of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has questioned the phase-out plans .
she recently challenged opponents of nuclear energy in germany to come up with realistic solutions to the country 's energy needs while paying heed to environmental issues . " i 'm saying that those who want both the nuclear phase-out and climate protection are now , naturally , called upon to provide answers , " merkel said in an interview with german radio in january . current storage problems yet regardless of the future of nuclear energy , germany still has to find solutions for storing the high-level radioactive waste which already exists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are regular protests at the gorleben nuclear storage facility in germany in 2005 , an atomic waste storage facility near the city of hanau was closed .
since then , most toxic waste continues to be sent to a " temporary " storage facility in the eastern german town of gorleben . it will take five to six years after the decision for atomic waste to be transferred to the storage area , according to an article in the daily braunschweiger zeitung on wednesday .
the ruling did not change the debate over using gorleben as a storage place for highly radioactive atomic waste .
the gorleben site has not been proven to be safe in the long term , according to the newspaper . the german atomic council welcomed the ruling and asked the government to comply with its responsibility to prepare the storage place . dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel asks for realistic alternatives to nuclear energy german chancellor angela merkel asked the opponents of nuclear energy in germany to come up with realistic solutions to the country 's energy needs while paying heed to environmental issues .

the 2-all draw puts the bundesliga side in excellent position to qualify for the champions league semi-finals next week in munich . bayern had lost four straight games against ac in milan , but this time they hung tough to put a major dent in milan 's title ambitions .
playing without keeper ollie kahn and midfielder mark van bommel , both suspended , munich twice came from behind in the match . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's challenge against kaka led to milan 's disputed penalty the hosts opened the scoring in the 40th minute after bayern botched an off-side trap - alberto gilardino headed home from 7 meters .
bayern were able to equalize in the 78th minute after the ball landed at van buyten 's feet directly in front of the goal . the visitors looked to be doomed seven minutes from time , when milan converted a controversial penalty .
but bayern made the most of the remaining minutes and van buyten levelled things up just before the final whistle , getting his left foot on a cross by owen hargreaves . with neither side playing brilliantly at the moment , this is a match-up that will be decided by persistence , not genius .
that means bayern still have a lot of work to do when milan visit munich for the return leg next wednesday . liverpool on a roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steven gerrard and liverpool powered past eindhoven liverpool , on the other hand , are all but through to the semis after putting hosts psv eindhoven through the soccer equivalent of a meat-grinder in the tuesday 's other quarterfinal . captain steven gerrard opened the scoring in the 27th minute with a powerful header , and liverpool sealed the win early in the second half on goals by john arne riise and peter crouch .

terrorism experts said the video shows that the kidnappers want to grab attention and money . the video shows a german woman hostage and her son pleading for help as their iraqi kidnappers threatened to execute them unless berlin withdraws its troops from afghanistan . hannelore krause , 61 , and her 20-year-old son sinan were sobbing and visibly distraught in the video picked up by the us-based site institute which monitors islamist websites . their captors extended by 10 days the deadline for germany to withdraw its troops from afghanistan or see the hostages executed , although the exact date of the new deadline was not immediately clear . " it is really very difficult to watch how these people are humiliated on video , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told a press briefing . he said ministry staff had studied the video overnight .
" many of us did not sleep much last night .
we will be meeting with the ministry 's crisis team this afternoon to give our interpretation of the video and try to draw final conclusions about it , " jäger said . hostage negotiators continue work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier briefs the media on the hostage situation germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called the video " shocking and inhumane " adding that " all hope had not been lost " thanks to the crisis team which he said was working on winning the release of the pair . krause , who is married to an iraqi doctor , and her son were seized on february 6 in baghdad where they have lived for several years . " i beg you , help me ...
i 'm so afraid and we only have a few days left , " krause said in the video , crying as she and her son sat in front of a green wall rug in the video that site said was posted on the al-hesbah internet forum . " i 'm completely at the end of my rope .
i 'm a complete mess , " said krause , wearing a headscarf and black robes . apparently addressing her husband , krause said : " you know that i would so much love to come home .
i miss you so much .
please find some way -lrb- to help -rrb- . " site said the five-minute and 27-second video was produced by an iraqi group called " kataeb siham al-haq -lrb- righteous arrows battalions -rrb- " that had threatened on march 10 to kill the germans . the group is seeking the withdrawal of german and austrian forces from afghanistan .
site said the video extended the ultimatum for the withdrawal by 10 days . germany has nearly 3,000 troops in afghanistan serving with the nato-led force and austria has a token contingent of around five officers . krause warned in the video that a failure to comply with her captors ' demands would have consequences for both countries and her and her son . a first deadline for the pair 's execution came and went on march 20 with the german government unable to contact the kidnappers , german television reported at the time . berlin has made several appeals for the hostages ' release including a message from german president horst köhler , contained in a video distributed in germany and the arab world , urging the kidnappers " to return the hostages to their family . " chancellor angela merkel warned after meeting afghan president hamid karzai last month that germany would not be blackmailed into withdrawing its troops from afghanistan . previous german hostages in iraq have been released unharmed . kidnappers want attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has sent tornado planes to afghanistan terrorism expert rolf tophoven said the new video is a way to pressure the german government to give into demands . " the goal of the hostage-takers is clearly to increase pressure on the federal government , " tophoven said . the video was made at the same time german tornado fighter jets are being sent to afghanistan .
this shows that the kidnappers are informed about politics and are using it to their advantage , tophoven said . " the timing is striking , " he said . " the kidnappers know the political situation in germany .
they also know that the government is n't able to be blackmailed , " tophoven said .
the kidnappers must also realize that it 's unrealistic to demand germany pull out of afghanistan , the expert said , adding he thought it was a way for the kidnappers to up the ante , but that behind the scenes , the kidnapping is about money . terrorism expert guido steinberg agreed that the kidnappers likely want money . " i do n't really think that right now in baghdad people are actually interested about what is happening in afghanistan and that german troops are there , " steinberg said in a wednesday morning interview with the german public broadcaster ard . steinberg , a specialist on islamist terrorism , said he was not suggesting that negotiators dismiss the link to afghanistan .
kidnappers often make political demands as ways to get money . " from my point of view , this is an attempt to use public opinion here in germany to get attention and force the german government to follow the wishes of the german public , " steinberg said in the ard interview . if the kidnappers are actually trying to get money , the scare tactics will likely continue , tophoven predicted .
the new video does provide some hope for the hostages , since it shows that they have n't been killed and there is room for negotiation . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iraqi militants extend deadline on german hostages militants in iraq who siezed two germans have released a new video saying they are giving germany a new deadline to begin pulling troops out of afghanistan or the two would be killed .

" site said the five-minute and 27-second video was produced by an iraqi group called " kataeb siham al-haq -lrb- righteous arrows battalions -rrb- " that had threatened on march 10 to kill the germans . the group is seeking the withdrawal of german and austrian forces from afghanistan .
site said the video extended the ultimatum for the withdrawal by 10 days . germany has nearly 3,000 troops in afghanistan serving with the nato-led force and austria has a token contingent of around five officers . krause warned in the video that a failure to comply with her captors ' demands would have consequences for both countries and her and her son . a first deadline for the pair 's execution came and went on march 20 with the german government unable to contact the kidnappers , german television reported at the time . berlin has made several appeals for the hostages ' release including a message from german president horst köhler , contained in a video distributed in germany and the arab world , urging the kidnappers " to return the hostages to their family . " chancellor angela merkel warned after meeting afghan president hamid karzai last month that germany would not be blackmailed into withdrawing its troops from afghanistan . previous german hostages in iraq have been released unharmed . kidnappers want attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has sent tornado planes to afghanistan terrorism expert rolf tophoven said the new video is a way to pressure the german government to give into demands . " the goal of the hostage-takers is clearly to increase pressure on the federal government , " tophoven said . the video was made at the same time german tornado fighter jets are being sent to afghanistan .
this shows that the kidnappers are informed about politics and are using it to their advantage , tophoven said . " the timing is striking , " he said . " the kidnappers know the political situation in germany .
they also know that the government is n't able to be blackmailed , " tophoven said .
the kidnappers must also realize that it 's unrealistic to demand germany pull out of afghanistan , the expert said , adding he thought it was a way for the kidnappers to up the ante , but that behind the scenes , the kidnapping is about money . terrorism expert guido steinberg agreed that the kidnappers likely want money . " i do n't really think that right now in baghdad people are actually interested about what is happening in afghanistan and that german troops are there , " steinberg said in a wednesday morning interview with the german public broadcaster ard . steinberg , a specialist on islamist terrorism , said he was not suggesting that negotiators dismiss the link to afghanistan .
kidnappers often make political demands as ways to get money . " from my point of view , this is an attempt to use public opinion here in germany to get attention and force the german government to follow the wishes of the german public , " steinberg said in the ard interview . if the kidnappers are actually trying to get money , the scare tactics will likely continue , tophoven predicted .
the new video does provide some hope for the hostages , since it shows that they have n't been killed and there is room for negotiation . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iraqi militants extend deadline on german hostages militants in iraq who siezed two germans have released a new video saying they are giving germany a new deadline to begin pulling troops out of afghanistan or the two would be killed .

in milan , bayern battled to the end against ac , pulling out a 2-all draw thanks to van buyten 's last-second goal . belgian defender daniel van buyten has n't been having the best season at bayern , but he came up big at san siro on tuesday night , scoring both of munich 's goals .
the 2-all draw puts the bundesliga side in excellent position to qualify for the champions league semi-finals next week in munich . bayern had lost four straight games against ac in milan , but this time they hung tough to put a major dent in milan 's title ambitions .
playing without keeper ollie kahn and midfielder mark van bommel , both suspended , munich twice came from behind in the match . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's challenge against kaka led to milan 's disputed penalty the hosts opened the scoring in the 40th minute after bayern botched an off-side trap - alberto gilardino headed home from 7 meters .
bayern were able to equalize in the 78th minute after the ball landed at van buyten 's feet directly in front of the goal . the visitors looked to be doomed seven minutes from time , when milan converted a controversial penalty .
but bayern made the most of the remaining minutes and van buyten levelled things up just before the final whistle , getting his left foot on a cross by owen hargreaves . with neither side playing brilliantly at the moment , this is a match-up that will be decided by persistence , not genius .
that means bayern still have a lot of work to do when milan visit munich for the return leg next wednesday . liverpool on a roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steven gerrard and liverpool powered past eindhoven liverpool , on the other hand , are all but through to the semis after putting hosts psv eindhoven through the soccer equivalent of a meat-grinder in the tuesday 's other quarterfinal . captain steven gerrard opened the scoring in the 27th minute with a powerful header , and liverpool sealed the win early in the second half on goals by john arne riise and peter crouch .
eindhoven never seriously threatened to stage a comeback , and liverpool showed why the english premiership is the dominant league in europe at the moment .

nuclear energy remains controversial and germany lacks a plan for storing its high-level radioactive waste . the federal administrative court in leipzig ruled tuesday that a plan to store atomic waste in an abandoned iron ore mine could go ahead .
work will begin as soon as possible , although it will likely take a number of years before atomic waste is transferred to the site . heinrich sander , lower saxony 's environment minister and a member of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- welcomed tuesday 's ruling , which comes after decades of legal challenges . " there 's finally legal certainty and clarity , " he said . germany 's federal government signalled it plans to go ahead with the storage project . " there 's no other alternative than to implement the decision , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel of the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . phasing out nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to close its nuclear power plants the underground site will hold up to 303,000 cubic meters of atomic waste .
communities and farmers near the site fought for years to stop the project , questioning the long-term safety of the storage facility and fearful of a possible terrorist attack .
the court dismissed those claims . at present , germany plans to phase out its use of nuclear power .
the previous coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder agreed to shut down all power plants by 2020 . but current chancellor angela merkel of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has questioned the phase-out plans .
she recently challenged opponents of nuclear energy in germany to come up with realistic solutions to the country 's energy needs while paying heed to environmental issues . " i 'm saying that those who want both the nuclear phase-out and climate protection are now , naturally , called upon to provide answers , " merkel said in an interview with german radio in january . current storage problems yet regardless of the future of nuclear energy , germany still has to find solutions for storing the high-level radioactive waste which already exists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are regular protests at the gorleben nuclear storage facility in germany in 2005 , an atomic waste storage facility near the city of hanau was closed .
since then , most toxic waste continues to be sent to a " temporary " storage facility in the eastern german town of gorleben . it will take five to six years after the decision for atomic waste to be transferred to the storage area , according to an article in the daily braunschweiger zeitung on wednesday .
the ruling did not change the debate over using gorleben as a storage place for highly radioactive atomic waste .
the gorleben site has not been proven to be safe in the long term , according to the newspaper . the german atomic council welcomed the ruling and asked the government to comply with its responsibility to prepare the storage place . dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel asks for realistic alternatives to nuclear energy german chancellor angela merkel asked the opponents of nuclear energy in germany to come up with realistic solutions to the country 's energy needs while paying heed to environmental issues .

chelsea drew 1-1 against valencia while man u lost in rome .
meanwhile , bayern munich relishes their draw in milan . supporters of english soccer were hoping that liverpool 's demolition of eindhoven on tuesday would set the tone for fellow premiership sides chelsea and manchester united .
but after wednesday evening , the current top two clubs in english soccer find themselves in a pinch .
chelsea managed only a 1-1 draw at home against valencia .
the spaniards played better soccer for most of the first half as valencia parried the uncoordinated attacks of the english champs .
at the half-hour mark , david silva let loose a sharp shot from some 20 meters out that was unstoppable for chelsea keeper petr cech - valenica led 1-0 .
after the interval , chelsea stormed out of the locker room and quickly took control of the game .
in the 53rd minute , the blues ' top scorer , didier drogba , headed home the equalizer .
chelsea , however , retained the pressure for the remainder of the match but valencia showed little weakness in gaining the draw .
with the home result , chelsea leave themselves in a precarious position for next week 's second leg tie in valencia .
man u drop match at roma in rome , premiership leader manchester united fell to roma 2-1 .
manu coach sir alex ferguson should be satisfied with the result considering his team played for almost one hour with 10 men after german referee herbert fendel sent off paul scholes .
roma took advantage of the red card and one minute before halftime , their brazilian midfielder taddei scored from 11 metres out with some help from two manchester defenders who deflected the ball into their own net .
the one-sided nature of this contest was obvious as roma launched 26 total shots .
manchester waited for counter-attacks , and that 's how they scored when wayne rooney equalized at the hour mark .
six minutes later , though , mirko vucinic slotted home the ball after manu keeper edwin van der sar was unable to stop a shot .
manchester got the desired one goal that coach ferguson demanded but will nevertheless have a tough task next week at old trafford .

chelsea drew 1-1 against valencia while man u lost in rome .
meanwhile , bayern munich relishes their draw in milan . supporters of english soccer were hoping that liverpool 's demolition of eindhoven on tuesday would set the tone for fellow premiership sides chelsea and manchester united .
but after wednesday evening , the current top two clubs in english soccer find themselves in a pinch .
chelsea managed only a 1-1 draw at home against valencia .
the spaniards played better soccer for most of the first half as valencia parried the uncoordinated attacks of the english champs .
at the half-hour mark , david silva let loose a sharp shot from some 20 meters out that was unstoppable for chelsea keeper petr cech - valenica led 1-0 .
after the interval , chelsea stormed out of the locker room and quickly took control of the game .
in the 53rd minute , the blues ' top scorer , didier drogba , headed home the equalizer .
chelsea , however , retained the pressure for the remainder of the match but valencia showed little weakness in gaining the draw .
with the home result , chelsea leave themselves in a precarious position for next week 's second leg tie in valencia .
man u drop match at roma in rome , premiership leader manchester united fell to roma 2-1 .
manu coach sir alex ferguson should be satisfied with the result considering his team played for almost one hour with 10 men after german referee herbert fendel sent off paul scholes .
roma took advantage of the red card and one minute before halftime , their brazilian midfielder taddei scored from 11 metres out with some help from two manchester defenders who deflected the ball into their own net .
the one-sided nature of this contest was obvious as roma launched 26 total shots .
manchester waited for counter-attacks , and that 's how they scored when wayne rooney equalized at the hour mark .
six minutes later , though , mirko vucinic slotted home the ball after manu keeper edwin van der sar was unable to stop a shot .
manchester got the desired one goal that coach ferguson demanded but will nevertheless have a tough task next week at old trafford .
the match was marred by fighting between supporters from both teams before and during the contest .
italian media reported that five people were injured in the clashes .
bayern still basking after milan draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's daniel van buyten : one dangerous left foot in germany , the talk of the day was bayern munich 's 2-2 draw at milan .
the man of the match was most certainly bayern 's two-goal scoring defender daniel van buyten who has been oft maligned of late .
bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld was equally pleased with his side 's performance , specifically with that of the oft maligned defender .
and if the munich strikers by any means reach van buyten 's form , a place in the semi-finals against either roma or manchester united should be a done deal . john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.04.2007 german government says hostage video shocking and inhumane großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kidnappers want german and austrian soldiers out of afghanistan german government officials condemned a video in which two germans taken hostage in iraq plead for their lives .
terrorism experts said the video shows that the kidnappers want to grab attention and money . the video shows a german woman hostage and her son pleading for help as their iraqi kidnappers threatened to execute them unless berlin withdraws its troops from afghanistan . hannelore krause , 61 , and her 20-year-old son sinan were sobbing and visibly distraught in the video picked up by the us-based site institute which monitors islamist websites . their captors extended by 10 days the deadline for germany to withdraw its troops from afghanistan or see the hostages executed , although the exact date of the new deadline was not immediately clear . " it is really very difficult to watch how these people are humiliated on video , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told a press briefing . he said ministry staff had studied the video overnight .
" many of us did not sleep much last night .
we will be meeting with the ministry 's crisis team this afternoon to give our interpretation of the video and try to draw final conclusions about it , " jäger said . hostage negotiators continue work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier briefs the media on the hostage situation germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called the video " shocking and inhumane " adding that " all hope had not been lost " thanks to the crisis team which he said was working on winning the release of the pair . krause , who is married to an iraqi doctor , and her son were seized on february 6 in baghdad where they have lived for several years . " i beg you , help me ...
i 'm so afraid and we only have a few days left , " krause said in the video , crying as she and her son sat in front of a green wall rug in the video that site said was posted on the al-hesbah internet forum . " i 'm completely at the end of my rope .
i 'm a complete mess , " said krause , wearing a headscarf and black robes . apparently addressing her husband , krause said : " you know that i would so much love to come home .
i miss you so much .
please find some way -lrb- to help -rrb- . " site said the five-minute and 27-second video was produced by an iraqi group called " kataeb siham al-haq -lrb- righteous arrows battalions -rrb- " that had threatened on march 10 to kill the germans . the group is seeking the withdrawal of german and austrian forces from afghanistan .
site said the video extended the ultimatum for the withdrawal by 10 days . germany has nearly 3,000 troops in afghanistan serving with the nato-led force and austria has a token contingent of around five officers . krause warned in the video that a failure to comply with her captors ' demands would have consequences for both countries and her and her son . a first deadline for the pair 's execution came and went on march 20 with the german government unable to contact the kidnappers , german television reported at the time . berlin has made several appeals for the hostages ' release including a message from german president horst köhler , contained in a video distributed in germany and the arab world , urging the kidnappers " to return the hostages to their family . " chancellor angela merkel warned after meeting afghan president hamid karzai last month that germany would not be blackmailed into withdrawing its troops from afghanistan . previous german hostages in iraq have been released unharmed . kidnappers want attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has sent tornado planes to afghanistan terrorism expert rolf tophoven said the new video is a way to pressure the german government to give into demands . " the goal of the hostage-takers is clearly to increase pressure on the federal government , " tophoven said . the video was made at the same time german tornado fighter jets are being sent to afghanistan .
this shows that the kidnappers are informed about politics and are using it to their advantage , tophoven said . " the timing is striking , " he said . " the kidnappers know the political situation in germany .
they also know that the government is n't able to be blackmailed , " tophoven said .
the kidnappers must also realize that it 's unrealistic to demand germany pull out of afghanistan , the expert said , adding he thought it was a way for the kidnappers to up the ante , but that behind the scenes , the kidnapping is about money . terrorism expert guido steinberg agreed that the kidnappers likely want money . " i do n't really think that right now in baghdad people are actually interested about what is happening in afghanistan and that german troops are there , " steinberg said in a wednesday morning interview with the german public broadcaster ard . steinberg , a specialist on islamist terrorism , said he was not suggesting that negotiators dismiss the link to afghanistan .
kidnappers often make political demands as ways to get money . " from my point of view , this is an attempt to use public opinion here in germany to get attention and force the german government to follow the wishes of the german public , " steinberg said in the ard interview . if the kidnappers are actually trying to get money , the scare tactics will likely continue , tophoven predicted .
the new video does provide some hope for the hostages , since it shows that they have n't been killed and there is room for negotiation . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iraqi militants extend deadline on german hostages militants in iraq who siezed two germans have released a new video saying they are giving germany a new deadline to begin pulling troops out of afghanistan or the two would be killed .

but will serbia , which considers kosovo as its territory , accept the idea ? the plan - which was drawn up by un special envoy martti ahtisaari of finland - would go a long way toward granting kosovo 's majority ethnic albanian populace independence form serbia while retaining international supervision over the province . at the same time , it would also allow serbian dominated municipalities to govern themselves in many respects and maintain existing ties to belgrade .
the goal is to create a multi-ethnic , democratic state under the rule of law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo was devasted by the 1998-1999 war and sporadic violence continues ahead of the closed-door debates in the security council , ahtisaari 's blueprint was endorsed by kosovo 's current president , fatmir sejdiu , and by the us and the eu , who see it as the only viable way to solve the problem of kosovo 's long-term status . kosovo has been under un control since 1999 when nato military forces intervened to stop a brutal serbian crackdown on the ethnic albanian independence movement in the province . russian scepticism any decision by the security council would be binding .
but russia , which has the power of veto on the council , has criticized the plan , saying any decisions on kosovo 's status must be accepted by all sides of the conflict . belgrade has flatly rejected ahtisaari 's blueprint , insisting that kosovo remain part of serbia and calling for fresh negotiations under a new un-appointed arbitrator . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un special envoy martti ahtisaari expects protracted negotiations britain 's un ambassador emyr jones parry - currently the security council president - said there was considerable support for the plan .
but he added , " i do n't think it 's likely there will be an early presentation of a security council resolution . " meanwhile , france says the un must decide on kosovo 's status soon or run the risk that ethnic strife will flare up again . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu foreign ministers to quiz un envoy on kosovo 's future european foreign ministers will ask un envoy martti ahtisaari on monday how he intends to push forward his proposals for kosovo 's future as they seek their own formula to keep serbia engaged .
-lrb- 12.02.2007 -rrb- un briefly delays kosovo talks to accommodate serbs a final round of un-backed negotiations on the future status of kosovo - the serbian province whose ethnic albanian majority is craving independence - will be postponed by one week and start on feb .

-lrb- 09.02.2007 -rrb- un : no more delays on kosovo decision the un envoy for kosovo has refused to delay talks on his plan for the troubled region , despite serbian requests to wait until a new government has been formed .
the un fears a delay could lead to violent confrontation .

london welcomed the news , but tensions between the countries remain strong . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad was shown on state television chatting with british sailors wednesday .
the president said they would be released immediately .
iranian state media said the 15 had " shouted for joy " when told the news . the sailors will return home from tehran 's mehrabad airport on thursday , an aide to the president said . " they will leave tomorrow from mehrabad airport , " the aide , who declined to be named , told iranian reporters . iran seized the britons on march 23 after saying the ship they were on had trespassed into territorial waters .
britain insists the soldiers were on a routine anti-smuggling patrol in iraqi territory under a united nations mandate . ahmadinejad said britain had promised in a letter not to repeat the incident . " the blair government chose the path of media hype and sent the issue to the un security council , " ahmadinejad said .

they appeared occasionally on iranian television to offer " confessions " for trespassing and to apologize .
it is unknown whether the statements were coerced . the united kingdom froze most ties with iran after the soldiers were seized .

" if mr. bush and his government change their behaviour ... this side -lrb- iran -rrb- has the ability to reconsider " ahmadinejad said . the united states said on wednesday if iran wanted to change its relationship with washington it would first have to suspend uranium enrichment . " the behavior that needs to change is the iranians , not the united states , " state department spokesman tom casey said . ahmadinejad said there was no link between the release of the britons and five iranians held by us forces in iraq .
the us also denied the release was in any way linked . " there is no link whatsoever .
neither we nor the british nor anyone else , as far as i know , has made that link , " casey said .

in milan , bayern battled to the end against ac , pulling out a 2-all draw thanks to van buyten 's last-second goal . belgian defender daniel van buyten has n't been having the best season at bayern , but he came up big at san siro on tuesday night , scoring both of munich 's goals .
the 2-all draw puts the bundesliga side in excellent position to qualify for the champions league semi-finals next week in munich . bayern had lost four straight games against ac in milan , but this time they hung tough to put a major dent in milan 's title ambitions .
playing without keeper ollie kahn and midfielder mark van bommel , both suspended , munich twice came from behind in the match . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's challenge against kaka led to milan 's disputed penalty the hosts opened the scoring in the 40th minute after bayern botched an off-side trap - alberto gilardino headed home from 7 meters .
bayern were able to equalize in the 78th minute after the ball landed at van buyten 's feet directly in front of the goal . the visitors looked to be doomed seven minutes from time , when milan converted a controversial penalty .
but bayern made the most of the remaining minutes and van buyten levelled things up just before the final whistle , getting his left foot on a cross by owen hargreaves . with neither side playing brilliantly at the moment , this is a match-up that will be decided by persistence , not genius .
that means bayern still have a lot of work to do when milan visit munich for the return leg next wednesday . liverpool on a roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steven gerrard and liverpool powered past eindhoven liverpool , on the other hand , are all but through to the semis after putting hosts psv eindhoven through the soccer equivalent of a meat-grinder in the tuesday 's other quarterfinal . captain steven gerrard opened the scoring in the 27th minute with a powerful header , and liverpool sealed the win early in the second half on goals by john arne riise and peter crouch .
eindhoven never seriously threatened to stage a comeback , and liverpool showed why the english premiership is the dominant league in europe at the moment .

" i can confirm that we are talking with some of the potential partners who have shown a clear interest , " daimlerchrysler chief executive dieter zetsche said in a speech prepared for delivery at the car maker 's annual shareholder meeting on wednesday in berlin . the prospect of daimlerchrysler jettisoning its detriot-based unit comes nine years after what is now the world 's fifth bigger carmaker was formed through a $ 36-billion -lrb- about 27 billion euros -rrb- merger of daimler and chrysler . shedding chrysler would also essentially take daimlerchrysler back to where it was in 1998 when its former chief jürgen schrempp launched his vision to transform the stuttgart-based company and maker of mercedes benz luxury cars into a welt ag or world inc .
but what schrempp hailed as " a marriage made in heaven " now looks like ending on the rocks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrylser boss dieter zetsche say he 's keeping all his options open the daimlerchrysler share price has largely fallen , resulting in growing stockholder anger that the group 's global expansion has not produced results . however , since the start of the year , the share price has climbed by more than 30 per cent on speculation that daimlerchrysler was now prepared to sell off its chrysler arm . " splitting off chrysler appears to us as appropriate , ' unio investment funds manager ingo speich told german business daily handelsblatt , reflecting the views of many other fund management groups attending wednesday 's shareholders ' meeting . no details as yet zetsche however said tuesday that he would not go into any detail about a possible sale of chrysler . " it is also true that we need to keep all options open and that i can not disclose any details because we need to have the maximum scope for maneuver , " zetsche said . management needed " the greatest possible flexibility so that we can identify and implement the best possible solution , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler is suffering from poor demand and high fuel prices speculation has been rife that chrysler would be put up for sale after it turned in an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros last year , despite repeated restructuring over recent years .
chrysler is suffering from high fuel prices and a consumer shift away from lucrative gasoline-guzzling trucks and large sports utility vehicles . in mid-february , daimlerchrysler unveiled plans to slash thousands more jobs and close two more plants at its loss-making us subsidiary in what observers believed could be a last-ditch attempt to turn the unit around . not too many takers the main aim was to steer chrysler back to profit , zetsche said . " this means , that after reviewing all options , we will finally decide for the option that best meets our criteria , " the ceo said .
" so far , i am satisfied with the process .
everything is going to plan . " a number of big institutional shareholders , such as union investment and seb , appear to be losing patience and want chrysler to put on the block as quickly as possible .
none of the other world 's leading car makers appear to be interested in chrysler , however .
us daily detroit news reported that only three candidates had submitted a firm offer by last week , private equity firms cerberus and blackstone , and canadian car parts maker magna , which is also likely to team up with an investment fund .
the newspaper said daimlerchrysler was aiming to start exclusive talks with a potential buyer by the end of this month , and hoped to raise around eight billion dollars -lrb- six billion euros -rrb- from the sale . outgoing boss says chrysler could stay on meanwhile , daimlerchrysler 's outgoing supervisory board chief hilmar kopper said in a newspaper interview wednesday that he could imagine chrysler remaining within the group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilmar kopper says daimlerchrysler may not need to shed chrysler right away " there is of course a chance that chrysler is still in the group in two years , " kopper told daily die welt . kopper , who was scheduled to retire as supervisory board chief at the agm on wednesday , defended the decision to merge daimler and chrysler in 1998 . " many of the arguments in favor of a merger back then are still valid today , " he said . and kopper rejected suggestions that the tie-up had destroyed value . " we created value for the shareholders .
we were better than half of the dax companies if you include the dividends , " he said . there was never any cross-subsidizing between chrysler and the group 's up-market mercedes-benz brand , kopper insisted . sales dropped in 2007 the beginning of the year has not been good for the car company . daimlerchrysler announced that first-quarter sales have fallen 2.8 percent from the same time period last year .
the company sold 286,800 mercedes-benz , maybach and smart-branded vehicles worldwide in the first three months of the year . sales dragged in germany and western europe , while in the us sales increased by 9.2 percent compared with a year ago .
sales also rose in asia .

chelsea drew 1-1 against valencia while man u lost in rome .
meanwhile , bayern munich relishes their draw in milan . supporters of english soccer were hoping that liverpool 's demolition of eindhoven on tuesday would set the tone for fellow premiership sides chelsea and manchester united .
but after wednesday evening , the current top two clubs in english soccer find themselves in a pinch .
chelsea managed only a 1-1 draw at home against valencia .
the spaniards played better soccer for most of the first half as valencia parried the uncoordinated attacks of the english champs .
at the half-hour mark , david silva let loose a sharp shot from some 20 meters out that was unstoppable for chelsea keeper petr cech - valenica led 1-0 .
after the interval , chelsea stormed out of the locker room and quickly took control of the game .
in the 53rd minute , the blues ' top scorer , didier drogba , headed home the equalizer .
chelsea , however , retained the pressure for the remainder of the match but valencia showed little weakness in gaining the draw .
with the home result , chelsea leave themselves in a precarious position for next week 's second leg tie in valencia .
man u drop match at roma in rome , premiership leader manchester united fell to roma 2-1 .
manu coach sir alex ferguson should be satisfied with the result considering his team played for almost one hour with 10 men after german referee herbert fendel sent off paul scholes .
roma took advantage of the red card and one minute before halftime , their brazilian midfielder taddei scored from 11 metres out with some help from two manchester defenders who deflected the ball into their own net .
the one-sided nature of this contest was obvious as roma launched 26 total shots .
manchester waited for counter-attacks , and that 's how they scored when wayne rooney equalized at the hour mark .
six minutes later , though , mirko vucinic slotted home the ball after manu keeper edwin van der sar was unable to stop a shot .
manchester got the desired one goal that coach ferguson demanded but will nevertheless have a tough task next week at old trafford .
the match was marred by fighting between supporters from both teams before and during the contest .
italian media reported that five people were injured in the clashes .
bayern still basking after milan draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's daniel van buyten : one dangerous left foot in germany , the talk of the day was bayern munich 's 2-2 draw at milan .
the man of the match was most certainly bayern 's two-goal scoring defender daniel van buyten who has been oft maligned of late .
bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld was equally pleased with his side 's performance , specifically with that of the oft maligned defender .
and if the munich strikers by any means reach van buyten 's form , a place in the semi-finals against either roma or manchester united should be a done deal . john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

" this is about the suggestion of the museum that there should be at least one reference to poland 's territorial status before and after the september 17 , 1939 , " he said . credibility question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photo of young survivors taken by red army soldiers " as is well known , a large part of the population of the eastern regions came under soviet rule .
that has to be taken into account if you want to remain credible to visitors to auschwitz , " mensfeld added . the russian part of the museum was closed three years ago for renovation and was originally meant to reopen in 2005 . several other countries have their own exhibition spaces in the former barracks of auschwitz that reflect the fate of their citizens at the hands of the nazis .
the belgian , czech , dutch , french , hungarian and slovak spaces have all been revamped in recent years . the decision to delay the opening of the russian block has sparked a political row that is stirring up deep-seated resentments between moscow and warsaw . technically correct while technically the description of victims from the annexed countries as soviet citizens is correct , the museum says they can not be regarded as such because they did not voluntarily renounce their original nationalities and freely assume soviet citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the anniversary of the liberation by soviet soldiers is commemorated each year russia stands accused of continuing to propagate a version of history that portrays the soviet union as a liberator and papers over its role as an aggressor . international auschwitz-birkenau council president wladyslaw bartoszewski said he ruled out the existence in poland of an exhibition that misrepresented history based on the criteria of the stalinist era . hitler-stalin pact the council president , who was himself a prisoner at the camp , is a famous resistance leader who took part in the 1944 warsaw uprising against the nazis and later went on to serve as a polish foreign minister after the end of communist rule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors are also getting embroiled in the dispute between the two nations " if they want to desecrate their own graves then so be it .
but we poles will not allow us to be misused in the framework of the hitler-stalin doctrine for the annexation of half of poland in 1939 or allow the jews and poles who died there to be declared soviet citizens , " said bartoszewski . " we protested against displays like that in the final inspection .
they wanted to talk to us straightaway about the matter back in 2005 , but they have still failed to do so , " he added . outrageous provocation moscow has responded angrily .
the russian daily kommersant this week quoted russian officials as saying poland was deliberately blocking the opening for political reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz was the largest nazi concentration camp konstantin kossatchov , the chairman of the foreign committee of the russian parliament , has accused poland of rewriting history . " an extraordinarily outrageous provocation is taking place right before our very eyes .

but the bloc also said it considers the standoff a domestic issue that does n't warrant outside involvement . the eu 's statement came a day after ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said he was dissolving parliament and calling fresh elections in may .
the parliament , which is dominated by yushchenko 's rival , viktor yanukovych , rejected that announcement , saying it amounted to an attempted coup d 'etat . crisis talks tuesday between yushchenko and prime minister viktor yanukovych failed to yield a compromise between the two rivals , even after ukraine 's government and parliament voted to defy the president 's orders . the presidential office said in a statement that yushchenko had informed the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana of his intention to hold snap elections . but yanukovych , who favours ties with russia , said pro-western yushchenko had made " a fatal mistake " in issuing the order dissolving parliament after months of political impasse .
hundreds of anti-yushchenko activists meanwhile camped out overnight in central kiev to protest against the president and vowed to hold a mass protest on wednesday .
" no to the division of ukraine ! " and " the constitution is the law for everyone ! " read placards posted up by the activists outside more than 200 tents set up near the parliament building and on independence square . eu has no plans to intervene the german eu presidency expressed concern about the situation in ukraine .
in a written statement , the german foreign ministry called upon the two sides in the conflict " to settle their current differences on domestic policy in a manner which complies with the constitution and domestic rules . " but the eu does not plan to intervene .
" we do not consider the situation at the moment to need influence from outside , " european commission spokeswoman christiane hohmann said .
" we think it 's a domestic affair that needs to be sorted out in ukraine itself . " adherents of both the pro-western yushchenko and the more russia-oriented yanukovych continue to stage protests in the ukrainian capital kiev . unwieldy partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych , left , and yushchenko have not been able to work together yushchenko was swept to power in january 2005 after a bitterly contested election against yanukovych and waves of popular street demonstrations that became known as the orange revolution .
but he was forced to accept his rival as prime minister after he and his allies failed to secure a parliamentary majority in a national election in 2006 . yushchenko accuses yanukovych of trying to encourage individual parliamentary deputies to switch allegiances , something he says is forbidden under ukraine 's constitution .
but critics of yushchenko say he himself refuses to accept limitations on the power of the ukrainian presidency put in place in 2005 . the two men have clashed repeatedly since yanukovych became prime minister , and it is unclear whether a new election would do anything to end the impasse . political chaos in ukraine would be a major worry for the eu since it is one of the largest countries in eastern europe and one that is home to pipelines supplying western europe with russian gas . the eu presidency was careful to point out on tuesday that it hoped negotiations for closer ties between the eu and ukraine would not be affected by the current political stalemate . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nationalists , russia find ukraine 's eurovision song quite a drag ukraine 's eurovision song contest entry is causing friction at home and abroad .

chelsea drew 1-1 against valencia while man u lost in rome .
meanwhile , bayern munich relishes their draw in milan . supporters of english soccer were hoping that liverpool 's demolition of eindhoven on tuesday would set the tone for fellow premiership sides chelsea and manchester united .
but after wednesday evening , the current top two clubs in english soccer find themselves in a pinch .
chelsea managed only a 1-1 draw at home against valencia .
the spaniards played better soccer for most of the first half as valencia parried the uncoordinated attacks of the english champs .
at the half-hour mark , david silva let loose a sharp shot from some 20 meters out that was unstoppable for chelsea keeper petr cech - valenica led 1-0 .
after the interval , chelsea stormed out of the locker room and quickly took control of the game .
in the 53rd minute , the blues ' top scorer , didier drogba , headed home the equalizer .
chelsea , however , retained the pressure for the remainder of the match but valencia showed little weakness in gaining the draw .
with the home result , chelsea leave themselves in a precarious position for next week 's second leg tie in valencia .
man u drop match at roma in rome , premiership leader manchester united fell to roma 2-1 .
manu coach sir alex ferguson should be satisfied with the result considering his team played for almost one hour with 10 men after german referee herbert fendel sent off paul scholes .
roma took advantage of the red card and one minute before halftime , their brazilian midfielder taddei scored from 11 metres out with some help from two manchester defenders who deflected the ball into their own net .
the one-sided nature of this contest was obvious as roma launched 26 total shots .
manchester waited for counter-attacks , and that 's how they scored when wayne rooney equalized at the hour mark .
six minutes later , though , mirko vucinic slotted home the ball after manu keeper edwin van der sar was unable to stop a shot .
manchester got the desired one goal that coach ferguson demanded but will nevertheless have a tough task next week at old trafford .
the match was marred by fighting between supporters from both teams before and during the contest .
italian media reported that five people were injured in the clashes .
bayern still basking after milan draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's daniel van buyten : one dangerous left foot in germany , the talk of the day was bayern munich 's 2-2 draw at milan .
the man of the match was most certainly bayern 's two-goal scoring defender daniel van buyten who has been oft maligned of late .
bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld was equally pleased with his side 's performance , specifically with that of the oft maligned defender .
and if the munich strikers by any means reach van buyten 's form , a place in the semi-finals against either roma or manchester united should be a done deal . john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

" this is about the suggestion of the museum that there should be at least one reference to poland 's territorial status before and after the september 17 , 1939 , " he said . credibility question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photo of young survivors taken by red army soldiers " as is well known , a large part of the population of the eastern regions came under soviet rule .
that has to be taken into account if you want to remain credible to visitors to auschwitz , " mensfeld added . the russian part of the museum was closed three years ago for renovation and was originally meant to reopen in 2005 . several other countries have their own exhibition spaces in the former barracks of auschwitz that reflect the fate of their citizens at the hands of the nazis .
the belgian , czech , dutch , french , hungarian and slovak spaces have all been revamped in recent years . the decision to delay the opening of the russian block has sparked a political row that is stirring up deep-seated resentments between moscow and warsaw . technically correct while technically the description of victims from the annexed countries as soviet citizens is correct , the museum says they can not be regarded as such because they did not voluntarily renounce their original nationalities and freely assume soviet citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the anniversary of the liberation by soviet soldiers is commemorated each year russia stands accused of continuing to propagate a version of history that portrays the soviet union as a liberator and papers over its role as an aggressor . international auschwitz-birkenau council president wladyslaw bartoszewski said he ruled out the existence in poland of an exhibition that misrepresented history based on the criteria of the stalinist era . hitler-stalin pact the council president , who was himself a prisoner at the camp , is a famous resistance leader who took part in the 1944 warsaw uprising against the nazis and later went on to serve as a polish foreign minister after the end of communist rule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors are also getting embroiled in the dispute between the two nations " if they want to desecrate their own graves then so be it .
but we poles will not allow us to be misused in the framework of the hitler-stalin doctrine for the annexation of half of poland in 1939 or allow the jews and poles who died there to be declared soviet citizens , " said bartoszewski . " we protested against displays like that in the final inspection .
they wanted to talk to us straightaway about the matter back in 2005 , but they have still failed to do so , " he added . outrageous provocation moscow has responded angrily .
the russian daily kommersant this week quoted russian officials as saying poland was deliberately blocking the opening for political reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz was the largest nazi concentration camp konstantin kossatchov , the chairman of the foreign committee of the russian parliament , has accused poland of rewriting history . " an extraordinarily outrageous provocation is taking place right before our very eyes .
they are trying to describe history from today 's standpoint and in accordance with the interests of poland today , " he said .

synthetic diamonds have been manufactured from carbon since the mid-1950s .
the process costs around $ 17,000 . diamonds not the court 's best friend the court said the daughter 's views on the care of the remains took precedence over the wishes of the dead man 's mother but ruled that any decision had to be in accordance with the expressed wishes of the deceased .
testimony from the man 's brother-in-law who visited a family grave with him shortly before his death from cancer last year indicated he did not wish to be turned into a diamond . the deceased allegedly remarked that he too would soon be buried there , casting doubt on his daughter 's claim . judges said that in the absence of written instructions , they preferred to believe the man 's preferences were conventional . wishes went with him to the grave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this stone was made from the ashes of a pet dog " with such an exotic form of interment , and one that is illegal in germany , there is an onus to prove that the deceased really wanted this , " the court said in its judgement . the ashes remain in the custody of the court until the conclusion of all legal action .

" i can confirm that we are talking with some of the potential partners who have shown a clear interest , " daimlerchrysler chief executive dieter zetsche said in a speech prepared for delivery at the car maker 's annual shareholder meeting on wednesday in berlin . the prospect of daimlerchrysler jettisoning its detriot-based unit comes nine years after what is now the world 's fifth bigger carmaker was formed through a $ 36-billion -lrb- about 27 billion euros -rrb- merger of daimler and chrysler . shedding chrysler would also essentially take daimlerchrysler back to where it was in 1998 when its former chief jürgen schrempp launched his vision to transform the stuttgart-based company and maker of mercedes benz luxury cars into a welt ag or world inc .
but what schrempp hailed as " a marriage made in heaven " now looks like ending on the rocks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrylser boss dieter zetsche say he 's keeping all his options open the daimlerchrysler share price has largely fallen , resulting in growing stockholder anger that the group 's global expansion has not produced results . however , since the start of the year , the share price has climbed by more than 30 per cent on speculation that daimlerchrysler was now prepared to sell off its chrysler arm . " splitting off chrysler appears to us as appropriate , ' unio investment funds manager ingo speich told german business daily handelsblatt , reflecting the views of many other fund management groups attending wednesday 's shareholders ' meeting . no details as yet zetsche however said tuesday that he would not go into any detail about a possible sale of chrysler . " it is also true that we need to keep all options open and that i can not disclose any details because we need to have the maximum scope for maneuver , " zetsche said . management needed " the greatest possible flexibility so that we can identify and implement the best possible solution , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler is suffering from poor demand and high fuel prices speculation has been rife that chrysler would be put up for sale after it turned in an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros last year , despite repeated restructuring over recent years .
chrysler is suffering from high fuel prices and a consumer shift away from lucrative gasoline-guzzling trucks and large sports utility vehicles . in mid-february , daimlerchrysler unveiled plans to slash thousands more jobs and close two more plants at its loss-making us subsidiary in what observers believed could be a last-ditch attempt to turn the unit around . not too many takers the main aim was to steer chrysler back to profit , zetsche said . " this means , that after reviewing all options , we will finally decide for the option that best meets our criteria , " the ceo said .
" so far , i am satisfied with the process .
everything is going to plan . " a number of big institutional shareholders , such as union investment and seb , appear to be losing patience and want chrysler to put on the block as quickly as possible .
none of the other world 's leading car makers appear to be interested in chrysler , however .
us daily detroit news reported that only three candidates had submitted a firm offer by last week , private equity firms cerberus and blackstone , and canadian car parts maker magna , which is also likely to team up with an investment fund .
the newspaper said daimlerchrysler was aiming to start exclusive talks with a potential buyer by the end of this month , and hoped to raise around eight billion dollars -lrb- six billion euros -rrb- from the sale . outgoing boss says chrysler could stay on meanwhile , daimlerchrysler 's outgoing supervisory board chief hilmar kopper said in a newspaper interview wednesday that he could imagine chrysler remaining within the group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilmar kopper says daimlerchrysler may not need to shed chrysler right away " there is of course a chance that chrysler is still in the group in two years , " kopper told daily die welt . kopper , who was scheduled to retire as supervisory board chief at the agm on wednesday , defended the decision to merge daimler and chrysler in 1998 . " many of the arguments in favor of a merger back then are still valid today , " he said . and kopper rejected suggestions that the tie-up had destroyed value . " we created value for the shareholders .
we were better than half of the dax companies if you include the dividends , " he said . there was never any cross-subsidizing between chrysler and the group 's up-market mercedes-benz brand , kopper insisted . sales dropped in 2007 the beginning of the year has not been good for the car company . daimlerchrysler announced that first-quarter sales have fallen 2.8 percent from the same time period last year .
the company sold 286,800 mercedes-benz , maybach and smart-branded vehicles worldwide in the first three months of the year . sales dragged in germany and western europe , while in the us sales increased by 9.2 percent compared with a year ago .
sales also rose in asia .
the company 's smart brand sales fell more than 57 percent , a drop the company said was caused by a model changeover . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers rev up effort to enter hybrid market amid increasing consumer awareness of global warming and other environmental issues , german carmakers have had to fight off growing criticism about their apparent lack of will to build environmentally friendly cars .

" this is about the suggestion of the museum that there should be at least one reference to poland 's territorial status before and after the september 17 , 1939 , " he said . credibility question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photo of young survivors taken by red army soldiers " as is well known , a large part of the population of the eastern regions came under soviet rule .
that has to be taken into account if you want to remain credible to visitors to auschwitz , " mensfeld added . the russian part of the museum was closed three years ago for renovation and was originally meant to reopen in 2005 . several other countries have their own exhibition spaces in the former barracks of auschwitz that reflect the fate of their citizens at the hands of the nazis .
the belgian , czech , dutch , french , hungarian and slovak spaces have all been revamped in recent years . the decision to delay the opening of the russian block has sparked a political row that is stirring up deep-seated resentments between moscow and warsaw . technically correct while technically the description of victims from the annexed countries as soviet citizens is correct , the museum says they can not be regarded as such because they did not voluntarily renounce their original nationalities and freely assume soviet citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the anniversary of the liberation by soviet soldiers is commemorated each year russia stands accused of continuing to propagate a version of history that portrays the soviet union as a liberator and papers over its role as an aggressor . international auschwitz-birkenau council president wladyslaw bartoszewski said he ruled out the existence in poland of an exhibition that misrepresented history based on the criteria of the stalinist era . hitler-stalin pact the council president , who was himself a prisoner at the camp , is a famous resistance leader who took part in the 1944 warsaw uprising against the nazis and later went on to serve as a polish foreign minister after the end of communist rule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors are also getting embroiled in the dispute between the two nations " if they want to desecrate their own graves then so be it .
but we poles will not allow us to be misused in the framework of the hitler-stalin doctrine for the annexation of half of poland in 1939 or allow the jews and poles who died there to be declared soviet citizens , " said bartoszewski . " we protested against displays like that in the final inspection .
they wanted to talk to us straightaway about the matter back in 2005 , but they have still failed to do so , " he added . outrageous provocation moscow has responded angrily .
the russian daily kommersant this week quoted russian officials as saying poland was deliberately blocking the opening for political reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz was the largest nazi concentration camp konstantin kossatchov , the chairman of the foreign committee of the russian parliament , has accused poland of rewriting history . " an extraordinarily outrageous provocation is taking place right before our very eyes .
they are trying to describe history from today 's standpoint and in accordance with the interests of poland today , " he said .

this is not only a paradox , but also a crime in itself . bildunterschrift : gert weisskirchen has been a member of the bundestag since 1976 how seriously should it be taken ? very seriously .
it ’ s really dangerous .
it shows that these people are ready to kill . how do you think the german government will respond to the ultimatum ? first of all , it ’ s clear that the government is trying to save the lives of these innocent people , but we are not ready to fulfil their claims . the tornado reconnaissance jets will arrive in northern afghanistan tomorrow .
the german government has maintained that its involvement in afghanistan is strictly a peacekeeping mission .
in light of the tornado mission and now the hostage-taking , do you think that germany will be able to stay out of danger or is it being drawn into more than it bargained for ? the point is that we are ready to give what we can , for instance to save the people of afghanistan , and we are ready to fulfill what they need , but we are working within a very restrictive mandate .
that means that the parliament is eagerly monitoring what is happening on the ground and we are not ready to enlarge the mandate militarily . how do you see the future of germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan ?
will it become more dangerous for german troops ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tornado reconnaissance jets arrive thursday in northern afghanistan no doubt the level of danger is increasing and that means we should be able to respond to this .
but it ’ s clear on the other hand that we are not ready to enlarge the mandate , which means that we are only fulfilling a restricted role .
and we would like to see much more readiness to create better conditions - like working on public infrastructure , civil involvement and trying to give the afghani people all the instruments they need in order to create peace in the country . this week kurt beck proposed organizing a peace conference with moderate members of the taliban .
what do you think of this idea ? as we have seen in musa kala , there is a kind of paradoxical consequence to this idea .
we have to think about in what way we can pick up this idea in order to involve people living on the ground and being that kind of authority in order to create local peace from below .
that means that it would be good to try and find out in what way we can get those people on board who are ready to create a kind of peace jerga , as they call it .

nuclear energy remains controversial and germany lacks a plan for storing its high-level radioactive waste . the federal administrative court in leipzig ruled tuesday that a plan to store atomic waste in an abandoned iron ore mine could go ahead .
work will begin as soon as possible , although it will likely take a number of years before atomic waste is transferred to the site . heinrich sander , lower saxony 's environment minister and a member of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- welcomed tuesday 's ruling , which comes after decades of legal challenges . " there 's finally legal certainty and clarity , " he said . germany 's federal government signalled it plans to go ahead with the storage project . " there 's no other alternative than to implement the decision , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel of the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . phasing out nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to close its nuclear power plants the underground site will hold up to 303,000 cubic meters of atomic waste .
communities and farmers near the site fought for years to stop the project , questioning the long-term safety of the storage facility and fearful of a possible terrorist attack .
the court dismissed those claims . at present , germany plans to phase out its use of nuclear power .
the previous coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder agreed to shut down all power plants by 2020 . but current chancellor angela merkel of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has questioned the phase-out plans .
she recently challenged opponents of nuclear energy in germany to come up with realistic solutions to the country 's energy needs while paying heed to environmental issues . " i 'm saying that those who want both the nuclear phase-out and climate protection are now , naturally , called upon to provide answers , " merkel said in an interview with german radio in january . current storage problems yet regardless of the future of nuclear energy , germany still has to find solutions for storing the high-level radioactive waste which already exists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are regular protests at the gorleben nuclear storage facility in germany in 2005 , an atomic waste storage facility near the city of hanau was closed .
since then , most toxic waste continues to be sent to a " temporary " storage facility in the eastern german town of gorleben . it will take five to six years after the decision for atomic waste to be transferred to the storage area , according to an article in the daily braunschweiger zeitung on wednesday .
the ruling did not change the debate over using gorleben as a storage place for highly radioactive atomic waste .
the gorleben site has not been proven to be safe in the long term , according to the newspaper . the german atomic council welcomed the ruling and asked the government to comply with its responsibility to prepare the storage place . dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel asks for realistic alternatives to nuclear energy german chancellor angela merkel asked the opponents of nuclear energy in germany to come up with realistic solutions to the country 's energy needs while paying heed to environmental issues .

" this is about the suggestion of the museum that there should be at least one reference to poland 's territorial status before and after the september 17 , 1939 , " he said . credibility question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photo of young survivors taken by red army soldiers " as is well known , a large part of the population of the eastern regions came under soviet rule .
that has to be taken into account if you want to remain credible to visitors to auschwitz , " mensfeld added . the russian part of the museum was closed three years ago for renovation and was originally meant to reopen in 2005 . several other countries have their own exhibition spaces in the former barracks of auschwitz that reflect the fate of their citizens at the hands of the nazis .
the belgian , czech , dutch , french , hungarian and slovak spaces have all been revamped in recent years . the decision to delay the opening of the russian block has sparked a political row that is stirring up deep-seated resentments between moscow and warsaw . technically correct while technically the description of victims from the annexed countries as soviet citizens is correct , the museum says they can not be regarded as such because they did not voluntarily renounce their original nationalities and freely assume soviet citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the anniversary of the liberation by soviet soldiers is commemorated each year russia stands accused of continuing to propagate a version of history that portrays the soviet union as a liberator and papers over its role as an aggressor . international auschwitz-birkenau council president wladyslaw bartoszewski said he ruled out the existence in poland of an exhibition that misrepresented history based on the criteria of the stalinist era . hitler-stalin pact the council president , who was himself a prisoner at the camp , is a famous resistance leader who took part in the 1944 warsaw uprising against the nazis and later went on to serve as a polish foreign minister after the end of communist rule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors are also getting embroiled in the dispute between the two nations " if they want to desecrate their own graves then so be it .
but we poles will not allow us to be misused in the framework of the hitler-stalin doctrine for the annexation of half of poland in 1939 or allow the jews and poles who died there to be declared soviet citizens , " said bartoszewski . " we protested against displays like that in the final inspection .
they wanted to talk to us straightaway about the matter back in 2005 , but they have still failed to do so , " he added . outrageous provocation moscow has responded angrily .
the russian daily kommersant this week quoted russian officials as saying poland was deliberately blocking the opening for political reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz was the largest nazi concentration camp konstantin kossatchov , the chairman of the foreign committee of the russian parliament , has accused poland of rewriting history . " an extraordinarily outrageous provocation is taking place right before our very eyes .
they are trying to describe history from today 's standpoint and in accordance with the interests of poland today , " he said .

" i can confirm that we are talking with some of the potential partners who have shown a clear interest , " daimlerchrysler chief executive dieter zetsche said in a speech prepared for delivery at the car maker 's annual shareholder meeting on wednesday in berlin . the prospect of daimlerchrysler jettisoning its detriot-based unit comes nine years after what is now the world 's fifth bigger carmaker was formed through a $ 36-billion -lrb- about 27 billion euros -rrb- merger of daimler and chrysler . shedding chrysler would also essentially take daimlerchrysler back to where it was in 1998 when its former chief jürgen schrempp launched his vision to transform the stuttgart-based company and maker of mercedes benz luxury cars into a welt ag or world inc .
but what schrempp hailed as " a marriage made in heaven " now looks like ending on the rocks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrylser boss dieter zetsche say he 's keeping all his options open the daimlerchrysler share price has largely fallen , resulting in growing stockholder anger that the group 's global expansion has not produced results . however , since the start of the year , the share price has climbed by more than 30 per cent on speculation that daimlerchrysler was now prepared to sell off its chrysler arm . " splitting off chrysler appears to us as appropriate , ' unio investment funds manager ingo speich told german business daily handelsblatt , reflecting the views of many other fund management groups attending wednesday 's shareholders ' meeting . no details as yet zetsche however said tuesday that he would not go into any detail about a possible sale of chrysler . " it is also true that we need to keep all options open and that i can not disclose any details because we need to have the maximum scope for maneuver , " zetsche said . management needed " the greatest possible flexibility so that we can identify and implement the best possible solution , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler is suffering from poor demand and high fuel prices speculation has been rife that chrysler would be put up for sale after it turned in an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros last year , despite repeated restructuring over recent years .
chrysler is suffering from high fuel prices and a consumer shift away from lucrative gasoline-guzzling trucks and large sports utility vehicles . in mid-february , daimlerchrysler unveiled plans to slash thousands more jobs and close two more plants at its loss-making us subsidiary in what observers believed could be a last-ditch attempt to turn the unit around . not too many takers the main aim was to steer chrysler back to profit , zetsche said . " this means , that after reviewing all options , we will finally decide for the option that best meets our criteria , " the ceo said .
" so far , i am satisfied with the process .
everything is going to plan . " a number of big institutional shareholders , such as union investment and seb , appear to be losing patience and want chrysler to put on the block as quickly as possible .
none of the other world 's leading car makers appear to be interested in chrysler , however .
us daily detroit news reported that only three candidates had submitted a firm offer by last week , private equity firms cerberus and blackstone , and canadian car parts maker magna , which is also likely to team up with an investment fund .
the newspaper said daimlerchrysler was aiming to start exclusive talks with a potential buyer by the end of this month , and hoped to raise around eight billion dollars -lrb- six billion euros -rrb- from the sale . outgoing boss says chrysler could stay on meanwhile , daimlerchrysler 's outgoing supervisory board chief hilmar kopper said in a newspaper interview wednesday that he could imagine chrysler remaining within the group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilmar kopper says daimlerchrysler may not need to shed chrysler right away " there is of course a chance that chrysler is still in the group in two years , " kopper told daily die welt . kopper , who was scheduled to retire as supervisory board chief at the agm on wednesday , defended the decision to merge daimler and chrysler in 1998 . " many of the arguments in favor of a merger back then are still valid today , " he said . and kopper rejected suggestions that the tie-up had destroyed value . " we created value for the shareholders .
we were better than half of the dax companies if you include the dividends , " he said . there was never any cross-subsidizing between chrysler and the group 's up-market mercedes-benz brand , kopper insisted . sales dropped in 2007 the beginning of the year has not been good for the car company . daimlerchrysler announced that first-quarter sales have fallen 2.8 percent from the same time period last year .
the company sold 286,800 mercedes-benz , maybach and smart-branded vehicles worldwide in the first three months of the year . sales dragged in germany and western europe , while in the us sales increased by 9.2 percent compared with a year ago .
sales also rose in asia .

" i can confirm that we are talking with some of the potential partners who have shown a clear interest , " daimlerchrysler chief executive dieter zetsche said in a speech prepared for delivery at the car maker 's annual shareholder meeting on wednesday in berlin . the prospect of daimlerchrysler jettisoning its detriot-based unit comes nine years after what is now the world 's fifth bigger carmaker was formed through a $ 36-billion -lrb- about 27 billion euros -rrb- merger of daimler and chrysler . shedding chrysler would also essentially take daimlerchrysler back to where it was in 1998 when its former chief jürgen schrempp launched his vision to transform the stuttgart-based company and maker of mercedes benz luxury cars into a welt ag or world inc .
but what schrempp hailed as " a marriage made in heaven " now looks like ending on the rocks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrylser boss dieter zetsche say he 's keeping all his options open the daimlerchrysler share price has largely fallen , resulting in growing stockholder anger that the group 's global expansion has not produced results . however , since the start of the year , the share price has climbed by more than 30 per cent on speculation that daimlerchrysler was now prepared to sell off its chrysler arm . " splitting off chrysler appears to us as appropriate , ' unio investment funds manager ingo speich told german business daily handelsblatt , reflecting the views of many other fund management groups attending wednesday 's shareholders ' meeting . no details as yet zetsche however said tuesday that he would not go into any detail about a possible sale of chrysler . " it is also true that we need to keep all options open and that i can not disclose any details because we need to have the maximum scope for maneuver , " zetsche said . management needed " the greatest possible flexibility so that we can identify and implement the best possible solution , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler is suffering from poor demand and high fuel prices speculation has been rife that chrysler would be put up for sale after it turned in an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros last year , despite repeated restructuring over recent years .
chrysler is suffering from high fuel prices and a consumer shift away from lucrative gasoline-guzzling trucks and large sports utility vehicles . in mid-february , daimlerchrysler unveiled plans to slash thousands more jobs and close two more plants at its loss-making us subsidiary in what observers believed could be a last-ditch attempt to turn the unit around . not too many takers the main aim was to steer chrysler back to profit , zetsche said . " this means , that after reviewing all options , we will finally decide for the option that best meets our criteria , " the ceo said .
" so far , i am satisfied with the process .
everything is going to plan . " a number of big institutional shareholders , such as union investment and seb , appear to be losing patience and want chrysler to put on the block as quickly as possible .
none of the other world 's leading car makers appear to be interested in chrysler , however .
us daily detroit news reported that only three candidates had submitted a firm offer by last week , private equity firms cerberus and blackstone , and canadian car parts maker magna , which is also likely to team up with an investment fund .
the newspaper said daimlerchrysler was aiming to start exclusive talks with a potential buyer by the end of this month , and hoped to raise around eight billion dollars -lrb- six billion euros -rrb- from the sale . outgoing boss says chrysler could stay on meanwhile , daimlerchrysler 's outgoing supervisory board chief hilmar kopper said in a newspaper interview wednesday that he could imagine chrysler remaining within the group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilmar kopper says daimlerchrysler may not need to shed chrysler right away " there is of course a chance that chrysler is still in the group in two years , " kopper told daily die welt . kopper , who was scheduled to retire as supervisory board chief at the agm on wednesday , defended the decision to merge daimler and chrysler in 1998 . " many of the arguments in favor of a merger back then are still valid today , " he said . and kopper rejected suggestions that the tie-up had destroyed value . " we created value for the shareholders .
we were better than half of the dax companies if you include the dividends , " he said . there was never any cross-subsidizing between chrysler and the group 's up-market mercedes-benz brand , kopper insisted . sales dropped in 2007 the beginning of the year has not been good for the car company . daimlerchrysler announced that first-quarter sales have fallen 2.8 percent from the same time period last year .
the company sold 286,800 mercedes-benz , maybach and smart-branded vehicles worldwide in the first three months of the year . sales dragged in germany and western europe , while in the us sales increased by 9.2 percent compared with a year ago .
sales also rose in asia .
the company 's smart brand sales fell more than 57 percent , a drop the company said was caused by a model changeover . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers rev up effort to enter hybrid market amid increasing consumer awareness of global warming and other environmental issues , german carmakers have had to fight off growing criticism about their apparent lack of will to build environmentally friendly cars .

terrorism experts said the video shows that the kidnappers want to grab attention and money . the video shows a german woman hostage and her son pleading for help as their iraqi kidnappers threatened to execute them unless berlin withdraws its troops from afghanistan . hannelore krause , 61 , and her 20-year-old son sinan were sobbing and visibly distraught in the video picked up by the us-based site institute which monitors islamist websites . their captors extended by 10 days the deadline for germany to withdraw its troops from afghanistan or see the hostages executed , although the exact date of the new deadline was not immediately clear . " it is really very difficult to watch how these people are humiliated on video , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told a press briefing . he said ministry staff had studied the video overnight .
" many of us did not sleep much last night .
we will be meeting with the ministry 's crisis team this afternoon to give our interpretation of the video and try to draw final conclusions about it , " jäger said . hostage negotiators continue work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier briefs the media on the hostage situation germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called the video " shocking and inhumane " adding that " all hope had not been lost " thanks to the crisis team which he said was working on winning the release of the pair . krause , who is married to an iraqi doctor , and her son were seized on february 6 in baghdad where they have lived for several years . " i beg you , help me ...
i 'm so afraid and we only have a few days left , " krause said in the video , crying as she and her son sat in front of a green wall rug in the video that site said was posted on the al-hesbah internet forum . " i 'm completely at the end of my rope .
i 'm a complete mess , " said krause , wearing a headscarf and black robes . apparently addressing her husband , krause said : " you know that i would so much love to come home .
i miss you so much .
please find some way -lrb- to help -rrb- . " site said the five-minute and 27-second video was produced by an iraqi group called " kataeb siham al-haq -lrb- righteous arrows battalions -rrb- " that had threatened on march 10 to kill the germans . the group is seeking the withdrawal of german and austrian forces from afghanistan .
site said the video extended the ultimatum for the withdrawal by 10 days . germany has nearly 3,000 troops in afghanistan serving with the nato-led force and austria has a token contingent of around five officers . krause warned in the video that a failure to comply with her captors ' demands would have consequences for both countries and her and her son . a first deadline for the pair 's execution came and went on march 20 with the german government unable to contact the kidnappers , german television reported at the time . berlin has made several appeals for the hostages ' release including a message from german president horst köhler , contained in a video distributed in germany and the arab world , urging the kidnappers " to return the hostages to their family . " chancellor angela merkel warned after meeting afghan president hamid karzai last month that germany would not be blackmailed into withdrawing its troops from afghanistan . previous german hostages in iraq have been released unharmed . kidnappers want attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has sent tornado planes to afghanistan terrorism expert rolf tophoven said the new video is a way to pressure the german government to give into demands . " the goal of the hostage-takers is clearly to increase pressure on the federal government , " tophoven said . the video was made at the same time german tornado fighter jets are being sent to afghanistan .
this shows that the kidnappers are informed about politics and are using it to their advantage , tophoven said . " the timing is striking , " he said . " the kidnappers know the political situation in germany .
they also know that the government is n't able to be blackmailed , " tophoven said .

terrorism experts said the video shows that the kidnappers want to grab attention and money . the video shows a german woman hostage and her son pleading for help as their iraqi kidnappers threatened to execute them unless berlin withdraws its troops from afghanistan . hannelore krause , 61 , and her 20-year-old son sinan were sobbing and visibly distraught in the video picked up by the us-based site institute which monitors islamist websites . their captors extended by 10 days the deadline for germany to withdraw its troops from afghanistan or see the hostages executed , although the exact date of the new deadline was not immediately clear . " it is really very difficult to watch how these people are humiliated on video , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told a press briefing . he said ministry staff had studied the video overnight .
" many of us did not sleep much last night .
we will be meeting with the ministry 's crisis team this afternoon to give our interpretation of the video and try to draw final conclusions about it , " jäger said . hostage negotiators continue work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier briefs the media on the hostage situation germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called the video " shocking and inhumane " adding that " all hope had not been lost " thanks to the crisis team which he said was working on winning the release of the pair . krause , who is married to an iraqi doctor , and her son were seized on february 6 in baghdad where they have lived for several years . " i beg you , help me ...
i 'm so afraid and we only have a few days left , " krause said in the video , crying as she and her son sat in front of a green wall rug in the video that site said was posted on the al-hesbah internet forum . " i 'm completely at the end of my rope .
i 'm a complete mess , " said krause , wearing a headscarf and black robes . apparently addressing her husband , krause said : " you know that i would so much love to come home .
i miss you so much .
please find some way -lrb- to help -rrb- . " site said the five-minute and 27-second video was produced by an iraqi group called " kataeb siham al-haq -lrb- righteous arrows battalions -rrb- " that had threatened on march 10 to kill the germans . the group is seeking the withdrawal of german and austrian forces from afghanistan .
site said the video extended the ultimatum for the withdrawal by 10 days . germany has nearly 3,000 troops in afghanistan serving with the nato-led force and austria has a token contingent of around five officers . krause warned in the video that a failure to comply with her captors ' demands would have consequences for both countries and her and her son . a first deadline for the pair 's execution came and went on march 20 with the german government unable to contact the kidnappers , german television reported at the time . berlin has made several appeals for the hostages ' release including a message from german president horst köhler , contained in a video distributed in germany and the arab world , urging the kidnappers " to return the hostages to their family . " chancellor angela merkel warned after meeting afghan president hamid karzai last month that germany would not be blackmailed into withdrawing its troops from afghanistan . previous german hostages in iraq have been released unharmed . kidnappers want attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has sent tornado planes to afghanistan terrorism expert rolf tophoven said the new video is a way to pressure the german government to give into demands . " the goal of the hostage-takers is clearly to increase pressure on the federal government , " tophoven said . the video was made at the same time german tornado fighter jets are being sent to afghanistan .
this shows that the kidnappers are informed about politics and are using it to their advantage , tophoven said . " the timing is striking , " he said . " the kidnappers know the political situation in germany .
they also know that the government is n't able to be blackmailed , " tophoven said .
the kidnappers must also realize that it 's unrealistic to demand germany pull out of afghanistan , the expert said , adding he thought it was a way for the kidnappers to up the ante , but that behind the scenes , the kidnapping is about money . terrorism expert guido steinberg agreed that the kidnappers likely want money . " i do n't really think that right now in baghdad people are actually interested about what is happening in afghanistan and that german troops are there , " steinberg said in a wednesday morning interview with the german public broadcaster ard . steinberg , a specialist on islamist terrorism , said he was not suggesting that negotiators dismiss the link to afghanistan .
kidnappers often make political demands as ways to get money . " from my point of view , this is an attempt to use public opinion here in germany to get attention and force the german government to follow the wishes of the german public , " steinberg said in the ard interview . if the kidnappers are actually trying to get money , the scare tactics will likely continue , tophoven predicted .
the new video does provide some hope for the hostages , since it shows that they have n't been killed and there is room for negotiation . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iraqi militants extend deadline on german hostages militants in iraq who siezed two germans have released a new video saying they are giving germany a new deadline to begin pulling troops out of afghanistan or the two would be killed .

the 2-all draw puts the bundesliga side in excellent position to qualify for the champions league semi-finals next week in munich . bayern had lost four straight games against ac in milan , but this time they hung tough to put a major dent in milan 's title ambitions .
playing without keeper ollie kahn and midfielder mark van bommel , both suspended , munich twice came from behind in the match . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's challenge against kaka led to milan 's disputed penalty the hosts opened the scoring in the 40th minute after bayern botched an off-side trap - alberto gilardino headed home from 7 meters .
bayern were able to equalize in the 78th minute after the ball landed at van buyten 's feet directly in front of the goal . the visitors looked to be doomed seven minutes from time , when milan converted a controversial penalty .
but bayern made the most of the remaining minutes and van buyten levelled things up just before the final whistle , getting his left foot on a cross by owen hargreaves . with neither side playing brilliantly at the moment , this is a match-up that will be decided by persistence , not genius .
that means bayern still have a lot of work to do when milan visit munich for the return leg next wednesday . liverpool on a roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steven gerrard and liverpool powered past eindhoven liverpool , on the other hand , are all but through to the semis after putting hosts psv eindhoven through the soccer equivalent of a meat-grinder in the tuesday 's other quarterfinal . captain steven gerrard opened the scoring in the 27th minute with a powerful header , and liverpool sealed the win early in the second half on goals by john arne riise and peter crouch .
eindhoven never seriously threatened to stage a comeback , and liverpool showed why the english premiership is the dominant league in europe at the moment .

terrorism experts said the video shows that the kidnappers want to grab attention and money . the video shows a german woman hostage and her son pleading for help as their iraqi kidnappers threatened to execute them unless berlin withdraws its troops from afghanistan . hannelore krause , 61 , and her 20-year-old son sinan were sobbing and visibly distraught in the video picked up by the us-based site institute which monitors islamist websites . their captors extended by 10 days the deadline for germany to withdraw its troops from afghanistan or see the hostages executed , although the exact date of the new deadline was not immediately clear . " it is really very difficult to watch how these people are humiliated on video , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger told a press briefing . he said ministry staff had studied the video overnight .
" many of us did not sleep much last night .
we will be meeting with the ministry 's crisis team this afternoon to give our interpretation of the video and try to draw final conclusions about it , " jäger said . hostage negotiators continue work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier briefs the media on the hostage situation germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called the video " shocking and inhumane " adding that " all hope had not been lost " thanks to the crisis team which he said was working on winning the release of the pair . krause , who is married to an iraqi doctor , and her son were seized on february 6 in baghdad where they have lived for several years . " i beg you , help me ...
i 'm so afraid and we only have a few days left , " krause said in the video , crying as she and her son sat in front of a green wall rug in the video that site said was posted on the al-hesbah internet forum . " i 'm completely at the end of my rope .
i 'm a complete mess , " said krause , wearing a headscarf and black robes . apparently addressing her husband , krause said : " you know that i would so much love to come home .
i miss you so much .
please find some way -lrb- to help -rrb- . " site said the five-minute and 27-second video was produced by an iraqi group called " kataeb siham al-haq -lrb- righteous arrows battalions -rrb- " that had threatened on march 10 to kill the germans . the group is seeking the withdrawal of german and austrian forces from afghanistan .
site said the video extended the ultimatum for the withdrawal by 10 days . germany has nearly 3,000 troops in afghanistan serving with the nato-led force and austria has a token contingent of around five officers . krause warned in the video that a failure to comply with her captors ' demands would have consequences for both countries and her and her son . a first deadline for the pair 's execution came and went on march 20 with the german government unable to contact the kidnappers , german television reported at the time . berlin has made several appeals for the hostages ' release including a message from german president horst köhler , contained in a video distributed in germany and the arab world , urging the kidnappers " to return the hostages to their family . " chancellor angela merkel warned after meeting afghan president hamid karzai last month that germany would not be blackmailed into withdrawing its troops from afghanistan . previous german hostages in iraq have been released unharmed . kidnappers want attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has sent tornado planes to afghanistan terrorism expert rolf tophoven said the new video is a way to pressure the german government to give into demands . " the goal of the hostage-takers is clearly to increase pressure on the federal government , " tophoven said . the video was made at the same time german tornado fighter jets are being sent to afghanistan .
this shows that the kidnappers are informed about politics and are using it to their advantage , tophoven said . " the timing is striking , " he said . " the kidnappers know the political situation in germany .
they also know that the government is n't able to be blackmailed , " tophoven said .
the kidnappers must also realize that it 's unrealistic to demand germany pull out of afghanistan , the expert said , adding he thought it was a way for the kidnappers to up the ante , but that behind the scenes , the kidnapping is about money . terrorism expert guido steinberg agreed that the kidnappers likely want money . " i do n't really think that right now in baghdad people are actually interested about what is happening in afghanistan and that german troops are there , " steinberg said in a wednesday morning interview with the german public broadcaster ard . steinberg , a specialist on islamist terrorism , said he was not suggesting that negotiators dismiss the link to afghanistan .
kidnappers often make political demands as ways to get money . " from my point of view , this is an attempt to use public opinion here in germany to get attention and force the german government to follow the wishes of the german public , " steinberg said in the ard interview . if the kidnappers are actually trying to get money , the scare tactics will likely continue , tophoven predicted .

iranian state media said the 15 had " shouted for joy " when told the news . the sailors will return home from tehran 's mehrabad airport on thursday , an aide to the president said . " they will leave tomorrow from mehrabad airport , " the aide , who declined to be named , told iranian reporters . iran seized the britons on march 23 after saying the ship they were on had trespassed into territorial waters .
britain insists the soldiers were on a routine anti-smuggling patrol in iraqi territory under a united nations mandate . ahmadinejad said britain had promised in a letter not to repeat the incident . " the blair government chose the path of media hype and sent the issue to the un security council , " ahmadinejad said .

they appeared occasionally on iranian television to offer " confessions " for trespassing and to apologize .
it is unknown whether the statements were coerced . the united kingdom froze most ties with iran after the soldiers were seized .

" if mr. bush and his government change their behaviour ... this side -lrb- iran -rrb- has the ability to reconsider " ahmadinejad said . the united states said on wednesday if iran wanted to change its relationship with washington it would first have to suspend uranium enrichment . " the behavior that needs to change is the iranians , not the united states , " state department spokesman tom casey said . ahmadinejad said there was no link between the release of the britons and five iranians held by us forces in iraq .

" this is about the suggestion of the museum that there should be at least one reference to poland 's territorial status before and after the september 17 , 1939 , " he said . credibility question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photo of young survivors taken by red army soldiers " as is well known , a large part of the population of the eastern regions came under soviet rule .
that has to be taken into account if you want to remain credible to visitors to auschwitz , " mensfeld added . the russian part of the museum was closed three years ago for renovation and was originally meant to reopen in 2005 . several other countries have their own exhibition spaces in the former barracks of auschwitz that reflect the fate of their citizens at the hands of the nazis .
the belgian , czech , dutch , french , hungarian and slovak spaces have all been revamped in recent years . the decision to delay the opening of the russian block has sparked a political row that is stirring up deep-seated resentments between moscow and warsaw . technically correct while technically the description of victims from the annexed countries as soviet citizens is correct , the museum says they can not be regarded as such because they did not voluntarily renounce their original nationalities and freely assume soviet citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the anniversary of the liberation by soviet soldiers is commemorated each year russia stands accused of continuing to propagate a version of history that portrays the soviet union as a liberator and papers over its role as an aggressor . international auschwitz-birkenau council president wladyslaw bartoszewski said he ruled out the existence in poland of an exhibition that misrepresented history based on the criteria of the stalinist era . hitler-stalin pact the council president , who was himself a prisoner at the camp , is a famous resistance leader who took part in the 1944 warsaw uprising against the nazis and later went on to serve as a polish foreign minister after the end of communist rule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors are also getting embroiled in the dispute between the two nations " if they want to desecrate their own graves then so be it .
but we poles will not allow us to be misused in the framework of the hitler-stalin doctrine for the annexation of half of poland in 1939 or allow the jews and poles who died there to be declared soviet citizens , " said bartoszewski . " we protested against displays like that in the final inspection .
they wanted to talk to us straightaway about the matter back in 2005 , but they have still failed to do so , " he added . outrageous provocation moscow has responded angrily .
the russian daily kommersant this week quoted russian officials as saying poland was deliberately blocking the opening for political reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz was the largest nazi concentration camp konstantin kossatchov , the chairman of the foreign committee of the russian parliament , has accused poland of rewriting history .

but the bloc also said it considers the standoff a domestic issue that does n't warrant outside involvement . the eu 's statement came a day after ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said he was dissolving parliament and calling fresh elections in may .
the parliament , which is dominated by yushchenko 's rival , viktor yanukovych , rejected that announcement , saying it amounted to an attempted coup d 'etat . crisis talks tuesday between yushchenko and prime minister viktor yanukovych failed to yield a compromise between the two rivals , even after ukraine 's government and parliament voted to defy the president 's orders . the presidential office said in a statement that yushchenko had informed the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana of his intention to hold snap elections . but yanukovych , who favours ties with russia , said pro-western yushchenko had made " a fatal mistake " in issuing the order dissolving parliament after months of political impasse .
hundreds of anti-yushchenko activists meanwhile camped out overnight in central kiev to protest against the president and vowed to hold a mass protest on wednesday .
" no to the division of ukraine ! " and " the constitution is the law for everyone ! " read placards posted up by the activists outside more than 200 tents set up near the parliament building and on independence square . eu has no plans to intervene the german eu presidency expressed concern about the situation in ukraine .
in a written statement , the german foreign ministry called upon the two sides in the conflict " to settle their current differences on domestic policy in a manner which complies with the constitution and domestic rules . " but the eu does not plan to intervene .
" we do not consider the situation at the moment to need influence from outside , " european commission spokeswoman christiane hohmann said .
" we think it 's a domestic affair that needs to be sorted out in ukraine itself . " adherents of both the pro-western yushchenko and the more russia-oriented yanukovych continue to stage protests in the ukrainian capital kiev . unwieldy partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych , left , and yushchenko have not been able to work together yushchenko was swept to power in january 2005 after a bitterly contested election against yanukovych and waves of popular street demonstrations that became known as the orange revolution .
but he was forced to accept his rival as prime minister after he and his allies failed to secure a parliamentary majority in a national election in 2006 . yushchenko accuses yanukovych of trying to encourage individual parliamentary deputies to switch allegiances , something he says is forbidden under ukraine 's constitution .
but critics of yushchenko say he himself refuses to accept limitations on the power of the ukrainian presidency put in place in 2005 . the two men have clashed repeatedly since yanukovych became prime minister , and it is unclear whether a new election would do anything to end the impasse . political chaos in ukraine would be a major worry for the eu since it is one of the largest countries in eastern europe and one that is home to pipelines supplying western europe with russian gas . the eu presidency was careful to point out on tuesday that it hoped negotiations for closer ties between the eu and ukraine would not be affected by the current political stalemate . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nationalists , russia find ukraine 's eurovision song quite a drag ukraine 's eurovision song contest entry is causing friction at home and abroad .

" my father told me in november before he died that he wanted to become a diamond .
his intentions should prevail , " the daughter said . her grandmother , 86 , disagreed , and sought an injunction to stop the cemetery releasing the funerary urn to a swiss diamond laboratory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a grave is more traditional - but you ca n't wear it round your neck the technique for turning the dead 's ashes into " memorial " diamonds originated in the united states but the practice is becoming popular in parts of europe . the ashes are placed in a press under intense pressure and heat , replicating the forces that create a natural diamond , over a period of several months .
synthetic diamonds have been manufactured from carbon since the mid-1950s .
the process costs around $ 17,000 . diamonds not the court 's best friend the court said the daughter 's views on the care of the remains took precedence over the wishes of the dead man 's mother but ruled that any decision had to be in accordance with the expressed wishes of the deceased .
testimony from the man 's brother-in-law who visited a family grave with him shortly before his death from cancer last year indicated he did not wish to be turned into a diamond . the deceased allegedly remarked that he too would soon be buried there , casting doubt on his daughter 's claim . judges said that in the absence of written instructions , they preferred to believe the man 's preferences were conventional . wishes went with him to the grave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this stone was made from the ashes of a pet dog " with such an exotic form of interment , and one that is illegal in germany , there is an onus to prove that the deceased really wanted this , " the court said in its judgement . the ashes remain in the custody of the court until the conclusion of all legal action .

nuclear energy remains controversial and germany lacks a plan for storing its high-level radioactive waste . the federal administrative court in leipzig ruled tuesday that a plan to store atomic waste in an abandoned iron ore mine could go ahead .
work will begin as soon as possible , although it will likely take a number of years before atomic waste is transferred to the site . heinrich sander , lower saxony 's environment minister and a member of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- welcomed tuesday 's ruling , which comes after decades of legal challenges . " there 's finally legal certainty and clarity , " he said . germany 's federal government signalled it plans to go ahead with the storage project . " there 's no other alternative than to implement the decision , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel of the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . phasing out nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to close its nuclear power plants the underground site will hold up to 303,000 cubic meters of atomic waste .
communities and farmers near the site fought for years to stop the project , questioning the long-term safety of the storage facility and fearful of a possible terrorist attack .
the court dismissed those claims . at present , germany plans to phase out its use of nuclear power .
the previous coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder agreed to shut down all power plants by 2020 . but current chancellor angela merkel of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has questioned the phase-out plans .
she recently challenged opponents of nuclear energy in germany to come up with realistic solutions to the country 's energy needs while paying heed to environmental issues . " i 'm saying that those who want both the nuclear phase-out and climate protection are now , naturally , called upon to provide answers , " merkel said in an interview with german radio in january . current storage problems yet regardless of the future of nuclear energy , germany still has to find solutions for storing the high-level radioactive waste which already exists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are regular protests at the gorleben nuclear storage facility in germany in 2005 , an atomic waste storage facility near the city of hanau was closed .
since then , most toxic waste continues to be sent to a " temporary " storage facility in the eastern german town of gorleben . it will take five to six years after the decision for atomic waste to be transferred to the storage area , according to an article in the daily braunschweiger zeitung on wednesday .
the ruling did not change the debate over using gorleben as a storage place for highly radioactive atomic waste .
the gorleben site has not been proven to be safe in the long term , according to the newspaper . the german atomic council welcomed the ruling and asked the government to comply with its responsibility to prepare the storage place . dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel asks for realistic alternatives to nuclear energy german chancellor angela merkel asked the opponents of nuclear energy in germany to come up with realistic solutions to the country 's energy needs while paying heed to environmental issues .

but the bloc also said it considers the standoff a domestic issue that does n't warrant outside involvement . the eu 's statement came a day after ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said he was dissolving parliament and calling fresh elections in may .
the parliament , which is dominated by yushchenko 's rival , viktor yanukovych , rejected that announcement , saying it amounted to an attempted coup d 'etat . crisis talks tuesday between yushchenko and prime minister viktor yanukovych failed to yield a compromise between the two rivals , even after ukraine 's government and parliament voted to defy the president 's orders . the presidential office said in a statement that yushchenko had informed the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana of his intention to hold snap elections . but yanukovych , who favours ties with russia , said pro-western yushchenko had made " a fatal mistake " in issuing the order dissolving parliament after months of political impasse .
hundreds of anti-yushchenko activists meanwhile camped out overnight in central kiev to protest against the president and vowed to hold a mass protest on wednesday .
" no to the division of ukraine ! " and " the constitution is the law for everyone ! " read placards posted up by the activists outside more than 200 tents set up near the parliament building and on independence square . eu has no plans to intervene the german eu presidency expressed concern about the situation in ukraine .
in a written statement , the german foreign ministry called upon the two sides in the conflict " to settle their current differences on domestic policy in a manner which complies with the constitution and domestic rules . " but the eu does not plan to intervene .
" we do not consider the situation at the moment to need influence from outside , " european commission spokeswoman christiane hohmann said .
" we think it 's a domestic affair that needs to be sorted out in ukraine itself . " adherents of both the pro-western yushchenko and the more russia-oriented yanukovych continue to stage protests in the ukrainian capital kiev . unwieldy partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych , left , and yushchenko have not been able to work together yushchenko was swept to power in january 2005 after a bitterly contested election against yanukovych and waves of popular street demonstrations that became known as the orange revolution .
but he was forced to accept his rival as prime minister after he and his allies failed to secure a parliamentary majority in a national election in 2006 . yushchenko accuses yanukovych of trying to encourage individual parliamentary deputies to switch allegiances , something he says is forbidden under ukraine 's constitution .
but critics of yushchenko say he himself refuses to accept limitations on the power of the ukrainian presidency put in place in 2005 . the two men have clashed repeatedly since yanukovych became prime minister , and it is unclear whether a new election would do anything to end the impasse . political chaos in ukraine would be a major worry for the eu since it is one of the largest countries in eastern europe and one that is home to pipelines supplying western europe with russian gas . the eu presidency was careful to point out on tuesday that it hoped negotiations for closer ties between the eu and ukraine would not be affected by the current political stalemate . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nationalists , russia find ukraine 's eurovision song quite a drag ukraine 's eurovision song contest entry is causing friction at home and abroad .

nuclear energy remains controversial and germany lacks a plan for storing its high-level radioactive waste . the federal administrative court in leipzig ruled tuesday that a plan to store atomic waste in an abandoned iron ore mine could go ahead .
work will begin as soon as possible , although it will likely take a number of years before atomic waste is transferred to the site . heinrich sander , lower saxony 's environment minister and a member of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- welcomed tuesday 's ruling , which comes after decades of legal challenges . " there 's finally legal certainty and clarity , " he said . germany 's federal government signalled it plans to go ahead with the storage project . " there 's no other alternative than to implement the decision , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel of the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . phasing out nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to close its nuclear power plants the underground site will hold up to 303,000 cubic meters of atomic waste .
communities and farmers near the site fought for years to stop the project , questioning the long-term safety of the storage facility and fearful of a possible terrorist attack .
the court dismissed those claims . at present , germany plans to phase out its use of nuclear power .
the previous coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder agreed to shut down all power plants by 2020 . but current chancellor angela merkel of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has questioned the phase-out plans .
she recently challenged opponents of nuclear energy in germany to come up with realistic solutions to the country 's energy needs while paying heed to environmental issues . " i 'm saying that those who want both the nuclear phase-out and climate protection are now , naturally , called upon to provide answers , " merkel said in an interview with german radio in january . current storage problems yet regardless of the future of nuclear energy , germany still has to find solutions for storing the high-level radioactive waste which already exists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are regular protests at the gorleben nuclear storage facility in germany in 2005 , an atomic waste storage facility near the city of hanau was closed .
since then , most toxic waste continues to be sent to a " temporary " storage facility in the eastern german town of gorleben . it will take five to six years after the decision for atomic waste to be transferred to the storage area , according to an article in the daily braunschweiger zeitung on wednesday .
the ruling did not change the debate over using gorleben as a storage place for highly radioactive atomic waste .
the gorleben site has not been proven to be safe in the long term , according to the newspaper . the german atomic council welcomed the ruling and asked the government to comply with its responsibility to prepare the storage place . dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel asks for realistic alternatives to nuclear energy german chancellor angela merkel asked the opponents of nuclear energy in germany to come up with realistic solutions to the country 's energy needs while paying heed to environmental issues .

but will serbia , which considers kosovo as its territory , accept the idea ? the plan - which was drawn up by un special envoy martti ahtisaari of finland - would go a long way toward granting kosovo 's majority ethnic albanian populace independence form serbia while retaining international supervision over the province . at the same time , it would also allow serbian dominated municipalities to govern themselves in many respects and maintain existing ties to belgrade .
the goal is to create a multi-ethnic , democratic state under the rule of law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo was devasted by the 1998-1999 war and sporadic violence continues ahead of the closed-door debates in the security council , ahtisaari 's blueprint was endorsed by kosovo 's current president , fatmir sejdiu , and by the us and the eu , who see it as the only viable way to solve the problem of kosovo 's long-term status . kosovo has been under un control since 1999 when nato military forces intervened to stop a brutal serbian crackdown on the ethnic albanian independence movement in the province . russian scepticism any decision by the security council would be binding .
but russia , which has the power of veto on the council , has criticized the plan , saying any decisions on kosovo 's status must be accepted by all sides of the conflict . belgrade has flatly rejected ahtisaari 's blueprint , insisting that kosovo remain part of serbia and calling for fresh negotiations under a new un-appointed arbitrator . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un special envoy martti ahtisaari expects protracted negotiations britain 's un ambassador emyr jones parry - currently the security council president - said there was considerable support for the plan .

" my father told me in november before he died that he wanted to become a diamond .
his intentions should prevail , " the daughter said . her grandmother , 86 , disagreed , and sought an injunction to stop the cemetery releasing the funerary urn to a swiss diamond laboratory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a grave is more traditional - but you ca n't wear it round your neck the technique for turning the dead 's ashes into " memorial " diamonds originated in the united states but the practice is becoming popular in parts of europe . the ashes are placed in a press under intense pressure and heat , replicating the forces that create a natural diamond , over a period of several months .
synthetic diamonds have been manufactured from carbon since the mid-1950s .
the process costs around $ 17,000 . diamonds not the court 's best friend the court said the daughter 's views on the care of the remains took precedence over the wishes of the dead man 's mother but ruled that any decision had to be in accordance with the expressed wishes of the deceased .
testimony from the man 's brother-in-law who visited a family grave with him shortly before his death from cancer last year indicated he did not wish to be turned into a diamond . the deceased allegedly remarked that he too would soon be buried there , casting doubt on his daughter 's claim . judges said that in the absence of written instructions , they preferred to believe the man 's preferences were conventional . wishes went with him to the grave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this stone was made from the ashes of a pet dog " with such an exotic form of interment , and one that is illegal in germany , there is an onus to prove that the deceased really wanted this , " the court said in its judgement . the ashes remain in the custody of the court until the conclusion of all legal action .

chelsea drew 1-1 against valencia while man u lost in rome .
meanwhile , bayern munich relishes their draw in milan . supporters of english soccer were hoping that liverpool 's demolition of eindhoven on tuesday would set the tone for fellow premiership sides chelsea and manchester united .
but after wednesday evening , the current top two clubs in english soccer find themselves in a pinch .
chelsea managed only a 1-1 draw at home against valencia .
the spaniards played better soccer for most of the first half as valencia parried the uncoordinated attacks of the english champs .
at the half-hour mark , david silva let loose a sharp shot from some 20 meters out that was unstoppable for chelsea keeper petr cech - valenica led 1-0 .
after the interval , chelsea stormed out of the locker room and quickly took control of the game .
in the 53rd minute , the blues ' top scorer , didier drogba , headed home the equalizer .
chelsea , however , retained the pressure for the remainder of the match but valencia showed little weakness in gaining the draw .
with the home result , chelsea leave themselves in a precarious position for next week 's second leg tie in valencia .
man u drop match at roma in rome , premiership leader manchester united fell to roma 2-1 .
manu coach sir alex ferguson should be satisfied with the result considering his team played for almost one hour with 10 men after german referee herbert fendel sent off paul scholes .
roma took advantage of the red card and one minute before halftime , their brazilian midfielder taddei scored from 11 metres out with some help from two manchester defenders who deflected the ball into their own net .
the one-sided nature of this contest was obvious as roma launched 26 total shots .
manchester waited for counter-attacks , and that 's how they scored when wayne rooney equalized at the hour mark .
six minutes later , though , mirko vucinic slotted home the ball after manu keeper edwin van der sar was unable to stop a shot .
manchester got the desired one goal that coach ferguson demanded but will nevertheless have a tough task next week at old trafford .
the match was marred by fighting between supporters from both teams before and during the contest .
italian media reported that five people were injured in the clashes .
bayern still basking after milan draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's daniel van buyten : one dangerous left foot in germany , the talk of the day was bayern munich 's 2-2 draw at milan .
the man of the match was most certainly bayern 's two-goal scoring defender daniel van buyten who has been oft maligned of late .
bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld was equally pleased with his side 's performance , specifically with that of the oft maligned defender .
and if the munich strikers by any means reach van buyten 's form , a place in the semi-finals against either roma or manchester united should be a done deal . john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

this is not only a paradox , but also a crime in itself . bildunterschrift : gert weisskirchen has been a member of the bundestag since 1976 how seriously should it be taken ? very seriously .
it ’ s really dangerous .
it shows that these people are ready to kill . how do you think the german government will respond to the ultimatum ? first of all , it ’ s clear that the government is trying to save the lives of these innocent people , but we are not ready to fulfil their claims . the tornado reconnaissance jets will arrive in northern afghanistan tomorrow .
the german government has maintained that its involvement in afghanistan is strictly a peacekeeping mission .
in light of the tornado mission and now the hostage-taking , do you think that germany will be able to stay out of danger or is it being drawn into more than it bargained for ? the point is that we are ready to give what we can , for instance to save the people of afghanistan , and we are ready to fulfill what they need , but we are working within a very restrictive mandate .
that means that the parliament is eagerly monitoring what is happening on the ground and we are not ready to enlarge the mandate militarily . how do you see the future of germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan ?
will it become more dangerous for german troops ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tornado reconnaissance jets arrive thursday in northern afghanistan no doubt the level of danger is increasing and that means we should be able to respond to this .
but it ’ s clear on the other hand that we are not ready to enlarge the mandate , which means that we are only fulfilling a restricted role .
and we would like to see much more readiness to create better conditions - like working on public infrastructure , civil involvement and trying to give the afghani people all the instruments they need in order to create peace in the country . this week kurt beck proposed organizing a peace conference with moderate members of the taliban .
what do you think of this idea ? as we have seen in musa kala , there is a kind of paradoxical consequence to this idea .
we have to think about in what way we can pick up this idea in order to involve people living on the ground and being that kind of authority in order to create local peace from below .
that means that it would be good to try and find out in what way we can get those people on board who are ready to create a kind of peace jerga , as they call it .

london welcomed the news , but tensions between the countries remain strong . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad was shown on state television chatting with british sailors wednesday .
the president said they would be released immediately .

britain insists the soldiers were on a routine anti-smuggling patrol in iraqi territory under a united nations mandate . ahmadinejad said britain had promised in a letter not to repeat the incident . " the blair government chose the path of media hype and sent the issue to the un security council , " ahmadinejad said .

nuclear energy remains controversial and germany lacks a plan for storing its high-level radioactive waste . the federal administrative court in leipzig ruled tuesday that a plan to store atomic waste in an abandoned iron ore mine could go ahead .
work will begin as soon as possible , although it will likely take a number of years before atomic waste is transferred to the site . heinrich sander , lower saxony 's environment minister and a member of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- welcomed tuesday 's ruling , which comes after decades of legal challenges . " there 's finally legal certainty and clarity , " he said . germany 's federal government signalled it plans to go ahead with the storage project . " there 's no other alternative than to implement the decision , " said environment minister sigmar gabriel of the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . phasing out nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to close its nuclear power plants the underground site will hold up to 303,000 cubic meters of atomic waste .
communities and farmers near the site fought for years to stop the project , questioning the long-term safety of the storage facility and fearful of a possible terrorist attack .
the court dismissed those claims . at present , germany plans to phase out its use of nuclear power .
the previous coalition of socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder agreed to shut down all power plants by 2020 . but current chancellor angela merkel of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has questioned the phase-out plans .
she recently challenged opponents of nuclear energy in germany to come up with realistic solutions to the country 's energy needs while paying heed to environmental issues . " i 'm saying that those who want both the nuclear phase-out and climate protection are now , naturally , called upon to provide answers , " merkel said in an interview with german radio in january . current storage problems yet regardless of the future of nuclear energy , germany still has to find solutions for storing the high-level radioactive waste which already exists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are regular protests at the gorleben nuclear storage facility in germany in 2005 , an atomic waste storage facility near the city of hanau was closed .
since then , most toxic waste continues to be sent to a " temporary " storage facility in the eastern german town of gorleben . it will take five to six years after the decision for atomic waste to be transferred to the storage area , according to an article in the daily braunschweiger zeitung on wednesday .
the ruling did not change the debate over using gorleben as a storage place for highly radioactive atomic waste .
the gorleben site has not been proven to be safe in the long term , according to the newspaper . the german atomic council welcomed the ruling and asked the government to comply with its responsibility to prepare the storage place . dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel asks for realistic alternatives to nuclear energy german chancellor angela merkel asked the opponents of nuclear energy in germany to come up with realistic solutions to the country 's energy needs while paying heed to environmental issues .

" my father told me in november before he died that he wanted to become a diamond .
his intentions should prevail , " the daughter said . her grandmother , 86 , disagreed , and sought an injunction to stop the cemetery releasing the funerary urn to a swiss diamond laboratory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a grave is more traditional - but you ca n't wear it round your neck the technique for turning the dead 's ashes into " memorial " diamonds originated in the united states but the practice is becoming popular in parts of europe . the ashes are placed in a press under intense pressure and heat , replicating the forces that create a natural diamond , over a period of several months .
synthetic diamonds have been manufactured from carbon since the mid-1950s .
the process costs around $ 17,000 . diamonds not the court 's best friend the court said the daughter 's views on the care of the remains took precedence over the wishes of the dead man 's mother but ruled that any decision had to be in accordance with the expressed wishes of the deceased .
testimony from the man 's brother-in-law who visited a family grave with him shortly before his death from cancer last year indicated he did not wish to be turned into a diamond . the deceased allegedly remarked that he too would soon be buried there , casting doubt on his daughter 's claim . judges said that in the absence of written instructions , they preferred to believe the man 's preferences were conventional . wishes went with him to the grave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this stone was made from the ashes of a pet dog " with such an exotic form of interment , and one that is illegal in germany , there is an onus to prove that the deceased really wanted this , " the court said in its judgement . the ashes remain in the custody of the court until the conclusion of all legal action .
the two women have refused to negotiate and the daughter may make an appeal . citizens in other countries face no such restrictions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.04.2007 eu urges moderation in ukraine political standoff großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych supporters have been voicing their discontent in kiev the european union has urged the leaders of rival parties in ukraine to settle their political disputes .
but the bloc also said it considers the standoff a domestic issue that does n't warrant outside involvement . the eu 's statement came a day after ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said he was dissolving parliament and calling fresh elections in may .
the parliament , which is dominated by yushchenko 's rival , viktor yanukovych , rejected that announcement , saying it amounted to an attempted coup d 'etat . crisis talks tuesday between yushchenko and prime minister viktor yanukovych failed to yield a compromise between the two rivals , even after ukraine 's government and parliament voted to defy the president 's orders . the presidential office said in a statement that yushchenko had informed the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana of his intention to hold snap elections . but yanukovych , who favours ties with russia , said pro-western yushchenko had made " a fatal mistake " in issuing the order dissolving parliament after months of political impasse .
hundreds of anti-yushchenko activists meanwhile camped out overnight in central kiev to protest against the president and vowed to hold a mass protest on wednesday .
" no to the division of ukraine ! " and " the constitution is the law for everyone ! " read placards posted up by the activists outside more than 200 tents set up near the parliament building and on independence square . eu has no plans to intervene the german eu presidency expressed concern about the situation in ukraine .
in a written statement , the german foreign ministry called upon the two sides in the conflict " to settle their current differences on domestic policy in a manner which complies with the constitution and domestic rules . " but the eu does not plan to intervene .
" we do not consider the situation at the moment to need influence from outside , " european commission spokeswoman christiane hohmann said .
" we think it 's a domestic affair that needs to be sorted out in ukraine itself . " adherents of both the pro-western yushchenko and the more russia-oriented yanukovych continue to stage protests in the ukrainian capital kiev . unwieldy partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych , left , and yushchenko have not been able to work together yushchenko was swept to power in january 2005 after a bitterly contested election against yanukovych and waves of popular street demonstrations that became known as the orange revolution .
but he was forced to accept his rival as prime minister after he and his allies failed to secure a parliamentary majority in a national election in 2006 . yushchenko accuses yanukovych of trying to encourage individual parliamentary deputies to switch allegiances , something he says is forbidden under ukraine 's constitution .
but critics of yushchenko say he himself refuses to accept limitations on the power of the ukrainian presidency put in place in 2005 . the two men have clashed repeatedly since yanukovych became prime minister , and it is unclear whether a new election would do anything to end the impasse . political chaos in ukraine would be a major worry for the eu since it is one of the largest countries in eastern europe and one that is home to pipelines supplying western europe with russian gas . the eu presidency was careful to point out on tuesday that it hoped negotiations for closer ties between the eu and ukraine would not be affected by the current political stalemate . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nationalists , russia find ukraine 's eurovision song quite a drag ukraine 's eurovision song contest entry is causing friction at home and abroad .

chelsea drew 1-1 against valencia while man u lost in rome .
meanwhile , bayern munich relishes their draw in milan . supporters of english soccer were hoping that liverpool 's demolition of eindhoven on tuesday would set the tone for fellow premiership sides chelsea and manchester united .
but after wednesday evening , the current top two clubs in english soccer find themselves in a pinch .
chelsea managed only a 1-1 draw at home against valencia .
the spaniards played better soccer for most of the first half as valencia parried the uncoordinated attacks of the english champs .
at the half-hour mark , david silva let loose a sharp shot from some 20 meters out that was unstoppable for chelsea keeper petr cech - valenica led 1-0 .
after the interval , chelsea stormed out of the locker room and quickly took control of the game .
in the 53rd minute , the blues ' top scorer , didier drogba , headed home the equalizer .
chelsea , however , retained the pressure for the remainder of the match but valencia showed little weakness in gaining the draw .
with the home result , chelsea leave themselves in a precarious position for next week 's second leg tie in valencia .
man u drop match at roma in rome , premiership leader manchester united fell to roma 2-1 .
manu coach sir alex ferguson should be satisfied with the result considering his team played for almost one hour with 10 men after german referee herbert fendel sent off paul scholes .
roma took advantage of the red card and one minute before halftime , their brazilian midfielder taddei scored from 11 metres out with some help from two manchester defenders who deflected the ball into their own net .
the one-sided nature of this contest was obvious as roma launched 26 total shots .
manchester waited for counter-attacks , and that 's how they scored when wayne rooney equalized at the hour mark .
six minutes later , though , mirko vucinic slotted home the ball after manu keeper edwin van der sar was unable to stop a shot .
manchester got the desired one goal that coach ferguson demanded but will nevertheless have a tough task next week at old trafford .
the match was marred by fighting between supporters from both teams before and during the contest .
italian media reported that five people were injured in the clashes .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- twin ivf births ' need to be cut ' bbc news / health graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- health contents : medical notes wednesday , 4 april 2007 , 06:49 gmt 07:49 uk twin ivf births ' need to be cut ' by branwen jeffreys health correspondent , bbc news the number of twins born from ivf needs to be cut because of risks to mothers and babies , a watchdog has said .
the human fertility and embryology authority -lrb- hfea -rrb- says as treatment has become more successful the number of multiple births has increased .
some 40 % of ivf babies are twins , but many are born prematurely and more than 100 die every year .
the hfea has begun public consultation on a range of options which could lead to fewer multiple births .
avoidable risks at least half of twins are born prematurely with a lower weight .
they are far more likely to need specialist care in the first few months and also are at a greater risk of poor health throughout their lives . "
doing nothing is not an option " shirley harrison hfea chairman ' i had ivf twins ' the chances of severe disability such as cerebral palsy are also higher in babies born in twins .
hfea chairman shirley harrison said these risks are avoidable , as are the deaths of some premature babies .
" doing nothing is not an option .
the latest figures show 126 ivf babies die each year because they have been born as twins not single babies .
we ca n't let that continue , " she said .
flexible treatment the consultation sets out four options for change , including simply making women more aware of the risks of multiple births .
the hfea is also considering whether there should be a gradual move towards a maximum for each fertility clinic of 10 % of births being twins .
an alternative could be setting out guidelines for which patients should only be given one embryo .
the hfea says any change needs to be flexible to take account of the wide range of patients seeking fertility treatment .
older women or those who have already been through several unsuccessful ivf cycles would be very unlikely to be restricted to one embryo transfer .
' numbers game ' most fertility specialists support change and some clinics are already trying to increase the number of patients implanted with just one embryo .
mr yacoub khalaf , the head of the assisted conception unit at guy 's and st thomas ' trust said : " we are already achieving great successes by replacing only single embryos in many of our suitable patients .
" in the last year our overall pregnancy rate has risen and our multiple pregnancy rate has been reduced . "
despite the consensus it could be hard to bring about change .
the vast majority of fertility patients pay for their own treatment as access to nhs funding is extremely patchy .
with an average cost for one cycle of ivf of £ 5,000 it is no surprise that couples seeking treatment are very interested in success rates .
each clinic is legally obliged to publish the number of pregnancies and live births per cycle of ivf .
there is a level playing field as the regulations allow a maximum of two embryos to be implanted in women under 40 years old , and a maximum of three for women over 40 .
fertility experts have warned about the combination of patients funding their own treatment and a virtual league table of success rates .
patchy provision three years ago , the government said the nhs should be offering one cycle of ivf to suitable patients by april 2005 .
it was seen as a stepping stone towards implementing the guidance from the national institute for clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- of three nhs funded cycles .
in many areas that simply has not happened , and the criteria for receiving nhs-funded treatment can differ widely from one area to another .

the human fertility and embryology authority -lrb- hfea -rrb- says as treatment has become more successful the number of multiple births has increased .

doing nothing is not an option shirley harrison hfea chairman ' i had ivf twins ' the chances of severe disability such as cerebral palsy are also higher in babies born in twins .
hfea chairman shirley harrison said these risks are avoidable , as are the deaths of some premature babies .
" doing nothing is not an option .
the latest figures show 126 ivf babies die each year because they have been born as twins not single babies .
we ca n't let that continue , " she said .
flexible treatment the consultation sets out four options for change , including simply making women more aware of the risks of multiple births .
the hfea is also considering whether there should be a gradual move towards a maximum for each fertility clinic of 10 % of births being twins .
an alternative could be setting out guidelines for which patients should only be given one embryo .
the hfea says any change needs to be flexible to take account of the wide range of patients seeking fertility treatment .

" in the last year our overall pregnancy rate has risen and our multiple pregnancy rate has been reduced . "

with an average cost for one cycle of ivf of £ 5,000 it is no surprise that couples seeking treatment are very interested in success rates .
each clinic is legally obliged to publish the number of pregnancies and live births per cycle of ivf .
there is a level playing field as the regulations allow a maximum of two embryos to be implanted in women under 40 years old , and a maximum of three for women over 40 .
fertility experts have warned about the combination of patients funding their own treatment and a virtual league table of success rates .
patchy provision three years ago , the government said the nhs should be offering one cycle of ivf to suitable patients by april 2005 .

as the house speaker , she is the most senior politician in the us after the president and vice-president .
nancy pelosi is one of the democratic party 's best fund-raisers widely respected for her organisational and fund-raising skills , ms pelosi has a low public profile compared with the democrats ' other female big hitter , hillary clinton .
but her position as representative for a liberal san francisco district means her promotion from house minority leader was expected to attract controversy .
the republicans have already sought to play on conservative voters ' fears by portraying her as the embodiment of everything they dislike most about the democrats , with campaign ads suggesting she will raise taxes , help illegal immigrants and back same-sex marriage .
for many within her party , she represents a new hope that the democrats can make their mark after a decade on the fringes of power .
fiercely partisan her agenda for the first 100 hours of a democrat-led house included : bringing in rules to break links between lobbyists and legislation enacting all the 9/11 commission recommendations raising the minimum wage expanding stem cell research she ruled out attempting to impeach president george w bush , as some in her party suggested .
there are those within the democrat camp who question whether she may prove too liberal for the moderates they hope to win over in the mid-term elections .
republican adverts seek to play on fears ms pelosi is too liberal ms pelosi 's personal voting record puts her to the left of many in her party .
she was one of 126 house democrats to vote against the use of force in iraq in 2002 , although after the war had started she voted to finance it .
however , her track record as a fiercely partisan house leader who has succeeded in unifying her party on important votes may help her to balance these differing expectations .
she is credited with masterminding the democratic party 's successful strategy for derailing mr bush 's plan to overhaul the social security system through partial privatisation .
her fund-raising prowess is unquestioned : the mother-of-five has raised more for the democrats in this mid-term election than almost anyone else .
on taking over as speaker from republican dennis hastert - who has been in the role since 1999 - ms pelosi became second in line to succeed president george w bush , after the vice-president , under the us constitution .
the position brings with it the power to appoint politicians to chair key bodies such as the judiciary and intelligence committees .
political family a native of baltimore , ms pelosi comes from a large italian-american , roman catholic family .
she is also the child of one of baltimore 's foremost political families - both her father and brother served as mayor .
republican dennis hastert has been house speaker since 1999 her san francisco congressional district , which she has represented since 1987 , is seen as one of the most liberal in the nation .
she became active in californian politics in the early 1980s and was chief fund-raiser for the national democratic senatorial campaign committee in the 1986 election .
she had been considering running for mayor in 1987 when her local congresswoman fell ill and died .
ms pelosi won the seat in a special election and has remained in place since .

as the house speaker , she is the most senior politician in the us after the president and vice-president .
widely respected for her organisational and fund-raising skills , ms pelosi has a low public profile compared with the democrats ' other female big hitter , hillary clinton .
but her position as representative for a liberal san francisco district means her promotion from house minority leader was expected to attract controversy .
the republicans have already sought to play on conservative voters ' fears by portraying her as the embodiment of everything they dislike most about the democrats , with campaign ads suggesting she will raise taxes , help illegal immigrants and back same-sex marriage .
for many within her party , she represents a new hope that the democrats can make their mark after a decade on the fringes of power .
fiercely partisan her agenda for the first 100 hours of a democrat-led house included : bringing in rules to break links between lobbyists and legislation enacting all the 9/11 commission recommendations raising the minimum wage expanding stem cell research she ruled out attempting to impeach president george w bush , as some in her party suggested .
there are those within the democrat camp who question whether she may prove too liberal for the moderates they hope to win over in the mid-term elections .
ms pelosi 's personal voting record puts her to the left of many in her party .
she was one of 126 house democrats to vote against the use of force in iraq in 2002 , although after the war had started she voted to finance it .
however , her track record as a fiercely partisan house leader who has succeeded in unifying her party on important votes may help her to balance these differing expectations .

a £ 100,000 gulbenkian prize winner is to be announced on 24 may .
contenders are kelvingrove art gallery and museum in glasgow , kew palace in london , pallant house in chichester and weston park museum in sheffield .
chairman of the judges , francine stock , said all four were " outstanding " , and that choosing a shortlist was " tough " .
she said : " we 've travelled coast to coast from northernmost scotland to the sussex seaside , visiting 10 very different museums .
original shortlist of 10 de la warr pavilion , bexhill district museum , braintree horniman museum , london kelvingrove art gallery and museum , glasgow kew palace , london metropolitan university 's women 's library , london pallant house , chichester scotland and medicine , edinburgh v & a islamic gallery , london weston park museum , sheffield " each has its own way of attracting the local community and new audiences to collections and exhibitions , and it is exciting to see the growth in visitor numbers . "
kelvingrove , a victorian gallery and museum that has had a £ 35m restoration , has what has been called " one of the greatest civic collections in europe " .
its 85,000 objects are grouped according to themes and stories , rather than style or chronology , and range from fine arts to archaeology and the natural world .
kew palace , a four-storey red brick house in kew gardens in south west london , is britain 's smallest royal palace and was home to george iii and his family in the early 1800s .
the palace recently underwent a major restoration and reopened to the public last year .
some rooms have been recreated in georgian splendour , but others have remained untouched for 200 years .
butcher 's shop pallant house gallery 's collection of modern british art includes works by peter blake , lucian freud , barbara hepworth and walter sickert .
the queen anne townhouse recently became the first gallery in the uk to install a geothermal heating and cooling system which has cut carbon emissions by up to 50 % .
treasures in weston park museum , which opened in 1875 , range from egyptian mummies to a traditional butcher 's shop .
it had 55,000 visitors in its first 15 days after opening , following a £ 19m transformation .

doctors treating maradona at a buenos aires clinic issued a statement denying the 46-year-old had attempted suicide .
admitted last wednesday , he is expected to stay in hospital for two more weeks .
maradona , who led the argentine team to victory in the 1986 world cup and is revered in his country , has battled cocaine addiction and obesity .
hector pezzella , head of the private guemes clinic in the argentine capital , said : " this was not a suicide attempt .
there has been good clinical progress . "
he added : " what happened was a disorder in compulsive form , in this case due to alcohol . "
maradona , who had reportedly been admitted against his wishes , was " obeying doctors " and his life was not in any danger , dr pezzella said .
the former argentine team captain is still idolised in his home country , and his fans have been watching and waiting for any news .
stomach stapling dr pezzella said maradona had been suffering from depression , which had led him to drink excessively .
his personal physician , alfredo cahe , said doctors had feared the footballer could develop pancreatitis - a potentially fatal disease of the pancreas - if not admitted .
maradona has suffered from health problems in the past he said the medical team would keep the public fully informed of maradona 's progress , adding that his latest health problems were less serious than those in 2000 and 2004 .
as well as leading the winning world cup team , maradona won league titles at home and in italy .
but in 1991 he was banned for 15 months after failing a drugs test and tested positive again for banned drugs at the 1994 world cup in the us .
he retired from competitive sport in 1997 .
in 2004 , he spent 10 days in intensive care with high blood pressure , breathing problems and a lung infection .
two years ago , he had a stomach stapling operation .
he lost 30kg -lrb- 66lb -rrb- , began playing football again and appeared to be getting his life back on track .
but the argentine media recently reported that maradona had put on weight and was considering taking a slimming cure in switzerland .
last month , argentina 's central bank said it was investigating him for alleged financial irregularities .

the 13ft-high granite sculpture took devon sculptor peter randall-page four years to create , from commission to completion .
it will now travel to eden from de lank quarry on bodmin moor where it was made and on 11 june it will be planted into eden 's new £ 15m education centre .
the seed will be unveiled on 21 june , the day of the summer solstice .
mr randall-page , from crockernwell , devon , said it was his most ambitious project yet .
the sculpture 's surface has about 1,800 circular nodes positioned according to the fibonacci sequence , a theory that links mathematical laws with the shapes and structures in plants .
" the maths is extremely complicated .
i think in some ways it is the most complex work i have done , " mr randall-page said .
the seed is not representative of any particular species - " it is a pattern you will find everywhere in nature , " said the sculptor .
mr randall-page 's work is displayed in various museums and art galleries including the british museum and the tate .
his work can also be seen in tasmania , ireland and south korea .

the new building at castle donington will co-ordinate fire services across five counties - notts , derbys , lincs , leics and northants .
contracts for the centre 's new computer system have been signed , but officials say it will not open until autumn 2009 instead of early 2008 .
regional fire service staff will be fully transferred there by march 2010 .
job losses the fire authority said the new timescale is a result of a national it deal for these centres announced by the government .
acting chief fire officer frank swann said : " the delay is a central government issue - and the movement of our staff in march 2010 is something we will have to work towards in conjunction with the trade union . "
steve ainley from the fire brigades union said : " the union does not support the centralisation of the fire control - we do n't believe it will produce any efficiencies and we believe it will be detrimental to both our members and the public . "
he said the fbu 's campaign to oppose the centralisation has been ongoing for several years .
nine new centres will replace the existing 46 control rooms in england .
there will be some job losses associated with the move to the new centre because fewer staff will be needed , but the government has said it hoped to avoid compulsory redundancies .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- will emi unlock music revolution ?

by stephen robb entertainment reporter , bbc news emi is to become the first major record label to sell music online without copy protection , so will the move spark a digital music revolution ?
the world 's third-biggest label made the announcement in a joint press conference with apple , whose itunes store will start selling the tracks in may , with other online stores to follow .
online music 's digital rights management -lrb- drm -rrb- protections have been controversial , with critics branding them " digital restrictions management " .
the software embedded in the music limits how it can be copied and on which devices it can be played .
many in the recording industry claim is necessary to fight music piracy .
but some companies and consumer groups argue that the incompatibility of different systems is anti-competitive and punishes innocent consumers .
for instance , drm has meant itunes songs can only be played on apple 's ipod , but the device will not recognise tracks from some other online stores , such as napster .
it means songs can become unusable if people change music providers or players , or the download company goes out of business .
' frustrating ' emi chief executive eric nicoli admitted on monday that the label 's move was intended to " address the lack of interoperability which is frustrating for many music fans " .
people will be able to buy songs to work on any computer operating system or player .
apple boss steve jobs predicted that other record labels would follow and that more than half of itunes ' music would be drm-free by the end of the year . "
i would be surprised if drm existed to its current extent by the end of the year " stephen godfroy director , rough trade the other three majors - universal music , sony bmg music and warner music - have so far announced no plans to offer their catalogues drm-free .
last month , warner music said mr jobs ' call for the scrapping of drm was " without logic and merit " .
" i think it 's a good , brave move from emi and maybe the others are happy to sit back and wait and see , " said paul scaife , publisher of the music industry 's record of the day newsletter .
" i would think it would push them to do something and there may well be a public tide that starts turning against them and starts forcing their hand . "

by stephen robb entertainment reporter , bbc news apple 's itunes online music store dominates the download market emi is to become the first major record label to sell music online without copy protection , so will the move spark a digital music revolution ?
the world 's third-biggest label made the announcement in a joint press conference with apple , whose itunes store will start selling the tracks in may , with other online stores to follow .
online music 's digital rights management -lrb- drm -rrb- protections have been controversial , with critics branding them " digital restrictions management " .
the software embedded in the music limits how it can be copied and on which devices it can be played .
many in the recording industry claim is necessary to fight music piracy .
but some companies and consumer groups argue that the incompatibility of different systems is anti-competitive and punishes innocent consumers .
for instance , drm has meant itunes songs can only be played on apple 's ipod , but the device will not recognise tracks from some other online stores , such as napster .
it means songs can become unusable if people change music providers or players , or the download company goes out of business .
' frustrating ' emi chief executive eric nicoli admitted on monday that the label 's move was intended to " address the lack of interoperability which is frustrating for many music fans " .
people will be able to buy songs to work on any computer operating system or player .
apple boss steve jobs predicted that other record labels would follow and that more than half of itunes ' music would be drm-free by the end of the year .
i would be surprised if drm existed to its current extent by the end of the year stephen godfroy director , rough trade the other three majors - universal music , sony bmg music and warner music - have so far announced no plans to offer their catalogues drm-free .
last month , warner music said mr jobs ' call for the scrapping of drm was " without logic and merit " .
" i think it 's a good , brave move from emi and maybe the others are happy to sit back and wait and see , " said paul scaife , publisher of the music industry 's record of the day newsletter .
" i would think it would push them to do something and there may well be a public tide that starts turning against them and starts forcing their hand . "
