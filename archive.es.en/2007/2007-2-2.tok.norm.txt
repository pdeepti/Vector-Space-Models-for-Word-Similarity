program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 02.02.2007 bundestag passes controversial health care overhaul großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many are skeptical that the reform will cure the health care system 's ills germany 's lower house of parliament has passed a controversial plan to reform the country 's health care system .
the legislation passed despite " no " votes from dozens of members of the coalition parties . the bundestag on friday approved the legislation with 378 votes , while 208 lawmakers said " no " to the changes to the public health care system .
thus , at least 40 parliamentarians from the ruling coalition parties , the christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , rejected the reform . health minister ulla schmidt said she was satisfied with the result . " it 's a good majority , " she said on friday . the bundesrat , germany 's upper chamber of parliament , will vote on the legislation on feb .
16 , and is also expected to approve it .
the law will come into effect on april 1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors protested against the changes .
" stinginess makes you sick , " read their backs the reform 's original aim was to cut non-labor wage costs , which contribute to the high price of german workers .
however , public health insurance companies raised their premiums during the long months of discussion before the reform passed .
both employers and employees were forced to pay more , jacking up non-wage labor costs .
lowest common denominator angela merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister party , the csu , initially wanted to cap employers ' contributions , which the social democrats opposed .
instead , the spd wanted a broader segment of society to be required to contribute to the system of solidarity that covers nearly 90 percent of germany 's residents .
the party demanded that civil servants , high earners and the self-employed also contribute to the public health insurance companies .
unlike the rest of society , those three groups are allowed to have private insurance plans , and most of them do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt was unable to push through her desires health minister schmidt , a social democrat , wanted private insurance to be available for everyone .
private insurers provide more services and allow more flexibility than the 252 public health insurance companies .
but the cdu / csu rejected schmidt 's plan .
in the end , the governing coalition of conservatives and social democrats agreed on the lowest common denominator .
still , merkel declared it a breakthrough . " the measures aim to improve the quality of providers , increase the choice and decision-making chances of the people insured , and altogether ensure a clearer picture of economy , transparency , competition and the financial viability of the health care system , " she said in july , when the coalition partners announced the compromise they had agreed upon . the heart of the reform is the so-called " health fund . "
from 2009 , all contributions to the public health insurance companies as well as state subsidies are supposed to be paid into this new fund .
the companies will levy a standard premium for everyone , and if the money they are allocated from the health fund does n't cover their costs , they will be able to charge the people they insure a supplement .
insurers who use their funds efficiently and do n't demand more money of their clients will thus be more appealing to the public .
lack of enthusiasm germany is the only country in the world that , in essence , has two separate health care systems - the private and public systems .
the reform will make it more difficult for people to be eligible for private insurance .
they will only be allowed to switch from a public to a private insurance company if they earn 3,975 euros -lrb- $ 5,155 -rrb- per month for three years . the changes also require everyone in germany to have health insurance by 2009 .
an estimated 200,000 residents are n't currently covered .
in the future , people who fall ill and are n't insured will be obliged to pay back health insurance premiums for up to five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospital staff is concerned that is will get harder to make ends meet the overhaul has n't provoked enthusiasm anywhere in germany - not from politicians , the insurance companies , health care professionals or patients .
up to the final days before the bundestag voted on the measures , the insurance companies lobbied the government to reform the reform .
they argued that the changes would n't resolve the public health care system 's financial problems , patients would carry a greater burden than now , bureaucracy would be increased and competition limited . " if this is a reform , then reform is a dirty word , " said reinhard bütiköfer , head of the green party opposition in the bundestag .
" it is the first so-called health care system reform in which it is a foregone conclusion that everything will be more expensive for the people who are insured . " dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german doctors prepare more protests against health reforms during a national day of action monday , german doctors ' and health federations announced that there would be more industrial action to come as the government 's controversial health reforms prepare to become law in april .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 02.02.2007 opinion : kosovo is a challenge for the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy martti ahtisaari presented his draft proposal for kosovo on friday .
his difficult and uncertain mission is of paramount importance , not only for the balkans , but the eu in general , says dw 's verica spasovska . united nations envoy martti ahtisaari has taken on a difficult mission .
its success - with serbs and albanians heavily entrenched in their positions - is highly uncertain .
ahtisaari 's visit to belgrade was made even more explosive when serbian prime minister vojsilav kostunica refused to meet with him - supposedly because he is in the midst of a complicated process of building a new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verica spasovska at the same time , kostunica is threatening to break off diplomatic relations with those countries that want to recognize kosovo .
in this precarious moment , kostuncia seems to be trying to shun political responsibility . the eu has been implying for months that the kosovo proposal could lead to independence , even if drastically limited , yet kostunica has so far lacked courage to prepare the serbian population for the possible loss of the province . kosovo albanians , on the other hand , are increasing the pressure on the west by postulating unlimited independence as something non-negotiable .
this is only hiking up the expectations of the population .
over the past few years , kosovo albanians have learned that the west is backing away from its political demands and giving in to riots and violence . after the massive riots three years ago , the eu gave up its postulate " standards before status . "
the eu is no longer demanding that the democratic rules of engagement be established and minorities protected before the status is determined .
since violence was rewarded with political concessions , one can possibly expect a new escalation of violence if all the demands of kosovo albanians are not met .
the international peace / keeping troops have been placed on heightened alert . the eu is in a tight spot .
it must find a face-saving solution for both parties that everybody would support .
that is why the word " independence " has not been in circulation for days .
on the other hand , serbia 's sovereignty is also not mentioned any more . the only way out of this dilemma lies in the clear eu accession perspectives for the serbs and the albanians .

his difficult and uncertain mission is of paramount importance , not only for the balkans , but the eu in general , says dw 's verica spasovska . united nations envoy martti ahtisaari has taken on a difficult mission .
its success - with serbs and albanians heavily entrenched in their positions - is highly uncertain .
ahtisaari 's visit to belgrade was made even more explosive when serbian prime minister vojsilav kostunica refused to meet with him - supposedly because he is in the midst of a complicated process of building a new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verica spasovska at the same time , kostunica is threatening to break off diplomatic relations with those countries that want to recognize kosovo .
in this precarious moment , kostuncia seems to be trying to shun political responsibility . the eu has been implying for months that the kosovo proposal could lead to independence , even if drastically limited , yet kostunica has so far lacked courage to prepare the serbian population for the possible loss of the province . kosovo albanians , on the other hand , are increasing the pressure on the west by postulating unlimited independence as something non-negotiable .
this is only hiking up the expectations of the population .
over the past few years , kosovo albanians have learned that the west is backing away from its political demands and giving in to riots and violence . after the massive riots three years ago , the eu gave up its postulate " standards before status . "
the eu is no longer demanding that the democratic rules of engagement be established and minorities protected before the status is determined .
since violence was rewarded with political concessions , one can possibly expect a new escalation of violence if all the demands of kosovo albanians are not met .
the international peace / keeping troops have been placed on heightened alert . the eu is in a tight spot .
it must find a face-saving solution for both parties that everybody would support .
that is why the word " independence " has not been in circulation for days .
on the other hand , serbia 's sovereignty is also not mentioned any more . the only way out of this dilemma lies in the clear eu accession perspectives for the serbs and the albanians .

the german government says more investment in environmental technology is the way ahead . the german government has announced a 255 million euro -lrb- $ 330.7 million -rrb- boost for research into preventing climate change .
this comes as the un climate panel gave its strongest warning yet that human activities are heating up the planet . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- report released in paris on friday predicts that temperatures are probably going to increase by 1.8 to 4 degrees celsius by the end of the century .
it also said sea levels would probably rise by between 28 and 43 centimeters -lrb- 11 to 17 inches -rrb- . german research minister annette schavan said the cash increase in environmental investment which will be paid over the next three years . it will include 35 million euros for the expansion of the german climate change calculation center . technological solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the melting of ice in the arctic is set to accelerate , endangering the habitats of creatures like polar bears and increasing the probability of flooding schavan stressed the need for technological change based on well-founded scientific research to curb global warming . " to keep climate change within acceptable boundaries we have to carry out intensive research and ensure that climate-friendly technologies are rapidly distributed , " she said . the minister also said an action plan for climate change would soon be made public that centered on human and social needs .

it said there was at least a 90 per cent probability that activities such as burning fossil fuels accounted for most of the warming over the past 50 years .
in 2001 , it said the link was 66 percent probable .

no post-2012 targets have yet been set . it is hoped that the united states , the world 's top emitter of greenhouse gases , will , in particular , do more to do cut the burning of fossil fuels in power plants , factories and cars . the us pulled out of the kyoto protocol in 2001 saying emission limits would damage the economy .

" climate change is a reality that ca n't be challenged , " said german deputy environment minister michael müller .
" it is already manifesting itself in increasingly extreme events such as heat waves and high levels of precipitation and in the accelerated melting of glaciers and ice caps .

gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison . nearly 30 years after left-wing radical group , raf -lrb- red army faction -rrb- terrorized west germany , federal prosecutors have filed a request for the release of brigitte mohnhaupt , a leading raf member who was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 for her role in a series of prominent murders .
separately , german president horst köhler is considering a pardon for mohnhaupt 's former colleague , christian klar who is serving a life sentence for at least 11 killings . the moves have sparked a furious debate in germany pitting outraged relatives of the raf 's victims against politicians who say the killers have done their time and no longer pose a threat to society . dw-world.de spoke with gerhart baum , former interior minister of germany and a member of the free-market liberal fdp party .
baum is a prominent advocate of releasing the prisoners . dw-world.de : why are you in favor of releasing mohnhaupt and klar from prison ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhart baum wants former raf prisoners to be released gerhart baum : that 's because i respect the principles of our constitutional state and believe they must be applied to the raf terrorists too .
they should not be given any special status , either in the negative or positive sense .
at the time -lrb- of their arrest -rrb- we refused to treat them as prisoners of the war as they wanted .
the raf terrorists are criminals and murderers and must be treated like any other criminals in a comparable case . we also need to make a distinction between the two .
in mohnhaupt 's case , it 's about releasing her on parole .
with christian klar , it 's about him being pardoned by the german president .
both cases are being reviewed by the authorities who will eventually make a decision . christian klar was given a triple life sentence .
can you explain what " life imprisonment " means in a strictly legal sense in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar is in prison for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder it does not mean literally for life .
there is no life-long imprisonment in practice unless the perpetrators are deemed dangerous and remain dangerous .
according to our laws , a life sentence is reviewed after 15 years for the first time .
and one of the fundamental principles of our legal system - which has been repeatedly reaffirmed by the country 's highest court - is that human dignity , as it is laid down in the constitution , also means that a person who is sentenced to life imprisonment must be given a perspective for freedom . those who oppose releasing mohnhaupt and klar say the two have neither shown any remorse nor contributed towards clearing up a series of unsolved murders . that 's precisely why mohnhaupt and klar have been punished so severely .
their sentences represent the toughest legal verdicts ever passed for raf terrorists .
they did n't show any remorse and they did n't cooperate in solving crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte mohnhaupt has never shown any contrition but we have to be clear on the point that according to german law , remorse is n't demanded .
it 's desirable , but it is n't necessary .
in the case of christian klar , who has appealed to the german president for clemency , it 's a different matter .
there i expect klar to distance himself from his crimes .
he has apparently done that .
but that 's for the german president to decide . you were germany 's interior minister from 1978 to 1982 and thus a key player in the german state 's long battle with the raf .
how do you look back on your role today ? in addition to using important police and legal resources - which we managed to implement successfully to defeat the raf - i especially tried to highlight flawed developments in our society at that time .
the aim was not to play down the raf , but rather to draw attention to the social environment in which those turbulent events took place . and let 's not forget , they are an issue until today .
just recently a double book edition was published with articles from some 60 scientists who analyzed that period because the raf is a radical byproduct of the disintegration of the left-wing protest movement .
at that time , we tried to sway those who harbored sympathy for the raf and win them over to the rule of law .
and we were successful with that . you were also responsible for passing several harsh anti-terror laws at the time .
do you regret any ?
what would you do differently today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in april 1977 federal prosecutor general siegfried buback was shot and killed by the raf the anti-terror measures were a necessary reaction .
we had to strengthen our police services which were n't in good shape then .
we also had to adapt our courts and legal systems to deal with new criminal behavioral patterns by making changes to our penal code as well as legal procedural code . i admit that some of this partly went too far .
to an extent , there was also a political overreaction to the raf threat .
but we did then dilute some of the measures .
when i took office in 1978 , i also abolished some of the measures used by the police to hunt down raf suspects - a procedure which also hugely affected unsuspecting citizens .
so we did draw certain consequences to deal with the threat of that time . at the same time , it has to be said that since the raf , anti-terror legislation has been continually beefed up , particularly after the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
we 're practically living in a state of permanent emergency where the balance between freedom and security has been damaged and ended up putting curbs on freedom . what lessons do you think germany can draw from the raf era in fighting terrorism today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of schleyer , held hostage by the raf for over a month , became an iconic image of 1970s west germany the most important thing is to maintain calm and not give in to hysteria and populist fear .
politicians should not be allowed to hijack security and turn it into an election topic .
instead the government has to tell the population that we must learn to live with risks .
germany must keep its cool , remain sober and pragmatic and only pass security measures that make real sense instead of symbolic gestures which are passed off as enhanced security for the population but which in reality only curb freedom . nearly 30 years after the raf terrorized west germany , the topic remains highly emotional and sparks strong reactions in germany .
why is that ? that whole period - the reform movements , the struggle for democratic reforms in the political parties , the left-wing protest movement , that whole turbulence and feeling of new beginnings of 1968 , the new policy towards the soviet union - is a fascinating one .
even the people suddenly lived differently at the time , they had a different relationship to sexuality , and art was in a heady heyday .
all that does still fascinate or interest today 's young generation .
a year ago an raf exhibition took place in berlin where artists reacted to the raf .
i promoted the exhibition at the time and it saw a record 50,000 visitors , most of them young people . but that is not to be mistaken as a fascination with the raf , which is only limited .
it 's more an interest in the political spirit of a highly exciting time .
i do n't think that the raf has turned into a myth .
we have to remember that they were murderers , though they were politically motivated . but the majority of the german population is against the release of mohnhaupt and klar .
how do you explain that ? if you follow a simple question pattern - are you for or against the release - then i think you could very quickly even have a situation where the population will be in favor of the death penalty .
this is where a democratic constitutional state has to show some nerve , keep its calm and hold fast to the fundamental principles of the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf 's symbol of a star and a rifle in the 1980s when german president richard von weizsäcker pardoned raf terrorists , it was considered an important gesture .
that is not the case today because the raf and its group of sympathizers no longer exist .
what we need is renewed proof that the german constitutional state is capable of showing mercy . do you think germany will finally close the raf chapter once its last remaining former members are released from prison ? no , not in any way .
we still do n't know the murderers of a whole series of victims after 1985 - for example those of alfred herrhausen -lrb- former deutsche bank chief -rrb- or detlev karsten rohwedder -lrb- leader of the post-reunification government-owned treuhand organization which was responsible for privatizing east german companies . -rrb- and not only do we not know the identity of the perpetrators who are still being hunted , but the interest in the period around 1967 and 1968 still remains very high .
so there is no way the debate will come to an end after the last raf members are released . sonia phalnikar interviewed gerhart baum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : " remorse is not a prerequisite " germany 's newspapers have been debating the possible early release of raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt and the petition for pardon that christian klar , another raf terrorist , submitted to the german president .

there i expect klar to distance himself from his crimes .
he has apparently done that .
but that 's for the german president to decide . you were germany 's interior minister from 1978 to 1982 and thus a key player in the german state 's long battle with the raf .
how do you look back on your role today ? in addition to using important police and legal resources - which we managed to implement successfully to defeat the raf - i especially tried to highlight flawed developments in our society at that time .
the aim was not to play down the raf , but rather to draw attention to the social environment in which those turbulent events took place . and let 's not forget , they are an issue until today .
just recently a double book edition was published with articles from some 60 scientists who analyzed that period because the raf is a radical byproduct of the disintegration of the left-wing protest movement .
at that time , we tried to sway those who harbored sympathy for the raf and win them over to the rule of law .
and we were successful with that . you were also responsible for passing several harsh anti-terror laws at the time .
do you regret any ?
what would you do differently today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in april 1977 federal prosecutor general siegfried buback was shot and killed by the raf the anti-terror measures were a necessary reaction .
we had to strengthen our police services which were n't in good shape then .
we also had to adapt our courts and legal systems to deal with new criminal behavioral patterns by making changes to our penal code as well as legal procedural code . i admit that some of this partly went too far .
to an extent , there was also a political overreaction to the raf threat .
but we did then dilute some of the measures .

gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison . nearly 30 years after left-wing radical group , raf -lrb- red army faction -rrb- terrorized west germany , federal prosecutors have filed a request for the release of brigitte mohnhaupt , a leading raf member who was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 for her role in a series of prominent murders .
separately , german president horst köhler is considering a pardon for mohnhaupt 's former colleague , christian klar who is serving a life sentence for at least 11 killings . the moves have sparked a furious debate in germany pitting outraged relatives of the raf 's victims against politicians who say the killers have done their time and no longer pose a threat to society . dw-world.de spoke with gerhart baum , former interior minister of germany and a member of the free-market liberal fdp party .
baum is a prominent advocate of releasing the prisoners . dw-world.de : why are you in favor of releasing mohnhaupt and klar from prison ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhart baum wants former raf prisoners to be released gerhart baum : that 's because i respect the principles of our constitutional state and believe they must be applied to the raf terrorists too .
they should not be given any special status , either in the negative or positive sense .
at the time -lrb- of their arrest -rrb- we refused to treat them as prisoners of the war as they wanted .
the raf terrorists are criminals and murderers and must be treated like any other criminals in a comparable case . we also need to make a distinction between the two .
in mohnhaupt 's case , it 's about releasing her on parole .
with christian klar , it 's about him being pardoned by the german president .
both cases are being reviewed by the authorities who will eventually make a decision . christian klar was given a triple life sentence .
can you explain what " life imprisonment " means in a strictly legal sense in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar is in prison for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder it does not mean literally for life .
there is no life-long imprisonment in practice unless the perpetrators are deemed dangerous and remain dangerous .
according to our laws , a life sentence is reviewed after 15 years for the first time .
and one of the fundamental principles of our legal system - which has been repeatedly reaffirmed by the country 's highest court - is that human dignity , as it is laid down in the constitution , also means that a person who is sentenced to life imprisonment must be given a perspective for freedom . those who oppose releasing mohnhaupt and klar say the two have neither shown any remorse nor contributed towards clearing up a series of unsolved murders . that 's precisely why mohnhaupt and klar have been punished so severely .
their sentences represent the toughest legal verdicts ever passed for raf terrorists .
they did n't show any remorse and they did n't cooperate in solving crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte mohnhaupt has never shown any contrition but we have to be clear on the point that according to german law , remorse is n't demanded .
it 's desirable , but it is n't necessary .
in the case of christian klar , who has appealed to the german president for clemency , it 's a different matter .
there i expect klar to distance himself from his crimes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 02.02.2007 " we need proof that the german state is capable of mercy " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it time for germans to pack away the memories of the raf ?
gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison . nearly 30 years after left-wing radical group , raf -lrb- red army faction -rrb- terrorized west germany , federal prosecutors have filed a request for the release of brigitte mohnhaupt , a leading raf member who was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 for her role in a series of prominent murders .
separately , german president horst köhler is considering a pardon for mohnhaupt 's former colleague , christian klar who is serving a life sentence for at least 11 killings . the moves have sparked a furious debate in germany pitting outraged relatives of the raf 's victims against politicians who say the killers have done their time and no longer pose a threat to society . dw-world.de spoke with gerhart baum , former interior minister of germany and a member of the free-market liberal fdp party .
baum is a prominent advocate of releasing the prisoners . dw-world.de : why are you in favor of releasing mohnhaupt and klar from prison ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhart baum wants former raf prisoners to be released gerhart baum : that 's because i respect the principles of our constitutional state and believe they must be applied to the raf terrorists too .
they should not be given any special status , either in the negative or positive sense .
at the time -lrb- of their arrest -rrb- we refused to treat them as prisoners of the war as they wanted .
the raf terrorists are criminals and murderers and must be treated like any other criminals in a comparable case . we also need to make a distinction between the two .
in mohnhaupt 's case , it 's about releasing her on parole .
with christian klar , it 's about him being pardoned by the german president .
both cases are being reviewed by the authorities who will eventually make a decision . christian klar was given a triple life sentence .
can you explain what " life imprisonment " means in a strictly legal sense in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar is in prison for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder it does not mean literally for life .
there is no life-long imprisonment in practice unless the perpetrators are deemed dangerous and remain dangerous .
according to our laws , a life sentence is reviewed after 15 years for the first time .
and one of the fundamental principles of our legal system - which has been repeatedly reaffirmed by the country 's highest court - is that human dignity , as it is laid down in the constitution , also means that a person who is sentenced to life imprisonment must be given a perspective for freedom . those who oppose releasing mohnhaupt and klar say the two have neither shown any remorse nor contributed towards clearing up a series of unsolved murders . that 's precisely why mohnhaupt and klar have been punished so severely .
their sentences represent the toughest legal verdicts ever passed for raf terrorists .
they did n't show any remorse and they did n't cooperate in solving crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte mohnhaupt has never shown any contrition but we have to be clear on the point that according to german law , remorse is n't demanded .
it 's desirable , but it is n't necessary .
in the case of christian klar , who has appealed to the german president for clemency , it 's a different matter .
there i expect klar to distance himself from his crimes .
he has apparently done that .
but that 's for the german president to decide . you were germany 's interior minister from 1978 to 1982 and thus a key player in the german state 's long battle with the raf .
how do you look back on your role today ? in addition to using important police and legal resources - which we managed to implement successfully to defeat the raf - i especially tried to highlight flawed developments in our society at that time .
the aim was not to play down the raf , but rather to draw attention to the social environment in which those turbulent events took place . and let 's not forget , they are an issue until today .
just recently a double book edition was published with articles from some 60 scientists who analyzed that period because the raf is a radical byproduct of the disintegration of the left-wing protest movement .
at that time , we tried to sway those who harbored sympathy for the raf and win them over to the rule of law .
and we were successful with that . you were also responsible for passing several harsh anti-terror laws at the time .
do you regret any ?
what would you do differently today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in april 1977 federal prosecutor general siegfried buback was shot and killed by the raf the anti-terror measures were a necessary reaction .
we had to strengthen our police services which were n't in good shape then .
we also had to adapt our courts and legal systems to deal with new criminal behavioral patterns by making changes to our penal code as well as legal procedural code . i admit that some of this partly went too far .
to an extent , there was also a political overreaction to the raf threat .
but we did then dilute some of the measures .
when i took office in 1978 , i also abolished some of the measures used by the police to hunt down raf suspects - a procedure which also hugely affected unsuspecting citizens .
so we did draw certain consequences to deal with the threat of that time . at the same time , it has to be said that since the raf , anti-terror legislation has been continually beefed up , particularly after the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
we 're practically living in a state of permanent emergency where the balance between freedom and security has been damaged and ended up putting curbs on freedom . what lessons do you think germany can draw from the raf era in fighting terrorism today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of schleyer , held hostage by the raf for over a month , became an iconic image of 1970s west germany the most important thing is to maintain calm and not give in to hysteria and populist fear .
politicians should not be allowed to hijack security and turn it into an election topic .
instead the government has to tell the population that we must learn to live with risks .
germany must keep its cool , remain sober and pragmatic and only pass security measures that make real sense instead of symbolic gestures which are passed off as enhanced security for the population but which in reality only curb freedom . nearly 30 years after the raf terrorized west germany , the topic remains highly emotional and sparks strong reactions in germany .
why is that ? that whole period - the reform movements , the struggle for democratic reforms in the political parties , the left-wing protest movement , that whole turbulence and feeling of new beginnings of 1968 , the new policy towards the soviet union - is a fascinating one .
even the people suddenly lived differently at the time , they had a different relationship to sexuality , and art was in a heady heyday .
all that does still fascinate or interest today 's young generation .
a year ago an raf exhibition took place in berlin where artists reacted to the raf .
i promoted the exhibition at the time and it saw a record 50,000 visitors , most of them young people . but that is not to be mistaken as a fascination with the raf , which is only limited .
it 's more an interest in the political spirit of a highly exciting time .
i do n't think that the raf has turned into a myth .
we have to remember that they were murderers , though they were politically motivated . but the majority of the german population is against the release of mohnhaupt and klar .
how do you explain that ? if you follow a simple question pattern - are you for or against the release - then i think you could very quickly even have a situation where the population will be in favor of the death penalty .
this is where a democratic constitutional state has to show some nerve , keep its calm and hold fast to the fundamental principles of the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf 's symbol of a star and a rifle in the 1980s when german president richard von weizsäcker pardoned raf terrorists , it was considered an important gesture .
that is not the case today because the raf and its group of sympathizers no longer exist .
what we need is renewed proof that the german constitutional state is capable of showing mercy . do you think germany will finally close the raf chapter once its last remaining former members are released from prison ? no , not in any way .
we still do n't know the murderers of a whole series of victims after 1985 - for example those of alfred herrhausen -lrb- former deutsche bank chief -rrb- or detlev karsten rohwedder -lrb- leader of the post-reunification government-owned treuhand organization which was responsible for privatizing east german companies . -rrb- and not only do we not know the identity of the perpetrators who are still being hunted , but the interest in the period around 1967 and 1968 still remains very high .
so there is no way the debate will come to an end after the last raf members are released . sonia phalnikar interviewed gerhart baum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : " remorse is not a prerequisite " germany 's newspapers have been debating the possible early release of raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt and the petition for pardon that christian klar , another raf terrorist , submitted to the german president .

topping the agenda are the situation in iraq , iran and the israeli-palestinian conflict . over the past six weeks , angela merkel has already met with israeli prime minister olmert , president of the palestinian autonomous authority abbas and jordanian king abdullah ii .
the forthcoming trip to the gulf region - during which she will visit four countries in four days - will be the german chancellor 's first longer trip after 14 months in office . merkel has received assurances from us president george w. bush that the united states will again strengthen their involvement in the peace negotiations between israel and palestine .

8 , its director seems worried about well-funded competitors on the festival circuit .
experts say that he need n't lose too much sleep over it . it was an entry fit for a movie star : surrounded by a cloud of flashbulbs , berlinale director dieter kosslick appeared before a few hundred journalists on tuesday to present the program for this year 's festival - the 57th of its kind .
he talked about record movie entries -lrb- some 5,000 -rrb- , a booming film market and a new event called " culinary cinema " that features screenings followed by a gourmet meal . known for his abominable english skills , kosslick had the room roaring with laughter when he recounted how he managed to convince clint eastwood to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is kosslick really worried about new festivals ?
" i 'm dieter from ze cherman film festival , " he introduced himself after mistaking eastwood for a friend in la .
apparently it did the trick . but off the stage , in a recent interview , kosslick did n't seem to be in the mood for jokes . " things are getting more and more complicated when it comes to film festivals , " kosslick told german daily die welt .
" there 's a boom in festivals and a boom in film markets , with millions invested in them . " nouveau riche competitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress isabella rossellini came to rome 's festival , but she will also come to berlin he was talking about a new generation of events that have sprung up around the globe in recent years .
in europe , cinema .
festa internazionale di roma just premiered with a rumored budget of 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26 million -rrb- last october .
in asia , festivals in bangkok and pusan -lrb- south korea -rrb- are increasingly getting attention .
and then there 's the three-year-old dubai international film festival -lrb- diff -rrb- , which kosslick also does n't think of too highly . " i know that ... rome and dubai buy stars with big money to put on festivals for an audience , " he told german trade magazine promedia .
" the big competitors that have a lot of money are increasingly turning into marketing events . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dubai will focus on arab film makers not so , said chris paton , a diff spokesman , who rejected the allegation that officials in dubai paid stars to attend . " while their hospitality can be on a very grand scale , they do n't pay straight-out fees , " he said , adding that free first-class flights and deluxe accommodation arrangements were necessary to convince hollywood greats to make the 23-hour journey . " if you want american stars to travel such a distance , of course you have to treat them in the right way , " paton said . the a-list clout he added that diff was more interested in establishing itself as an important regional hub than competing with one of " the three grande dames " : berlin , cannes and venice . others agreed that kosslick should n't worry too much about losing out because of the likes of rome or dubai . " i do n't think there is real competition , " said bruno chatelin , the paris-based co-founder of filmfestivals.com and a former film studio marketing executive .
" producers know the difference between being selected in dubai and being selected in berlin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they still do wonders to a movie 's selling power thorsten schaumann , the head of germany 's leading film distributor bavaria film international , agreed that recognition in berlin was highly valuable for a movie . " the berlinale is certainly the first big a-festival of the year for us to meet all the buyers , " said schaumann , who has two films competing for the festival 's coveted golden bear trophy . " it 's one of the most important , if not the most important festivals for us , " he added .
" that 's a status that can not be taken away . " but that 's not to say that some of the newcomers are n't welcome additions to the year-round festival circus . " rome 's an important platform for us as well , " schaumann said .
" we need a european market at the end of the year . " a healthy dose of arrogance in the end , berlinale director kosslick 's comments might have been nothing more than a clever trick to position his festival . " he 's discrediting the others by relegating them to a different league , " said thorsten hennig-thurau , who is professor for marketing and media research at weimar 's bauhaus university .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 02.02.2007 " we need proof that the german state is capable of mercy " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it time for germans to pack away the memories of the raf ?
gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison . nearly 30 years after left-wing radical group , raf -lrb- red army faction -rrb- terrorized west germany , federal prosecutors have filed a request for the release of brigitte mohnhaupt , a leading raf member who was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 for her role in a series of prominent murders .
separately , german president horst köhler is considering a pardon for mohnhaupt 's former colleague , christian klar who is serving a life sentence for at least 11 killings . the moves have sparked a furious debate in germany pitting outraged relatives of the raf 's victims against politicians who say the killers have done their time and no longer pose a threat to society . dw-world.de spoke with gerhart baum , former interior minister of germany and a member of the free-market liberal fdp party .
baum is a prominent advocate of releasing the prisoners . dw-world.de : why are you in favor of releasing mohnhaupt and klar from prison ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhart baum wants former raf prisoners to be released gerhart baum : that 's because i respect the principles of our constitutional state and believe they must be applied to the raf terrorists too .
they should not be given any special status , either in the negative or positive sense .
at the time -lrb- of their arrest -rrb- we refused to treat them as prisoners of the war as they wanted .
the raf terrorists are criminals and murderers and must be treated like any other criminals in a comparable case . we also need to make a distinction between the two .
in mohnhaupt 's case , it 's about releasing her on parole .
with christian klar , it 's about him being pardoned by the german president .
both cases are being reviewed by the authorities who will eventually make a decision . christian klar was given a triple life sentence .
can you explain what " life imprisonment " means in a strictly legal sense in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar is in prison for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder it does not mean literally for life .
there is no life-long imprisonment in practice unless the perpetrators are deemed dangerous and remain dangerous .
according to our laws , a life sentence is reviewed after 15 years for the first time .
and one of the fundamental principles of our legal system - which has been repeatedly reaffirmed by the country 's highest court - is that human dignity , as it is laid down in the constitution , also means that a person who is sentenced to life imprisonment must be given a perspective for freedom . those who oppose releasing mohnhaupt and klar say the two have neither shown any remorse nor contributed towards clearing up a series of unsolved murders . that 's precisely why mohnhaupt and klar have been punished so severely .
their sentences represent the toughest legal verdicts ever passed for raf terrorists .
they did n't show any remorse and they did n't cooperate in solving crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte mohnhaupt has never shown any contrition but we have to be clear on the point that according to german law , remorse is n't demanded .
it 's desirable , but it is n't necessary .
in the case of christian klar , who has appealed to the german president for clemency , it 's a different matter .
there i expect klar to distance himself from his crimes .
he has apparently done that .
but that 's for the german president to decide . you were germany 's interior minister from 1978 to 1982 and thus a key player in the german state 's long battle with the raf .
how do you look back on your role today ? in addition to using important police and legal resources - which we managed to implement successfully to defeat the raf - i especially tried to highlight flawed developments in our society at that time .
the aim was not to play down the raf , but rather to draw attention to the social environment in which those turbulent events took place . and let 's not forget , they are an issue until today .
just recently a double book edition was published with articles from some 60 scientists who analyzed that period because the raf is a radical byproduct of the disintegration of the left-wing protest movement .
at that time , we tried to sway those who harbored sympathy for the raf and win them over to the rule of law .
and we were successful with that . you were also responsible for passing several harsh anti-terror laws at the time .
do you regret any ?
what would you do differently today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in april 1977 federal prosecutor general siegfried buback was shot and killed by the raf the anti-terror measures were a necessary reaction .
we had to strengthen our police services which were n't in good shape then .
we also had to adapt our courts and legal systems to deal with new criminal behavioral patterns by making changes to our penal code as well as legal procedural code . i admit that some of this partly went too far .
to an extent , there was also a political overreaction to the raf threat .
but we did then dilute some of the measures .
when i took office in 1978 , i also abolished some of the measures used by the police to hunt down raf suspects - a procedure which also hugely affected unsuspecting citizens .
so we did draw certain consequences to deal with the threat of that time . at the same time , it has to be said that since the raf , anti-terror legislation has been continually beefed up , particularly after the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
we 're practically living in a state of permanent emergency where the balance between freedom and security has been damaged and ended up putting curbs on freedom . what lessons do you think germany can draw from the raf era in fighting terrorism today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of schleyer , held hostage by the raf for over a month , became an iconic image of 1970s west germany the most important thing is to maintain calm and not give in to hysteria and populist fear .
politicians should not be allowed to hijack security and turn it into an election topic .
instead the government has to tell the population that we must learn to live with risks .
germany must keep its cool , remain sober and pragmatic and only pass security measures that make real sense instead of symbolic gestures which are passed off as enhanced security for the population but which in reality only curb freedom . nearly 30 years after the raf terrorized west germany , the topic remains highly emotional and sparks strong reactions in germany .
why is that ? that whole period - the reform movements , the struggle for democratic reforms in the political parties , the left-wing protest movement , that whole turbulence and feeling of new beginnings of 1968 , the new policy towards the soviet union - is a fascinating one .
even the people suddenly lived differently at the time , they had a different relationship to sexuality , and art was in a heady heyday .
all that does still fascinate or interest today 's young generation .
a year ago an raf exhibition took place in berlin where artists reacted to the raf .
i promoted the exhibition at the time and it saw a record 50,000 visitors , most of them young people . but that is not to be mistaken as a fascination with the raf , which is only limited .
it 's more an interest in the political spirit of a highly exciting time .
i do n't think that the raf has turned into a myth .
we have to remember that they were murderers , though they were politically motivated . but the majority of the german population is against the release of mohnhaupt and klar .
how do you explain that ? if you follow a simple question pattern - are you for or against the release - then i think you could very quickly even have a situation where the population will be in favor of the death penalty .
this is where a democratic constitutional state has to show some nerve , keep its calm and hold fast to the fundamental principles of the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf 's symbol of a star and a rifle in the 1980s when german president richard von weizsäcker pardoned raf terrorists , it was considered an important gesture .
that is not the case today because the raf and its group of sympathizers no longer exist .
what we need is renewed proof that the german constitutional state is capable of showing mercy . do you think germany will finally close the raf chapter once its last remaining former members are released from prison ? no , not in any way .
we still do n't know the murderers of a whole series of victims after 1985 - for example those of alfred herrhausen -lrb- former deutsche bank chief -rrb- or detlev karsten rohwedder -lrb- leader of the post-reunification government-owned treuhand organization which was responsible for privatizing east german companies . -rrb- and not only do we not know the identity of the perpetrators who are still being hunted , but the interest in the period around 1967 and 1968 still remains very high .

gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison . nearly 30 years after left-wing radical group , raf -lrb- red army faction -rrb- terrorized west germany , federal prosecutors have filed a request for the release of brigitte mohnhaupt , a leading raf member who was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 for her role in a series of prominent murders .
separately , german president horst köhler is considering a pardon for mohnhaupt 's former colleague , christian klar who is serving a life sentence for at least 11 killings . the moves have sparked a furious debate in germany pitting outraged relatives of the raf 's victims against politicians who say the killers have done their time and no longer pose a threat to society . dw-world.de spoke with gerhart baum , former interior minister of germany and a member of the free-market liberal fdp party .
baum is a prominent advocate of releasing the prisoners . dw-world.de : why are you in favor of releasing mohnhaupt and klar from prison ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhart baum wants former raf prisoners to be released gerhart baum : that 's because i respect the principles of our constitutional state and believe they must be applied to the raf terrorists too .
they should not be given any special status , either in the negative or positive sense .
at the time -lrb- of their arrest -rrb- we refused to treat them as prisoners of the war as they wanted .
the raf terrorists are criminals and murderers and must be treated like any other criminals in a comparable case . we also need to make a distinction between the two .
in mohnhaupt 's case , it 's about releasing her on parole .
with christian klar , it 's about him being pardoned by the german president .
both cases are being reviewed by the authorities who will eventually make a decision . christian klar was given a triple life sentence .
can you explain what " life imprisonment " means in a strictly legal sense in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar is in prison for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder it does not mean literally for life .
there is no life-long imprisonment in practice unless the perpetrators are deemed dangerous and remain dangerous .
according to our laws , a life sentence is reviewed after 15 years for the first time .
and one of the fundamental principles of our legal system - which has been repeatedly reaffirmed by the country 's highest court - is that human dignity , as it is laid down in the constitution , also means that a person who is sentenced to life imprisonment must be given a perspective for freedom . those who oppose releasing mohnhaupt and klar say the two have neither shown any remorse nor contributed towards clearing up a series of unsolved murders . that 's precisely why mohnhaupt and klar have been punished so severely .
their sentences represent the toughest legal verdicts ever passed for raf terrorists .
they did n't show any remorse and they did n't cooperate in solving crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte mohnhaupt has never shown any contrition but we have to be clear on the point that according to german law , remorse is n't demanded .
it 's desirable , but it is n't necessary .
in the case of christian klar , who has appealed to the german president for clemency , it 's a different matter .
there i expect klar to distance himself from his crimes .
he has apparently done that .
but that 's for the german president to decide . you were germany 's interior minister from 1978 to 1982 and thus a key player in the german state 's long battle with the raf .
how do you look back on your role today ? in addition to using important police and legal resources - which we managed to implement successfully to defeat the raf - i especially tried to highlight flawed developments in our society at that time .
the aim was not to play down the raf , but rather to draw attention to the social environment in which those turbulent events took place . and let 's not forget , they are an issue until today .
just recently a double book edition was published with articles from some 60 scientists who analyzed that period because the raf is a radical byproduct of the disintegration of the left-wing protest movement .
at that time , we tried to sway those who harbored sympathy for the raf and win them over to the rule of law .
and we were successful with that . you were also responsible for passing several harsh anti-terror laws at the time .
do you regret any ?
what would you do differently today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in april 1977 federal prosecutor general siegfried buback was shot and killed by the raf the anti-terror measures were a necessary reaction .
we had to strengthen our police services which were n't in good shape then .
we also had to adapt our courts and legal systems to deal with new criminal behavioral patterns by making changes to our penal code as well as legal procedural code . i admit that some of this partly went too far .
to an extent , there was also a political overreaction to the raf threat .
but we did then dilute some of the measures .
when i took office in 1978 , i also abolished some of the measures used by the police to hunt down raf suspects - a procedure which also hugely affected unsuspecting citizens .
so we did draw certain consequences to deal with the threat of that time . at the same time , it has to be said that since the raf , anti-terror legislation has been continually beefed up , particularly after the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
we 're practically living in a state of permanent emergency where the balance between freedom and security has been damaged and ended up putting curbs on freedom . what lessons do you think germany can draw from the raf era in fighting terrorism today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of schleyer , held hostage by the raf for over a month , became an iconic image of 1970s west germany the most important thing is to maintain calm and not give in to hysteria and populist fear .
politicians should not be allowed to hijack security and turn it into an election topic .
instead the government has to tell the population that we must learn to live with risks .
germany must keep its cool , remain sober and pragmatic and only pass security measures that make real sense instead of symbolic gestures which are passed off as enhanced security for the population but which in reality only curb freedom . nearly 30 years after the raf terrorized west germany , the topic remains highly emotional and sparks strong reactions in germany .
why is that ? that whole period - the reform movements , the struggle for democratic reforms in the political parties , the left-wing protest movement , that whole turbulence and feeling of new beginnings of 1968 , the new policy towards the soviet union - is a fascinating one .
even the people suddenly lived differently at the time , they had a different relationship to sexuality , and art was in a heady heyday .
all that does still fascinate or interest today 's young generation .
a year ago an raf exhibition took place in berlin where artists reacted to the raf .
i promoted the exhibition at the time and it saw a record 50,000 visitors , most of them young people . but that is not to be mistaken as a fascination with the raf , which is only limited .
it 's more an interest in the political spirit of a highly exciting time .
i do n't think that the raf has turned into a myth .
we have to remember that they were murderers , though they were politically motivated . but the majority of the german population is against the release of mohnhaupt and klar .
how do you explain that ? if you follow a simple question pattern - are you for or against the release - then i think you could very quickly even have a situation where the population will be in favor of the death penalty .
this is where a democratic constitutional state has to show some nerve , keep its calm and hold fast to the fundamental principles of the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf 's symbol of a star and a rifle in the 1980s when german president richard von weizsäcker pardoned raf terrorists , it was considered an important gesture .
that is not the case today because the raf and its group of sympathizers no longer exist .
what we need is renewed proof that the german constitutional state is capable of showing mercy . do you think germany will finally close the raf chapter once its last remaining former members are released from prison ? no , not in any way .
we still do n't know the murderers of a whole series of victims after 1985 - for example those of alfred herrhausen -lrb- former deutsche bank chief -rrb- or detlev karsten rohwedder -lrb- leader of the post-reunification government-owned treuhand organization which was responsible for privatizing east german companies . -rrb- and not only do we not know the identity of the perpetrators who are still being hunted , but the interest in the period around 1967 and 1968 still remains very high .

gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison . nearly 30 years after left-wing radical group , raf -lrb- red army faction -rrb- terrorized west germany , federal prosecutors have filed a request for the release of brigitte mohnhaupt , a leading raf member who was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 for her role in a series of prominent murders .
separately , german president horst köhler is considering a pardon for mohnhaupt 's former colleague , christian klar who is serving a life sentence for at least 11 killings . the moves have sparked a furious debate in germany pitting outraged relatives of the raf 's victims against politicians who say the killers have done their time and no longer pose a threat to society . dw-world.de spoke with gerhart baum , former interior minister of germany and a member of the free-market liberal fdp party .
baum is a prominent advocate of releasing the prisoners . dw-world.de : why are you in favor of releasing mohnhaupt and klar from prison ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhart baum wants former raf prisoners to be released gerhart baum : that 's because i respect the principles of our constitutional state and believe they must be applied to the raf terrorists too .
they should not be given any special status , either in the negative or positive sense .
at the time -lrb- of their arrest -rrb- we refused to treat them as prisoners of the war as they wanted .
the raf terrorists are criminals and murderers and must be treated like any other criminals in a comparable case . we also need to make a distinction between the two .
in mohnhaupt 's case , it 's about releasing her on parole .
with christian klar , it 's about him being pardoned by the german president .
both cases are being reviewed by the authorities who will eventually make a decision . christian klar was given a triple life sentence .
can you explain what " life imprisonment " means in a strictly legal sense in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar is in prison for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder it does not mean literally for life .
there is no life-long imprisonment in practice unless the perpetrators are deemed dangerous and remain dangerous .
according to our laws , a life sentence is reviewed after 15 years for the first time .
and one of the fundamental principles of our legal system - which has been repeatedly reaffirmed by the country 's highest court - is that human dignity , as it is laid down in the constitution , also means that a person who is sentenced to life imprisonment must be given a perspective for freedom . those who oppose releasing mohnhaupt and klar say the two have neither shown any remorse nor contributed towards clearing up a series of unsolved murders . that 's precisely why mohnhaupt and klar have been punished so severely .
their sentences represent the toughest legal verdicts ever passed for raf terrorists .
they did n't show any remorse and they did n't cooperate in solving crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte mohnhaupt has never shown any contrition but we have to be clear on the point that according to german law , remorse is n't demanded .
it 's desirable , but it is n't necessary .
in the case of christian klar , who has appealed to the german president for clemency , it 's a different matter .
there i expect klar to distance himself from his crimes .
he has apparently done that .
but that 's for the german president to decide . you were germany 's interior minister from 1978 to 1982 and thus a key player in the german state 's long battle with the raf .
how do you look back on your role today ? in addition to using important police and legal resources - which we managed to implement successfully to defeat the raf - i especially tried to highlight flawed developments in our society at that time .
the aim was not to play down the raf , but rather to draw attention to the social environment in which those turbulent events took place . and let 's not forget , they are an issue until today .
just recently a double book edition was published with articles from some 60 scientists who analyzed that period because the raf is a radical byproduct of the disintegration of the left-wing protest movement .
at that time , we tried to sway those who harbored sympathy for the raf and win them over to the rule of law .
and we were successful with that . you were also responsible for passing several harsh anti-terror laws at the time .
do you regret any ?
what would you do differently today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in april 1977 federal prosecutor general siegfried buback was shot and killed by the raf the anti-terror measures were a necessary reaction .
we had to strengthen our police services which were n't in good shape then .
we also had to adapt our courts and legal systems to deal with new criminal behavioral patterns by making changes to our penal code as well as legal procedural code . i admit that some of this partly went too far .
to an extent , there was also a political overreaction to the raf threat .
but we did then dilute some of the measures .
when i took office in 1978 , i also abolished some of the measures used by the police to hunt down raf suspects - a procedure which also hugely affected unsuspecting citizens .
so we did draw certain consequences to deal with the threat of that time . at the same time , it has to be said that since the raf , anti-terror legislation has been continually beefed up , particularly after the attacks of sept .

topping the agenda are the situation in iraq , iran and the israeli-palestinian conflict . over the past six weeks , angela merkel has already met with israeli prime minister olmert , president of the palestinian autonomous authority abbas and jordanian king abdullah ii .
the forthcoming trip to the gulf region - during which she will visit four countries in four days - will be the german chancellor 's first longer trip after 14 months in office . merkel has received assurances from us president george w. bush that the united states will again strengthen their involvement in the peace negotiations between israel and palestine .
on friday , one day before merkel 's trip to the gulf , the middle-east quartet - consisting of the us , russia , the eu and the un - met again for the first time in a year . while former german chancellor gerhard schröder made economic ties the focus of his trips to the middle east , " political topics will clearly stand in the foreground " during merkel 's talks , said government spokesperson thomas steg . political agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanon is still recovering from the war with israel germany 's economics minister , michael gloss , is also traveling to the region together with a delegation of business leaders , but their routes will overlap only occasionally . " the chancellor would like the countries in the region to feel responsible and participate in conflict resolution , " steg said . there are already enough conflicts in the middle east : while lebanon 's moderate government is fighting for stability , iran is causing alarm with its nuclear plans , and palestinian rival movements hamas and fatah are involved in a power struggle that has - since the escalation of violence - cost 60 lives . " the essential historical conflict , however , remains to be the one between israel and palestine , " said middle east expert christian-peter hanelt .

the forthcoming trip to the gulf region - during which she will visit four countries in four days - will be the german chancellor 's first longer trip after 14 months in office . merkel has received assurances from us president george w. bush that the united states will again strengthen their involvement in the peace negotiations between israel and palestine .

" since iran is no longer militarily kept at bay by iraq , the saudis are increasingly seeing a threat in iran because of their ideological differences , " meyer said . iran is ruled by shiite moslems , whereas the saudis are mostly sunnites . " the fact that she is the council president of the whole european union will strengthen her position during this trip , " meyer said . in her talks with king abdullah ii last week in berlin , merkel spoke about taking advantage of the existing " window of opportunity for the peace process .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the clock is ticking eu backs plans for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions interviews : the united nations and climate change germany in top five countries fighting climate change merkel calls for eu climate change strategy environment -pipe- 02.02.2007 germany boosts investment in climate change research großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drought will become more likely as climate change accelerates the un climate panel has issued its strongest ever warning about global warning .
the german government says more investment in environmental technology is the way ahead . the german government has announced a 255 million euro -lrb- $ 330.7 million -rrb- boost for research into preventing climate change .
this comes as the un climate panel gave its strongest warning yet that human activities are heating up the planet . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- report released in paris on friday predicts that temperatures are probably going to increase by 1.8 to 4 degrees celsius by the end of the century .
it also said sea levels would probably rise by between 28 and 43 centimeters -lrb- 11 to 17 inches -rrb- . german research minister annette schavan said the cash increase in environmental investment which will be paid over the next three years . it will include 35 million euros for the expansion of the german climate change calculation center . technological solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the melting of ice in the arctic is set to accelerate , endangering the habitats of creatures like polar bears and increasing the probability of flooding schavan stressed the need for technological change based on well-founded scientific research to curb global warming . " to keep climate change within acceptable boundaries we have to carry out intensive research and ensure that climate-friendly technologies are rapidly distributed , " she said . the minister also said an action plan for climate change would soon be made public that centered on human and social needs . " this program will be forward-looking in that it offers technological solutions for the growing economies of our world , " schavan said .
" we will also open up new markets for our economy . " more heat waves and violent cyclones other projections made by the ipcc report include the increasing likelihood of heat waves and violent tropical cyclones , as well as the melting of the artic sea ice in summer by 2100 . the document was much more forceful than its last report in judging whether humans were to blame for climate change .
it said there was at least a 90 per cent probability that activities such as burning fossil fuels accounted for most of the warming over the past 50 years .
in 2001 , it said the link was 66 percent probable . " if you see the extent to which human activities are influencing the climate system , the options for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions appear in a different light , because you can see what the costs of inaction are , " ipcc chairman rajendra pachauri told delegates in paris . humans to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un wants governments to cut down on the use of fossil fuels the head of the un environment program achim steiner said friday would be remembered as the day when the question mark was removed from whether people are to blame for climate change . steiner , whose agency oversees the operation of the kyoto protocol , urged governments to put more effort into getting stalled talks on long-term cuts in carbon dioxide emissions back on track .
no post-2012 targets have yet been set . it is hoped that the united states , the world 's top emitter of greenhouse gases , will , in particular , do more to do cut the burning of fossil fuels in power plants , factories and cars . the us pulled out of the kyoto protocol in 2001 saying emission limits would damage the economy .
us president george w. bush was also critical of the decision to exclude developing nations from the targets during the first phase of the agreement .
china 's booming industry is not bound by kyoto . eu vow to cut emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars are also a contributor to rising carbon dioxide emissions germany has already vowed to make cutting emissions a central aim during its six-month eu presidency .
the german environmental ministry also responded to the news of today 's report saying the european union should continue to push for industrialized nations , including the eu , to agree to a 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020 compared to1990 levels . " climate change is a reality that ca n't be challenged , " said german deputy environment minister michael müller .
" it is already manifesting itself in increasingly extreme events such as heat waves and high levels of precipitation and in the accelerated melting of glaciers and ice caps .
the report confirms the necessity of an ambitious climate policy . " chancellor angela merkel has , however , recently come under fire for apparently backtracking on her pledge to tackle global warming and speaking out against blanket emission levels for new cars . dw staff -lrb- jeg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel opposed to eu plans for car emissions scheme german chancellor merkel said she would resist attempts from the eu commission to impose caps on auto emissions which would apply to all new cars in the bloc .

the german government says more investment in environmental technology is the way ahead . the german government has announced a 255 million euro -lrb- $ 330.7 million -rrb- boost for research into preventing climate change .
this comes as the un climate panel gave its strongest warning yet that human activities are heating up the planet . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- report released in paris on friday predicts that temperatures are probably going to increase by 1.8 to 4 degrees celsius by the end of the century .

in 2001 , it said the link was 66 percent probable .

" climate change is a reality that ca n't be challenged , " said german deputy environment minister michael müller .

the german government says more investment in environmental technology is the way ahead . the german government has announced a 255 million euro -lrb- $ 330.7 million -rrb- boost for research into preventing climate change .
this comes as the un climate panel gave its strongest warning yet that human activities are heating up the planet . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- report released in paris on friday predicts that temperatures are probably going to increase by 1.8 to 4 degrees celsius by the end of the century .
it also said sea levels would probably rise by between 28 and 43 centimeters -lrb- 11 to 17 inches -rrb- . german research minister annette schavan said the cash increase in environmental investment which will be paid over the next three years . it will include 35 million euros for the expansion of the german climate change calculation center . technological solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the melting of ice in the arctic is set to accelerate , endangering the habitats of creatures like polar bears and increasing the probability of flooding schavan stressed the need for technological change based on well-founded scientific research to curb global warming . " to keep climate change within acceptable boundaries we have to carry out intensive research and ensure that climate-friendly technologies are rapidly distributed , " she said . the minister also said an action plan for climate change would soon be made public that centered on human and social needs . " this program will be forward-looking in that it offers technological solutions for the growing economies of our world , " schavan said .
" we will also open up new markets for our economy . " more heat waves and violent cyclones other projections made by the ipcc report include the increasing likelihood of heat waves and violent tropical cyclones , as well as the melting of the artic sea ice in summer by 2100 . the document was much more forceful than its last report in judging whether humans were to blame for climate change .
it said there was at least a 90 per cent probability that activities such as burning fossil fuels accounted for most of the warming over the past 50 years .
in 2001 , it said the link was 66 percent probable . " if you see the extent to which human activities are influencing the climate system , the options for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions appear in a different light , because you can see what the costs of inaction are , " ipcc chairman rajendra pachauri told delegates in paris . humans to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un wants governments to cut down on the use of fossil fuels the head of the un environment program achim steiner said friday would be remembered as the day when the question mark was removed from whether people are to blame for climate change . steiner , whose agency oversees the operation of the kyoto protocol , urged governments to put more effort into getting stalled talks on long-term cuts in carbon dioxide emissions back on track .
no post-2012 targets have yet been set . it is hoped that the united states , the world 's top emitter of greenhouse gases , will , in particular , do more to do cut the burning of fossil fuels in power plants , factories and cars . the us pulled out of the kyoto protocol in 2001 saying emission limits would damage the economy .
us president george w. bush was also critical of the decision to exclude developing nations from the targets during the first phase of the agreement .
china 's booming industry is not bound by kyoto . eu vow to cut emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars are also a contributor to rising carbon dioxide emissions germany has already vowed to make cutting emissions a central aim during its six-month eu presidency .
the german environmental ministry also responded to the news of today 's report saying the european union should continue to push for industrialized nations , including the eu , to agree to a 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020 compared to1990 levels . " climate change is a reality that ca n't be challenged , " said german deputy environment minister michael müller .
" it is already manifesting itself in increasingly extreme events such as heat waves and high levels of precipitation and in the accelerated melting of glaciers and ice caps .
the report confirms the necessity of an ambitious climate policy . " chancellor angela merkel has , however , recently come under fire for apparently backtracking on her pledge to tackle global warming and speaking out against blanket emission levels for new cars . dw staff -lrb- jeg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel opposed to eu plans for car emissions scheme german chancellor merkel said she would resist attempts from the eu commission to impose caps on auto emissions which would apply to all new cars in the bloc .

his difficult and uncertain mission is of paramount importance , not only for the balkans , but the eu in general , says dw 's verica spasovska . united nations envoy martti ahtisaari has taken on a difficult mission .
its success - with serbs and albanians heavily entrenched in their positions - is highly uncertain .
ahtisaari 's visit to belgrade was made even more explosive when serbian prime minister vojsilav kostunica refused to meet with him - supposedly because he is in the midst of a complicated process of building a new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verica spasovska at the same time , kostunica is threatening to break off diplomatic relations with those countries that want to recognize kosovo .
in this precarious moment , kostuncia seems to be trying to shun political responsibility . the eu has been implying for months that the kosovo proposal could lead to independence , even if drastically limited , yet kostunica has so far lacked courage to prepare the serbian population for the possible loss of the province . kosovo albanians , on the other hand , are increasing the pressure on the west by postulating unlimited independence as something non-negotiable .
this is only hiking up the expectations of the population .
over the past few years , kosovo albanians have learned that the west is backing away from its political demands and giving in to riots and violence . after the massive riots three years ago , the eu gave up its postulate " standards before status . "
the eu is no longer demanding that the democratic rules of engagement be established and minorities protected before the status is determined .
since violence was rewarded with political concessions , one can possibly expect a new escalation of violence if all the demands of kosovo albanians are not met .
the international peace / keeping troops have been placed on heightened alert . the eu is in a tight spot .
it must find a face-saving solution for both parties that everybody would support .
that is why the word " independence " has not been in circulation for days .
on the other hand , serbia 's sovereignty is also not mentioned any more . the only way out of this dilemma lies in the clear eu accession perspectives for the serbs and the albanians .
both conflicting parties know that their economic and political development is coupled with eu membership and that they have to rely on the eu .
it must be made clear to both the serbs and the albanians that it is paradoxical for them to insist on sovereignty when they will sooner or later give up parts of that sovereignty to the eu .
they have to understand that at the very least that 's why the use of violence is not worth it . for the european union , kosovo is an elementary challenge : the eu has to manage this conflict successfully if it is to show that it is capable of a uniform foreign policy . verica spasovska is head of dw-radio 's program for central and southeastern europe -lrb- tt -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de del ponte warns eu against resuming talks with serbia carla del ponte , the un chief prosecutor for war crimes in the former yugoslavia , on wednesday warned the eu against resuming cooperation talks with serbia , saying key fugitives must first be arrested .

his difficult and uncertain mission is of paramount importance , not only for the balkans , but the eu in general , says dw 's verica spasovska . united nations envoy martti ahtisaari has taken on a difficult mission .
its success - with serbs and albanians heavily entrenched in their positions - is highly uncertain .
ahtisaari 's visit to belgrade was made even more explosive when serbian prime minister vojsilav kostunica refused to meet with him - supposedly because he is in the midst of a complicated process of building a new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verica spasovska at the same time , kostunica is threatening to break off diplomatic relations with those countries that want to recognize kosovo .
in this precarious moment , kostuncia seems to be trying to shun political responsibility . the eu has been implying for months that the kosovo proposal could lead to independence , even if drastically limited , yet kostunica has so far lacked courage to prepare the serbian population for the possible loss of the province . kosovo albanians , on the other hand , are increasing the pressure on the west by postulating unlimited independence as something non-negotiable .
this is only hiking up the expectations of the population .
over the past few years , kosovo albanians have learned that the west is backing away from its political demands and giving in to riots and violence . after the massive riots three years ago , the eu gave up its postulate " standards before status . "
the eu is no longer demanding that the democratic rules of engagement be established and minorities protected before the status is determined .
since violence was rewarded with political concessions , one can possibly expect a new escalation of violence if all the demands of kosovo albanians are not met .
the international peace / keeping troops have been placed on heightened alert . the eu is in a tight spot .
it must find a face-saving solution for both parties that everybody would support .
that is why the word " independence " has not been in circulation for days .
on the other hand , serbia 's sovereignty is also not mentioned any more . the only way out of this dilemma lies in the clear eu accession perspectives for the serbs and the albanians .
both conflicting parties know that their economic and political development is coupled with eu membership and that they have to rely on the eu .
it must be made clear to both the serbs and the albanians that it is paradoxical for them to insist on sovereignty when they will sooner or later give up parts of that sovereignty to the eu .
they have to understand that at the very least that 's why the use of violence is not worth it . for the european union , kosovo is an elementary challenge : the eu has to manage this conflict successfully if it is to show that it is capable of a uniform foreign policy . verica spasovska is head of dw-radio 's program for central and southeastern europe -lrb- tt -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de del ponte warns eu against resuming talks with serbia carla del ponte , the un chief prosecutor for war crimes in the former yugoslavia , on wednesday warned the eu against resuming cooperation talks with serbia , saying key fugitives must first be arrested .

the legislation passed despite " no " votes from dozens of members of the coalition parties . the bundestag on friday approved the legislation with 378 votes , while 208 lawmakers said " no " to the changes to the public health care system .
thus , at least 40 parliamentarians from the ruling coalition parties , the christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , rejected the reform . health minister ulla schmidt said she was satisfied with the result . " it 's a good majority , " she said on friday . the bundesrat , germany 's upper chamber of parliament , will vote on the legislation on feb .
16 , and is also expected to approve it .
the law will come into effect on april 1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors protested against the changes .
" stinginess makes you sick , " read their backs the reform 's original aim was to cut non-labor wage costs , which contribute to the high price of german workers .
however , public health insurance companies raised their premiums during the long months of discussion before the reform passed .
both employers and employees were forced to pay more , jacking up non-wage labor costs .
lowest common denominator angela merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister party , the csu , initially wanted to cap employers ' contributions , which the social democrats opposed .
instead , the spd wanted a broader segment of society to be required to contribute to the system of solidarity that covers nearly 90 percent of germany 's residents .
the party demanded that civil servants , high earners and the self-employed also contribute to the public health insurance companies .
unlike the rest of society , those three groups are allowed to have private insurance plans , and most of them do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt was unable to push through her desires health minister schmidt , a social democrat , wanted private insurance to be available for everyone .
private insurers provide more services and allow more flexibility than the 252 public health insurance companies .
but the cdu / csu rejected schmidt 's plan .
in the end , the governing coalition of conservatives and social democrats agreed on the lowest common denominator .
still , merkel declared it a breakthrough . " the measures aim to improve the quality of providers , increase the choice and decision-making chances of the people insured , and altogether ensure a clearer picture of economy , transparency , competition and the financial viability of the health care system , " she said in july , when the coalition partners announced the compromise they had agreed upon . the heart of the reform is the so-called " health fund . "
from 2009 , all contributions to the public health insurance companies as well as state subsidies are supposed to be paid into this new fund .
the companies will levy a standard premium for everyone , and if the money they are allocated from the health fund does n't cover their costs , they will be able to charge the people they insure a supplement .
insurers who use their funds efficiently and do n't demand more money of their clients will thus be more appealing to the public .
lack of enthusiasm germany is the only country in the world that , in essence , has two separate health care systems - the private and public systems .
the reform will make it more difficult for people to be eligible for private insurance .
they will only be allowed to switch from a public to a private insurance company if they earn 3,975 euros -lrb- $ 5,155 -rrb- per month for three years . the changes also require everyone in germany to have health insurance by 2009 .
an estimated 200,000 residents are n't currently covered .
in the future , people who fall ill and are n't insured will be obliged to pay back health insurance premiums for up to five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospital staff is concerned that is will get harder to make ends meet the overhaul has n't provoked enthusiasm anywhere in germany - not from politicians , the insurance companies , health care professionals or patients .
up to the final days before the bundestag voted on the measures , the insurance companies lobbied the government to reform the reform .
they argued that the changes would n't resolve the public health care system 's financial problems , patients would carry a greater burden than now , bureaucracy would be increased and competition limited . " if this is a reform , then reform is a dirty word , " said reinhard bütiköfer , head of the green party opposition in the bundestag .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 02.02.2007 " we need proof that the german state is capable of mercy " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it time for germans to pack away the memories of the raf ?
gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison . nearly 30 years after left-wing radical group , raf -lrb- red army faction -rrb- terrorized west germany , federal prosecutors have filed a request for the release of brigitte mohnhaupt , a leading raf member who was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 for her role in a series of prominent murders .
separately , german president horst köhler is considering a pardon for mohnhaupt 's former colleague , christian klar who is serving a life sentence for at least 11 killings . the moves have sparked a furious debate in germany pitting outraged relatives of the raf 's victims against politicians who say the killers have done their time and no longer pose a threat to society . dw-world.de spoke with gerhart baum , former interior minister of germany and a member of the free-market liberal fdp party .
baum is a prominent advocate of releasing the prisoners . dw-world.de : why are you in favor of releasing mohnhaupt and klar from prison ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhart baum wants former raf prisoners to be released gerhart baum : that 's because i respect the principles of our constitutional state and believe they must be applied to the raf terrorists too .
they should not be given any special status , either in the negative or positive sense .
at the time -lrb- of their arrest -rrb- we refused to treat them as prisoners of the war as they wanted .
the raf terrorists are criminals and murderers and must be treated like any other criminals in a comparable case . we also need to make a distinction between the two .
in mohnhaupt 's case , it 's about releasing her on parole .
with christian klar , it 's about him being pardoned by the german president .
both cases are being reviewed by the authorities who will eventually make a decision . christian klar was given a triple life sentence .
can you explain what " life imprisonment " means in a strictly legal sense in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar is in prison for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder it does not mean literally for life .
there is no life-long imprisonment in practice unless the perpetrators are deemed dangerous and remain dangerous .
according to our laws , a life sentence is reviewed after 15 years for the first time .
and one of the fundamental principles of our legal system - which has been repeatedly reaffirmed by the country 's highest court - is that human dignity , as it is laid down in the constitution , also means that a person who is sentenced to life imprisonment must be given a perspective for freedom . those who oppose releasing mohnhaupt and klar say the two have neither shown any remorse nor contributed towards clearing up a series of unsolved murders . that 's precisely why mohnhaupt and klar have been punished so severely .
their sentences represent the toughest legal verdicts ever passed for raf terrorists .
they did n't show any remorse and they did n't cooperate in solving crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte mohnhaupt has never shown any contrition but we have to be clear on the point that according to german law , remorse is n't demanded .
it 's desirable , but it is n't necessary .
in the case of christian klar , who has appealed to the german president for clemency , it 's a different matter .
there i expect klar to distance himself from his crimes .
he has apparently done that .
but that 's for the german president to decide . you were germany 's interior minister from 1978 to 1982 and thus a key player in the german state 's long battle with the raf .
how do you look back on your role today ? in addition to using important police and legal resources - which we managed to implement successfully to defeat the raf - i especially tried to highlight flawed developments in our society at that time .
the aim was not to play down the raf , but rather to draw attention to the social environment in which those turbulent events took place . and let 's not forget , they are an issue until today .
just recently a double book edition was published with articles from some 60 scientists who analyzed that period because the raf is a radical byproduct of the disintegration of the left-wing protest movement .
at that time , we tried to sway those who harbored sympathy for the raf and win them over to the rule of law .
and we were successful with that . you were also responsible for passing several harsh anti-terror laws at the time .
do you regret any ?
what would you do differently today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in april 1977 federal prosecutor general siegfried buback was shot and killed by the raf the anti-terror measures were a necessary reaction .
we had to strengthen our police services which were n't in good shape then .
we also had to adapt our courts and legal systems to deal with new criminal behavioral patterns by making changes to our penal code as well as legal procedural code . i admit that some of this partly went too far .
to an extent , there was also a political overreaction to the raf threat .
but we did then dilute some of the measures .
when i took office in 1978 , i also abolished some of the measures used by the police to hunt down raf suspects - a procedure which also hugely affected unsuspecting citizens .
so we did draw certain consequences to deal with the threat of that time . at the same time , it has to be said that since the raf , anti-terror legislation has been continually beefed up , particularly after the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
we 're practically living in a state of permanent emergency where the balance between freedom and security has been damaged and ended up putting curbs on freedom . what lessons do you think germany can draw from the raf era in fighting terrorism today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of schleyer , held hostage by the raf for over a month , became an iconic image of 1970s west germany the most important thing is to maintain calm and not give in to hysteria and populist fear .
politicians should not be allowed to hijack security and turn it into an election topic .
instead the government has to tell the population that we must learn to live with risks .
germany must keep its cool , remain sober and pragmatic and only pass security measures that make real sense instead of symbolic gestures which are passed off as enhanced security for the population but which in reality only curb freedom . nearly 30 years after the raf terrorized west germany , the topic remains highly emotional and sparks strong reactions in germany .
why is that ? that whole period - the reform movements , the struggle for democratic reforms in the political parties , the left-wing protest movement , that whole turbulence and feeling of new beginnings of 1968 , the new policy towards the soviet union - is a fascinating one .
even the people suddenly lived differently at the time , they had a different relationship to sexuality , and art was in a heady heyday .
all that does still fascinate or interest today 's young generation .
a year ago an raf exhibition took place in berlin where artists reacted to the raf .
i promoted the exhibition at the time and it saw a record 50,000 visitors , most of them young people . but that is not to be mistaken as a fascination with the raf , which is only limited .
it 's more an interest in the political spirit of a highly exciting time .
i do n't think that the raf has turned into a myth .
we have to remember that they were murderers , though they were politically motivated . but the majority of the german population is against the release of mohnhaupt and klar .
how do you explain that ? if you follow a simple question pattern - are you for or against the release - then i think you could very quickly even have a situation where the population will be in favor of the death penalty .
this is where a democratic constitutional state has to show some nerve , keep its calm and hold fast to the fundamental principles of the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf 's symbol of a star and a rifle in the 1980s when german president richard von weizsäcker pardoned raf terrorists , it was considered an important gesture .
that is not the case today because the raf and its group of sympathizers no longer exist .
what we need is renewed proof that the german constitutional state is capable of showing mercy . do you think germany will finally close the raf chapter once its last remaining former members are released from prison ? no , not in any way .
we still do n't know the murderers of a whole series of victims after 1985 - for example those of alfred herrhausen -lrb- former deutsche bank chief -rrb- or detlev karsten rohwedder -lrb- leader of the post-reunification government-owned treuhand organization which was responsible for privatizing east german companies . -rrb- and not only do we not know the identity of the perpetrators who are still being hunted , but the interest in the period around 1967 and 1968 still remains very high .
so there is no way the debate will come to an end after the last raf members are released . sonia phalnikar interviewed gerhart baum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : " remorse is not a prerequisite " germany 's newspapers have been debating the possible early release of raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt and the petition for pardon that christian klar , another raf terrorist , submitted to the german president .

the german government says more investment in environmental technology is the way ahead . the german government has announced a 255 million euro -lrb- $ 330.7 million -rrb- boost for research into preventing climate change .
this comes as the un climate panel gave its strongest warning yet that human activities are heating up the planet . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- report released in paris on friday predicts that temperatures are probably going to increase by 1.8 to 4 degrees celsius by the end of the century .
it also said sea levels would probably rise by between 28 and 43 centimeters -lrb- 11 to 17 inches -rrb- . german research minister annette schavan said the cash increase in environmental investment which will be paid over the next three years . it will include 35 million euros for the expansion of the german climate change calculation center . technological solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the melting of ice in the arctic is set to accelerate , endangering the habitats of creatures like polar bears and increasing the probability of flooding schavan stressed the need for technological change based on well-founded scientific research to curb global warming . " to keep climate change within acceptable boundaries we have to carry out intensive research and ensure that climate-friendly technologies are rapidly distributed , " she said . the minister also said an action plan for climate change would soon be made public that centered on human and social needs . " this program will be forward-looking in that it offers technological solutions for the growing economies of our world , " schavan said .
" we will also open up new markets for our economy . " more heat waves and violent cyclones other projections made by the ipcc report include the increasing likelihood of heat waves and violent tropical cyclones , as well as the melting of the artic sea ice in summer by 2100 . the document was much more forceful than its last report in judging whether humans were to blame for climate change .
it said there was at least a 90 per cent probability that activities such as burning fossil fuels accounted for most of the warming over the past 50 years .
in 2001 , it said the link was 66 percent probable . " if you see the extent to which human activities are influencing the climate system , the options for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions appear in a different light , because you can see what the costs of inaction are , " ipcc chairman rajendra pachauri told delegates in paris . humans to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un wants governments to cut down on the use of fossil fuels the head of the un environment program achim steiner said friday would be remembered as the day when the question mark was removed from whether people are to blame for climate change . steiner , whose agency oversees the operation of the kyoto protocol , urged governments to put more effort into getting stalled talks on long-term cuts in carbon dioxide emissions back on track .
no post-2012 targets have yet been set . it is hoped that the united states , the world 's top emitter of greenhouse gases , will , in particular , do more to do cut the burning of fossil fuels in power plants , factories and cars . the us pulled out of the kyoto protocol in 2001 saying emission limits would damage the economy .
us president george w. bush was also critical of the decision to exclude developing nations from the targets during the first phase of the agreement .
china 's booming industry is not bound by kyoto . eu vow to cut emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars are also a contributor to rising carbon dioxide emissions germany has already vowed to make cutting emissions a central aim during its six-month eu presidency .
the german environmental ministry also responded to the news of today 's report saying the european union should continue to push for industrialized nations , including the eu , to agree to a 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020 compared to1990 levels . " climate change is a reality that ca n't be challenged , " said german deputy environment minister michael müller .
" it is already manifesting itself in increasingly extreme events such as heat waves and high levels of precipitation and in the accelerated melting of glaciers and ice caps .
the report confirms the necessity of an ambitious climate policy . " chancellor angela merkel has , however , recently come under fire for apparently backtracking on her pledge to tackle global warming and speaking out against blanket emission levels for new cars . dw staff -lrb- jeg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel opposed to eu plans for car emissions scheme german chancellor merkel said she would resist attempts from the eu commission to impose caps on auto emissions which would apply to all new cars in the bloc .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 02.02.2007 bundestag passes controversial health care overhaul großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many are skeptical that the reform will cure the health care system 's ills germany 's lower house of parliament has passed a controversial plan to reform the country 's health care system .
the legislation passed despite " no " votes from dozens of members of the coalition parties . the bundestag on friday approved the legislation with 378 votes , while 208 lawmakers said " no " to the changes to the public health care system .
thus , at least 40 parliamentarians from the ruling coalition parties , the christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , rejected the reform . health minister ulla schmidt said she was satisfied with the result . " it 's a good majority , " she said on friday . the bundesrat , germany 's upper chamber of parliament , will vote on the legislation on feb .
16 , and is also expected to approve it .
the law will come into effect on april 1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors protested against the changes .
" stinginess makes you sick , " read their backs the reform 's original aim was to cut non-labor wage costs , which contribute to the high price of german workers .
however , public health insurance companies raised their premiums during the long months of discussion before the reform passed .
both employers and employees were forced to pay more , jacking up non-wage labor costs .
lowest common denominator angela merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister party , the csu , initially wanted to cap employers ' contributions , which the social democrats opposed .
instead , the spd wanted a broader segment of society to be required to contribute to the system of solidarity that covers nearly 90 percent of germany 's residents .
the party demanded that civil servants , high earners and the self-employed also contribute to the public health insurance companies .
unlike the rest of society , those three groups are allowed to have private insurance plans , and most of them do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt was unable to push through her desires health minister schmidt , a social democrat , wanted private insurance to be available for everyone .
private insurers provide more services and allow more flexibility than the 252 public health insurance companies .
but the cdu / csu rejected schmidt 's plan .
in the end , the governing coalition of conservatives and social democrats agreed on the lowest common denominator .
still , merkel declared it a breakthrough . " the measures aim to improve the quality of providers , increase the choice and decision-making chances of the people insured , and altogether ensure a clearer picture of economy , transparency , competition and the financial viability of the health care system , " she said in july , when the coalition partners announced the compromise they had agreed upon . the heart of the reform is the so-called " health fund . "
from 2009 , all contributions to the public health insurance companies as well as state subsidies are supposed to be paid into this new fund .
the companies will levy a standard premium for everyone , and if the money they are allocated from the health fund does n't cover their costs , they will be able to charge the people they insure a supplement .
insurers who use their funds efficiently and do n't demand more money of their clients will thus be more appealing to the public .
lack of enthusiasm germany is the only country in the world that , in essence , has two separate health care systems - the private and public systems .
the reform will make it more difficult for people to be eligible for private insurance .
they will only be allowed to switch from a public to a private insurance company if they earn 3,975 euros -lrb- $ 5,155 -rrb- per month for three years . the changes also require everyone in germany to have health insurance by 2009 .
an estimated 200,000 residents are n't currently covered .
in the future , people who fall ill and are n't insured will be obliged to pay back health insurance premiums for up to five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospital staff is concerned that is will get harder to make ends meet the overhaul has n't provoked enthusiasm anywhere in germany - not from politicians , the insurance companies , health care professionals or patients .
up to the final days before the bundestag voted on the measures , the insurance companies lobbied the government to reform the reform .
they argued that the changes would n't resolve the public health care system 's financial problems , patients would carry a greater burden than now , bureaucracy would be increased and competition limited . " if this is a reform , then reform is a dirty word , " said reinhard bütiköfer , head of the green party opposition in the bundestag .
" it is the first so-called health care system reform in which it is a foregone conclusion that everything will be more expensive for the people who are insured . " dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german doctors prepare more protests against health reforms during a national day of action monday , german doctors ' and health federations announced that there would be more industrial action to come as the government 's controversial health reforms prepare to become law in april .

chancellor angela merkel put health care reform at the top of her government 's agenda .

" the convergence between the united states and europe started last year , but us growth will remain stronger thanks to more dynamic demographics and a bigger working population , " morgan stanley economist eric chaney said . but in the short term , europe 's growth prospects are looking up . surviving the vat hike after a particularly strong showing in 2006 , the 13 countries sharing the euro currency were expected to see growth slow this year , in part due to an increase in german value added tax and a us slowdown . but a barrage of data published wednesday showed that the vat hike in germany , europe 's biggest economy , has had only a negligible effect while us growth is proving stronger than expected . as a result , many economists now expect any slowdown in european growth to be relatively small . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the euro is coming to poland - but when ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice paved the way for merkel to go without a headscarf " the times have changed , foreign guests are not obliged to wear the headscarf any more , " a saudi journalist explained .

however , his religion has not prevented him from shaking hands with female politicians from foreign countries .

her meetings will focus primarily on economic questions , the middle east , violence in iraq and other perennial regional issues . the chancellor 's trip , which begins on saturday in egypt , will take her to saudi arabia on sunday and then on to kuwait and the emirate states of abu dhabi and dubai .

8 , its director seems worried about well-funded competitors on the festival circuit .
experts say that he need n't lose too much sleep over it . it was an entry fit for a movie star : surrounded by a cloud of flashbulbs , berlinale director dieter kosslick appeared before a few hundred journalists on tuesday to present the program for this year 's festival - the 57th of its kind .
he talked about record movie entries -lrb- some 5,000 -rrb- , a booming film market and a new event called " culinary cinema " that features screenings followed by a gourmet meal . known for his abominable english skills , kosslick had the room roaring with laughter when he recounted how he managed to convince clint eastwood to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is kosslick really worried about new festivals ?
" i 'm dieter from ze cherman film festival , " he introduced himself after mistaking eastwood for a friend in la .
apparently it did the trick . but off the stage , in a recent interview , kosslick did n't seem to be in the mood for jokes . " things are getting more and more complicated when it comes to film festivals , " kosslick told german daily die welt .
" there 's a boom in festivals and a boom in film markets , with millions invested in them . " nouveau riche competitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress isabella rossellini came to rome 's festival , but she will also come to berlin he was talking about a new generation of events that have sprung up around the globe in recent years .
in europe , cinema .
festa internazionale di roma just premiered with a rumored budget of 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26 million -rrb- last october .
in asia , festivals in bangkok and pusan -lrb- south korea -rrb- are increasingly getting attention .
and then there 's the three-year-old dubai international film festival -lrb- diff -rrb- , which kosslick also does n't think of too highly . " i know that ... rome and dubai buy stars with big money to put on festivals for an audience , " he told german trade magazine promedia .
" the big competitors that have a lot of money are increasingly turning into marketing events . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dubai will focus on arab film makers not so , said chris paton , a diff spokesman , who rejected the allegation that officials in dubai paid stars to attend . " while their hospitality can be on a very grand scale , they do n't pay straight-out fees , " he said , adding that free first-class flights and deluxe accommodation arrangements were necessary to convince hollywood greats to make the 23-hour journey . " if you want american stars to travel such a distance , of course you have to treat them in the right way , " paton said . the a-list clout he added that diff was more interested in establishing itself as an important regional hub than competing with one of " the three grande dames " : berlin , cannes and venice . others agreed that kosslick should n't worry too much about losing out because of the likes of rome or dubai . " i do n't think there is real competition , " said bruno chatelin , the paris-based co-founder of filmfestivals.com and a former film studio marketing executive .
" producers know the difference between being selected in dubai and being selected in berlin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they still do wonders to a movie 's selling power thorsten schaumann , the head of germany 's leading film distributor bavaria film international , agreed that recognition in berlin was highly valuable for a movie . " the berlinale is certainly the first big a-festival of the year for us to meet all the buyers , " said schaumann , who has two films competing for the festival 's coveted golden bear trophy . " it 's one of the most important , if not the most important festivals for us , " he added .
" that 's a status that can not be taken away . " but that 's not to say that some of the newcomers are n't welcome additions to the year-round festival circus . " rome 's an important platform for us as well , " schaumann said .
" we need a european market at the end of the year . " a healthy dose of arrogance in the end , berlinale director kosslick 's comments might have been nothing more than a clever trick to position his festival . " he 's discrediting the others by relegating them to a different league , " said thorsten hennig-thurau , who is professor for marketing and media research at weimar 's bauhaus university .
" he can do that , but i do n't think that 's what matters in the end . " what will matter is whether kosslick and his berlinale colleagues will manage to secure their hard-earned place among the world 's top film festivals by continuing to convince stars and movie producers to come to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now that 's more like it , dieter " let them open -lrb- their festivals -rrb- - we 'll be better , " hennig-thurau suggested as a more proactive approach . kosslick might have already gotten the hint . " i 'm quite confident that we have the right concept with our mix of film market , red carpet , dedicated cinema and promotion of young talents , " he told promedia . come next friday , he 'll get a chance to prove it again . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin film festival line-up complete four films from asia , two from latin america and one from israel along with a large contingent of movies from north america and europe form the line-up of entries at the berlinale .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice paved the way for merkel to go without a headscarf " the times have changed , foreign guests are not obliged to wear the headscarf any more , " a saudi journalist explained .
" all the same , camilla , the wife of prince charles , wore a headscarf during her visit last year . " former british prime minister margaret thatcher and former us secretary of state madeleine albright also opted to cover their heads for riyadh talks during their times in office . saudi king abdullah is a strict muslim .
however , his religion has not prevented him from shaking hands with female politicians from foreign countries .
whirlwind visit in saudi arabia - where women are not permitted to drive and require the written consent of their male " custodians " for every important decision - even a handshake is a radical gesture with which all saudis would not agree .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are banned from driving in saudi arabia although some saudi women have inherited positions of influence or are highly respected for their business activities , no women have ascended to powerful positions in the country . talks with other women are not on merkel 's agenda , which is hardly surprising considering the brevity of her trip .
her meetings will focus primarily on economic questions , the middle east , violence in iraq and other perennial regional issues . the chancellor 's trip , which begins on saturday in egypt , will take her to saudi arabia on sunday and then on to kuwait and the emirate states of abu dhabi and dubai .
in egypt , she is scheduled to have a quick look at the pyramids of giza by night . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian constitutional court upholds headscarf ban the highest court in the southern german state of bavaria decided on monday that the state did not overstep its authority by banning muslim teachers from wearing headscarves in the classroom .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice paved the way for merkel to go without a headscarf " the times have changed , foreign guests are not obliged to wear the headscarf any more , " a saudi journalist explained .

" former british prime minister margaret thatcher and former us secretary of state madeleine albright also opted to cover their heads for riyadh talks during their times in office . saudi king abdullah is a strict muslim .
however , his religion has not prevented him from shaking hands with female politicians from foreign countries .
whirlwind visit in saudi arabia - where women are not permitted to drive and require the written consent of their male " custodians " for every important decision - even a handshake is a radical gesture with which all saudis would not agree .

her meetings will focus primarily on economic questions , the middle east , violence in iraq and other perennial regional issues . the chancellor 's trip , which begins on saturday in egypt , will take her to saudi arabia on sunday and then on to kuwait and the emirate states of abu dhabi and dubai .

"
as a member in swift 's oversight committee the european union 's central bank had to take responsibility in ensuring the transaction network complies with eu privacy laws , he said . " just as other banks , the ecb can not escape some responsibilities in the swift case which has breached the trust and private lives of many millions of people , " said hustinx . " secret , routine and massive access of third country authorities to banking data is unacceptable , " he added in a statement accompanying his final report on the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swift headquarters in belgium swift , the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication , based outside brussels , is used for global bank transactions of more than 11 million euros -lrb- $ 14 million -rrb- daily .

ecb rejects responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb chief trichet says data protection at swift is outside the bank 's remit the european central bank swiftly issued its own press release in which it said that " the monitoring of swift activities that do not affect financial stability is not a matter for central bank oversight . " " the request by the european data protection supervisor to bring data protection compliance within the remit of central bank oversight would not be in line with the allocation of legal responsibilities , " the bank added . the ecb has investigated possible options to using swift services and has had to conclude that at this stage no feasible alternatives , it said . in response to concerns voiced by european lawmakers , ecb chief jean-claude trichet said in a letter on wednesday that the eu and the us need to clarify the line between fighting terrorism and terror protection , reuters reported . " the main issue at stake is to find ways to reconcile eu and non-eu data protection legislation , as well as to maintain a proper balance between such legislation and the legal instruments applied tin the fight against terrorism , " he wrote .

his difficult and uncertain mission is of paramount importance , not only for the balkans , but the eu in general , says dw 's verica spasovska . united nations envoy martti ahtisaari has taken on a difficult mission .
its success - with serbs and albanians heavily entrenched in their positions - is highly uncertain .
ahtisaari 's visit to belgrade was made even more explosive when serbian prime minister vojsilav kostunica refused to meet with him - supposedly because he is in the midst of a complicated process of building a new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verica spasovska at the same time , kostunica is threatening to break off diplomatic relations with those countries that want to recognize kosovo .
in this precarious moment , kostuncia seems to be trying to shun political responsibility . the eu has been implying for months that the kosovo proposal could lead to independence , even if drastically limited , yet kostunica has so far lacked courage to prepare the serbian population for the possible loss of the province . kosovo albanians , on the other hand , are increasing the pressure on the west by postulating unlimited independence as something non-negotiable .
this is only hiking up the expectations of the population .
over the past few years , kosovo albanians have learned that the west is backing away from its political demands and giving in to riots and violence . after the massive riots three years ago , the eu gave up its postulate " standards before status . "
the eu is no longer demanding that the democratic rules of engagement be established and minorities protected before the status is determined .
since violence was rewarded with political concessions , one can possibly expect a new escalation of violence if all the demands of kosovo albanians are not met .
the international peace / keeping troops have been placed on heightened alert . the eu is in a tight spot .
it must find a face-saving solution for both parties that everybody would support .
that is why the word " independence " has not been in circulation for days .
on the other hand , serbia 's sovereignty is also not mentioned any more . the only way out of this dilemma lies in the clear eu accession perspectives for the serbs and the albanians .
both conflicting parties know that their economic and political development is coupled with eu membership and that they have to rely on the eu .
it must be made clear to both the serbs and the albanians that it is paradoxical for them to insist on sovereignty when they will sooner or later give up parts of that sovereignty to the eu .
they have to understand that at the very least that 's why the use of violence is not worth it . for the european union , kosovo is an elementary challenge : the eu has to manage this conflict successfully if it is to show that it is capable of a uniform foreign policy . verica spasovska is head of dw-radio 's program for central and southeastern europe -lrb- tt -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de del ponte warns eu against resuming talks with serbia carla del ponte , the un chief prosecutor for war crimes in the former yugoslavia , on wednesday warned the eu against resuming cooperation talks with serbia , saying key fugitives must first be arrested .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice paved the way for merkel to go without a headscarf " the times have changed , foreign guests are not obliged to wear the headscarf any more , " a saudi journalist explained .
" all the same , camilla , the wife of prince charles , wore a headscarf during her visit last year . " former british prime minister margaret thatcher and former us secretary of state madeleine albright also opted to cover their heads for riyadh talks during their times in office . saudi king abdullah is a strict muslim .
however , his religion has not prevented him from shaking hands with female politicians from foreign countries .
whirlwind visit in saudi arabia - where women are not permitted to drive and require the written consent of their male " custodians " for every important decision - even a handshake is a radical gesture with which all saudis would not agree .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are banned from driving in saudi arabia although some saudi women have inherited positions of influence or are highly respected for their business activities , no women have ascended to powerful positions in the country . talks with other women are not on merkel 's agenda , which is hardly surprising considering the brevity of her trip .
her meetings will focus primarily on economic questions , the middle east , violence in iraq and other perennial regional issues . the chancellor 's trip , which begins on saturday in egypt , will take her to saudi arabia on sunday and then on to kuwait and the emirate states of abu dhabi and dubai .

the legislation passed despite " no " votes from dozens of members of the coalition parties . the bundestag on friday approved the legislation with 378 votes , while 208 lawmakers said " no " to the changes to the public health care system .
thus , at least 40 parliamentarians from the ruling coalition parties , the christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , rejected the reform . health minister ulla schmidt said she was satisfied with the result . " it 's a good majority , " she said on friday . the bundesrat , germany 's upper chamber of parliament , will vote on the legislation on feb .
16 , and is also expected to approve it .
the law will come into effect on april 1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors protested against the changes .
" stinginess makes you sick , " read their backs the reform 's original aim was to cut non-labor wage costs , which contribute to the high price of german workers .
however , public health insurance companies raised their premiums during the long months of discussion before the reform passed .
both employers and employees were forced to pay more , jacking up non-wage labor costs .
lowest common denominator angela merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister party , the csu , initially wanted to cap employers ' contributions , which the social democrats opposed .
instead , the spd wanted a broader segment of society to be required to contribute to the system of solidarity that covers nearly 90 percent of germany 's residents .
the party demanded that civil servants , high earners and the self-employed also contribute to the public health insurance companies .
unlike the rest of society , those three groups are allowed to have private insurance plans , and most of them do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt was unable to push through her desires health minister schmidt , a social democrat , wanted private insurance to be available for everyone .
private insurers provide more services and allow more flexibility than the 252 public health insurance companies .
but the cdu / csu rejected schmidt 's plan .
in the end , the governing coalition of conservatives and social democrats agreed on the lowest common denominator .
still , merkel declared it a breakthrough . " the measures aim to improve the quality of providers , increase the choice and decision-making chances of the people insured , and altogether ensure a clearer picture of economy , transparency , competition and the financial viability of the health care system , " she said in july , when the coalition partners announced the compromise they had agreed upon . the heart of the reform is the so-called " health fund . "
from 2009 , all contributions to the public health insurance companies as well as state subsidies are supposed to be paid into this new fund .
the companies will levy a standard premium for everyone , and if the money they are allocated from the health fund does n't cover their costs , they will be able to charge the people they insure a supplement .
insurers who use their funds efficiently and do n't demand more money of their clients will thus be more appealing to the public .
lack of enthusiasm germany is the only country in the world that , in essence , has two separate health care systems - the private and public systems .
the reform will make it more difficult for people to be eligible for private insurance .
they will only be allowed to switch from a public to a private insurance company if they earn 3,975 euros -lrb- $ 5,155 -rrb- per month for three years . the changes also require everyone in germany to have health insurance by 2009 .
an estimated 200,000 residents are n't currently covered .
in the future , people who fall ill and are n't insured will be obliged to pay back health insurance premiums for up to five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospital staff is concerned that is will get harder to make ends meet the overhaul has n't provoked enthusiasm anywhere in germany - not from politicians , the insurance companies , health care professionals or patients .
up to the final days before the bundestag voted on the measures , the insurance companies lobbied the government to reform the reform .
they argued that the changes would n't resolve the public health care system 's financial problems , patients would carry a greater burden than now , bureaucracy would be increased and competition limited . " if this is a reform , then reform is a dirty word , " said reinhard bütiköfer , head of the green party opposition in the bundestag .

as a member in swift 's oversight committee the european union 's central bank had to take responsibility in ensuring the transaction network complies with eu privacy laws , he said . " just as other banks , the ecb can not escape some responsibilities in the swift case which has breached the trust and private lives of many millions of people , " said hustinx . " secret , routine and massive access of third country authorities to banking data is unacceptable , " he added in a statement accompanying his final report on the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swift headquarters in belgium swift , the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication , based outside brussels , is used for global bank transactions of more than 11 million euros -lrb- $ 14 million -rrb- daily .
it is a cooperative owned by the nearly 8,000 financial institutions in the more than 200 countries that use it . swift officials admitted in june that it had provided us authorities with a " limited " amount of data in the wake of the sept .
11 terror attacks in 2001 but insisted it had done its utmost to protect privacy . under eu data protection rules , information on money transfers can be used only for banking purposes , and not for other uses , such as investigations into terrorism financing . the european data watchdog does have teeth , and if it is not satisfied by the ecb 's response by april it could takes measures including blocking the transfer of data or taking the case to an eu court .
ecb rejects responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb chief trichet says data protection at swift is outside the bank 's remit the european central bank swiftly issued its own press release in which it said that " the monitoring of swift activities that do not affect financial stability is not a matter for central bank oversight . " " the request by the european data protection supervisor to bring data protection compliance within the remit of central bank oversight would not be in line with the allocation of legal responsibilities , " the bank added . the ecb has investigated possible options to using swift services and has had to conclude that at this stage no feasible alternatives , it said . in response to concerns voiced by european lawmakers , ecb chief jean-claude trichet said in a letter on wednesday that the eu and the us need to clarify the line between fighting terrorism and terror protection , reuters reported . " the main issue at stake is to find ways to reconcile eu and non-eu data protection legislation , as well as to maintain a proper balance between such legislation and the legal instruments applied tin the fight against terrorism , " he wrote .

the german government says more investment in environmental technology is the way ahead . the german government has announced a 255 million euro -lrb- $ 330.7 million -rrb- boost for research into preventing climate change .
this comes as the un climate panel gave its strongest warning yet that human activities are heating up the planet . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- report released in paris on friday predicts that temperatures are probably going to increase by 1.8 to 4 degrees celsius by the end of the century .
it also said sea levels would probably rise by between 28 and 43 centimeters -lrb- 11 to 17 inches -rrb- . german research minister annette schavan said the cash increase in environmental investment which will be paid over the next three years . it will include 35 million euros for the expansion of the german climate change calculation center . technological solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the melting of ice in the arctic is set to accelerate , endangering the habitats of creatures like polar bears and increasing the probability of flooding schavan stressed the need for technological change based on well-founded scientific research to curb global warming . " to keep climate change within acceptable boundaries we have to carry out intensive research and ensure that climate-friendly technologies are rapidly distributed , " she said . the minister also said an action plan for climate change would soon be made public that centered on human and social needs . " this program will be forward-looking in that it offers technological solutions for the growing economies of our world , " schavan said .
" we will also open up new markets for our economy . " more heat waves and violent cyclones other projections made by the ipcc report include the increasing likelihood of heat waves and violent tropical cyclones , as well as the melting of the artic sea ice in summer by 2100 . the document was much more forceful than its last report in judging whether humans were to blame for climate change .
it said there was at least a 90 per cent probability that activities such as burning fossil fuels accounted for most of the warming over the past 50 years .
in 2001 , it said the link was 66 percent probable . " if you see the extent to which human activities are influencing the climate system , the options for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions appear in a different light , because you can see what the costs of inaction are , " ipcc chairman rajendra pachauri told delegates in paris . humans to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un wants governments to cut down on the use of fossil fuels the head of the un environment program achim steiner said friday would be remembered as the day when the question mark was removed from whether people are to blame for climate change . steiner , whose agency oversees the operation of the kyoto protocol , urged governments to put more effort into getting stalled talks on long-term cuts in carbon dioxide emissions back on track .
no post-2012 targets have yet been set . it is hoped that the united states , the world 's top emitter of greenhouse gases , will , in particular , do more to do cut the burning of fossil fuels in power plants , factories and cars . the us pulled out of the kyoto protocol in 2001 saying emission limits would damage the economy .
us president george w. bush was also critical of the decision to exclude developing nations from the targets during the first phase of the agreement .
china 's booming industry is not bound by kyoto . eu vow to cut emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars are also a contributor to rising carbon dioxide emissions germany has already vowed to make cutting emissions a central aim during its six-month eu presidency .
the german environmental ministry also responded to the news of today 's report saying the european union should continue to push for industrialized nations , including the eu , to agree to a 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020 compared to1990 levels . " climate change is a reality that ca n't be challenged , " said german deputy environment minister michael müller .
" it is already manifesting itself in increasingly extreme events such as heat waves and high levels of precipitation and in the accelerated melting of glaciers and ice caps .
the report confirms the necessity of an ambitious climate policy . " chancellor angela merkel has , however , recently come under fire for apparently backtracking on her pledge to tackle global warming and speaking out against blanket emission levels for new cars . dw staff -lrb- jeg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel opposed to eu plans for car emissions scheme german chancellor merkel said she would resist attempts from the eu commission to impose caps on auto emissions which would apply to all new cars in the bloc .

the legislation passed despite " no " votes from dozens of members of the coalition parties . the bundestag on friday approved the legislation with 378 votes , while 208 lawmakers said " no " to the changes to the public health care system .
thus , at least 40 parliamentarians from the ruling coalition parties , the christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , rejected the reform . health minister ulla schmidt said she was satisfied with the result . " it 's a good majority , " she said on friday . the bundesrat , germany 's upper chamber of parliament , will vote on the legislation on feb .
16 , and is also expected to approve it .
the law will come into effect on april 1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors protested against the changes .
" stinginess makes you sick , " read their backs the reform 's original aim was to cut non-labor wage costs , which contribute to the high price of german workers .
however , public health insurance companies raised their premiums during the long months of discussion before the reform passed .
both employers and employees were forced to pay more , jacking up non-wage labor costs .
lowest common denominator angela merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister party , the csu , initially wanted to cap employers ' contributions , which the social democrats opposed .
instead , the spd wanted a broader segment of society to be required to contribute to the system of solidarity that covers nearly 90 percent of germany 's residents .
the party demanded that civil servants , high earners and the self-employed also contribute to the public health insurance companies .
unlike the rest of society , those three groups are allowed to have private insurance plans , and most of them do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt was unable to push through her desires health minister schmidt , a social democrat , wanted private insurance to be available for everyone .
private insurers provide more services and allow more flexibility than the 252 public health insurance companies .
but the cdu / csu rejected schmidt 's plan .
in the end , the governing coalition of conservatives and social democrats agreed on the lowest common denominator .
still , merkel declared it a breakthrough . " the measures aim to improve the quality of providers , increase the choice and decision-making chances of the people insured , and altogether ensure a clearer picture of economy , transparency , competition and the financial viability of the health care system , " she said in july , when the coalition partners announced the compromise they had agreed upon . the heart of the reform is the so-called " health fund . "
from 2009 , all contributions to the public health insurance companies as well as state subsidies are supposed to be paid into this new fund .
the companies will levy a standard premium for everyone , and if the money they are allocated from the health fund does n't cover their costs , they will be able to charge the people they insure a supplement .
insurers who use their funds efficiently and do n't demand more money of their clients will thus be more appealing to the public .
lack of enthusiasm germany is the only country in the world that , in essence , has two separate health care systems - the private and public systems .
the reform will make it more difficult for people to be eligible for private insurance .
they will only be allowed to switch from a public to a private insurance company if they earn 3,975 euros -lrb- $ 5,155 -rrb- per month for three years . the changes also require everyone in germany to have health insurance by 2009 .
an estimated 200,000 residents are n't currently covered .
in the future , people who fall ill and are n't insured will be obliged to pay back health insurance premiums for up to five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospital staff is concerned that is will get harder to make ends meet the overhaul has n't provoked enthusiasm anywhere in germany - not from politicians , the insurance companies , health care professionals or patients .
up to the final days before the bundestag voted on the measures , the insurance companies lobbied the government to reform the reform .
they argued that the changes would n't resolve the public health care system 's financial problems , patients would carry a greater burden than now , bureaucracy would be increased and competition limited . " if this is a reform , then reform is a dirty word , " said reinhard bütiköfer , head of the green party opposition in the bundestag .

the german government says more investment in environmental technology is the way ahead . the german government has announced a 255 million euro -lrb- $ 330.7 million -rrb- boost for research into preventing climate change .
this comes as the un climate panel gave its strongest warning yet that human activities are heating up the planet . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- report released in paris on friday predicts that temperatures are probably going to increase by 1.8 to 4 degrees celsius by the end of the century .
it also said sea levels would probably rise by between 28 and 43 centimeters -lrb- 11 to 17 inches -rrb- . german research minister annette schavan said the cash increase in environmental investment which will be paid over the next three years . it will include 35 million euros for the expansion of the german climate change calculation center . technological solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the melting of ice in the arctic is set to accelerate , endangering the habitats of creatures like polar bears and increasing the probability of flooding schavan stressed the need for technological change based on well-founded scientific research to curb global warming . " to keep climate change within acceptable boundaries we have to carry out intensive research and ensure that climate-friendly technologies are rapidly distributed , " she said . the minister also said an action plan for climate change would soon be made public that centered on human and social needs .

in 2001 , it said the link was 66 percent probable .

no post-2012 targets have yet been set . it is hoped that the united states , the world 's top emitter of greenhouse gases , will , in particular , do more to do cut the burning of fossil fuels in power plants , factories and cars . the us pulled out of the kyoto protocol in 2001 saying emission limits would damage the economy .

" climate change is a reality that ca n't be challenged , " said german deputy environment minister michael müller .

the german government says more investment in environmental technology is the way ahead . the german government has announced a 255 million euro -lrb- $ 330.7 million -rrb- boost for research into preventing climate change .
this comes as the un climate panel gave its strongest warning yet that human activities are heating up the planet . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- report released in paris on friday predicts that temperatures are probably going to increase by 1.8 to 4 degrees celsius by the end of the century .
it also said sea levels would probably rise by between 28 and 43 centimeters -lrb- 11 to 17 inches -rrb- . german research minister annette schavan said the cash increase in environmental investment which will be paid over the next three years . it will include 35 million euros for the expansion of the german climate change calculation center . technological solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the melting of ice in the arctic is set to accelerate , endangering the habitats of creatures like polar bears and increasing the probability of flooding schavan stressed the need for technological change based on well-founded scientific research to curb global warming . " to keep climate change within acceptable boundaries we have to carry out intensive research and ensure that climate-friendly technologies are rapidly distributed , " she said . the minister also said an action plan for climate change would soon be made public that centered on human and social needs . " this program will be forward-looking in that it offers technological solutions for the growing economies of our world , " schavan said .
" we will also open up new markets for our economy . " more heat waves and violent cyclones other projections made by the ipcc report include the increasing likelihood of heat waves and violent tropical cyclones , as well as the melting of the artic sea ice in summer by 2100 . the document was much more forceful than its last report in judging whether humans were to blame for climate change .
it said there was at least a 90 per cent probability that activities such as burning fossil fuels accounted for most of the warming over the past 50 years .
in 2001 , it said the link was 66 percent probable . " if you see the extent to which human activities are influencing the climate system , the options for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions appear in a different light , because you can see what the costs of inaction are , " ipcc chairman rajendra pachauri told delegates in paris . humans to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un wants governments to cut down on the use of fossil fuels the head of the un environment program achim steiner said friday would be remembered as the day when the question mark was removed from whether people are to blame for climate change . steiner , whose agency oversees the operation of the kyoto protocol , urged governments to put more effort into getting stalled talks on long-term cuts in carbon dioxide emissions back on track .
no post-2012 targets have yet been set . it is hoped that the united states , the world 's top emitter of greenhouse gases , will , in particular , do more to do cut the burning of fossil fuels in power plants , factories and cars . the us pulled out of the kyoto protocol in 2001 saying emission limits would damage the economy .
us president george w. bush was also critical of the decision to exclude developing nations from the targets during the first phase of the agreement .
china 's booming industry is not bound by kyoto . eu vow to cut emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars are also a contributor to rising carbon dioxide emissions germany has already vowed to make cutting emissions a central aim during its six-month eu presidency .
the german environmental ministry also responded to the news of today 's report saying the european union should continue to push for industrialized nations , including the eu , to agree to a 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020 compared to1990 levels . " climate change is a reality that ca n't be challenged , " said german deputy environment minister michael müller .
" it is already manifesting itself in increasingly extreme events such as heat waves and high levels of precipitation and in the accelerated melting of glaciers and ice caps .
the report confirms the necessity of an ambitious climate policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 02.02.2007 bundestag passes controversial health care overhaul großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many are skeptical that the reform will cure the health care system 's ills germany 's lower house of parliament has passed a controversial plan to reform the country 's health care system .
the legislation passed despite " no " votes from dozens of members of the coalition parties . the bundestag on friday approved the legislation with 378 votes , while 208 lawmakers said " no " to the changes to the public health care system .
thus , at least 40 parliamentarians from the ruling coalition parties , the christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , rejected the reform . health minister ulla schmidt said she was satisfied with the result . " it 's a good majority , " she said on friday . the bundesrat , germany 's upper chamber of parliament , will vote on the legislation on feb .
16 , and is also expected to approve it .
the law will come into effect on april 1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors protested against the changes .
" stinginess makes you sick , " read their backs the reform 's original aim was to cut non-labor wage costs , which contribute to the high price of german workers .
however , public health insurance companies raised their premiums during the long months of discussion before the reform passed .
both employers and employees were forced to pay more , jacking up non-wage labor costs .
lowest common denominator angela merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister party , the csu , initially wanted to cap employers ' contributions , which the social democrats opposed .
instead , the spd wanted a broader segment of society to be required to contribute to the system of solidarity that covers nearly 90 percent of germany 's residents .
the party demanded that civil servants , high earners and the self-employed also contribute to the public health insurance companies .
unlike the rest of society , those three groups are allowed to have private insurance plans , and most of them do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt was unable to push through her desires health minister schmidt , a social democrat , wanted private insurance to be available for everyone .
private insurers provide more services and allow more flexibility than the 252 public health insurance companies .
but the cdu / csu rejected schmidt 's plan .
in the end , the governing coalition of conservatives and social democrats agreed on the lowest common denominator .
still , merkel declared it a breakthrough . " the measures aim to improve the quality of providers , increase the choice and decision-making chances of the people insured , and altogether ensure a clearer picture of economy , transparency , competition and the financial viability of the health care system , " she said in july , when the coalition partners announced the compromise they had agreed upon . the heart of the reform is the so-called " health fund . "
from 2009 , all contributions to the public health insurance companies as well as state subsidies are supposed to be paid into this new fund .
the companies will levy a standard premium for everyone , and if the money they are allocated from the health fund does n't cover their costs , they will be able to charge the people they insure a supplement .
insurers who use their funds efficiently and do n't demand more money of their clients will thus be more appealing to the public .
lack of enthusiasm germany is the only country in the world that , in essence , has two separate health care systems - the private and public systems .
the reform will make it more difficult for people to be eligible for private insurance .
they will only be allowed to switch from a public to a private insurance company if they earn 3,975 euros -lrb- $ 5,155 -rrb- per month for three years . the changes also require everyone in germany to have health insurance by 2009 .
an estimated 200,000 residents are n't currently covered .
in the future , people who fall ill and are n't insured will be obliged to pay back health insurance premiums for up to five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospital staff is concerned that is will get harder to make ends meet the overhaul has n't provoked enthusiasm anywhere in germany - not from politicians , the insurance companies , health care professionals or patients .
up to the final days before the bundestag voted on the measures , the insurance companies lobbied the government to reform the reform .
they argued that the changes would n't resolve the public health care system 's financial problems , patients would carry a greater burden than now , bureaucracy would be increased and competition limited . " if this is a reform , then reform is a dirty word , " said reinhard bütiköfer , head of the green party opposition in the bundestag .
" it is the first so-called health care system reform in which it is a foregone conclusion that everything will be more expensive for the people who are insured .

"
as a member in swift 's oversight committee the european union 's central bank had to take responsibility in ensuring the transaction network complies with eu privacy laws , he said . " just as other banks , the ecb can not escape some responsibilities in the swift case which has breached the trust and private lives of many millions of people , " said hustinx . " secret , routine and massive access of third country authorities to banking data is unacceptable , " he added in a statement accompanying his final report on the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swift headquarters in belgium swift , the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication , based outside brussels , is used for global bank transactions of more than 11 million euros -lrb- $ 14 million -rrb- daily .

11 terror attacks in 2001 but insisted it had done its utmost to protect privacy . under eu data protection rules , information on money transfers can be used only for banking purposes , and not for other uses , such as investigations into terrorism financing . the european data watchdog does have teeth , and if it is not satisfied by the ecb 's response by april it could takes measures including blocking the transfer of data or taking the case to an eu court .
ecb rejects responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb chief trichet says data protection at swift is outside the bank 's remit the european central bank swiftly issued its own press release in which it said that " the monitoring of swift activities that do not affect financial stability is not a matter for central bank oversight . " " the request by the european data protection supervisor to bring data protection compliance within the remit of central bank oversight would not be in line with the allocation of legal responsibilities , " the bank added . the ecb has investigated possible options to using swift services and has had to conclude that at this stage no feasible alternatives , it said . in response to concerns voiced by european lawmakers , ecb chief jean-claude trichet said in a letter on wednesday that the eu and the us need to clarify the line between fighting terrorism and terror protection , reuters reported . " the main issue at stake is to find ways to reconcile eu and non-eu data protection legislation , as well as to maintain a proper balance between such legislation and the legal instruments applied tin the fight against terrorism , " he wrote .

gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison . nearly 30 years after left-wing radical group , raf -lrb- red army faction -rrb- terrorized west germany , federal prosecutors have filed a request for the release of brigitte mohnhaupt , a leading raf member who was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 for her role in a series of prominent murders .
separately , german president horst köhler is considering a pardon for mohnhaupt 's former colleague , christian klar who is serving a life sentence for at least 11 killings . the moves have sparked a furious debate in germany pitting outraged relatives of the raf 's victims against politicians who say the killers have done their time and no longer pose a threat to society . dw-world.de spoke with gerhart baum , former interior minister of germany and a member of the free-market liberal fdp party .
baum is a prominent advocate of releasing the prisoners . dw-world.de : why are you in favor of releasing mohnhaupt and klar from prison ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhart baum wants former raf prisoners to be released gerhart baum : that 's because i respect the principles of our constitutional state and believe they must be applied to the raf terrorists too .
they should not be given any special status , either in the negative or positive sense .
at the time -lrb- of their arrest -rrb- we refused to treat them as prisoners of the war as they wanted .
the raf terrorists are criminals and murderers and must be treated like any other criminals in a comparable case . we also need to make a distinction between the two .
in mohnhaupt 's case , it 's about releasing her on parole .
with christian klar , it 's about him being pardoned by the german president .
both cases are being reviewed by the authorities who will eventually make a decision . christian klar was given a triple life sentence .
can you explain what " life imprisonment " means in a strictly legal sense in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar is in prison for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder it does not mean literally for life .
there is no life-long imprisonment in practice unless the perpetrators are deemed dangerous and remain dangerous .
according to our laws , a life sentence is reviewed after 15 years for the first time .
and one of the fundamental principles of our legal system - which has been repeatedly reaffirmed by the country 's highest court - is that human dignity , as it is laid down in the constitution , also means that a person who is sentenced to life imprisonment must be given a perspective for freedom . those who oppose releasing mohnhaupt and klar say the two have neither shown any remorse nor contributed towards clearing up a series of unsolved murders . that 's precisely why mohnhaupt and klar have been punished so severely .
their sentences represent the toughest legal verdicts ever passed for raf terrorists .
they did n't show any remorse and they did n't cooperate in solving crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte mohnhaupt has never shown any contrition but we have to be clear on the point that according to german law , remorse is n't demanded .
it 's desirable , but it is n't necessary .
in the case of christian klar , who has appealed to the german president for clemency , it 's a different matter .
there i expect klar to distance himself from his crimes .
he has apparently done that .
but that 's for the german president to decide . you were germany 's interior minister from 1978 to 1982 and thus a key player in the german state 's long battle with the raf .
how do you look back on your role today ? in addition to using important police and legal resources - which we managed to implement successfully to defeat the raf - i especially tried to highlight flawed developments in our society at that time .
the aim was not to play down the raf , but rather to draw attention to the social environment in which those turbulent events took place . and let 's not forget , they are an issue until today .
just recently a double book edition was published with articles from some 60 scientists who analyzed that period because the raf is a radical byproduct of the disintegration of the left-wing protest movement .
at that time , we tried to sway those who harbored sympathy for the raf and win them over to the rule of law .
and we were successful with that . you were also responsible for passing several harsh anti-terror laws at the time .
do you regret any ?
what would you do differently today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in april 1977 federal prosecutor general siegfried buback was shot and killed by the raf the anti-terror measures were a necessary reaction .
we had to strengthen our police services which were n't in good shape then .
we also had to adapt our courts and legal systems to deal with new criminal behavioral patterns by making changes to our penal code as well as legal procedural code . i admit that some of this partly went too far .
to an extent , there was also a political overreaction to the raf threat .
but we did then dilute some of the measures .
when i took office in 1978 , i also abolished some of the measures used by the police to hunt down raf suspects - a procedure which also hugely affected unsuspecting citizens .
so we did draw certain consequences to deal with the threat of that time . at the same time , it has to be said that since the raf , anti-terror legislation has been continually beefed up , particularly after the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
we 're practically living in a state of permanent emergency where the balance between freedom and security has been damaged and ended up putting curbs on freedom . what lessons do you think germany can draw from the raf era in fighting terrorism today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of schleyer , held hostage by the raf for over a month , became an iconic image of 1970s west germany the most important thing is to maintain calm and not give in to hysteria and populist fear .
politicians should not be allowed to hijack security and turn it into an election topic .
instead the government has to tell the population that we must learn to live with risks .
germany must keep its cool , remain sober and pragmatic and only pass security measures that make real sense instead of symbolic gestures which are passed off as enhanced security for the population but which in reality only curb freedom . nearly 30 years after the raf terrorized west germany , the topic remains highly emotional and sparks strong reactions in germany .
why is that ? that whole period - the reform movements , the struggle for democratic reforms in the political parties , the left-wing protest movement , that whole turbulence and feeling of new beginnings of 1968 , the new policy towards the soviet union - is a fascinating one .
even the people suddenly lived differently at the time , they had a different relationship to sexuality , and art was in a heady heyday .
all that does still fascinate or interest today 's young generation .
a year ago an raf exhibition took place in berlin where artists reacted to the raf .
i promoted the exhibition at the time and it saw a record 50,000 visitors , most of them young people . but that is not to be mistaken as a fascination with the raf , which is only limited .
it 's more an interest in the political spirit of a highly exciting time .
i do n't think that the raf has turned into a myth .
we have to remember that they were murderers , though they were politically motivated . but the majority of the german population is against the release of mohnhaupt and klar .
how do you explain that ? if you follow a simple question pattern - are you for or against the release - then i think you could very quickly even have a situation where the population will be in favor of the death penalty .
this is where a democratic constitutional state has to show some nerve , keep its calm and hold fast to the fundamental principles of the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf 's symbol of a star and a rifle in the 1980s when german president richard von weizsäcker pardoned raf terrorists , it was considered an important gesture .
that is not the case today because the raf and its group of sympathizers no longer exist .
what we need is renewed proof that the german constitutional state is capable of showing mercy . do you think germany will finally close the raf chapter once its last remaining former members are released from prison ? no , not in any way .
we still do n't know the murderers of a whole series of victims after 1985 - for example those of alfred herrhausen -lrb- former deutsche bank chief -rrb- or detlev karsten rohwedder -lrb- leader of the post-reunification government-owned treuhand organization which was responsible for privatizing east german companies . -rrb- and not only do we not know the identity of the perpetrators who are still being hunted , but the interest in the period around 1967 and 1968 still remains very high .

gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison . nearly 30 years after left-wing radical group , raf -lrb- red army faction -rrb- terrorized west germany , federal prosecutors have filed a request for the release of brigitte mohnhaupt , a leading raf member who was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 for her role in a series of prominent murders .
separately , german president horst köhler is considering a pardon for mohnhaupt 's former colleague , christian klar who is serving a life sentence for at least 11 killings . the moves have sparked a furious debate in germany pitting outraged relatives of the raf 's victims against politicians who say the killers have done their time and no longer pose a threat to society . dw-world.de spoke with gerhart baum , former interior minister of germany and a member of the free-market liberal fdp party .
baum is a prominent advocate of releasing the prisoners . dw-world.de : why are you in favor of releasing mohnhaupt and klar from prison ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhart baum wants former raf prisoners to be released gerhart baum : that 's because i respect the principles of our constitutional state and believe they must be applied to the raf terrorists too .
they should not be given any special status , either in the negative or positive sense .
at the time -lrb- of their arrest -rrb- we refused to treat them as prisoners of the war as they wanted .
the raf terrorists are criminals and murderers and must be treated like any other criminals in a comparable case . we also need to make a distinction between the two .
in mohnhaupt 's case , it 's about releasing her on parole .
with christian klar , it 's about him being pardoned by the german president .
both cases are being reviewed by the authorities who will eventually make a decision . christian klar was given a triple life sentence .
can you explain what " life imprisonment " means in a strictly legal sense in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar is in prison for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder it does not mean literally for life .
there is no life-long imprisonment in practice unless the perpetrators are deemed dangerous and remain dangerous .
according to our laws , a life sentence is reviewed after 15 years for the first time .
and one of the fundamental principles of our legal system - which has been repeatedly reaffirmed by the country 's highest court - is that human dignity , as it is laid down in the constitution , also means that a person who is sentenced to life imprisonment must be given a perspective for freedom . those who oppose releasing mohnhaupt and klar say the two have neither shown any remorse nor contributed towards clearing up a series of unsolved murders . that 's precisely why mohnhaupt and klar have been punished so severely .
their sentences represent the toughest legal verdicts ever passed for raf terrorists .
they did n't show any remorse and they did n't cooperate in solving crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte mohnhaupt has never shown any contrition but we have to be clear on the point that according to german law , remorse is n't demanded .
it 's desirable , but it is n't necessary .
in the case of christian klar , who has appealed to the german president for clemency , it 's a different matter .
there i expect klar to distance himself from his crimes .
he has apparently done that .
but that 's for the german president to decide . you were germany 's interior minister from 1978 to 1982 and thus a key player in the german state 's long battle with the raf .
how do you look back on your role today ? in addition to using important police and legal resources - which we managed to implement successfully to defeat the raf - i especially tried to highlight flawed developments in our society at that time .
the aim was not to play down the raf , but rather to draw attention to the social environment in which those turbulent events took place . and let 's not forget , they are an issue until today .
just recently a double book edition was published with articles from some 60 scientists who analyzed that period because the raf is a radical byproduct of the disintegration of the left-wing protest movement .
at that time , we tried to sway those who harbored sympathy for the raf and win them over to the rule of law .
and we were successful with that . you were also responsible for passing several harsh anti-terror laws at the time .
do you regret any ?
what would you do differently today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in april 1977 federal prosecutor general siegfried buback was shot and killed by the raf the anti-terror measures were a necessary reaction .
we had to strengthen our police services which were n't in good shape then .
we also had to adapt our courts and legal systems to deal with new criminal behavioral patterns by making changes to our penal code as well as legal procedural code . i admit that some of this partly went too far .
to an extent , there was also a political overreaction to the raf threat .
but we did then dilute some of the measures .
when i took office in 1978 , i also abolished some of the measures used by the police to hunt down raf suspects - a procedure which also hugely affected unsuspecting citizens .
so we did draw certain consequences to deal with the threat of that time . at the same time , it has to be said that since the raf , anti-terror legislation has been continually beefed up , particularly after the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
we 're practically living in a state of permanent emergency where the balance between freedom and security has been damaged and ended up putting curbs on freedom . what lessons do you think germany can draw from the raf era in fighting terrorism today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of schleyer , held hostage by the raf for over a month , became an iconic image of 1970s west germany the most important thing is to maintain calm and not give in to hysteria and populist fear .
politicians should not be allowed to hijack security and turn it into an election topic .
instead the government has to tell the population that we must learn to live with risks .
germany must keep its cool , remain sober and pragmatic and only pass security measures that make real sense instead of symbolic gestures which are passed off as enhanced security for the population but which in reality only curb freedom . nearly 30 years after the raf terrorized west germany , the topic remains highly emotional and sparks strong reactions in germany .
why is that ? that whole period - the reform movements , the struggle for democratic reforms in the political parties , the left-wing protest movement , that whole turbulence and feeling of new beginnings of 1968 , the new policy towards the soviet union - is a fascinating one .
even the people suddenly lived differently at the time , they had a different relationship to sexuality , and art was in a heady heyday .
all that does still fascinate or interest today 's young generation .
a year ago an raf exhibition took place in berlin where artists reacted to the raf .
i promoted the exhibition at the time and it saw a record 50,000 visitors , most of them young people . but that is not to be mistaken as a fascination with the raf , which is only limited .
it 's more an interest in the political spirit of a highly exciting time .
i do n't think that the raf has turned into a myth .
we have to remember that they were murderers , though they were politically motivated . but the majority of the german population is against the release of mohnhaupt and klar .
how do you explain that ? if you follow a simple question pattern - are you for or against the release - then i think you could very quickly even have a situation where the population will be in favor of the death penalty .
this is where a democratic constitutional state has to show some nerve , keep its calm and hold fast to the fundamental principles of the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf 's symbol of a star and a rifle in the 1980s when german president richard von weizsäcker pardoned raf terrorists , it was considered an important gesture .
that is not the case today because the raf and its group of sympathizers no longer exist .
what we need is renewed proof that the german constitutional state is capable of showing mercy . do you think germany will finally close the raf chapter once its last remaining former members are released from prison ? no , not in any way .
we still do n't know the murderers of a whole series of victims after 1985 - for example those of alfred herrhausen -lrb- former deutsche bank chief -rrb- or detlev karsten rohwedder -lrb- leader of the post-reunification government-owned treuhand organization which was responsible for privatizing east german companies . -rrb- and not only do we not know the identity of the perpetrators who are still being hunted , but the interest in the period around 1967 and 1968 still remains very high .

it 's more an interest in the political spirit of a highly exciting time .
i do n't think that the raf has turned into a myth .
we have to remember that they were murderers , though they were politically motivated . but the majority of the german population is against the release of mohnhaupt and klar .
how do you explain that ? if you follow a simple question pattern - are you for or against the release - then i think you could very quickly even have a situation where the population will be in favor of the death penalty .
this is where a democratic constitutional state has to show some nerve , keep its calm and hold fast to the fundamental principles of the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf 's symbol of a star and a rifle in the 1980s when german president richard von weizsäcker pardoned raf terrorists , it was considered an important gesture .

what we need is renewed proof that the german constitutional state is capable of showing mercy . do you think germany will finally close the raf chapter once its last remaining former members are released from prison ? no , not in any way .

gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison . nearly 30 years after left-wing radical group , raf -lrb- red army faction -rrb- terrorized west germany , federal prosecutors have filed a request for the release of brigitte mohnhaupt , a leading raf member who was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 for her role in a series of prominent murders .
separately , german president horst köhler is considering a pardon for mohnhaupt 's former colleague , christian klar who is serving a life sentence for at least 11 killings . the moves have sparked a furious debate in germany pitting outraged relatives of the raf 's victims against politicians who say the killers have done their time and no longer pose a threat to society . dw-world.de spoke with gerhart baum , former interior minister of germany and a member of the free-market liberal fdp party .
baum is a prominent advocate of releasing the prisoners . dw-world.de : why are you in favor of releasing mohnhaupt and klar from prison ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhart baum wants former raf prisoners to be released gerhart baum : that 's because i respect the principles of our constitutional state and believe they must be applied to the raf terrorists too .
they should not be given any special status , either in the negative or positive sense .
at the time -lrb- of their arrest -rrb- we refused to treat them as prisoners of the war as they wanted .
the raf terrorists are criminals and murderers and must be treated like any other criminals in a comparable case . we also need to make a distinction between the two .
in mohnhaupt 's case , it 's about releasing her on parole .
with christian klar , it 's about him being pardoned by the german president .
both cases are being reviewed by the authorities who will eventually make a decision . christian klar was given a triple life sentence .
can you explain what " life imprisonment " means in a strictly legal sense in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar is in prison for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder it does not mean literally for life .
there is no life-long imprisonment in practice unless the perpetrators are deemed dangerous and remain dangerous .
according to our laws , a life sentence is reviewed after 15 years for the first time .
and one of the fundamental principles of our legal system - which has been repeatedly reaffirmed by the country 's highest court - is that human dignity , as it is laid down in the constitution , also means that a person who is sentenced to life imprisonment must be given a perspective for freedom . those who oppose releasing mohnhaupt and klar say the two have neither shown any remorse nor contributed towards clearing up a series of unsolved murders . that 's precisely why mohnhaupt and klar have been punished so severely .
their sentences represent the toughest legal verdicts ever passed for raf terrorists .
they did n't show any remorse and they did n't cooperate in solving crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte mohnhaupt has never shown any contrition but we have to be clear on the point that according to german law , remorse is n't demanded .
it 's desirable , but it is n't necessary .
in the case of christian klar , who has appealed to the german president for clemency , it 's a different matter .
there i expect klar to distance himself from his crimes .
he has apparently done that .
but that 's for the german president to decide . you were germany 's interior minister from 1978 to 1982 and thus a key player in the german state 's long battle with the raf .
how do you look back on your role today ? in addition to using important police and legal resources - which we managed to implement successfully to defeat the raf - i especially tried to highlight flawed developments in our society at that time .
the aim was not to play down the raf , but rather to draw attention to the social environment in which those turbulent events took place . and let 's not forget , they are an issue until today .
just recently a double book edition was published with articles from some 60 scientists who analyzed that period because the raf is a radical byproduct of the disintegration of the left-wing protest movement .
at that time , we tried to sway those who harbored sympathy for the raf and win them over to the rule of law .
and we were successful with that . you were also responsible for passing several harsh anti-terror laws at the time .
do you regret any ?
what would you do differently today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in april 1977 federal prosecutor general siegfried buback was shot and killed by the raf the anti-terror measures were a necessary reaction .
we had to strengthen our police services which were n't in good shape then .
we also had to adapt our courts and legal systems to deal with new criminal behavioral patterns by making changes to our penal code as well as legal procedural code . i admit that some of this partly went too far .
to an extent , there was also a political overreaction to the raf threat .
but we did then dilute some of the measures .
when i took office in 1978 , i also abolished some of the measures used by the police to hunt down raf suspects - a procedure which also hugely affected unsuspecting citizens .
so we did draw certain consequences to deal with the threat of that time . at the same time , it has to be said that since the raf , anti-terror legislation has been continually beefed up , particularly after the attacks of sept .

" the convergence between the united states and europe started last year , but us growth will remain stronger thanks to more dynamic demographics and a bigger working population , " morgan stanley economist eric chaney said . but in the short term , europe 's growth prospects are looking up . surviving the vat hike after a particularly strong showing in 2006 , the 13 countries sharing the euro currency were expected to see growth slow this year , in part due to an increase in german value added tax and a us slowdown . but a barrage of data published wednesday showed that the vat hike in germany , europe 's biggest economy , has had only a negligible effect while us growth is proving stronger than expected . as a result , many economists now expect any slowdown in european growth to be relatively small . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the euro is coming to poland - but when ?

"
as a member in swift 's oversight committee the european union 's central bank had to take responsibility in ensuring the transaction network complies with eu privacy laws , he said . " just as other banks , the ecb can not escape some responsibilities in the swift case which has breached the trust and private lives of many millions of people , " said hustinx . " secret , routine and massive access of third country authorities to banking data is unacceptable , " he added in a statement accompanying his final report on the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swift headquarters in belgium swift , the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication , based outside brussels , is used for global bank transactions of more than 11 million euros -lrb- $ 14 million -rrb- daily .

11 terror attacks in 2001 but insisted it had done its utmost to protect privacy . under eu data protection rules , information on money transfers can be used only for banking purposes , and not for other uses , such as investigations into terrorism financing . the european data watchdog does have teeth , and if it is not satisfied by the ecb 's response by april it could takes measures including blocking the transfer of data or taking the case to an eu court .
ecb rejects responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb chief trichet says data protection at swift is outside the bank 's remit the european central bank swiftly issued its own press release in which it said that " the monitoring of swift activities that do not affect financial stability is not a matter for central bank oversight . " " the request by the european data protection supervisor to bring data protection compliance within the remit of central bank oversight would not be in line with the allocation of legal responsibilities , " the bank added . the ecb has investigated possible options to using swift services and has had to conclude that at this stage no feasible alternatives , it said . in response to concerns voiced by european lawmakers , ecb chief jean-claude trichet said in a letter on wednesday that the eu and the us need to clarify the line between fighting terrorism and terror protection , reuters reported . " the main issue at stake is to find ways to reconcile eu and non-eu data protection legislation , as well as to maintain a proper balance between such legislation and the legal instruments applied tin the fight against terrorism , " he wrote .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the clock is ticking eu backs plans for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions interviews : the united nations and climate change germany in top five countries fighting climate change merkel calls for eu climate change strategy environment -pipe- 02.02.2007 germany boosts investment in climate change research großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drought will become more likely as climate change accelerates the un climate panel has issued its strongest ever warning about global warning .
the german government says more investment in environmental technology is the way ahead . the german government has announced a 255 million euro -lrb- $ 330.7 million -rrb- boost for research into preventing climate change .
this comes as the un climate panel gave its strongest warning yet that human activities are heating up the planet . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- report released in paris on friday predicts that temperatures are probably going to increase by 1.8 to 4 degrees celsius by the end of the century .
it also said sea levels would probably rise by between 28 and 43 centimeters -lrb- 11 to 17 inches -rrb- . german research minister annette schavan said the cash increase in environmental investment which will be paid over the next three years . it will include 35 million euros for the expansion of the german climate change calculation center . technological solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the melting of ice in the arctic is set to accelerate , endangering the habitats of creatures like polar bears and increasing the probability of flooding schavan stressed the need for technological change based on well-founded scientific research to curb global warming . " to keep climate change within acceptable boundaries we have to carry out intensive research and ensure that climate-friendly technologies are rapidly distributed , " she said . the minister also said an action plan for climate change would soon be made public that centered on human and social needs . " this program will be forward-looking in that it offers technological solutions for the growing economies of our world , " schavan said .
" we will also open up new markets for our economy . " more heat waves and violent cyclones other projections made by the ipcc report include the increasing likelihood of heat waves and violent tropical cyclones , as well as the melting of the artic sea ice in summer by 2100 . the document was much more forceful than its last report in judging whether humans were to blame for climate change .
it said there was at least a 90 per cent probability that activities such as burning fossil fuels accounted for most of the warming over the past 50 years .
in 2001 , it said the link was 66 percent probable . " if you see the extent to which human activities are influencing the climate system , the options for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions appear in a different light , because you can see what the costs of inaction are , " ipcc chairman rajendra pachauri told delegates in paris . humans to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un wants governments to cut down on the use of fossil fuels the head of the un environment program achim steiner said friday would be remembered as the day when the question mark was removed from whether people are to blame for climate change . steiner , whose agency oversees the operation of the kyoto protocol , urged governments to put more effort into getting stalled talks on long-term cuts in carbon dioxide emissions back on track .
no post-2012 targets have yet been set . it is hoped that the united states , the world 's top emitter of greenhouse gases , will , in particular , do more to do cut the burning of fossil fuels in power plants , factories and cars . the us pulled out of the kyoto protocol in 2001 saying emission limits would damage the economy .
us president george w. bush was also critical of the decision to exclude developing nations from the targets during the first phase of the agreement .
china 's booming industry is not bound by kyoto . eu vow to cut emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars are also a contributor to rising carbon dioxide emissions germany has already vowed to make cutting emissions a central aim during its six-month eu presidency .
the german environmental ministry also responded to the news of today 's report saying the european union should continue to push for industrialized nations , including the eu , to agree to a 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020 compared to1990 levels . " climate change is a reality that ca n't be challenged , " said german deputy environment minister michael müller .
" it is already manifesting itself in increasingly extreme events such as heat waves and high levels of precipitation and in the accelerated melting of glaciers and ice caps .
the report confirms the necessity of an ambitious climate policy . " chancellor angela merkel has , however , recently come under fire for apparently backtracking on her pledge to tackle global warming and speaking out against blanket emission levels for new cars . dw staff -lrb- jeg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel opposed to eu plans for car emissions scheme german chancellor merkel said she would resist attempts from the eu commission to impose caps on auto emissions which would apply to all new cars in the bloc .
-lrb- 29.01.2007 -rrb- merkel calls for eu climate change strategy europe needs to take the lead on tackling climate change and develop a unified strategy for when the kyoto protocol expires , german chancellor merkel after a meeting with british prime minister blair .

the german government says more investment in environmental technology is the way ahead . the german government has announced a 255 million euro -lrb- $ 330.7 million -rrb- boost for research into preventing climate change .
this comes as the un climate panel gave its strongest warning yet that human activities are heating up the planet . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- report released in paris on friday predicts that temperatures are probably going to increase by 1.8 to 4 degrees celsius by the end of the century .
it also said sea levels would probably rise by between 28 and 43 centimeters -lrb- 11 to 17 inches -rrb- . german research minister annette schavan said the cash increase in environmental investment which will be paid over the next three years . it will include 35 million euros for the expansion of the german climate change calculation center . technological solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the melting of ice in the arctic is set to accelerate , endangering the habitats of creatures like polar bears and increasing the probability of flooding schavan stressed the need for technological change based on well-founded scientific research to curb global warming . " to keep climate change within acceptable boundaries we have to carry out intensive research and ensure that climate-friendly technologies are rapidly distributed , " she said . the minister also said an action plan for climate change would soon be made public that centered on human and social needs . " this program will be forward-looking in that it offers technological solutions for the growing economies of our world , " schavan said .
" we will also open up new markets for our economy . " more heat waves and violent cyclones other projections made by the ipcc report include the increasing likelihood of heat waves and violent tropical cyclones , as well as the melting of the artic sea ice in summer by 2100 . the document was much more forceful than its last report in judging whether humans were to blame for climate change .
it said there was at least a 90 per cent probability that activities such as burning fossil fuels accounted for most of the warming over the past 50 years .
in 2001 , it said the link was 66 percent probable . " if you see the extent to which human activities are influencing the climate system , the options for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions appear in a different light , because you can see what the costs of inaction are , " ipcc chairman rajendra pachauri told delegates in paris . humans to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un wants governments to cut down on the use of fossil fuels the head of the un environment program achim steiner said friday would be remembered as the day when the question mark was removed from whether people are to blame for climate change . steiner , whose agency oversees the operation of the kyoto protocol , urged governments to put more effort into getting stalled talks on long-term cuts in carbon dioxide emissions back on track .
no post-2012 targets have yet been set . it is hoped that the united states , the world 's top emitter of greenhouse gases , will , in particular , do more to do cut the burning of fossil fuels in power plants , factories and cars . the us pulled out of the kyoto protocol in 2001 saying emission limits would damage the economy .
us president george w. bush was also critical of the decision to exclude developing nations from the targets during the first phase of the agreement .
china 's booming industry is not bound by kyoto . eu vow to cut emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars are also a contributor to rising carbon dioxide emissions germany has already vowed to make cutting emissions a central aim during its six-month eu presidency .
the german environmental ministry also responded to the news of today 's report saying the european union should continue to push for industrialized nations , including the eu , to agree to a 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020 compared to1990 levels . " climate change is a reality that ca n't be challenged , " said german deputy environment minister michael müller .
" it is already manifesting itself in increasingly extreme events such as heat waves and high levels of precipitation and in the accelerated melting of glaciers and ice caps .
the report confirms the necessity of an ambitious climate policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 02.02.2007 bundestag passes controversial health care overhaul großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many are skeptical that the reform will cure the health care system 's ills germany 's lower house of parliament has passed a controversial plan to reform the country 's health care system .
the legislation passed despite " no " votes from dozens of members of the coalition parties . the bundestag on friday approved the legislation with 378 votes , while 208 lawmakers said " no " to the changes to the public health care system .
thus , at least 40 parliamentarians from the ruling coalition parties , the christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , rejected the reform . health minister ulla schmidt said she was satisfied with the result . " it 's a good majority , " she said on friday . the bundesrat , germany 's upper chamber of parliament , will vote on the legislation on feb .
16 , and is also expected to approve it .
the law will come into effect on april 1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors protested against the changes .
" stinginess makes you sick , " read their backs the reform 's original aim was to cut non-labor wage costs , which contribute to the high price of german workers .
however , public health insurance companies raised their premiums during the long months of discussion before the reform passed .
both employers and employees were forced to pay more , jacking up non-wage labor costs .
lowest common denominator angela merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister party , the csu , initially wanted to cap employers ' contributions , which the social democrats opposed .
instead , the spd wanted a broader segment of society to be required to contribute to the system of solidarity that covers nearly 90 percent of germany 's residents .
the party demanded that civil servants , high earners and the self-employed also contribute to the public health insurance companies .
unlike the rest of society , those three groups are allowed to have private insurance plans , and most of them do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt was unable to push through her desires health minister schmidt , a social democrat , wanted private insurance to be available for everyone .
private insurers provide more services and allow more flexibility than the 252 public health insurance companies .
but the cdu / csu rejected schmidt 's plan .
in the end , the governing coalition of conservatives and social democrats agreed on the lowest common denominator .
still , merkel declared it a breakthrough . " the measures aim to improve the quality of providers , increase the choice and decision-making chances of the people insured , and altogether ensure a clearer picture of economy , transparency , competition and the financial viability of the health care system , " she said in july , when the coalition partners announced the compromise they had agreed upon . the heart of the reform is the so-called " health fund . "
from 2009 , all contributions to the public health insurance companies as well as state subsidies are supposed to be paid into this new fund .
the companies will levy a standard premium for everyone , and if the money they are allocated from the health fund does n't cover their costs , they will be able to charge the people they insure a supplement .
insurers who use their funds efficiently and do n't demand more money of their clients will thus be more appealing to the public .
lack of enthusiasm germany is the only country in the world that , in essence , has two separate health care systems - the private and public systems .
the reform will make it more difficult for people to be eligible for private insurance .
they will only be allowed to switch from a public to a private insurance company if they earn 3,975 euros -lrb- $ 5,155 -rrb- per month for three years . the changes also require everyone in germany to have health insurance by 2009 .
an estimated 200,000 residents are n't currently covered .
in the future , people who fall ill and are n't insured will be obliged to pay back health insurance premiums for up to five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospital staff is concerned that is will get harder to make ends meet the overhaul has n't provoked enthusiasm anywhere in germany - not from politicians , the insurance companies , health care professionals or patients .
up to the final days before the bundestag voted on the measures , the insurance companies lobbied the government to reform the reform .
they argued that the changes would n't resolve the public health care system 's financial problems , patients would carry a greater burden than now , bureaucracy would be increased and competition limited . " if this is a reform , then reform is a dirty word , " said reinhard bütiköfer , head of the green party opposition in the bundestag .
" it is the first so-called health care system reform in which it is a foregone conclusion that everything will be more expensive for the people who are insured .

gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison . nearly 30 years after left-wing radical group , raf -lrb- red army faction -rrb- terrorized west germany , federal prosecutors have filed a request for the release of brigitte mohnhaupt , a leading raf member who was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 for her role in a series of prominent murders .
separately , german president horst köhler is considering a pardon for mohnhaupt 's former colleague , christian klar who is serving a life sentence for at least 11 killings . the moves have sparked a furious debate in germany pitting outraged relatives of the raf 's victims against politicians who say the killers have done their time and no longer pose a threat to society . dw-world.de spoke with gerhart baum , former interior minister of germany and a member of the free-market liberal fdp party .
baum is a prominent advocate of releasing the prisoners . dw-world.de : why are you in favor of releasing mohnhaupt and klar from prison ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhart baum wants former raf prisoners to be released gerhart baum : that 's because i respect the principles of our constitutional state and believe they must be applied to the raf terrorists too .
they should not be given any special status , either in the negative or positive sense .
at the time -lrb- of their arrest -rrb- we refused to treat them as prisoners of the war as they wanted .
the raf terrorists are criminals and murderers and must be treated like any other criminals in a comparable case . we also need to make a distinction between the two .
in mohnhaupt 's case , it 's about releasing her on parole .
with christian klar , it 's about him being pardoned by the german president .
both cases are being reviewed by the authorities who will eventually make a decision . christian klar was given a triple life sentence .
can you explain what " life imprisonment " means in a strictly legal sense in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar is in prison for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder it does not mean literally for life .
there is no life-long imprisonment in practice unless the perpetrators are deemed dangerous and remain dangerous .
according to our laws , a life sentence is reviewed after 15 years for the first time .
and one of the fundamental principles of our legal system - which has been repeatedly reaffirmed by the country 's highest court - is that human dignity , as it is laid down in the constitution , also means that a person who is sentenced to life imprisonment must be given a perspective for freedom . those who oppose releasing mohnhaupt and klar say the two have neither shown any remorse nor contributed towards clearing up a series of unsolved murders . that 's precisely why mohnhaupt and klar have been punished so severely .
their sentences represent the toughest legal verdicts ever passed for raf terrorists .
they did n't show any remorse and they did n't cooperate in solving crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte mohnhaupt has never shown any contrition but we have to be clear on the point that according to german law , remorse is n't demanded .
it 's desirable , but it is n't necessary .
in the case of christian klar , who has appealed to the german president for clemency , it 's a different matter .
there i expect klar to distance himself from his crimes .
he has apparently done that .
but that 's for the german president to decide . you were germany 's interior minister from 1978 to 1982 and thus a key player in the german state 's long battle with the raf .
how do you look back on your role today ? in addition to using important police and legal resources - which we managed to implement successfully to defeat the raf - i especially tried to highlight flawed developments in our society at that time .
the aim was not to play down the raf , but rather to draw attention to the social environment in which those turbulent events took place . and let 's not forget , they are an issue until today .
just recently a double book edition was published with articles from some 60 scientists who analyzed that period because the raf is a radical byproduct of the disintegration of the left-wing protest movement .
at that time , we tried to sway those who harbored sympathy for the raf and win them over to the rule of law .
and we were successful with that . you were also responsible for passing several harsh anti-terror laws at the time .
do you regret any ?
what would you do differently today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in april 1977 federal prosecutor general siegfried buback was shot and killed by the raf the anti-terror measures were a necessary reaction .
we had to strengthen our police services which were n't in good shape then .
we also had to adapt our courts and legal systems to deal with new criminal behavioral patterns by making changes to our penal code as well as legal procedural code . i admit that some of this partly went too far .
to an extent , there was also a political overreaction to the raf threat .
but we did then dilute some of the measures .
when i took office in 1978 , i also abolished some of the measures used by the police to hunt down raf suspects - a procedure which also hugely affected unsuspecting citizens .
so we did draw certain consequences to deal with the threat of that time . at the same time , it has to be said that since the raf , anti-terror legislation has been continually beefed up , particularly after the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
we 're practically living in a state of permanent emergency where the balance between freedom and security has been damaged and ended up putting curbs on freedom . what lessons do you think germany can draw from the raf era in fighting terrorism today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of schleyer , held hostage by the raf for over a month , became an iconic image of 1970s west germany the most important thing is to maintain calm and not give in to hysteria and populist fear .
politicians should not be allowed to hijack security and turn it into an election topic .
instead the government has to tell the population that we must learn to live with risks .
germany must keep its cool , remain sober and pragmatic and only pass security measures that make real sense instead of symbolic gestures which are passed off as enhanced security for the population but which in reality only curb freedom . nearly 30 years after the raf terrorized west germany , the topic remains highly emotional and sparks strong reactions in germany .
why is that ? that whole period - the reform movements , the struggle for democratic reforms in the political parties , the left-wing protest movement , that whole turbulence and feeling of new beginnings of 1968 , the new policy towards the soviet union - is a fascinating one .
even the people suddenly lived differently at the time , they had a different relationship to sexuality , and art was in a heady heyday .
all that does still fascinate or interest today 's young generation .
a year ago an raf exhibition took place in berlin where artists reacted to the raf .
i promoted the exhibition at the time and it saw a record 50,000 visitors , most of them young people . but that is not to be mistaken as a fascination with the raf , which is only limited .
it 's more an interest in the political spirit of a highly exciting time .
i do n't think that the raf has turned into a myth .
we have to remember that they were murderers , though they were politically motivated . but the majority of the german population is against the release of mohnhaupt and klar .
how do you explain that ? if you follow a simple question pattern - are you for or against the release - then i think you could very quickly even have a situation where the population will be in favor of the death penalty .
this is where a democratic constitutional state has to show some nerve , keep its calm and hold fast to the fundamental principles of the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf 's symbol of a star and a rifle in the 1980s when german president richard von weizsäcker pardoned raf terrorists , it was considered an important gesture .

gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison . nearly 30 years after left-wing radical group , raf -lrb- red army faction -rrb- terrorized west germany , federal prosecutors have filed a request for the release of brigitte mohnhaupt , a leading raf member who was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 for her role in a series of prominent murders .
separately , german president horst köhler is considering a pardon for mohnhaupt 's former colleague , christian klar who is serving a life sentence for at least 11 killings . the moves have sparked a furious debate in germany pitting outraged relatives of the raf 's victims against politicians who say the killers have done their time and no longer pose a threat to society . dw-world.de spoke with gerhart baum , former interior minister of germany and a member of the free-market liberal fdp party .
baum is a prominent advocate of releasing the prisoners . dw-world.de : why are you in favor of releasing mohnhaupt and klar from prison ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhart baum wants former raf prisoners to be released gerhart baum : that 's because i respect the principles of our constitutional state and believe they must be applied to the raf terrorists too .
they should not be given any special status , either in the negative or positive sense .
at the time -lrb- of their arrest -rrb- we refused to treat them as prisoners of the war as they wanted .
the raf terrorists are criminals and murderers and must be treated like any other criminals in a comparable case . we also need to make a distinction between the two .
in mohnhaupt 's case , it 's about releasing her on parole .
with christian klar , it 's about him being pardoned by the german president .
both cases are being reviewed by the authorities who will eventually make a decision . christian klar was given a triple life sentence .
can you explain what " life imprisonment " means in a strictly legal sense in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar is in prison for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder it does not mean literally for life .
there is no life-long imprisonment in practice unless the perpetrators are deemed dangerous and remain dangerous .
according to our laws , a life sentence is reviewed after 15 years for the first time .
and one of the fundamental principles of our legal system - which has been repeatedly reaffirmed by the country 's highest court - is that human dignity , as it is laid down in the constitution , also means that a person who is sentenced to life imprisonment must be given a perspective for freedom . those who oppose releasing mohnhaupt and klar say the two have neither shown any remorse nor contributed towards clearing up a series of unsolved murders . that 's precisely why mohnhaupt and klar have been punished so severely .
their sentences represent the toughest legal verdicts ever passed for raf terrorists .
they did n't show any remorse and they did n't cooperate in solving crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte mohnhaupt has never shown any contrition but we have to be clear on the point that according to german law , remorse is n't demanded .
it 's desirable , but it is n't necessary .
in the case of christian klar , who has appealed to the german president for clemency , it 's a different matter .
there i expect klar to distance himself from his crimes .
he has apparently done that .
but that 's for the german president to decide . you were germany 's interior minister from 1978 to 1982 and thus a key player in the german state 's long battle with the raf .
how do you look back on your role today ? in addition to using important police and legal resources - which we managed to implement successfully to defeat the raf - i especially tried to highlight flawed developments in our society at that time .
the aim was not to play down the raf , but rather to draw attention to the social environment in which those turbulent events took place . and let 's not forget , they are an issue until today .
just recently a double book edition was published with articles from some 60 scientists who analyzed that period because the raf is a radical byproduct of the disintegration of the left-wing protest movement .
at that time , we tried to sway those who harbored sympathy for the raf and win them over to the rule of law .
and we were successful with that . you were also responsible for passing several harsh anti-terror laws at the time .
do you regret any ?
what would you do differently today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in april 1977 federal prosecutor general siegfried buback was shot and killed by the raf the anti-terror measures were a necessary reaction .
we had to strengthen our police services which were n't in good shape then .
we also had to adapt our courts and legal systems to deal with new criminal behavioral patterns by making changes to our penal code as well as legal procedural code . i admit that some of this partly went too far .
to an extent , there was also a political overreaction to the raf threat .
but we did then dilute some of the measures .
when i took office in 1978 , i also abolished some of the measures used by the police to hunt down raf suspects - a procedure which also hugely affected unsuspecting citizens .
so we did draw certain consequences to deal with the threat of that time . at the same time , it has to be said that since the raf , anti-terror legislation has been continually beefed up , particularly after the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
we 're practically living in a state of permanent emergency where the balance between freedom and security has been damaged and ended up putting curbs on freedom . what lessons do you think germany can draw from the raf era in fighting terrorism today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of schleyer , held hostage by the raf for over a month , became an iconic image of 1970s west germany the most important thing is to maintain calm and not give in to hysteria and populist fear .
politicians should not be allowed to hijack security and turn it into an election topic .
instead the government has to tell the population that we must learn to live with risks .
germany must keep its cool , remain sober and pragmatic and only pass security measures that make real sense instead of symbolic gestures which are passed off as enhanced security for the population but which in reality only curb freedom . nearly 30 years after the raf terrorized west germany , the topic remains highly emotional and sparks strong reactions in germany .
why is that ? that whole period - the reform movements , the struggle for democratic reforms in the political parties , the left-wing protest movement , that whole turbulence and feeling of new beginnings of 1968 , the new policy towards the soviet union - is a fascinating one .
even the people suddenly lived differently at the time , they had a different relationship to sexuality , and art was in a heady heyday .
all that does still fascinate or interest today 's young generation .
a year ago an raf exhibition took place in berlin where artists reacted to the raf .
i promoted the exhibition at the time and it saw a record 50,000 visitors , most of them young people . but that is not to be mistaken as a fascination with the raf , which is only limited .
it 's more an interest in the political spirit of a highly exciting time .
i do n't think that the raf has turned into a myth .
we have to remember that they were murderers , though they were politically motivated . but the majority of the german population is against the release of mohnhaupt and klar .
how do you explain that ? if you follow a simple question pattern - are you for or against the release - then i think you could very quickly even have a situation where the population will be in favor of the death penalty .
this is where a democratic constitutional state has to show some nerve , keep its calm and hold fast to the fundamental principles of the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf 's symbol of a star and a rifle in the 1980s when german president richard von weizsäcker pardoned raf terrorists , it was considered an important gesture .
that is not the case today because the raf and its group of sympathizers no longer exist .

gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison . nearly 30 years after left-wing radical group , raf -lrb- red army faction -rrb- terrorized west germany , federal prosecutors have filed a request for the release of brigitte mohnhaupt , a leading raf member who was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 for her role in a series of prominent murders .
separately , german president horst köhler is considering a pardon for mohnhaupt 's former colleague , christian klar who is serving a life sentence for at least 11 killings . the moves have sparked a furious debate in germany pitting outraged relatives of the raf 's victims against politicians who say the killers have done their time and no longer pose a threat to society . dw-world.de spoke with gerhart baum , former interior minister of germany and a member of the free-market liberal fdp party .
baum is a prominent advocate of releasing the prisoners . dw-world.de : why are you in favor of releasing mohnhaupt and klar from prison ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhart baum wants former raf prisoners to be released gerhart baum : that 's because i respect the principles of our constitutional state and believe they must be applied to the raf terrorists too .
they should not be given any special status , either in the negative or positive sense .
at the time -lrb- of their arrest -rrb- we refused to treat them as prisoners of the war as they wanted .
the raf terrorists are criminals and murderers and must be treated like any other criminals in a comparable case . we also need to make a distinction between the two .
in mohnhaupt 's case , it 's about releasing her on parole .
with christian klar , it 's about him being pardoned by the german president .
both cases are being reviewed by the authorities who will eventually make a decision . christian klar was given a triple life sentence .
can you explain what " life imprisonment " means in a strictly legal sense in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar is in prison for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder it does not mean literally for life .
there is no life-long imprisonment in practice unless the perpetrators are deemed dangerous and remain dangerous .
according to our laws , a life sentence is reviewed after 15 years for the first time .
and one of the fundamental principles of our legal system - which has been repeatedly reaffirmed by the country 's highest court - is that human dignity , as it is laid down in the constitution , also means that a person who is sentenced to life imprisonment must be given a perspective for freedom . those who oppose releasing mohnhaupt and klar say the two have neither shown any remorse nor contributed towards clearing up a series of unsolved murders . that 's precisely why mohnhaupt and klar have been punished so severely .
their sentences represent the toughest legal verdicts ever passed for raf terrorists .
they did n't show any remorse and they did n't cooperate in solving crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte mohnhaupt has never shown any contrition but we have to be clear on the point that according to german law , remorse is n't demanded .
it 's desirable , but it is n't necessary .
in the case of christian klar , who has appealed to the german president for clemency , it 's a different matter .
there i expect klar to distance himself from his crimes .
he has apparently done that .
but that 's for the german president to decide . you were germany 's interior minister from 1978 to 1982 and thus a key player in the german state 's long battle with the raf .
how do you look back on your role today ? in addition to using important police and legal resources - which we managed to implement successfully to defeat the raf - i especially tried to highlight flawed developments in our society at that time .
the aim was not to play down the raf , but rather to draw attention to the social environment in which those turbulent events took place . and let 's not forget , they are an issue until today .
just recently a double book edition was published with articles from some 60 scientists who analyzed that period because the raf is a radical byproduct of the disintegration of the left-wing protest movement .
at that time , we tried to sway those who harbored sympathy for the raf and win them over to the rule of law .
and we were successful with that . you were also responsible for passing several harsh anti-terror laws at the time .
do you regret any ?
what would you do differently today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in april 1977 federal prosecutor general siegfried buback was shot and killed by the raf the anti-terror measures were a necessary reaction .

the legislation passed despite " no " votes from dozens of members of the coalition parties . the bundestag on friday approved the legislation with 378 votes , while 208 lawmakers said " no " to the changes to the public health care system .
thus , at least 40 parliamentarians from the ruling coalition parties , the christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , rejected the reform . health minister ulla schmidt said she was satisfied with the result . " it 's a good majority , " she said on friday . the bundesrat , germany 's upper chamber of parliament , will vote on the legislation on feb .
16 , and is also expected to approve it .
the law will come into effect on april 1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors protested against the changes .
" stinginess makes you sick , " read their backs the reform 's original aim was to cut non-labor wage costs , which contribute to the high price of german workers .
however , public health insurance companies raised their premiums during the long months of discussion before the reform passed .
both employers and employees were forced to pay more , jacking up non-wage labor costs .
lowest common denominator angela merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister party , the csu , initially wanted to cap employers ' contributions , which the social democrats opposed .
instead , the spd wanted a broader segment of society to be required to contribute to the system of solidarity that covers nearly 90 percent of germany 's residents .
the party demanded that civil servants , high earners and the self-employed also contribute to the public health insurance companies .
unlike the rest of society , those three groups are allowed to have private insurance plans , and most of them do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt was unable to push through her desires health minister schmidt , a social democrat , wanted private insurance to be available for everyone .
private insurers provide more services and allow more flexibility than the 252 public health insurance companies .
but the cdu / csu rejected schmidt 's plan .
in the end , the governing coalition of conservatives and social democrats agreed on the lowest common denominator .
still , merkel declared it a breakthrough . " the measures aim to improve the quality of providers , increase the choice and decision-making chances of the people insured , and altogether ensure a clearer picture of economy , transparency , competition and the financial viability of the health care system , " she said in july , when the coalition partners announced the compromise they had agreed upon . the heart of the reform is the so-called " health fund . "
from 2009 , all contributions to the public health insurance companies as well as state subsidies are supposed to be paid into this new fund .
the companies will levy a standard premium for everyone , and if the money they are allocated from the health fund does n't cover their costs , they will be able to charge the people they insure a supplement .
insurers who use their funds efficiently and do n't demand more money of their clients will thus be more appealing to the public .
lack of enthusiasm germany is the only country in the world that , in essence , has two separate health care systems - the private and public systems .
the reform will make it more difficult for people to be eligible for private insurance .
they will only be allowed to switch from a public to a private insurance company if they earn 3,975 euros -lrb- $ 5,155 -rrb- per month for three years . the changes also require everyone in germany to have health insurance by 2009 .
an estimated 200,000 residents are n't currently covered .
in the future , people who fall ill and are n't insured will be obliged to pay back health insurance premiums for up to five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospital staff is concerned that is will get harder to make ends meet the overhaul has n't provoked enthusiasm anywhere in germany - not from politicians , the insurance companies , health care professionals or patients .
up to the final days before the bundestag voted on the measures , the insurance companies lobbied the government to reform the reform .
they argued that the changes would n't resolve the public health care system 's financial problems , patients would carry a greater burden than now , bureaucracy would be increased and competition limited . " if this is a reform , then reform is a dirty word , " said reinhard bütiköfer , head of the green party opposition in the bundestag .

"
as a member in swift 's oversight committee the european union 's central bank had to take responsibility in ensuring the transaction network complies with eu privacy laws , he said . " just as other banks , the ecb can not escape some responsibilities in the swift case which has breached the trust and private lives of many millions of people , " said hustinx . " secret , routine and massive access of third country authorities to banking data is unacceptable , " he added in a statement accompanying his final report on the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swift headquarters in belgium swift , the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication , based outside brussels , is used for global bank transactions of more than 11 million euros -lrb- $ 14 million -rrb- daily .

ecb rejects responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb chief trichet says data protection at swift is outside the bank 's remit the european central bank swiftly issued its own press release in which it said that " the monitoring of swift activities that do not affect financial stability is not a matter for central bank oversight . " " the request by the european data protection supervisor to bring data protection compliance within the remit of central bank oversight would not be in line with the allocation of legal responsibilities , " the bank added . the ecb has investigated possible options to using swift services and has had to conclude that at this stage no feasible alternatives , it said . in response to concerns voiced by european lawmakers , ecb chief jean-claude trichet said in a letter on wednesday that the eu and the us need to clarify the line between fighting terrorism and terror protection , reuters reported . " the main issue at stake is to find ways to reconcile eu and non-eu data protection legislation , as well as to maintain a proper balance between such legislation and the legal instruments applied tin the fight against terrorism , " he wrote .

the legislation passed despite " no " votes from dozens of members of the coalition parties . the bundestag on friday approved the legislation with 378 votes , while 208 lawmakers said " no " to the changes to the public health care system .
thus , at least 40 parliamentarians from the ruling coalition parties , the christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , rejected the reform . health minister ulla schmidt said she was satisfied with the result . " it 's a good majority , " she said on friday . the bundesrat , germany 's upper chamber of parliament , will vote on the legislation on feb .
16 , and is also expected to approve it .
the law will come into effect on april 1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors protested against the changes .
" stinginess makes you sick , " read their backs the reform 's original aim was to cut non-labor wage costs , which contribute to the high price of german workers .
however , public health insurance companies raised their premiums during the long months of discussion before the reform passed .
both employers and employees were forced to pay more , jacking up non-wage labor costs .
lowest common denominator angela merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister party , the csu , initially wanted to cap employers ' contributions , which the social democrats opposed .
instead , the spd wanted a broader segment of society to be required to contribute to the system of solidarity that covers nearly 90 percent of germany 's residents .
the party demanded that civil servants , high earners and the self-employed also contribute to the public health insurance companies .
unlike the rest of society , those three groups are allowed to have private insurance plans , and most of them do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt was unable to push through her desires health minister schmidt , a social democrat , wanted private insurance to be available for everyone .
private insurers provide more services and allow more flexibility than the 252 public health insurance companies .
but the cdu / csu rejected schmidt 's plan .
in the end , the governing coalition of conservatives and social democrats agreed on the lowest common denominator .
still , merkel declared it a breakthrough . " the measures aim to improve the quality of providers , increase the choice and decision-making chances of the people insured , and altogether ensure a clearer picture of economy , transparency , competition and the financial viability of the health care system , " she said in july , when the coalition partners announced the compromise they had agreed upon . the heart of the reform is the so-called " health fund . "
from 2009 , all contributions to the public health insurance companies as well as state subsidies are supposed to be paid into this new fund .
the companies will levy a standard premium for everyone , and if the money they are allocated from the health fund does n't cover their costs , they will be able to charge the people they insure a supplement .
insurers who use their funds efficiently and do n't demand more money of their clients will thus be more appealing to the public .
lack of enthusiasm germany is the only country in the world that , in essence , has two separate health care systems - the private and public systems .
the reform will make it more difficult for people to be eligible for private insurance .
they will only be allowed to switch from a public to a private insurance company if they earn 3,975 euros -lrb- $ 5,155 -rrb- per month for three years . the changes also require everyone in germany to have health insurance by 2009 .
an estimated 200,000 residents are n't currently covered .

up to the final days before the bundestag voted on the measures , the insurance companies lobbied the government to reform the reform .
they argued that the changes would n't resolve the public health care system 's financial problems , patients would carry a greater burden than now , bureaucracy would be increased and competition limited .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 02.02.2007 opinion : kosovo is a challenge for the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy martti ahtisaari presented his draft proposal for kosovo on friday .
his difficult and uncertain mission is of paramount importance , not only for the balkans , but the eu in general , says dw 's verica spasovska . united nations envoy martti ahtisaari has taken on a difficult mission .
its success - with serbs and albanians heavily entrenched in their positions - is highly uncertain .
ahtisaari 's visit to belgrade was made even more explosive when serbian prime minister vojsilav kostunica refused to meet with him - supposedly because he is in the midst of a complicated process of building a new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verica spasovska at the same time , kostunica is threatening to break off diplomatic relations with those countries that want to recognize kosovo .
in this precarious moment , kostuncia seems to be trying to shun political responsibility . the eu has been implying for months that the kosovo proposal could lead to independence , even if drastically limited , yet kostunica has so far lacked courage to prepare the serbian population for the possible loss of the province . kosovo albanians , on the other hand , are increasing the pressure on the west by postulating unlimited independence as something non-negotiable .
this is only hiking up the expectations of the population .
over the past few years , kosovo albanians have learned that the west is backing away from its political demands and giving in to riots and violence . after the massive riots three years ago , the eu gave up its postulate " standards before status . "
the eu is no longer demanding that the democratic rules of engagement be established and minorities protected before the status is determined .
since violence was rewarded with political concessions , one can possibly expect a new escalation of violence if all the demands of kosovo albanians are not met .
the international peace / keeping troops have been placed on heightened alert . the eu is in a tight spot .
it must find a face-saving solution for both parties that everybody would support .
that is why the word " independence " has not been in circulation for days .
on the other hand , serbia 's sovereignty is also not mentioned any more . the only way out of this dilemma lies in the clear eu accession perspectives for the serbs and the albanians .
both conflicting parties know that their economic and political development is coupled with eu membership and that they have to rely on the eu .
it must be made clear to both the serbs and the albanians that it is paradoxical for them to insist on sovereignty when they will sooner or later give up parts of that sovereignty to the eu .
they have to understand that at the very least that 's why the use of violence is not worth it . for the european union , kosovo is an elementary challenge : the eu has to manage this conflict successfully if it is to show that it is capable of a uniform foreign policy . verica spasovska is head of dw-radio 's program for central and southeastern europe -lrb- tt -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de del ponte warns eu against resuming talks with serbia carla del ponte , the un chief prosecutor for war crimes in the former yugoslavia , on wednesday warned the eu against resuming cooperation talks with serbia , saying key fugitives must first be arrested .

however , the recently formed identity , tradition and sovereignty group -lrb- its -rrb- will receive funding after being officially approved as a political bloc . " they got their cash , but lost any power , " a parliamentary spokesman said of its . the right-wing group includes a diverse range of politicians from romania 's xenophobic and anti-roma greater romania party through to france 's anti-immigrant national front and belgium 's vlaams belang . prominent members include frenchman jean-marie le pen and alessandra mussolini , granddaughter of italy 's former fascist dictator benito mussolini . break with normal procedure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's jean marie le pen is among the far-right alliance 's prominent members under normal parliamentary procedure , committee positions are distributed according to the size of the parliamentary groups .
this would have entitled the far-right wing alliance to two vice-chairmanships . but parliamentary rules also allow for a vote if one-sixth of committee members request it .
on thursday , lawmakers decided to break with convention and called for secret ballots . its ' two nominees for the parliament 's culture and transport committees were then voted down .
the chairs and vice-chairs for the remaining 20 committees were endorsed without a vote . the committee chairmanships , which has the power to influence the parliament 's agenda , were largely seen as one of the few changes that could have occurred in the parliament 's daily politics after the its was approved as a political group . applying unfair tactics ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of parliament were concerned about tarnishing the parliament 's image " the parliament operated in a legal , but , shall we say , slightly unfair fashion when they demanded votes , " according to one parliamentary insider cited by the afp news agency . spanish liberal ignasi guardans cambo , who called for a secret vote in the culture committee along with austrian socialist christa prets said keeping the vice-chairmanships out of its hands was important for the eu 's image . " a vice-chairman is our face to the outside , " they said .
" in the culture committee we can not have a vice-chairman who works against immigration . " italian far-right mep luca romagnoli , who had stood for the post of vice-chairman of the transport committee , attacked the way other groups had acted . " i thought that the european parliament had a high democratic level - that it was an example for democracy and minority rights , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 02.02.2007 opinion : kosovo is a challenge for the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy martti ahtisaari presented his draft proposal for kosovo on friday .
his difficult and uncertain mission is of paramount importance , not only for the balkans , but the eu in general , says dw 's verica spasovska . united nations envoy martti ahtisaari has taken on a difficult mission .
its success - with serbs and albanians heavily entrenched in their positions - is highly uncertain .
ahtisaari 's visit to belgrade was made even more explosive when serbian prime minister vojsilav kostunica refused to meet with him - supposedly because he is in the midst of a complicated process of building a new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verica spasovska at the same time , kostunica is threatening to break off diplomatic relations with those countries that want to recognize kosovo .
in this precarious moment , kostuncia seems to be trying to shun political responsibility . the eu has been implying for months that the kosovo proposal could lead to independence , even if drastically limited , yet kostunica has so far lacked courage to prepare the serbian population for the possible loss of the province . kosovo albanians , on the other hand , are increasing the pressure on the west by postulating unlimited independence as something non-negotiable .
this is only hiking up the expectations of the population .
over the past few years , kosovo albanians have learned that the west is backing away from its political demands and giving in to riots and violence . after the massive riots three years ago , the eu gave up its postulate " standards before status . "
the eu is no longer demanding that the democratic rules of engagement be established and minorities protected before the status is determined .
since violence was rewarded with political concessions , one can possibly expect a new escalation of violence if all the demands of kosovo albanians are not met .
the international peace / keeping troops have been placed on heightened alert . the eu is in a tight spot .
it must find a face-saving solution for both parties that everybody would support .
that is why the word " independence " has not been in circulation for days .
on the other hand , serbia 's sovereignty is also not mentioned any more . the only way out of this dilemma lies in the clear eu accession perspectives for the serbs and the albanians .
both conflicting parties know that their economic and political development is coupled with eu membership and that they have to rely on the eu .
it must be made clear to both the serbs and the albanians that it is paradoxical for them to insist on sovereignty when they will sooner or later give up parts of that sovereignty to the eu .
they have to understand that at the very least that 's why the use of violence is not worth it . for the european union , kosovo is an elementary challenge : the eu has to manage this conflict successfully if it is to show that it is capable of a uniform foreign policy . verica spasovska is head of dw-radio 's program for central and southeastern europe -lrb- tt -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de del ponte warns eu against resuming talks with serbia carla del ponte , the un chief prosecutor for war crimes in the former yugoslavia , on wednesday warned the eu against resuming cooperation talks with serbia , saying key fugitives must first be arrested .
-lrb- 31.01.2007 -rrb- un envoy presents draft plan for kosovo nato watches carefully as the un envoy unveils a plan for kosovo that attempts to keep stable the potentially explosive situation in the serbian-controlled province .
-lrb- 26.01.2007 -rrb- eu hopes for a pro-european coalition in serbia eu officials put a brave face on the ultra-nationalists ' victory in the serbian parliamentary elections in the hope that a pro-european coalition of democratic parties will form the next serbian government .

experts say that he need n't lose too much sleep over it . it was an entry fit for a movie star : surrounded by a cloud of flashbulbs , berlinale director dieter kosslick appeared before a few hundred journalists on tuesday to present the program for this year 's festival - the 57th of its kind .
he talked about record movie entries -lrb- some 5,000 -rrb- , a booming film market and a new event called " culinary cinema " that features screenings followed by a gourmet meal . known for his abominable english skills , kosslick had the room roaring with laughter when he recounted how he managed to convince clint eastwood to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is kosslick really worried about new festivals ?
" i 'm dieter from ze cherman film festival , " he introduced himself after mistaking eastwood for a friend in la .
apparently it did the trick . but off the stage , in a recent interview , kosslick did n't seem to be in the mood for jokes . " things are getting more and more complicated when it comes to film festivals , " kosslick told german daily die welt .
" there 's a boom in festivals and a boom in film markets , with millions invested in them . " nouveau riche competitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress isabella rossellini came to rome 's festival , but she will also come to berlin he was talking about a new generation of events that have sprung up around the globe in recent years .
in europe , cinema .
festa internazionale di roma just premiered with a rumored budget of 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26 million -rrb- last october .
in asia , festivals in bangkok and pusan -lrb- south korea -rrb- are increasingly getting attention .
and then there 's the three-year-old dubai international film festival -lrb- diff -rrb- , which kosslick also does n't think of too highly . " i know that ... rome and dubai buy stars with big money to put on festivals for an audience , " he told german trade magazine promedia .
" the big competitors that have a lot of money are increasingly turning into marketing events . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dubai will focus on arab film makers not so , said chris paton , a diff spokesman , who rejected the allegation that officials in dubai paid stars to attend . " while their hospitality can be on a very grand scale , they do n't pay straight-out fees , " he said , adding that free first-class flights and deluxe accommodation arrangements were necessary to convince hollywood greats to make the 23-hour journey . " if you want american stars to travel such a distance , of course you have to treat them in the right way , " paton said . the a-list clout he added that diff was more interested in establishing itself as an important regional hub than competing with one of " the three grande dames " : berlin , cannes and venice . others agreed that kosslick should n't worry too much about losing out because of the likes of rome or dubai . " i do n't think there is real competition , " said bruno chatelin , the paris-based co-founder of filmfestivals.com and a former film studio marketing executive .
" producers know the difference between being selected in dubai and being selected in berlin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they still do wonders to a movie 's selling power thorsten schaumann , the head of germany 's leading film distributor bavaria film international , agreed that recognition in berlin was highly valuable for a movie . " the berlinale is certainly the first big a-festival of the year for us to meet all the buyers , " said schaumann , who has two films competing for the festival 's coveted golden bear trophy . " it 's one of the most important , if not the most important festivals for us , " he added .
" that 's a status that can not be taken away . " but that 's not to say that some of the newcomers are n't welcome additions to the year-round festival circus . " rome 's an important platform for us as well , " schaumann said .
" we need a european market at the end of the year . " a healthy dose of arrogance in the end , berlinale director kosslick 's comments might have been nothing more than a clever trick to position his festival . " he 's discrediting the others by relegating them to a different league , " said thorsten hennig-thurau , who is professor for marketing and media research at weimar 's bauhaus university .
" he can do that , but i do n't think that 's what matters in the end . " what will matter is whether kosslick and his berlinale colleagues will manage to secure their hard-earned place among the world 's top film festivals by continuing to convince stars and movie producers to come to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now that 's more like it , dieter " let them open -lrb- their festivals -rrb- - we 'll be better , " hennig-thurau suggested as a more proactive approach . kosslick might have already gotten the hint . " i 'm quite confident that we have the right concept with our mix of film market , red carpet , dedicated cinema and promotion of young talents , " he told promedia . come next friday , he 'll get a chance to prove it again . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin film festival line-up complete four films from asia , two from latin america and one from israel along with a large contingent of movies from north america and europe form the line-up of entries at the berlinale .

his difficult and uncertain mission is of paramount importance , not only for the balkans , but the eu in general , says dw 's verica spasovska . united nations envoy martti ahtisaari has taken on a difficult mission .
its success - with serbs and albanians heavily entrenched in their positions - is highly uncertain .
ahtisaari 's visit to belgrade was made even more explosive when serbian prime minister vojsilav kostunica refused to meet with him - supposedly because he is in the midst of a complicated process of building a new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verica spasovska at the same time , kostunica is threatening to break off diplomatic relations with those countries that want to recognize kosovo .
in this precarious moment , kostuncia seems to be trying to shun political responsibility . the eu has been implying for months that the kosovo proposal could lead to independence , even if drastically limited , yet kostunica has so far lacked courage to prepare the serbian population for the possible loss of the province . kosovo albanians , on the other hand , are increasing the pressure on the west by postulating unlimited independence as something non-negotiable .
this is only hiking up the expectations of the population .
over the past few years , kosovo albanians have learned that the west is backing away from its political demands and giving in to riots and violence . after the massive riots three years ago , the eu gave up its postulate " standards before status . "
the eu is no longer demanding that the democratic rules of engagement be established and minorities protected before the status is determined .

it must find a face-saving solution for both parties that everybody would support .
that is why the word " independence " has not been in circulation for days .
on the other hand , serbia 's sovereignty is also not mentioned any more . the only way out of this dilemma lies in the clear eu accession perspectives for the serbs and the albanians .
both conflicting parties know that their economic and political development is coupled with eu membership and that they have to rely on the eu .
it must be made clear to both the serbs and the albanians that it is paradoxical for them to insist on sovereignty when they will sooner or later give up parts of that sovereignty to the eu .

his difficult and uncertain mission is of paramount importance , not only for the balkans , but the eu in general , says dw 's verica spasovska . united nations envoy martti ahtisaari has taken on a difficult mission .
its success - with serbs and albanians heavily entrenched in their positions - is highly uncertain .
ahtisaari 's visit to belgrade was made even more explosive when serbian prime minister vojsilav kostunica refused to meet with him - supposedly because he is in the midst of a complicated process of building a new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verica spasovska at the same time , kostunica is threatening to break off diplomatic relations with those countries that want to recognize kosovo .
in this precarious moment , kostuncia seems to be trying to shun political responsibility . the eu has been implying for months that the kosovo proposal could lead to independence , even if drastically limited , yet kostunica has so far lacked courage to prepare the serbian population for the possible loss of the province . kosovo albanians , on the other hand , are increasing the pressure on the west by postulating unlimited independence as something non-negotiable .
this is only hiking up the expectations of the population .
over the past few years , kosovo albanians have learned that the west is backing away from its political demands and giving in to riots and violence . after the massive riots three years ago , the eu gave up its postulate " standards before status . "

topping the agenda are the situation in iraq , iran and the israeli-palestinian conflict . over the past six weeks , angela merkel has already met with israeli prime minister olmert , president of the palestinian autonomous authority abbas and jordanian king abdullah ii .
the forthcoming trip to the gulf region - during which she will visit four countries in four days - will be the german chancellor 's first longer trip after 14 months in office . merkel has received assurances from us president george w. bush that the united states will again strengthen their involvement in the peace negotiations between israel and palestine .
on friday , one day before merkel 's trip to the gulf , the middle-east quartet - consisting of the us , russia , the eu and the un - met again for the first time in a year . while former german chancellor gerhard schröder made economic ties the focus of his trips to the middle east , " political topics will clearly stand in the foreground " during merkel 's talks , said government spokesperson thomas steg . political agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanon is still recovering from the war with israel germany 's economics minister , michael gloss , is also traveling to the region together with a delegation of business leaders , but their routes will overlap only occasionally . " the chancellor would like the countries in the region to feel responsible and participate in conflict resolution , " steg said . there are already enough conflicts in the middle east : while lebanon 's moderate government is fighting for stability , iran is causing alarm with its nuclear plans , and palestinian rival movements hamas and fatah are involved in a power struggle that has - since the escalation of violence - cost 60 lives . " the essential historical conflict , however , remains to be the one between israel and palestine , " said middle east expert christian-peter hanelt .
" if this conflict gets resolved , this will have a positive effect on the whole region . " a stabilizing role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear plans are causing concern in the region it 's become clear in the last few months that moderate gulf countries can play an important role for the stabilization of the middle east . " they are now showing more clearly that they are ready to assume responsibility , " hanelt said . the saudi royal family exerted positive influence , for instance , during the hezbollah general strike in lebanon . " in his talks with the iranian leaders , their special envoy prevented the escalation of the general strike , " hanelt said . together with egypt , saudi arabia offered earlier this week to mediate in the inner-palestinian conflict . similar interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabian 's king abdullah is important for angela merkel 's middle east initiative according to günter meyer , who heads the mainz-based center for research on the arab world , the saudi king abdullah will be a particularly important negotiating partner for merkel because germany and saudia arabia have similar interests , especially vis-à-vis iran . " since iran is no longer militarily kept at bay by iraq , the saudis are increasingly seeing a threat in iran because of their ideological differences , " meyer said . iran is ruled by shiite moslems , whereas the saudis are mostly sunnites . " the fact that she is the council president of the whole european union will strengthen her position during this trip , " meyer said . in her talks with king abdullah ii last week in berlin , merkel spoke about taking advantage of the existing " window of opportunity for the peace process . "
after her trip to the middle east , she 'll know a little better if she was right about it . mareike aden -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no headscarf for chancellor merkel during arab tour german chancellor angela merkel will not be packing a headscarf in preparation for her tour of four arab countries which kicks off on saturday .

8 , its director seems worried about well-funded competitors on the festival circuit .
experts say that he need n't lose too much sleep over it . it was an entry fit for a movie star : surrounded by a cloud of flashbulbs , berlinale director dieter kosslick appeared before a few hundred journalists on tuesday to present the program for this year 's festival - the 57th of its kind .
he talked about record movie entries -lrb- some 5,000 -rrb- , a booming film market and a new event called " culinary cinema " that features screenings followed by a gourmet meal . known for his abominable english skills , kosslick had the room roaring with laughter when he recounted how he managed to convince clint eastwood to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is kosslick really worried about new festivals ?
" i 'm dieter from ze cherman film festival , " he introduced himself after mistaking eastwood for a friend in la .
apparently it did the trick . but off the stage , in a recent interview , kosslick did n't seem to be in the mood for jokes . " things are getting more and more complicated when it comes to film festivals , " kosslick told german daily die welt .
" there 's a boom in festivals and a boom in film markets , with millions invested in them . " nouveau riche competitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress isabella rossellini came to rome 's festival , but she will also come to berlin he was talking about a new generation of events that have sprung up around the globe in recent years .
in europe , cinema .
festa internazionale di roma just premiered with a rumored budget of 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26 million -rrb- last october .
in asia , festivals in bangkok and pusan -lrb- south korea -rrb- are increasingly getting attention .
and then there 's the three-year-old dubai international film festival -lrb- diff -rrb- , which kosslick also does n't think of too highly . " i know that ... rome and dubai buy stars with big money to put on festivals for an audience , " he told german trade magazine promedia .
" the big competitors that have a lot of money are increasingly turning into marketing events . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dubai will focus on arab film makers not so , said chris paton , a diff spokesman , who rejected the allegation that officials in dubai paid stars to attend . " while their hospitality can be on a very grand scale , they do n't pay straight-out fees , " he said , adding that free first-class flights and deluxe accommodation arrangements were necessary to convince hollywood greats to make the 23-hour journey . " if you want american stars to travel such a distance , of course you have to treat them in the right way , " paton said . the a-list clout he added that diff was more interested in establishing itself as an important regional hub than competing with one of " the three grande dames " : berlin , cannes and venice . others agreed that kosslick should n't worry too much about losing out because of the likes of rome or dubai . " i do n't think there is real competition , " said bruno chatelin , the paris-based co-founder of filmfestivals.com and a former film studio marketing executive .
" producers know the difference between being selected in dubai and being selected in berlin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they still do wonders to a movie 's selling power thorsten schaumann , the head of germany 's leading film distributor bavaria film international , agreed that recognition in berlin was highly valuable for a movie . " the berlinale is certainly the first big a-festival of the year for us to meet all the buyers , " said schaumann , who has two films competing for the festival 's coveted golden bear trophy . " it 's one of the most important , if not the most important festivals for us , " he added .
" that 's a status that can not be taken away . " but that 's not to say that some of the newcomers are n't welcome additions to the year-round festival circus . " rome 's an important platform for us as well , " schaumann said .
" we need a european market at the end of the year . " a healthy dose of arrogance in the end , berlinale director kosslick 's comments might have been nothing more than a clever trick to position his festival .

gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison . nearly 30 years after left-wing radical group , raf -lrb- red army faction -rrb- terrorized west germany , federal prosecutors have filed a request for the release of brigitte mohnhaupt , a leading raf member who was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 for her role in a series of prominent murders .
separately , german president horst köhler is considering a pardon for mohnhaupt 's former colleague , christian klar who is serving a life sentence for at least 11 killings . the moves have sparked a furious debate in germany pitting outraged relatives of the raf 's victims against politicians who say the killers have done their time and no longer pose a threat to society . dw-world.de spoke with gerhart baum , former interior minister of germany and a member of the free-market liberal fdp party .
baum is a prominent advocate of releasing the prisoners . dw-world.de : why are you in favor of releasing mohnhaupt and klar from prison ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhart baum wants former raf prisoners to be released gerhart baum : that 's because i respect the principles of our constitutional state and believe they must be applied to the raf terrorists too .
they should not be given any special status , either in the negative or positive sense .
at the time -lrb- of their arrest -rrb- we refused to treat them as prisoners of the war as they wanted .
the raf terrorists are criminals and murderers and must be treated like any other criminals in a comparable case . we also need to make a distinction between the two .
in mohnhaupt 's case , it 's about releasing her on parole .
with christian klar , it 's about him being pardoned by the german president .
both cases are being reviewed by the authorities who will eventually make a decision . christian klar was given a triple life sentence .
can you explain what " life imprisonment " means in a strictly legal sense in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar is in prison for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder it does not mean literally for life .
there is no life-long imprisonment in practice unless the perpetrators are deemed dangerous and remain dangerous .
according to our laws , a life sentence is reviewed after 15 years for the first time .
and one of the fundamental principles of our legal system - which has been repeatedly reaffirmed by the country 's highest court - is that human dignity , as it is laid down in the constitution , also means that a person who is sentenced to life imprisonment must be given a perspective for freedom . those who oppose releasing mohnhaupt and klar say the two have neither shown any remorse nor contributed towards clearing up a series of unsolved murders . that 's precisely why mohnhaupt and klar have been punished so severely .
their sentences represent the toughest legal verdicts ever passed for raf terrorists .
they did n't show any remorse and they did n't cooperate in solving crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte mohnhaupt has never shown any contrition but we have to be clear on the point that according to german law , remorse is n't demanded .
it 's desirable , but it is n't necessary .
in the case of christian klar , who has appealed to the german president for clemency , it 's a different matter .
there i expect klar to distance himself from his crimes .
he has apparently done that .
but that 's for the german president to decide . you were germany 's interior minister from 1978 to 1982 and thus a key player in the german state 's long battle with the raf .
how do you look back on your role today ? in addition to using important police and legal resources - which we managed to implement successfully to defeat the raf - i especially tried to highlight flawed developments in our society at that time .
the aim was not to play down the raf , but rather to draw attention to the social environment in which those turbulent events took place . and let 's not forget , they are an issue until today .
just recently a double book edition was published with articles from some 60 scientists who analyzed that period because the raf is a radical byproduct of the disintegration of the left-wing protest movement .
at that time , we tried to sway those who harbored sympathy for the raf and win them over to the rule of law .
and we were successful with that . you were also responsible for passing several harsh anti-terror laws at the time .
do you regret any ?
what would you do differently today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in april 1977 federal prosecutor general siegfried buback was shot and killed by the raf the anti-terror measures were a necessary reaction .
we had to strengthen our police services which were n't in good shape then .
we also had to adapt our courts and legal systems to deal with new criminal behavioral patterns by making changes to our penal code as well as legal procedural code . i admit that some of this partly went too far .
to an extent , there was also a political overreaction to the raf threat .
but we did then dilute some of the measures .
when i took office in 1978 , i also abolished some of the measures used by the police to hunt down raf suspects - a procedure which also hugely affected unsuspecting citizens .
so we did draw certain consequences to deal with the threat of that time . at the same time , it has to be said that since the raf , anti-terror legislation has been continually beefed up , particularly after the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
we 're practically living in a state of permanent emergency where the balance between freedom and security has been damaged and ended up putting curbs on freedom . what lessons do you think germany can draw from the raf era in fighting terrorism today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of schleyer , held hostage by the raf for over a month , became an iconic image of 1970s west germany the most important thing is to maintain calm and not give in to hysteria and populist fear .
politicians should not be allowed to hijack security and turn it into an election topic .
instead the government has to tell the population that we must learn to live with risks .
germany must keep its cool , remain sober and pragmatic and only pass security measures that make real sense instead of symbolic gestures which are passed off as enhanced security for the population but which in reality only curb freedom . nearly 30 years after the raf terrorized west germany , the topic remains highly emotional and sparks strong reactions in germany .
why is that ? that whole period - the reform movements , the struggle for democratic reforms in the political parties , the left-wing protest movement , that whole turbulence and feeling of new beginnings of 1968 , the new policy towards the soviet union - is a fascinating one .
even the people suddenly lived differently at the time , they had a different relationship to sexuality , and art was in a heady heyday .
all that does still fascinate or interest today 's young generation .
a year ago an raf exhibition took place in berlin where artists reacted to the raf .
i promoted the exhibition at the time and it saw a record 50,000 visitors , most of them young people . but that is not to be mistaken as a fascination with the raf , which is only limited .
it 's more an interest in the political spirit of a highly exciting time .
i do n't think that the raf has turned into a myth .
we have to remember that they were murderers , though they were politically motivated . but the majority of the german population is against the release of mohnhaupt and klar .
how do you explain that ? if you follow a simple question pattern - are you for or against the release - then i think you could very quickly even have a situation where the population will be in favor of the death penalty .
this is where a democratic constitutional state has to show some nerve , keep its calm and hold fast to the fundamental principles of the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf 's symbol of a star and a rifle in the 1980s when german president richard von weizsäcker pardoned raf terrorists , it was considered an important gesture .
that is not the case today because the raf and its group of sympathizers no longer exist .
what we need is renewed proof that the german constitutional state is capable of showing mercy . do you think germany will finally close the raf chapter once its last remaining former members are released from prison ? no , not in any way .
we still do n't know the murderers of a whole series of victims after 1985 - for example those of alfred herrhausen -lrb- former deutsche bank chief -rrb- or detlev karsten rohwedder -lrb- leader of the post-reunification government-owned treuhand organization which was responsible for privatizing east german companies . -rrb- and not only do we not know the identity of the perpetrators who are still being hunted , but the interest in the period around 1967 and 1968 still remains very high .
so there is no way the debate will come to an end after the last raf members are released . sonia phalnikar interviewed gerhart baum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : " remorse is not a prerequisite " germany 's newspapers have been debating the possible early release of raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt and the petition for pardon that christian klar , another raf terrorist , submitted to the german president .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 02.02.2007 german chancellor arrives for talks in egypt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's presidency over the eu council will strengthen her position in the middle east german chancellor merkel left on saturday for a four-day trip to egypt , kuwait , saudi arabia and the united arab emirates .
topping the agenda are the situation in iraq , iran and the israeli-palestinian conflict . over the past six weeks , angela merkel has already met with israeli prime minister olmert , president of the palestinian autonomous authority abbas and jordanian king abdullah ii .
the forthcoming trip to the gulf region - during which she will visit four countries in four days - will be the german chancellor 's first longer trip after 14 months in office . merkel has received assurances from us president george w. bush that the united states will again strengthen their involvement in the peace negotiations between israel and palestine .
on friday , one day before merkel 's trip to the gulf , the middle-east quartet - consisting of the us , russia , the eu and the un - met again for the first time in a year . while former german chancellor gerhard schröder made economic ties the focus of his trips to the middle east , " political topics will clearly stand in the foreground " during merkel 's talks , said government spokesperson thomas steg . political agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanon is still recovering from the war with israel germany 's economics minister , michael gloss , is also traveling to the region together with a delegation of business leaders , but their routes will overlap only occasionally . " the chancellor would like the countries in the region to feel responsible and participate in conflict resolution , " steg said . there are already enough conflicts in the middle east : while lebanon 's moderate government is fighting for stability , iran is causing alarm with its nuclear plans , and palestinian rival movements hamas and fatah are involved in a power struggle that has - since the escalation of violence - cost 60 lives . " the essential historical conflict , however , remains to be the one between israel and palestine , " said middle east expert christian-peter hanelt .
" if this conflict gets resolved , this will have a positive effect on the whole region . " a stabilizing role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear plans are causing concern in the region it 's become clear in the last few months that moderate gulf countries can play an important role for the stabilization of the middle east . " they are now showing more clearly that they are ready to assume responsibility , " hanelt said . the saudi royal family exerted positive influence , for instance , during the hezbollah general strike in lebanon .

on friday , one day before merkel 's trip to the gulf , the middle-east quartet - consisting of the us , russia , the eu and the un - met again for the first time in a year . while former german chancellor gerhard schröder made economic ties the focus of his trips to the middle east , " political topics will clearly stand in the foreground " during merkel 's talks , said government spokesperson thomas steg . political agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanon is still recovering from the war with israel germany 's economics minister , michael gloss , is also traveling to the region together with a delegation of business leaders , but their routes will overlap only occasionally . " the chancellor would like the countries in the region to feel responsible and participate in conflict resolution , " steg said . there are already enough conflicts in the middle east : while lebanon 's moderate government is fighting for stability , iran is causing alarm with its nuclear plans , and palestinian rival movements hamas and fatah are involved in a power struggle that has - since the escalation of violence - cost 60 lives . " the essential historical conflict , however , remains to be the one between israel and palestine , " said middle east expert christian-peter hanelt .
" if this conflict gets resolved , this will have a positive effect on the whole region . " a stabilizing role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear plans are causing concern in the region it 's become clear in the last few months that moderate gulf countries can play an important role for the stabilization of the middle east . " they are now showing more clearly that they are ready to assume responsibility , " hanelt said . the saudi royal family exerted positive influence , for instance , during the hezbollah general strike in lebanon . " in his talks with the iranian leaders , their special envoy prevented the escalation of the general strike , " hanelt said . together with egypt , saudi arabia offered earlier this week to mediate in the inner-palestinian conflict . similar interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabian 's king abdullah is important for angela merkel 's middle east initiative according to günter meyer , who heads the mainz-based center for research on the arab world , the saudi king abdullah will be a particularly important negotiating partner for merkel because germany and saudia arabia have similar interests , especially vis-à-vis iran . " since iran is no longer militarily kept at bay by iraq , the saudis are increasingly seeing a threat in iran because of their ideological differences , " meyer said . iran is ruled by shiite moslems , whereas the saudis are mostly sunnites . " the fact that she is the council president of the whole european union will strengthen her position during this trip , " meyer said . in her talks with king abdullah ii last week in berlin , merkel spoke about taking advantage of the existing " window of opportunity for the peace process . "

gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison . nearly 30 years after left-wing radical group , raf -lrb- red army faction -rrb- terrorized west germany , federal prosecutors have filed a request for the release of brigitte mohnhaupt , a leading raf member who was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 for her role in a series of prominent murders .
separately , german president horst köhler is considering a pardon for mohnhaupt 's former colleague , christian klar who is serving a life sentence for at least 11 killings . the moves have sparked a furious debate in germany pitting outraged relatives of the raf 's victims against politicians who say the killers have done their time and no longer pose a threat to society . dw-world.de spoke with gerhart baum , former interior minister of germany and a member of the free-market liberal fdp party .
baum is a prominent advocate of releasing the prisoners . dw-world.de : why are you in favor of releasing mohnhaupt and klar from prison ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhart baum wants former raf prisoners to be released gerhart baum : that 's because i respect the principles of our constitutional state and believe they must be applied to the raf terrorists too .
they should not be given any special status , either in the negative or positive sense .
at the time -lrb- of their arrest -rrb- we refused to treat them as prisoners of the war as they wanted .
the raf terrorists are criminals and murderers and must be treated like any other criminals in a comparable case . we also need to make a distinction between the two .
in mohnhaupt 's case , it 's about releasing her on parole .
with christian klar , it 's about him being pardoned by the german president .
both cases are being reviewed by the authorities who will eventually make a decision . christian klar was given a triple life sentence .
can you explain what " life imprisonment " means in a strictly legal sense in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar is in prison for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder it does not mean literally for life .
there is no life-long imprisonment in practice unless the perpetrators are deemed dangerous and remain dangerous .
according to our laws , a life sentence is reviewed after 15 years for the first time .
and one of the fundamental principles of our legal system - which has been repeatedly reaffirmed by the country 's highest court - is that human dignity , as it is laid down in the constitution , also means that a person who is sentenced to life imprisonment must be given a perspective for freedom . those who oppose releasing mohnhaupt and klar say the two have neither shown any remorse nor contributed towards clearing up a series of unsolved murders . that 's precisely why mohnhaupt and klar have been punished so severely .
their sentences represent the toughest legal verdicts ever passed for raf terrorists .
they did n't show any remorse and they did n't cooperate in solving crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte mohnhaupt has never shown any contrition but we have to be clear on the point that according to german law , remorse is n't demanded .
it 's desirable , but it is n't necessary .
in the case of christian klar , who has appealed to the german president for clemency , it 's a different matter .
there i expect klar to distance himself from his crimes .
he has apparently done that .
but that 's for the german president to decide . you were germany 's interior minister from 1978 to 1982 and thus a key player in the german state 's long battle with the raf .
how do you look back on your role today ? in addition to using important police and legal resources - which we managed to implement successfully to defeat the raf - i especially tried to highlight flawed developments in our society at that time .
the aim was not to play down the raf , but rather to draw attention to the social environment in which those turbulent events took place . and let 's not forget , they are an issue until today .
just recently a double book edition was published with articles from some 60 scientists who analyzed that period because the raf is a radical byproduct of the disintegration of the left-wing protest movement .
at that time , we tried to sway those who harbored sympathy for the raf and win them over to the rule of law .
and we were successful with that . you were also responsible for passing several harsh anti-terror laws at the time .
do you regret any ?
what would you do differently today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in april 1977 federal prosecutor general siegfried buback was shot and killed by the raf the anti-terror measures were a necessary reaction .
we had to strengthen our police services which were n't in good shape then .
we also had to adapt our courts and legal systems to deal with new criminal behavioral patterns by making changes to our penal code as well as legal procedural code . i admit that some of this partly went too far .
to an extent , there was also a political overreaction to the raf threat .
but we did then dilute some of the measures .
when i took office in 1978 , i also abolished some of the measures used by the police to hunt down raf suspects - a procedure which also hugely affected unsuspecting citizens .
so we did draw certain consequences to deal with the threat of that time . at the same time , it has to be said that since the raf , anti-terror legislation has been continually beefed up , particularly after the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
we 're practically living in a state of permanent emergency where the balance between freedom and security has been damaged and ended up putting curbs on freedom . what lessons do you think germany can draw from the raf era in fighting terrorism today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of schleyer , held hostage by the raf for over a month , became an iconic image of 1970s west germany the most important thing is to maintain calm and not give in to hysteria and populist fear .
politicians should not be allowed to hijack security and turn it into an election topic .
instead the government has to tell the population that we must learn to live with risks .
germany must keep its cool , remain sober and pragmatic and only pass security measures that make real sense instead of symbolic gestures which are passed off as enhanced security for the population but which in reality only curb freedom . nearly 30 years after the raf terrorized west germany , the topic remains highly emotional and sparks strong reactions in germany .
why is that ? that whole period - the reform movements , the struggle for democratic reforms in the political parties , the left-wing protest movement , that whole turbulence and feeling of new beginnings of 1968 , the new policy towards the soviet union - is a fascinating one .
even the people suddenly lived differently at the time , they had a different relationship to sexuality , and art was in a heady heyday .
all that does still fascinate or interest today 's young generation .
a year ago an raf exhibition took place in berlin where artists reacted to the raf .
i promoted the exhibition at the time and it saw a record 50,000 visitors , most of them young people . but that is not to be mistaken as a fascination with the raf , which is only limited .
it 's more an interest in the political spirit of a highly exciting time .
i do n't think that the raf has turned into a myth .
we have to remember that they were murderers , though they were politically motivated . but the majority of the german population is against the release of mohnhaupt and klar .
how do you explain that ? if you follow a simple question pattern - are you for or against the release - then i think you could very quickly even have a situation where the population will be in favor of the death penalty .
this is where a democratic constitutional state has to show some nerve , keep its calm and hold fast to the fundamental principles of the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf 's symbol of a star and a rifle in the 1980s when german president richard von weizsäcker pardoned raf terrorists , it was considered an important gesture .
that is not the case today because the raf and its group of sympathizers no longer exist .
what we need is renewed proof that the german constitutional state is capable of showing mercy . do you think germany will finally close the raf chapter once its last remaining former members are released from prison ? no , not in any way .
we still do n't know the murderers of a whole series of victims after 1985 - for example those of alfred herrhausen -lrb- former deutsche bank chief -rrb- or detlev karsten rohwedder -lrb- leader of the post-reunification government-owned treuhand organization which was responsible for privatizing east german companies . -rrb- and not only do we not know the identity of the perpetrators who are still being hunted , but the interest in the period around 1967 and 1968 still remains very high .
so there is no way the debate will come to an end after the last raf members are released . sonia phalnikar interviewed gerhart baum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : " remorse is not a prerequisite " germany 's newspapers have been debating the possible early release of raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt and the petition for pardon that christian klar , another raf terrorist , submitted to the german president .

and one of the fundamental principles of our legal system - which has been repeatedly reaffirmed by the country 's highest court - is that human dignity , as it is laid down in the constitution , also means that a person who is sentenced to life imprisonment must be given a perspective for freedom . those who oppose releasing mohnhaupt and klar say the two have neither shown any remorse nor contributed towards clearing up a series of unsolved murders . that 's precisely why mohnhaupt and klar have been punished so severely .
their sentences represent the toughest legal verdicts ever passed for raf terrorists .
they did n't show any remorse and they did n't cooperate in solving crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte mohnhaupt has never shown any contrition but we have to be clear on the point that according to german law , remorse is n't demanded .
it 's desirable , but it is n't necessary .
in the case of christian klar , who has appealed to the german president for clemency , it 's a different matter .
there i expect klar to distance himself from his crimes .
he has apparently done that .
but that 's for the german president to decide . you were germany 's interior minister from 1978 to 1982 and thus a key player in the german state 's long battle with the raf .
how do you look back on your role today ? in addition to using important police and legal resources - which we managed to implement successfully to defeat the raf - i especially tried to highlight flawed developments in our society at that time .
the aim was not to play down the raf , but rather to draw attention to the social environment in which those turbulent events took place . and let 's not forget , they are an issue until today .
just recently a double book edition was published with articles from some 60 scientists who analyzed that period because the raf is a radical byproduct of the disintegration of the left-wing protest movement .
at that time , we tried to sway those who harbored sympathy for the raf and win them over to the rule of law .
and we were successful with that . you were also responsible for passing several harsh anti-terror laws at the time .
do you regret any ?
what would you do differently today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in april 1977 federal prosecutor general siegfried buback was shot and killed by the raf the anti-terror measures were a necessary reaction .
we had to strengthen our police services which were n't in good shape then .
we also had to adapt our courts and legal systems to deal with new criminal behavioral patterns by making changes to our penal code as well as legal procedural code . i admit that some of this partly went too far .
to an extent , there was also a political overreaction to the raf threat .
but we did then dilute some of the measures .
when i took office in 1978 , i also abolished some of the measures used by the police to hunt down raf suspects - a procedure which also hugely affected unsuspecting citizens .
so we did draw certain consequences to deal with the threat of that time . at the same time , it has to be said that since the raf , anti-terror legislation has been continually beefed up , particularly after the attacks of sept .

we 're practically living in a state of permanent emergency where the balance between freedom and security has been damaged and ended up putting curbs on freedom . what lessons do you think germany can draw from the raf era in fighting terrorism today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of schleyer , held hostage by the raf for over a month , became an iconic image of 1970s west germany the most important thing is to maintain calm and not give in to hysteria and populist fear .
politicians should not be allowed to hijack security and turn it into an election topic .
instead the government has to tell the population that we must learn to live with risks .
germany must keep its cool , remain sober and pragmatic and only pass security measures that make real sense instead of symbolic gestures which are passed off as enhanced security for the population but which in reality only curb freedom . nearly 30 years after the raf terrorized west germany , the topic remains highly emotional and sparks strong reactions in germany .
why is that ? that whole period - the reform movements , the struggle for democratic reforms in the political parties , the left-wing protest movement , that whole turbulence and feeling of new beginnings of 1968 , the new policy towards the soviet union - is a fascinating one .
even the people suddenly lived differently at the time , they had a different relationship to sexuality , and art was in a heady heyday .
all that does still fascinate or interest today 's young generation .
a year ago an raf exhibition took place in berlin where artists reacted to the raf .
i promoted the exhibition at the time and it saw a record 50,000 visitors , most of them young people . but that is not to be mistaken as a fascination with the raf , which is only limited .
it 's more an interest in the political spirit of a highly exciting time .
i do n't think that the raf has turned into a myth .
we have to remember that they were murderers , though they were politically motivated . but the majority of the german population is against the release of mohnhaupt and klar .
how do you explain that ? if you follow a simple question pattern - are you for or against the release - then i think you could very quickly even have a situation where the population will be in favor of the death penalty .

gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison . nearly 30 years after left-wing radical group , raf -lrb- red army faction -rrb- terrorized west germany , federal prosecutors have filed a request for the release of brigitte mohnhaupt , a leading raf member who was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 for her role in a series of prominent murders .
separately , german president horst köhler is considering a pardon for mohnhaupt 's former colleague , christian klar who is serving a life sentence for at least 11 killings . the moves have sparked a furious debate in germany pitting outraged relatives of the raf 's victims against politicians who say the killers have done their time and no longer pose a threat to society . dw-world.de spoke with gerhart baum , former interior minister of germany and a member of the free-market liberal fdp party .
baum is a prominent advocate of releasing the prisoners . dw-world.de : why are you in favor of releasing mohnhaupt and klar from prison ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhart baum wants former raf prisoners to be released gerhart baum : that 's because i respect the principles of our constitutional state and believe they must be applied to the raf terrorists too .
they should not be given any special status , either in the negative or positive sense .
at the time -lrb- of their arrest -rrb- we refused to treat them as prisoners of the war as they wanted .
the raf terrorists are criminals and murderers and must be treated like any other criminals in a comparable case . we also need to make a distinction between the two .
in mohnhaupt 's case , it 's about releasing her on parole .
with christian klar , it 's about him being pardoned by the german president .
both cases are being reviewed by the authorities who will eventually make a decision . christian klar was given a triple life sentence .
can you explain what " life imprisonment " means in a strictly legal sense in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar is in prison for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder it does not mean literally for life .
there is no life-long imprisonment in practice unless the perpetrators are deemed dangerous and remain dangerous .

and one of the fundamental principles of our legal system - which has been repeatedly reaffirmed by the country 's highest court - is that human dignity , as it is laid down in the constitution , also means that a person who is sentenced to life imprisonment must be given a perspective for freedom . those who oppose releasing mohnhaupt and klar say the two have neither shown any remorse nor contributed towards clearing up a series of unsolved murders . that 's precisely why mohnhaupt and klar have been punished so severely .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 02.02.2007 opinion : kosovo is a challenge for the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy martti ahtisaari presented his draft proposal for kosovo on friday .
his difficult and uncertain mission is of paramount importance , not only for the balkans , but the eu in general , says dw 's verica spasovska . united nations envoy martti ahtisaari has taken on a difficult mission .
its success - with serbs and albanians heavily entrenched in their positions - is highly uncertain .
ahtisaari 's visit to belgrade was made even more explosive when serbian prime minister vojsilav kostunica refused to meet with him - supposedly because he is in the midst of a complicated process of building a new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verica spasovska at the same time , kostunica is threatening to break off diplomatic relations with those countries that want to recognize kosovo .
in this precarious moment , kostuncia seems to be trying to shun political responsibility . the eu has been implying for months that the kosovo proposal could lead to independence , even if drastically limited , yet kostunica has so far lacked courage to prepare the serbian population for the possible loss of the province . kosovo albanians , on the other hand , are increasing the pressure on the west by postulating unlimited independence as something non-negotiable .
this is only hiking up the expectations of the population .
over the past few years , kosovo albanians have learned that the west is backing away from its political demands and giving in to riots and violence . after the massive riots three years ago , the eu gave up its postulate " standards before status . "
the eu is no longer demanding that the democratic rules of engagement be established and minorities protected before the status is determined .
since violence was rewarded with political concessions , one can possibly expect a new escalation of violence if all the demands of kosovo albanians are not met .
the international peace / keeping troops have been placed on heightened alert . the eu is in a tight spot .
it must find a face-saving solution for both parties that everybody would support .
that is why the word " independence " has not been in circulation for days .
on the other hand , serbia 's sovereignty is also not mentioned any more . the only way out of this dilemma lies in the clear eu accession perspectives for the serbs and the albanians .
both conflicting parties know that their economic and political development is coupled with eu membership and that they have to rely on the eu .
it must be made clear to both the serbs and the albanians that it is paradoxical for them to insist on sovereignty when they will sooner or later give up parts of that sovereignty to the eu .
they have to understand that at the very least that 's why the use of violence is not worth it . for the european union , kosovo is an elementary challenge : the eu has to manage this conflict successfully if it is to show that it is capable of a uniform foreign policy . verica spasovska is head of dw-radio 's program for central and southeastern europe -lrb- tt -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de del ponte warns eu against resuming talks with serbia carla del ponte , the un chief prosecutor for war crimes in the former yugoslavia , on wednesday warned the eu against resuming cooperation talks with serbia , saying key fugitives must first be arrested .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 02.02.2007 german chancellor arrives for talks in egypt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's presidency over the eu council will strengthen her position in the middle east german chancellor merkel left on saturday for a four-day trip to egypt , kuwait , saudi arabia and the united arab emirates .
topping the agenda are the situation in iraq , iran and the israeli-palestinian conflict . over the past six weeks , angela merkel has already met with israeli prime minister olmert , president of the palestinian autonomous authority abbas and jordanian king abdullah ii .
the forthcoming trip to the gulf region - during which she will visit four countries in four days - will be the german chancellor 's first longer trip after 14 months in office . merkel has received assurances from us president george w. bush that the united states will again strengthen their involvement in the peace negotiations between israel and palestine .
on friday , one day before merkel 's trip to the gulf , the middle-east quartet - consisting of the us , russia , the eu and the un - met again for the first time in a year . while former german chancellor gerhard schröder made economic ties the focus of his trips to the middle east , " political topics will clearly stand in the foreground " during merkel 's talks , said government spokesperson thomas steg . political agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanon is still recovering from the war with israel germany 's economics minister , michael gloss , is also traveling to the region together with a delegation of business leaders , but their routes will overlap only occasionally . " the chancellor would like the countries in the region to feel responsible and participate in conflict resolution , " steg said . there are already enough conflicts in the middle east : while lebanon 's moderate government is fighting for stability , iran is causing alarm with its nuclear plans , and palestinian rival movements hamas and fatah are involved in a power struggle that has - since the escalation of violence - cost 60 lives . " the essential historical conflict , however , remains to be the one between israel and palestine , " said middle east expert christian-peter hanelt .
" if this conflict gets resolved , this will have a positive effect on the whole region . " a stabilizing role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear plans are causing concern in the region it 's become clear in the last few months that moderate gulf countries can play an important role for the stabilization of the middle east .

thus , at least 40 parliamentarians from the ruling coalition parties , the christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , rejected the reform . health minister ulla schmidt said she was satisfied with the result . " it 's a good majority , " she said on friday . the bundesrat , germany 's upper chamber of parliament , will vote on the legislation on feb .
16 , and is also expected to approve it .
the law will come into effect on april 1 .

" stinginess makes you sick , " read their backs the reform 's original aim was to cut non-labor wage costs , which contribute to the high price of german workers .
however , public health insurance companies raised their premiums during the long months of discussion before the reform passed .
both employers and employees were forced to pay more , jacking up non-wage labor costs .
lowest common denominator angela merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister party , the csu , initially wanted to cap employers ' contributions , which the social democrats opposed .
instead , the spd wanted a broader segment of society to be required to contribute to the system of solidarity that covers nearly 90 percent of germany 's residents .
the party demanded that civil servants , high earners and the self-employed also contribute to the public health insurance companies .
unlike the rest of society , those three groups are allowed to have private insurance plans , and most of them do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt was unable to push through her desires health minister schmidt , a social democrat , wanted private insurance to be available for everyone .
private insurers provide more services and allow more flexibility than the 252 public health insurance companies .
but the cdu / csu rejected schmidt 's plan .
in the end , the governing coalition of conservatives and social democrats agreed on the lowest common denominator .
still , merkel declared it a breakthrough . " the measures aim to improve the quality of providers , increase the choice and decision-making chances of the people insured , and altogether ensure a clearer picture of economy , transparency , competition and the financial viability of the health care system , " she said in july , when the coalition partners announced the compromise they had agreed upon . the heart of the reform is the so-called " health fund . "
from 2009 , all contributions to the public health insurance companies as well as state subsidies are supposed to be paid into this new fund .
the companies will levy a standard premium for everyone , and if the money they are allocated from the health fund does n't cover their costs , they will be able to charge the people they insure a supplement .
insurers who use their funds efficiently and do n't demand more money of their clients will thus be more appealing to the public .
lack of enthusiasm germany is the only country in the world that , in essence , has two separate health care systems - the private and public systems .
the reform will make it more difficult for people to be eligible for private insurance .
they will only be allowed to switch from a public to a private insurance company if they earn 3,975 euros -lrb- $ 5,155 -rrb- per month for three years . the changes also require everyone in germany to have health insurance by 2009 .
an estimated 200,000 residents are n't currently covered .
in the future , people who fall ill and are n't insured will be obliged to pay back health insurance premiums for up to five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospital staff is concerned that is will get harder to make ends meet the overhaul has n't provoked enthusiasm anywhere in germany - not from politicians , the insurance companies , health care professionals or patients .
up to the final days before the bundestag voted on the measures , the insurance companies lobbied the government to reform the reform .
they argued that the changes would n't resolve the public health care system 's financial problems , patients would carry a greater burden than now , bureaucracy would be increased and competition limited . " if this is a reform , then reform is a dirty word , " said reinhard bütiköfer , head of the green party opposition in the bundestag .

" stinginess makes you sick , " read their backs the reform 's original aim was to cut non-labor wage costs , which contribute to the high price of german workers .
however , public health insurance companies raised their premiums during the long months of discussion before the reform passed .
both employers and employees were forced to pay more , jacking up non-wage labor costs .
lowest common denominator angela merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister party , the csu , initially wanted to cap employers ' contributions , which the social democrats opposed .
instead , the spd wanted a broader segment of society to be required to contribute to the system of solidarity that covers nearly 90 percent of germany 's residents .
the party demanded that civil servants , high earners and the self-employed also contribute to the public health insurance companies .
unlike the rest of society , those three groups are allowed to have private insurance plans , and most of them do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt was unable to push through her desires health minister schmidt , a social democrat , wanted private insurance to be available for everyone .
private insurers provide more services and allow more flexibility than the 252 public health insurance companies .
but the cdu / csu rejected schmidt 's plan .
in the end , the governing coalition of conservatives and social democrats agreed on the lowest common denominator .
still , merkel declared it a breakthrough . " the measures aim to improve the quality of providers , increase the choice and decision-making chances of the people insured , and altogether ensure a clearer picture of economy , transparency , competition and the financial viability of the health care system , " she said in july , when the coalition partners announced the compromise they had agreed upon . the heart of the reform is the so-called " health fund . "
from 2009 , all contributions to the public health insurance companies as well as state subsidies are supposed to be paid into this new fund .
the companies will levy a standard premium for everyone , and if the money they are allocated from the health fund does n't cover their costs , they will be able to charge the people they insure a supplement .
insurers who use their funds efficiently and do n't demand more money of their clients will thus be more appealing to the public .
lack of enthusiasm germany is the only country in the world that , in essence , has two separate health care systems - the private and public systems .
the reform will make it more difficult for people to be eligible for private insurance .
they will only be allowed to switch from a public to a private insurance company if they earn 3,975 euros -lrb- $ 5,155 -rrb- per month for three years . the changes also require everyone in germany to have health insurance by 2009 .
an estimated 200,000 residents are n't currently covered .
in the future , people who fall ill and are n't insured will be obliged to pay back health insurance premiums for up to five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospital staff is concerned that is will get harder to make ends meet the overhaul has n't provoked enthusiasm anywhere in germany - not from politicians , the insurance companies , health care professionals or patients .
up to the final days before the bundestag voted on the measures , the insurance companies lobbied the government to reform the reform .
they argued that the changes would n't resolve the public health care system 's financial problems , patients would carry a greater burden than now , bureaucracy would be increased and competition limited . " if this is a reform , then reform is a dirty word , " said reinhard bütiköfer , head of the green party opposition in the bundestag .
" it is the first so-called health care system reform in which it is a foregone conclusion that everything will be more expensive for the people who are insured .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice paved the way for merkel to go without a headscarf " the times have changed , foreign guests are not obliged to wear the headscarf any more , " a saudi journalist explained .
" all the same , camilla , the wife of prince charles , wore a headscarf during her visit last year . " former british prime minister margaret thatcher and former us secretary of state madeleine albright also opted to cover their heads for riyadh talks during their times in office . saudi king abdullah is a strict muslim .
however , his religion has not prevented him from shaking hands with female politicians from foreign countries .
whirlwind visit in saudi arabia - where women are not permitted to drive and require the written consent of their male " custodians " for every important decision - even a handshake is a radical gesture with which all saudis would not agree .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are banned from driving in saudi arabia although some saudi women have inherited positions of influence or are highly respected for their business activities , no women have ascended to powerful positions in the country . talks with other women are not on merkel 's agenda , which is hardly surprising considering the brevity of her trip .
her meetings will focus primarily on economic questions , the middle east , violence in iraq and other perennial regional issues . the chancellor 's trip , which begins on saturday in egypt , will take her to saudi arabia on sunday and then on to kuwait and the emirate states of abu dhabi and dubai .

8 , its director seems worried about well-funded competitors on the festival circuit .
experts say that he need n't lose too much sleep over it . it was an entry fit for a movie star : surrounded by a cloud of flashbulbs , berlinale director dieter kosslick appeared before a few hundred journalists on tuesday to present the program for this year 's festival - the 57th of its kind .
he talked about record movie entries -lrb- some 5,000 -rrb- , a booming film market and a new event called " culinary cinema " that features screenings followed by a gourmet meal . known for his abominable english skills , kosslick had the room roaring with laughter when he recounted how he managed to convince clint eastwood to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is kosslick really worried about new festivals ?
" i 'm dieter from ze cherman film festival , " he introduced himself after mistaking eastwood for a friend in la .
apparently it did the trick . but off the stage , in a recent interview , kosslick did n't seem to be in the mood for jokes . " things are getting more and more complicated when it comes to film festivals , " kosslick told german daily die welt .
" there 's a boom in festivals and a boom in film markets , with millions invested in them . " nouveau riche competitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress isabella rossellini came to rome 's festival , but she will also come to berlin he was talking about a new generation of events that have sprung up around the globe in recent years .
in europe , cinema .
festa internazionale di roma just premiered with a rumored budget of 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26 million -rrb- last october .
in asia , festivals in bangkok and pusan -lrb- south korea -rrb- are increasingly getting attention .
and then there 's the three-year-old dubai international film festival -lrb- diff -rrb- , which kosslick also does n't think of too highly . " i know that ... rome and dubai buy stars with big money to put on festivals for an audience , " he told german trade magazine promedia .
" the big competitors that have a lot of money are increasingly turning into marketing events . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dubai will focus on arab film makers not so , said chris paton , a diff spokesman , who rejected the allegation that officials in dubai paid stars to attend . " while their hospitality can be on a very grand scale , they do n't pay straight-out fees , " he said , adding that free first-class flights and deluxe accommodation arrangements were necessary to convince hollywood greats to make the 23-hour journey . " if you want american stars to travel such a distance , of course you have to treat them in the right way , " paton said . the a-list clout he added that diff was more interested in establishing itself as an important regional hub than competing with one of " the three grande dames " : berlin , cannes and venice . others agreed that kosslick should n't worry too much about losing out because of the likes of rome or dubai . " i do n't think there is real competition , " said bruno chatelin , the paris-based co-founder of filmfestivals.com and a former film studio marketing executive .
" producers know the difference between being selected in dubai and being selected in berlin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they still do wonders to a movie 's selling power thorsten schaumann , the head of germany 's leading film distributor bavaria film international , agreed that recognition in berlin was highly valuable for a movie . " the berlinale is certainly the first big a-festival of the year for us to meet all the buyers , " said schaumann , who has two films competing for the festival 's coveted golden bear trophy . " it 's one of the most important , if not the most important festivals for us , " he added .
" that 's a status that can not be taken away . " but that 's not to say that some of the newcomers are n't welcome additions to the year-round festival circus . " rome 's an important platform for us as well , " schaumann said .
" we need a european market at the end of the year . " a healthy dose of arrogance in the end , berlinale director kosslick 's comments might have been nothing more than a clever trick to position his festival . " he 's discrediting the others by relegating them to a different league , " said thorsten hennig-thurau , who is professor for marketing and media research at weimar 's bauhaus university .
" he can do that , but i do n't think that 's what matters in the end . " what will matter is whether kosslick and his berlinale colleagues will manage to secure their hard-earned place among the world 's top film festivals by continuing to convince stars and movie producers to come to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now that 's more like it , dieter " let them open -lrb- their festivals -rrb- - we 'll be better , " hennig-thurau suggested as a more proactive approach . kosslick might have already gotten the hint . " i 'm quite confident that we have the right concept with our mix of film market , red carpet , dedicated cinema and promotion of young talents , " he told promedia . come next friday , he 'll get a chance to prove it again . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin film festival line-up complete four films from asia , two from latin america and one from israel along with a large contingent of movies from north america and europe form the line-up of entries at the berlinale .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 02.02.2007 opinion : kosovo is a challenge for the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy martti ahtisaari presented his draft proposal for kosovo on friday .
his difficult and uncertain mission is of paramount importance , not only for the balkans , but the eu in general , says dw 's verica spasovska . united nations envoy martti ahtisaari has taken on a difficult mission .
its success - with serbs and albanians heavily entrenched in their positions - is highly uncertain .
ahtisaari 's visit to belgrade was made even more explosive when serbian prime minister vojsilav kostunica refused to meet with him - supposedly because he is in the midst of a complicated process of building a new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verica spasovska at the same time , kostunica is threatening to break off diplomatic relations with those countries that want to recognize kosovo .
in this precarious moment , kostuncia seems to be trying to shun political responsibility . the eu has been implying for months that the kosovo proposal could lead to independence , even if drastically limited , yet kostunica has so far lacked courage to prepare the serbian population for the possible loss of the province . kosovo albanians , on the other hand , are increasing the pressure on the west by postulating unlimited independence as something non-negotiable .
this is only hiking up the expectations of the population .
over the past few years , kosovo albanians have learned that the west is backing away from its political demands and giving in to riots and violence . after the massive riots three years ago , the eu gave up its postulate " standards before status . "
the eu is no longer demanding that the democratic rules of engagement be established and minorities protected before the status is determined .
since violence was rewarded with political concessions , one can possibly expect a new escalation of violence if all the demands of kosovo albanians are not met .
the international peace / keeping troops have been placed on heightened alert . the eu is in a tight spot .
it must find a face-saving solution for both parties that everybody would support .
that is why the word " independence " has not been in circulation for days .
on the other hand , serbia 's sovereignty is also not mentioned any more . the only way out of this dilemma lies in the clear eu accession perspectives for the serbs and the albanians .
both conflicting parties know that their economic and political development is coupled with eu membership and that they have to rely on the eu .
it must be made clear to both the serbs and the albanians that it is paradoxical for them to insist on sovereignty when they will sooner or later give up parts of that sovereignty to the eu .
they have to understand that at the very least that 's why the use of violence is not worth it . for the european union , kosovo is an elementary challenge : the eu has to manage this conflict successfully if it is to show that it is capable of a uniform foreign policy . verica spasovska is head of dw-radio 's program for central and southeastern europe -lrb- tt -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de del ponte warns eu against resuming talks with serbia carla del ponte , the un chief prosecutor for war crimes in the former yugoslavia , on wednesday warned the eu against resuming cooperation talks with serbia , saying key fugitives must first be arrested .

it also said sea levels would probably rise by between 28 and 43 centimeters -lrb- 11 to 17 inches -rrb- . german research minister annette schavan said the cash increase in environmental investment which will be paid over the next three years . it will include 35 million euros for the expansion of the german climate change calculation center . technological solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the melting of ice in the arctic is set to accelerate , endangering the habitats of creatures like polar bears and increasing the probability of flooding schavan stressed the need for technological change based on well-founded scientific research to curb global warming . " to keep climate change within acceptable boundaries we have to carry out intensive research and ensure that climate-friendly technologies are rapidly distributed , " she said . the minister also said an action plan for climate change would soon be made public that centered on human and social needs . " this program will be forward-looking in that it offers technological solutions for the growing economies of our world , " schavan said .
" we will also open up new markets for our economy . " more heat waves and violent cyclones other projections made by the ipcc report include the increasing likelihood of heat waves and violent tropical cyclones , as well as the melting of the artic sea ice in summer by 2100 . the document was much more forceful than its last report in judging whether humans were to blame for climate change .
it said there was at least a 90 per cent probability that activities such as burning fossil fuels accounted for most of the warming over the past 50 years .
in 2001 , it said the link was 66 percent probable . " if you see the extent to which human activities are influencing the climate system , the options for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions appear in a different light , because you can see what the costs of inaction are , " ipcc chairman rajendra pachauri told delegates in paris . humans to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un wants governments to cut down on the use of fossil fuels the head of the un environment program achim steiner said friday would be remembered as the day when the question mark was removed from whether people are to blame for climate change . steiner , whose agency oversees the operation of the kyoto protocol , urged governments to put more effort into getting stalled talks on long-term cuts in carbon dioxide emissions back on track .
no post-2012 targets have yet been set . it is hoped that the united states , the world 's top emitter of greenhouse gases , will , in particular , do more to do cut the burning of fossil fuels in power plants , factories and cars . the us pulled out of the kyoto protocol in 2001 saying emission limits would damage the economy .
us president george w. bush was also critical of the decision to exclude developing nations from the targets during the first phase of the agreement .
china 's booming industry is not bound by kyoto . eu vow to cut emissions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars are also a contributor to rising carbon dioxide emissions germany has already vowed to make cutting emissions a central aim during its six-month eu presidency .
the german environmental ministry also responded to the news of today 's report saying the european union should continue to push for industrialized nations , including the eu , to agree to a 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020 compared to1990 levels . " climate change is a reality that ca n't be challenged , " said german deputy environment minister michael müller .
" it is already manifesting itself in increasingly extreme events such as heat waves and high levels of precipitation and in the accelerated melting of glaciers and ice caps .
the report confirms the necessity of an ambitious climate policy . " chancellor angela merkel has , however , recently come under fire for apparently backtracking on her pledge to tackle global warming and speaking out against blanket emission levels for new cars . dw staff -lrb- jeg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel opposed to eu plans for car emissions scheme german chancellor merkel said she would resist attempts from the eu commission to impose caps on auto emissions which would apply to all new cars in the bloc .

8 , its director seems worried about well-funded competitors on the festival circuit .
experts say that he need n't lose too much sleep over it . it was an entry fit for a movie star : surrounded by a cloud of flashbulbs , berlinale director dieter kosslick appeared before a few hundred journalists on tuesday to present the program for this year 's festival - the 57th of its kind .
he talked about record movie entries -lrb- some 5,000 -rrb- , a booming film market and a new event called " culinary cinema " that features screenings followed by a gourmet meal . known for his abominable english skills , kosslick had the room roaring with laughter when he recounted how he managed to convince clint eastwood to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is kosslick really worried about new festivals ?
" i 'm dieter from ze cherman film festival , " he introduced himself after mistaking eastwood for a friend in la .
apparently it did the trick . but off the stage , in a recent interview , kosslick did n't seem to be in the mood for jokes . " things are getting more and more complicated when it comes to film festivals , " kosslick told german daily die welt .
" there 's a boom in festivals and a boom in film markets , with millions invested in them . " nouveau riche competitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress isabella rossellini came to rome 's festival , but she will also come to berlin he was talking about a new generation of events that have sprung up around the globe in recent years .
in europe , cinema .
festa internazionale di roma just premiered with a rumored budget of 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26 million -rrb- last october .
in asia , festivals in bangkok and pusan -lrb- south korea -rrb- are increasingly getting attention .
and then there 's the three-year-old dubai international film festival -lrb- diff -rrb- , which kosslick also does n't think of too highly . " i know that ... rome and dubai buy stars with big money to put on festivals for an audience , " he told german trade magazine promedia .
" the big competitors that have a lot of money are increasingly turning into marketing events . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dubai will focus on arab film makers not so , said chris paton , a diff spokesman , who rejected the allegation that officials in dubai paid stars to attend . " while their hospitality can be on a very grand scale , they do n't pay straight-out fees , " he said , adding that free first-class flights and deluxe accommodation arrangements were necessary to convince hollywood greats to make the 23-hour journey . " if you want american stars to travel such a distance , of course you have to treat them in the right way , " paton said . the a-list clout he added that diff was more interested in establishing itself as an important regional hub than competing with one of " the three grande dames " : berlin , cannes and venice . others agreed that kosslick should n't worry too much about losing out because of the likes of rome or dubai . " i do n't think there is real competition , " said bruno chatelin , the paris-based co-founder of filmfestivals.com and a former film studio marketing executive .
" producers know the difference between being selected in dubai and being selected in berlin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they still do wonders to a movie 's selling power thorsten schaumann , the head of germany 's leading film distributor bavaria film international , agreed that recognition in berlin was highly valuable for a movie . " the berlinale is certainly the first big a-festival of the year for us to meet all the buyers , " said schaumann , who has two films competing for the festival 's coveted golden bear trophy . " it 's one of the most important , if not the most important festivals for us , " he added .
" that 's a status that can not be taken away . " but that 's not to say that some of the newcomers are n't welcome additions to the year-round festival circus . " rome 's an important platform for us as well , " schaumann said .
" we need a european market at the end of the year . " a healthy dose of arrogance in the end , berlinale director kosslick 's comments might have been nothing more than a clever trick to position his festival . " he 's discrediting the others by relegating them to a different league , " said thorsten hennig-thurau , who is professor for marketing and media research at weimar 's bauhaus university .
" he can do that , but i do n't think that 's what matters in the end .

topping the agenda are the situation in iraq , iran and the israeli-palestinian conflict . over the past six weeks , angela merkel has already met with israeli prime minister olmert , president of the palestinian autonomous authority abbas and jordanian king abdullah ii .
the forthcoming trip to the gulf region - during which she will visit four countries in four days - will be the german chancellor 's first longer trip after 14 months in office . merkel has received assurances from us president george w. bush that the united states will again strengthen their involvement in the peace negotiations between israel and palestine .
on friday , one day before merkel 's trip to the gulf , the middle-east quartet - consisting of the us , russia , the eu and the un - met again for the first time in a year . while former german chancellor gerhard schröder made economic ties the focus of his trips to the middle east , " political topics will clearly stand in the foreground " during merkel 's talks , said government spokesperson thomas steg . political agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanon is still recovering from the war with israel germany 's economics minister , michael gloss , is also traveling to the region together with a delegation of business leaders , but their routes will overlap only occasionally .

" the essential historical conflict , however , remains to be the one between israel and palestine , " said middle east expert christian-peter hanelt .

gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison . nearly 30 years after left-wing radical group , raf -lrb- red army faction -rrb- terrorized west germany , federal prosecutors have filed a request for the release of brigitte mohnhaupt , a leading raf member who was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 for her role in a series of prominent murders .
separately , german president horst köhler is considering a pardon for mohnhaupt 's former colleague , christian klar who is serving a life sentence for at least 11 killings . the moves have sparked a furious debate in germany pitting outraged relatives of the raf 's victims against politicians who say the killers have done their time and no longer pose a threat to society . dw-world.de spoke with gerhart baum , former interior minister of germany and a member of the free-market liberal fdp party .
baum is a prominent advocate of releasing the prisoners . dw-world.de : why are you in favor of releasing mohnhaupt and klar from prison ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhart baum wants former raf prisoners to be released gerhart baum : that 's because i respect the principles of our constitutional state and believe they must be applied to the raf terrorists too .
they should not be given any special status , either in the negative or positive sense .
at the time -lrb- of their arrest -rrb- we refused to treat them as prisoners of the war as they wanted .
the raf terrorists are criminals and murderers and must be treated like any other criminals in a comparable case . we also need to make a distinction between the two .
in mohnhaupt 's case , it 's about releasing her on parole .
with christian klar , it 's about him being pardoned by the german president .
both cases are being reviewed by the authorities who will eventually make a decision . christian klar was given a triple life sentence .
can you explain what " life imprisonment " means in a strictly legal sense in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar is in prison for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder it does not mean literally for life .
there is no life-long imprisonment in practice unless the perpetrators are deemed dangerous and remain dangerous .
according to our laws , a life sentence is reviewed after 15 years for the first time .
and one of the fundamental principles of our legal system - which has been repeatedly reaffirmed by the country 's highest court - is that human dignity , as it is laid down in the constitution , also means that a person who is sentenced to life imprisonment must be given a perspective for freedom . those who oppose releasing mohnhaupt and klar say the two have neither shown any remorse nor contributed towards clearing up a series of unsolved murders . that 's precisely why mohnhaupt and klar have been punished so severely .
their sentences represent the toughest legal verdicts ever passed for raf terrorists .
they did n't show any remorse and they did n't cooperate in solving crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte mohnhaupt has never shown any contrition but we have to be clear on the point that according to german law , remorse is n't demanded .
it 's desirable , but it is n't necessary .
in the case of christian klar , who has appealed to the german president for clemency , it 's a different matter .
there i expect klar to distance himself from his crimes .
he has apparently done that .
but that 's for the german president to decide . you were germany 's interior minister from 1978 to 1982 and thus a key player in the german state 's long battle with the raf .
how do you look back on your role today ? in addition to using important police and legal resources - which we managed to implement successfully to defeat the raf - i especially tried to highlight flawed developments in our society at that time .
the aim was not to play down the raf , but rather to draw attention to the social environment in which those turbulent events took place . and let 's not forget , they are an issue until today .
just recently a double book edition was published with articles from some 60 scientists who analyzed that period because the raf is a radical byproduct of the disintegration of the left-wing protest movement .
at that time , we tried to sway those who harbored sympathy for the raf and win them over to the rule of law .
and we were successful with that . you were also responsible for passing several harsh anti-terror laws at the time .
do you regret any ?
what would you do differently today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in april 1977 federal prosecutor general siegfried buback was shot and killed by the raf the anti-terror measures were a necessary reaction .
we had to strengthen our police services which were n't in good shape then .
we also had to adapt our courts and legal systems to deal with new criminal behavioral patterns by making changes to our penal code as well as legal procedural code . i admit that some of this partly went too far .
to an extent , there was also a political overreaction to the raf threat .
but we did then dilute some of the measures .
when i took office in 1978 , i also abolished some of the measures used by the police to hunt down raf suspects - a procedure which also hugely affected unsuspecting citizens .
so we did draw certain consequences to deal with the threat of that time . at the same time , it has to be said that since the raf , anti-terror legislation has been continually beefed up , particularly after the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
we 're practically living in a state of permanent emergency where the balance between freedom and security has been damaged and ended up putting curbs on freedom . what lessons do you think germany can draw from the raf era in fighting terrorism today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of schleyer , held hostage by the raf for over a month , became an iconic image of 1970s west germany the most important thing is to maintain calm and not give in to hysteria and populist fear .
politicians should not be allowed to hijack security and turn it into an election topic .
instead the government has to tell the population that we must learn to live with risks .
germany must keep its cool , remain sober and pragmatic and only pass security measures that make real sense instead of symbolic gestures which are passed off as enhanced security for the population but which in reality only curb freedom . nearly 30 years after the raf terrorized west germany , the topic remains highly emotional and sparks strong reactions in germany .
why is that ? that whole period - the reform movements , the struggle for democratic reforms in the political parties , the left-wing protest movement , that whole turbulence and feeling of new beginnings of 1968 , the new policy towards the soviet union - is a fascinating one .
even the people suddenly lived differently at the time , they had a different relationship to sexuality , and art was in a heady heyday .
all that does still fascinate or interest today 's young generation .
a year ago an raf exhibition took place in berlin where artists reacted to the raf .
i promoted the exhibition at the time and it saw a record 50,000 visitors , most of them young people . but that is not to be mistaken as a fascination with the raf , which is only limited .
it 's more an interest in the political spirit of a highly exciting time .
i do n't think that the raf has turned into a myth .
we have to remember that they were murderers , though they were politically motivated . but the majority of the german population is against the release of mohnhaupt and klar .
how do you explain that ? if you follow a simple question pattern - are you for or against the release - then i think you could very quickly even have a situation where the population will be in favor of the death penalty .
this is where a democratic constitutional state has to show some nerve , keep its calm and hold fast to the fundamental principles of the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf 's symbol of a star and a rifle in the 1980s when german president richard von weizsäcker pardoned raf terrorists , it was considered an important gesture .
that is not the case today because the raf and its group of sympathizers no longer exist .
what we need is renewed proof that the german constitutional state is capable of showing mercy . do you think germany will finally close the raf chapter once its last remaining former members are released from prison ? no , not in any way .
we still do n't know the murderers of a whole series of victims after 1985 - for example those of alfred herrhausen -lrb- former deutsche bank chief -rrb- or detlev karsten rohwedder -lrb- leader of the post-reunification government-owned treuhand organization which was responsible for privatizing east german companies . -rrb- and not only do we not know the identity of the perpetrators who are still being hunted , but the interest in the period around 1967 and 1968 still remains very high .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 02.02.2007 " we need proof that the german state is capable of mercy " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it time for germans to pack away the memories of the raf ?
gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison . nearly 30 years after left-wing radical group , raf -lrb- red army faction -rrb- terrorized west germany , federal prosecutors have filed a request for the release of brigitte mohnhaupt , a leading raf member who was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 for her role in a series of prominent murders .
separately , german president horst köhler is considering a pardon for mohnhaupt 's former colleague , christian klar who is serving a life sentence for at least 11 killings . the moves have sparked a furious debate in germany pitting outraged relatives of the raf 's victims against politicians who say the killers have done their time and no longer pose a threat to society . dw-world.de spoke with gerhart baum , former interior minister of germany and a member of the free-market liberal fdp party .
baum is a prominent advocate of releasing the prisoners . dw-world.de : why are you in favor of releasing mohnhaupt and klar from prison ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhart baum wants former raf prisoners to be released gerhart baum : that 's because i respect the principles of our constitutional state and believe they must be applied to the raf terrorists too .
they should not be given any special status , either in the negative or positive sense .
at the time -lrb- of their arrest -rrb- we refused to treat them as prisoners of the war as they wanted .
the raf terrorists are criminals and murderers and must be treated like any other criminals in a comparable case . we also need to make a distinction between the two .
in mohnhaupt 's case , it 's about releasing her on parole .
with christian klar , it 's about him being pardoned by the german president .
both cases are being reviewed by the authorities who will eventually make a decision . christian klar was given a triple life sentence .
can you explain what " life imprisonment " means in a strictly legal sense in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar is in prison for nine killings and 11 counts of attempted murder it does not mean literally for life .
there is no life-long imprisonment in practice unless the perpetrators are deemed dangerous and remain dangerous .
according to our laws , a life sentence is reviewed after 15 years for the first time .
and one of the fundamental principles of our legal system - which has been repeatedly reaffirmed by the country 's highest court - is that human dignity , as it is laid down in the constitution , also means that a person who is sentenced to life imprisonment must be given a perspective for freedom . those who oppose releasing mohnhaupt and klar say the two have neither shown any remorse nor contributed towards clearing up a series of unsolved murders . that 's precisely why mohnhaupt and klar have been punished so severely .
their sentences represent the toughest legal verdicts ever passed for raf terrorists .
they did n't show any remorse and they did n't cooperate in solving crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte mohnhaupt has never shown any contrition but we have to be clear on the point that according to german law , remorse is n't demanded .
it 's desirable , but it is n't necessary .
in the case of christian klar , who has appealed to the german president for clemency , it 's a different matter .
there i expect klar to distance himself from his crimes .
he has apparently done that .
but that 's for the german president to decide . you were germany 's interior minister from 1978 to 1982 and thus a key player in the german state 's long battle with the raf .
how do you look back on your role today ? in addition to using important police and legal resources - which we managed to implement successfully to defeat the raf - i especially tried to highlight flawed developments in our society at that time .
the aim was not to play down the raf , but rather to draw attention to the social environment in which those turbulent events took place . and let 's not forget , they are an issue until today .
just recently a double book edition was published with articles from some 60 scientists who analyzed that period because the raf is a radical byproduct of the disintegration of the left-wing protest movement .
at that time , we tried to sway those who harbored sympathy for the raf and win them over to the rule of law .
and we were successful with that . you were also responsible for passing several harsh anti-terror laws at the time .
do you regret any ?
what would you do differently today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in april 1977 federal prosecutor general siegfried buback was shot and killed by the raf the anti-terror measures were a necessary reaction .
we had to strengthen our police services which were n't in good shape then .
we also had to adapt our courts and legal systems to deal with new criminal behavioral patterns by making changes to our penal code as well as legal procedural code . i admit that some of this partly went too far .
to an extent , there was also a political overreaction to the raf threat .
but we did then dilute some of the measures .
when i took office in 1978 , i also abolished some of the measures used by the police to hunt down raf suspects - a procedure which also hugely affected unsuspecting citizens .
so we did draw certain consequences to deal with the threat of that time . at the same time , it has to be said that since the raf , anti-terror legislation has been continually beefed up , particularly after the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
we 're practically living in a state of permanent emergency where the balance between freedom and security has been damaged and ended up putting curbs on freedom . what lessons do you think germany can draw from the raf era in fighting terrorism today ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photo of schleyer , held hostage by the raf for over a month , became an iconic image of 1970s west germany the most important thing is to maintain calm and not give in to hysteria and populist fear .
politicians should not be allowed to hijack security and turn it into an election topic .
instead the government has to tell the population that we must learn to live with risks .
germany must keep its cool , remain sober and pragmatic and only pass security measures that make real sense instead of symbolic gestures which are passed off as enhanced security for the population but which in reality only curb freedom . nearly 30 years after the raf terrorized west germany , the topic remains highly emotional and sparks strong reactions in germany .
why is that ? that whole period - the reform movements , the struggle for democratic reforms in the political parties , the left-wing protest movement , that whole turbulence and feeling of new beginnings of 1968 , the new policy towards the soviet union - is a fascinating one .
even the people suddenly lived differently at the time , they had a different relationship to sexuality , and art was in a heady heyday .
all that does still fascinate or interest today 's young generation .
a year ago an raf exhibition took place in berlin where artists reacted to the raf .
i promoted the exhibition at the time and it saw a record 50,000 visitors , most of them young people . but that is not to be mistaken as a fascination with the raf , which is only limited .
it 's more an interest in the political spirit of a highly exciting time .
i do n't think that the raf has turned into a myth .
we have to remember that they were murderers , though they were politically motivated . but the majority of the german population is against the release of mohnhaupt and klar .
how do you explain that ? if you follow a simple question pattern - are you for or against the release - then i think you could very quickly even have a situation where the population will be in favor of the death penalty .
this is where a democratic constitutional state has to show some nerve , keep its calm and hold fast to the fundamental principles of the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf 's symbol of a star and a rifle in the 1980s when german president richard von weizsäcker pardoned raf terrorists , it was considered an important gesture .
that is not the case today because the raf and its group of sympathizers no longer exist .
what we need is renewed proof that the german constitutional state is capable of showing mercy . do you think germany will finally close the raf chapter once its last remaining former members are released from prison ? no , not in any way .
we still do n't know the murderers of a whole series of victims after 1985 - for example those of alfred herrhausen -lrb- former deutsche bank chief -rrb- or detlev karsten rohwedder -lrb- leader of the post-reunification government-owned treuhand organization which was responsible for privatizing east german companies . -rrb- and not only do we not know the identity of the perpetrators who are still being hunted , but the interest in the period around 1967 and 1968 still remains very high .

"
as a member in swift 's oversight committee the european union 's central bank had to take responsibility in ensuring the transaction network complies with eu privacy laws , he said . " just as other banks , the ecb can not escape some responsibilities in the swift case which has breached the trust and private lives of many millions of people , " said hustinx . " secret , routine and massive access of third country authorities to banking data is unacceptable , " he added in a statement accompanying his final report on the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swift headquarters in belgium swift , the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication , based outside brussels , is used for global bank transactions of more than 11 million euros -lrb- $ 14 million -rrb- daily .

ecb rejects responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb chief trichet says data protection at swift is outside the bank 's remit the european central bank swiftly issued its own press release in which it said that " the monitoring of swift activities that do not affect financial stability is not a matter for central bank oversight . " " the request by the european data protection supervisor to bring data protection compliance within the remit of central bank oversight would not be in line with the allocation of legal responsibilities , " the bank added . the ecb has investigated possible options to using swift services and has had to conclude that at this stage no feasible alternatives , it said . in response to concerns voiced by european lawmakers , ecb chief jean-claude trichet said in a letter on wednesday that the eu and the us need to clarify the line between fighting terrorism and terror protection , reuters reported . " the main issue at stake is to find ways to reconcile eu and non-eu data protection legislation , as well as to maintain a proper balance between such legislation and the legal instruments applied tin the fight against terrorism , " he wrote .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 02.02.2007 opinion : kosovo is a challenge for the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy martti ahtisaari presented his draft proposal for kosovo on friday .
his difficult and uncertain mission is of paramount importance , not only for the balkans , but the eu in general , says dw 's verica spasovska . united nations envoy martti ahtisaari has taken on a difficult mission .
its success - with serbs and albanians heavily entrenched in their positions - is highly uncertain .
ahtisaari 's visit to belgrade was made even more explosive when serbian prime minister vojsilav kostunica refused to meet with him - supposedly because he is in the midst of a complicated process of building a new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verica spasovska at the same time , kostunica is threatening to break off diplomatic relations with those countries that want to recognize kosovo .
in this precarious moment , kostuncia seems to be trying to shun political responsibility . the eu has been implying for months that the kosovo proposal could lead to independence , even if drastically limited , yet kostunica has so far lacked courage to prepare the serbian population for the possible loss of the province . kosovo albanians , on the other hand , are increasing the pressure on the west by postulating unlimited independence as something non-negotiable .
this is only hiking up the expectations of the population .
over the past few years , kosovo albanians have learned that the west is backing away from its political demands and giving in to riots and violence . after the massive riots three years ago , the eu gave up its postulate " standards before status . "
the eu is no longer demanding that the democratic rules of engagement be established and minorities protected before the status is determined .
since violence was rewarded with political concessions , one can possibly expect a new escalation of violence if all the demands of kosovo albanians are not met .
the international peace / keeping troops have been placed on heightened alert . the eu is in a tight spot .
it must find a face-saving solution for both parties that everybody would support .
that is why the word " independence " has not been in circulation for days .
on the other hand , serbia 's sovereignty is also not mentioned any more . the only way out of this dilemma lies in the clear eu accession perspectives for the serbs and the albanians .
both conflicting parties know that their economic and political development is coupled with eu membership and that they have to rely on the eu .
it must be made clear to both the serbs and the albanians that it is paradoxical for them to insist on sovereignty when they will sooner or later give up parts of that sovereignty to the eu .
they have to understand that at the very least that 's why the use of violence is not worth it . for the european union , kosovo is an elementary challenge : the eu has to manage this conflict successfully if it is to show that it is capable of a uniform foreign policy . verica spasovska is head of dw-radio 's program for central and southeastern europe -lrb- tt -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de del ponte warns eu against resuming talks with serbia carla del ponte , the un chief prosecutor for war crimes in the former yugoslavia , on wednesday warned the eu against resuming cooperation talks with serbia , saying key fugitives must first be arrested .

his difficult and uncertain mission is of paramount importance , not only for the balkans , but the eu in general , says dw 's verica spasovska . united nations envoy martti ahtisaari has taken on a difficult mission .
its success - with serbs and albanians heavily entrenched in their positions - is highly uncertain .
ahtisaari 's visit to belgrade was made even more explosive when serbian prime minister vojsilav kostunica refused to meet with him - supposedly because he is in the midst of a complicated process of building a new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verica spasovska at the same time , kostunica is threatening to break off diplomatic relations with those countries that want to recognize kosovo .
in this precarious moment , kostuncia seems to be trying to shun political responsibility . the eu has been implying for months that the kosovo proposal could lead to independence , even if drastically limited , yet kostunica has so far lacked courage to prepare the serbian population for the possible loss of the province . kosovo albanians , on the other hand , are increasing the pressure on the west by postulating unlimited independence as something non-negotiable .
this is only hiking up the expectations of the population .
over the past few years , kosovo albanians have learned that the west is backing away from its political demands and giving in to riots and violence . after the massive riots three years ago , the eu gave up its postulate " standards before status . "
the eu is no longer demanding that the democratic rules of engagement be established and minorities protected before the status is determined .
since violence was rewarded with political concessions , one can possibly expect a new escalation of violence if all the demands of kosovo albanians are not met .
the international peace / keeping troops have been placed on heightened alert . the eu is in a tight spot .
it must find a face-saving solution for both parties that everybody would support .
that is why the word " independence " has not been in circulation for days .
on the other hand , serbia 's sovereignty is also not mentioned any more . the only way out of this dilemma lies in the clear eu accession perspectives for the serbs and the albanians .
both conflicting parties know that their economic and political development is coupled with eu membership and that they have to rely on the eu .
it must be made clear to both the serbs and the albanians that it is paradoxical for them to insist on sovereignty when they will sooner or later give up parts of that sovereignty to the eu .
they have to understand that at the very least that 's why the use of violence is not worth it . for the european union , kosovo is an elementary challenge : the eu has to manage this conflict successfully if it is to show that it is capable of a uniform foreign policy . verica spasovska is head of dw-radio 's program for central and southeastern europe -lrb- tt -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de del ponte warns eu against resuming talks with serbia carla del ponte , the un chief prosecutor for war crimes in the former yugoslavia , on wednesday warned the eu against resuming cooperation talks with serbia , saying key fugitives must first be arrested .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice paved the way for merkel to go without a headscarf " the times have changed , foreign guests are not obliged to wear the headscarf any more , " a saudi journalist explained .

8 , its director seems worried about well-funded competitors on the festival circuit .
experts say that he need n't lose too much sleep over it . it was an entry fit for a movie star : surrounded by a cloud of flashbulbs , berlinale director dieter kosslick appeared before a few hundred journalists on tuesday to present the program for this year 's festival - the 57th of its kind .
he talked about record movie entries -lrb- some 5,000 -rrb- , a booming film market and a new event called " culinary cinema " that features screenings followed by a gourmet meal . known for his abominable english skills , kosslick had the room roaring with laughter when he recounted how he managed to convince clint eastwood to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is kosslick really worried about new festivals ?
" i 'm dieter from ze cherman film festival , " he introduced himself after mistaking eastwood for a friend in la .
apparently it did the trick . but off the stage , in a recent interview , kosslick did n't seem to be in the mood for jokes . " things are getting more and more complicated when it comes to film festivals , " kosslick told german daily die welt .
" there 's a boom in festivals and a boom in film markets , with millions invested in them . " nouveau riche competitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress isabella rossellini came to rome 's festival , but she will also come to berlin he was talking about a new generation of events that have sprung up around the globe in recent years .
in europe , cinema .
festa internazionale di roma just premiered with a rumored budget of 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26 million -rrb- last october .
in asia , festivals in bangkok and pusan -lrb- south korea -rrb- are increasingly getting attention .
and then there 's the three-year-old dubai international film festival -lrb- diff -rrb- , which kosslick also does n't think of too highly . " i know that ... rome and dubai buy stars with big money to put on festivals for an audience , " he told german trade magazine promedia .
" the big competitors that have a lot of money are increasingly turning into marketing events . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dubai will focus on arab film makers not so , said chris paton , a diff spokesman , who rejected the allegation that officials in dubai paid stars to attend . " while their hospitality can be on a very grand scale , they do n't pay straight-out fees , " he said , adding that free first-class flights and deluxe accommodation arrangements were necessary to convince hollywood greats to make the 23-hour journey . " if you want american stars to travel such a distance , of course you have to treat them in the right way , " paton said . the a-list clout he added that diff was more interested in establishing itself as an important regional hub than competing with one of " the three grande dames " : berlin , cannes and venice . others agreed that kosslick should n't worry too much about losing out because of the likes of rome or dubai . " i do n't think there is real competition , " said bruno chatelin , the paris-based co-founder of filmfestivals.com and a former film studio marketing executive .
" producers know the difference between being selected in dubai and being selected in berlin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they still do wonders to a movie 's selling power thorsten schaumann , the head of germany 's leading film distributor bavaria film international , agreed that recognition in berlin was highly valuable for a movie . " the berlinale is certainly the first big a-festival of the year for us to meet all the buyers , " said schaumann , who has two films competing for the festival 's coveted golden bear trophy . " it 's one of the most important , if not the most important festivals for us , " he added .
" that 's a status that can not be taken away . " but that 's not to say that some of the newcomers are n't welcome additions to the year-round festival circus . " rome 's an important platform for us as well , " schaumann said .
" we need a european market at the end of the year . " a healthy dose of arrogance in the end , berlinale director kosslick 's comments might have been nothing more than a clever trick to position his festival . " he 's discrediting the others by relegating them to a different league , " said thorsten hennig-thurau , who is professor for marketing and media research at weimar 's bauhaus university .

figures from the association of payment clearing systems -lrb- apacs -rrb- show that credit card spending dropped from £ 122bn in 2005 to £ 120bn in 2006 .
the 2 % fall was due to the increasing popularity of debit cards , on which spending rose by 15 % to £ 195.7bn.
consumers also became more cautious about borrowing on plastic because of the build-up of personal debt .
by the end of last year , says the bank of england , this had reached a total of £ 1.29 trillion .
of this , £ 1.08 trillion was in the form of mortgages and £ 213bn was in the form of consumer credit , such as credit cards , bank loans and hire purchase agreements .
but outstanding debt on credit cards alone fell back during the year , dropping from a peak of £ 58.3bn in january 2006 to £ 54.9bn in december .
" people are increasingly paying off their credit card spending , showing they are becoming a bit more prudent , " said an apacs spokeswoman .
changing spending behaviour although credit card spending hit a plateau in 2005 before dropping last year , it was in fact overtaken in 2001 by spending on debit cards .
these draw money directly from users ' bank accounts rather than letting a person borrow and build up a debt .
by the end of last year , debit cards accounted for nearly two-thirds of all spending on plastic .
they also overtook cash in 2005 .
that year , £ 89bn was spent on debit cards in shops , stores , supermarkets and online , compared with just £ 81bn changing hands as notes and coins .
even so , credit cards are still popular and not only for big-ticket items .

figures from the association of payment clearing systems -lrb- apacs -rrb- show that credit card spending dropped from £ 122bn in 2005 to £ 120bn in 2006 .
the 2 % fall was due to the increasing popularity of debit cards , on which spending rose by 15 % to £ 195.7bn.
consumers also became more cautious about borrowing on plastic because of the build-up of personal debt .
by the end of last year , says the bank of england , this had reached a total of £ 1.29 trillion .
of this , £ 1.08 trillion was in the form of mortgages and £ 213bn was in the form of consumer credit , such as credit cards , bank loans and hire purchase agreements .
but outstanding debt on credit cards alone fell back during the year , dropping from a peak of £ 58.3bn in january 2006 to £ 54.9bn in december .
" people are increasingly paying off their credit card spending , showing they are becoming a bit more prudent , " said an apacs spokeswoman .
changing spending behaviour although credit card spending hit a plateau in 2005 before dropping last year , it was in fact overtaken in 2001 by spending on debit cards .
these draw money directly from users ' bank accounts rather than letting a person borrow and build up a debt .
by the end of last year , debit cards accounted for nearly two-thirds of all spending on plastic .
they also overtook cash in 2005 .
that year , £ 89bn was spent on debit cards in shops , stores , supermarkets and online , compared with just £ 81bn changing hands as notes and coins .

ba said pre-tax profits for the three months to the end of december fell to £ 113m -lrb- $ 222m -rrb- , from £ 166m last year .
the news comes just days after ba reached a last-minute deal with unions to avert a strike by cabin crew .
the planned action would have grounded ba flights from heathrow and gatwick airports and caused major disruption for thousands of ba passengers .
ba said it expected to lose about £ 80m in revenues as a result of the dispute .
' patience and loyalty ' i want to apologise for the inconvenience they have suffered during this period willie walsh , ba chief executive ba said severe fog before christmas and the failure of the baggage system on two occasions in december at heathrow 's terminal 4 had cost the firm about £ 40m during the final three months of 2006 .
chief executive willie walsh said the " patience and loyalty " of ba 's passengers had been tested by the setbacks over christmas .
" i want to apologise for the inconvenience they have suffered during this period , " mr walsh said .
a planned two-day strike by ba cabin crew was called off on monday , following marathon talks between the airline 's bosses and the transport and general workers union -lrb- t & g -rrb- .
the two sides had been at loggerheads over a number of issues , including pay , pensions and the management of sickness absence .
ba had cancelled 1,300 flights on tuesday and wednesday - when the strike was due to take place - but the airline managed to resume services after the deal with the t & g was reached .
however , the agreement came too late to prevent disruption to thousands of ba passengers , many of whom made alternative plans as the planned strike date drew near .
ba said it was cutting its full-year revenue guidance to 3.25 % -3.75 % growth , compared with a 4.5 % -5 % forecast in november .
the company added that it expected its fuel bill for the year to rise to £ 1.95bn.

'
ipcc report : at a glance global climate change is " very likely " to have a human cause , an influential group of scientists has concluded .
the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- said temperatures were probably going to increase by 1.8-4c -lrb- 3.2-7.2f -rrb- by the end of the century .
it also projected that sea levels were most likely to rise by 28-43cm , and global warming was likely to influence the intensity of tropical storms .
the findings are the first of four ipcc reports to be published this year .
" we can be very confident that the net effect of human activity since 1750 has been one of warming , " co-lead author dr susan soloman told delegates in paris .
strong language the report , produced by a team tasked with assessing the science of climate change , was intended to be the definitive summary of climatic shifts facing the world in the coming years .
ipcc projections probable temperature rise between 1.8c and 4c possible temperature rise between 1.1c and 6.4c sea level most likely to rise by 28-43cm arctic summer sea ice disappears in second half of century increase in heatwaves very likely increase in tropical storm intensity likely ipcc report : world reaction ipcc report : uk reaction the agency said that it would use stronger language to assess humanity 's influence on climatic change than it had previously done .
in 2001 , it said that it was " likely " that human activities lay behind the trends observed at various parts of the planet ; " likely " in ipcc terminology means between 66 % and 90 % probability .
now , the panel concluded that it was at least 90 % certain that human emissions of greenhouse gases rather than natural variations are warming the planet 's surface .
they projected that temperatures would probably rise by between 1.8c and 4c , though increases as small as 1.1c -lrb- 2f -rrb- or as large as 6.4c -lrb- 11.5f -rrb- were possible .
in 2001 , using different methodology , the numbers were 1.4 -lrb- 2.5f -rrb- and 5.8c -lrb- 10.4f -rrb- .
how computers model climate on sea level , there has been a more fundamental debate .
computer models of climate generally include water coming into the oceans as ice caps and glaciers melt .
but the potentially much larger contribution of " accelerated melting " , where the disintegration of ice shelves and lubrication of glaciers by meltwater speeds up the flow of ice into the oceans , is much harder to model .
so the ipcc had to decide whether to exclude this from its calculations , or to estimate the effect of a process which scientists do not understand well but which could have a big impact .
they used the former , more conservative approach , projecting an average rise in sea levels globally of between 28 and 43cm .
the 2001 report cited a range of nine to 88cm .
as for climate change influencing the intensity of tropical storms in some areas of the world , the ipcc concluded that it was likely - meaning a greater probability than 66 % - that rising temperatures were a factor .
' unequivocal ' climate change : in graphics dr rajendra pachauri , the ipcc chairman , said : " it is extremely encouraging in that the science has moved on from what was possible in the third assessment report .

'
ipcc report : at a glance global climate change is " very likely " to have a human cause , an influential group of scientists has concluded .
the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- said temperatures were probably going to increase by 1.8-4c -lrb- 3.2-7.2f -rrb- by the end of the century .
it also projected that sea levels were most likely to rise by 28-43cm , and global warming was likely to influence the intensity of tropical storms .
the findings are the first of four ipcc reports to be published this year .
" we can be very confident that the net effect of human activity since 1750 has been one of warming , " co-lead author dr susan soloman told delegates in paris .
strong language the report , produced by a team tasked with assessing the science of climate change , was intended to be the definitive summary of climatic shifts facing the world in the coming years .
ipcc projections probable temperature rise between 1.8c and 4c possible temperature rise between 1.1c and 6.4c sea level most likely to rise by 28-43cm arctic summer sea ice disappears in second half of century increase in heatwaves very likely increase in tropical storm intensity likely ipcc report : world reaction ipcc report : uk reaction the agency said that it would use stronger language to assess humanity 's influence on climatic change than it had previously done .
in 2001 , it said that it was " likely " that human activities lay behind the trends observed at various parts of the planet ; " likely " in ipcc terminology means between 66 % and 90 % probability .
now , the panel concluded that it was at least 90 % certain that human emissions of greenhouse gases rather than natural variations are warming the planet 's surface .
they projected that temperatures would probably rise by between 1.8c and 4c , though increases as small as 1.1c -lrb- 2f -rrb- or as large as 6.4c -lrb- 11.5f -rrb- were possible .
in 2001 , using different methodology , the numbers were 1.4 -lrb- 2.5f -rrb- and 5.8c -lrb- 10.4f -rrb- .
how computers model climate on sea level , there has been a more fundamental debate .
computer models of climate generally include water coming into the oceans as ice caps and glaciers melt .
but the potentially much larger contribution of " accelerated melting " , where the disintegration of ice shelves and lubrication of glaciers by meltwater speeds up the flow of ice into the oceans , is much harder to model .
so the ipcc had to decide whether to exclude this from its calculations , or to estimate the effect of a process which scientists do not understand well but which could have a big impact .
they used the former , more conservative approach , projecting an average rise in sea levels globally of between 28 and 43cm .
the 2001 report cited a range of nine to 88cm .
as for climate change influencing the intensity of tropical storms in some areas of the world , the ipcc concluded that it was likely - meaning a greater probability than 66 % - that rising temperatures were a factor .
' unequivocal ' climate change : in graphics dr rajendra pachauri , the ipcc chairman , said : " it is extremely encouraging in that the science has moved on from what was possible in the third assessment report .
" if you see the extent to which human activities are influencing the climate system , the options for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions appear in a different light , because you can see what the costs of inaction are , " he told delegates in paris .

'
ipcc report : at a glance global climate change is " very likely " to have a human cause , an influential group of scientists has concluded .
the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- said temperatures were probably going to increase by 1.8-4c -lrb- 3.2-7.2f -rrb- by the end of the century .
it also projected that sea levels were most likely to rise by 28-43cm , and global warming was likely to influence the intensity of tropical storms .
the findings are the first of four ipcc reports to be published this year .
" we can be very confident that the net effect of human activity since 1750 has been one of warming , " co-lead author dr susan soloman told delegates in paris .
strong language the report , produced by a team tasked with assessing the science of climate change , was intended to be the definitive summary of climatic shifts facing the world in the coming years .
ipcc projections probable temperature rise between 1.8c and 4c possible temperature rise between 1.1c and 6.4c sea level most likely to rise by 28-43cm arctic summer sea ice disappears in second half of century increase in heatwaves very likely increase in tropical storm intensity likely ipcc report : world reaction ipcc report : uk reaction the agency said that it would use stronger language to assess humanity 's influence on climatic change than it had previously done .
in 2001 , it said that it was " likely " that human activities lay behind the trends observed at various parts of the planet ; " likely " in ipcc terminology means between 66 % and 90 % probability .
now , the panel concluded that it was at least 90 % certain that human emissions of greenhouse gases rather than natural variations are warming the planet 's surface .
they projected that temperatures would probably rise by between 1.8c and 4c , though increases as small as 1.1c -lrb- 2f -rrb- or as large as 6.4c -lrb- 11.5f -rrb- were possible .
in 2001 , using different methodology , the numbers were 1.4 -lrb- 2.5f -rrb- and 5.8c -lrb- 10.4f -rrb- .
how computers model climate on sea level , there has been a more fundamental debate .
computer models of climate generally include water coming into the oceans as ice caps and glaciers melt .
but the potentially much larger contribution of " accelerated melting " , where the disintegration of ice shelves and lubrication of glaciers by meltwater speeds up the flow of ice into the oceans , is much harder to model .
so the ipcc had to decide whether to exclude this from its calculations , or to estimate the effect of a process which scientists do not understand well but which could have a big impact .
they used the former , more conservative approach , projecting an average rise in sea levels globally of between 28 and 43cm .
the 2001 report cited a range of nine to 88cm .
as for climate change influencing the intensity of tropical storms in some areas of the world , the ipcc concluded that it was likely - meaning a greater probability than 66 % - that rising temperatures were a factor .
' unequivocal ' dr rajendra pachauri , the ipcc chairman , said : " it is extremely encouraging in that the science has moved on from what was possible in the third assessment report .

the qca canvassed teachers and local authority advisers on what they thought about particular plays and their suitability for teaching to children in key stage 3 .
children in state schools generally do not study shakespeare until they are 13 or 14 , in year 9 .
in the survey , people were asked to rate seven shakespeare plays on their suitability for this age group .
top of the list came romeo and juliet , with 91 % saying the play was suitable or very suitable .
many said the themes of young love and family made the play very accessible for pupils .
sexual jealousy the idea of including othello prompted the most objections - with 55 % saying it was not suitable .
many teachers said the play should be kept for a-level study and that the themes were " too mature and sensitive for this age group " .
the report said : " many stated that the topic of racism was not appropriate for key stage 3 study and the theme of sexual jealousy was widely felt to be beyond the experience of year 9 children . "
those who supported the inclusion of othello said the play 's strong themes of love , jealousy , cultural stereo-typing and the treatment of minorities in society would engage pupils .
there was little support for the idea of 13 and 14-year-olds studying henry iv part i. some 66 % said it was not suitable and just 6 % that it was " very suitable " .
critics said the historical context and a lack of action made the play boring and inaccessible for many pupils .

ian mcneilly , director of the national association for the teaching of english , said he could understand the teachers ' favourite choices .
romeo and juliet , macbeth and julius caesar were all great plays , he said .
and while the race theme in othello might be appropriate for the age group , the theme of sexual jealousy might not be .
but the real question was not so much the choice of plays on offer but the way some teachers were driven to teach them .
they were being forced to " teach to the test " , with children often studying just a few scenes instead of getting to enjoy and appreciate a whole play .

sunai manomai-udom , head of special investigations , said a man seen on security cameras near one bomb site was also wanted for attacks in the south .
he named him as thawansek paenae , a suspect in several bank bombings .
previously , authorities have blamed the new year 's eve attacks on elements loyal to ousted pm thaksin shinawatra .
mr thaksin , who has not returned to thailand since he was replaced in a september coup , has denied any involvement .
mr sunai said the suspect was one of three people - all from the south - picked up on security cameras .
but he said it was too early to conclusively link them to the bombings , and that investigators needed another week to decide .
that view was echoed by prime minister gen surayud chulanont , who was visiting southern provinces affected by the violence .
" do n't make a too quick judgement before the investigation concludes on whether the southern unrest has intensified and moved to bangkok .

that view was echoed by prime minister gen surayud chulanont , who was visiting southern provinces affected by the violence .

the us embassy in seoul has now asked south korea to resume beef imports ahead of talks on the issue .
the embassy used a korean language internet forum to state that us safety standards would be applied to all beef shipments .
