it 's not surprising considering the reactor was shut down following a technical irregularity earlier this month .
the problem at brunsbüttel , one of 17 nuclear reactors in germany , is by no means the only mishap in recent months that has increasingly called the safety of atomic power into question .
earlier this month , an earthquake caused leaks at a reactor in northwestern japan and led to low-level radiation , reviving fears about nuclear safety , and the closure of the brunsbüttel plant in germany followed a fire at another reactor close to hamburg .
around the world , there are 438 nuclear plants currently in operation .
the majority are in industrialized nations - 104 in the us , 59 in france and 31 in russia .
how dangerous were the incidents ?
despite the recent slew of incidents at nuclear power stations , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said the errors in germany , sweden and japan were exceptions and certainly did not pose a danger .
that 's a view echoed by klaus kotthoff of the grs group , an independent nuclear assessment and research organization .
while there is no technology that 's free of errors , kotthoff pointed out that nuclear power plants are subject to a range of registration procedures and measures aimed at managing irregularities - as was the case at two nuclear plants in germany earlier this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire broke out last month at the krümmel nuclear plant near hamburg in germany " i believe these incidents were not noteworthy from a technical security point of view , " kotthoff said .
critics of nuclear energy , however , do n't buy the argument .
henrik paulitz of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- said the recent german incidents were dangerous .
" the reactor protection system was activated .
that only happens in serious cases , " paulitz said , adding that they were n't isolated cases .
there are several nuclear incidents in germany about which the public is not sufficiently informed , he said .
the information that is released is mostly " incomprehensible " and the controversial backgrounds are often concealed .
" serious security deficits are usually glossed over , " paulitz said .
experts split over nuclear safety experts remain divided about the safety of nuclear reactors .
while kotthoff said german plants are generally considered the safest , a 1997 study by the organization for economic cooperation and development ranked the german nuclear power station biblis b second to last in an international nuclear power plant comparison . only the maine yankee plant in the us fared worse , and it 's since been shut down .
but paulitz said other nuclear power stations too are n't much better .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is again debating whether to stick to a nuclear energy phase out " an unfortunate mixture of technical problems and human error can at any time cause a major nuclear meltdown anywhere , " he said .
the recent string of incidents comes at a time when nuclear energy seems to be undergoing somewhat of a revival .
considered one of the most cost-effective forms of generating electricity as prices of oil and gas rise , nuclear energy is largely favored by rapidly expanding economies in eastern europe and asia to meet their spiraling energy needs .
" the debates about climate change and reducing emissions also play a role here , " said alan mcdonald of the iaea .
" and naturally , it 's about securing production . "
nuclear energy plagued by problems nuclear energy production , however , remains problematic as most countries using nuclear energy need to import uranium .
according to the iaea , there are only 4.7 tons of economically viable uranium reserves worldwide .
given current levels of usage , experts believe stocks will only last for another 60 years .
that would mean that uranium would be depleted faster than oil and gas reserves .
experts also pointed to the unsolved problem of disposing nuclear waste , which remains radioactive for decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts estimate that uranium stocks will only last another 60 years paulitz said the environmental advantages of using nuclear energy are also limited since it only provides an estimated 1.2 percent of the world 's energy needs .
for nuclear energy to make a real difference in cutting greenhouse gas emissions , thousands of new reactors would have to be built , he said .
that is hardly possible given the nuclear industry 's low production capacity .
" it 's only about sustaining energy production on this low level and maintaining the technology - also because of interest in nuclear weapons , " paulitz said , adding that the world could easily do without this marginal energy source .
security poses biggest hurdle iaea 's mcdonald said that security issues increasingly pose the biggest hurdle when it comes to using nuclear energy .
the vienna-based nuclear watchdog has set up an entire department to explore ways of preventing the misuse of nuclear materials and terrorist attacks on reactors .
" terrorists who plant to blow up a nuclear reactor can do so with relatively easy means , " paulitz said .
" protecting against such attacks is just not possible . " ina rottscheidt -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rainer brüderle , deputy chairman of the fdp told mass market bild daily that china was " a successful hi-tech nation and not a developing country . "
the view was echoed by wolfgang bosbach of the cdu .
" the german government needs to examine whether it should continue paying development aid to china , " he said .
according to the news report , china will receive 67.5 million euros -lrb- $ 92.1 million -rrb- this year from the german ministry of economic cooperation and development .
german government rejects demands the german government , however , has rejected the demands from the two politicians , saying the money that flowed to china this year was transferred within the framework of long-term and successful economic cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government says china can now tackle poverty within its borders itself " china does n't receive any development aid from germany , " thomas steg , a press spokesman for the government said in berlin .
" this cooperation is explicitly in german interests . "
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul also stressed that development aid to china had been adapted to the country 's changing economic dynamics over the years .
" the funds by the german government are largely provided as loans with market conditions and are paid back by china , " the minister said .
china can now afford to fight poverty within its own borders on its own , wieczorek-zeul said .
she added that the bulk of current development money focused on boosting environmental protection as well as supporting legal and political reforms .
steg added that the former included promoting renewable energy and helping improve energy efficiency .
he pointed out that it " always results in renewed contracts for german companies . "
china is considered the world 's second biggest emitter of carbon dioxide , after the united states , and the biggest producer of sulfur dioxide .
chinese economy hurtles ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese exports are expected to soar by 20 percent this year the debate over putting the brakes on development aid to china follows the recent publication of statistics that show the asian country 's economy is galloping ahead at a rapid pace . it grew by 11.9 percent in the first quarter of this year , according to china 's national statistics bureau .
some experts say that if present economic growth rates are sustained , china could in five years replace germany as the world 's third largest economy after the us and japan , and other experts have said germany has already been knocked into fourth place .
china 's exports are expected to grow at an annual rate of 20 percent in 2007 and 2008 compared with 9 percent for german exports over the same period .
in 2005 , china surpassed britain to become the world 's fourth largest economy .

intel denied the charges friday . the european commission said sent a " statement of objections " to intel on thursday alleging that it tried to exclude competitor advanced micro devices inc .
-lrb- amd -rrb- from the market .
intel could face fines if it is found guilty of infringing on eu antitrust rules .
intel has abused its dominant market position , the european union statement said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most computers have intel inside the eu said intel gave computer makers " substantial rebates " for buying their x86 cpus from intel .
they were allegedly offered below cost to strategic customers , such as governments and universities , according to the eu statement .
intel also allegedly paid manufacturers to delay or cancel product lines which used amd chips .
" the rebates offered by intel were of such a quantity and such an amount that an efficient competitor would be forced to price below cost , " european commission spokesman ton van lierop told reuters .
" we think that would be bad for competition and bad for consumers . "
the eu said below-cost or predatory pricing may be good for consumers in the short term , but is ultimately harmful because it kills off competition , which offers more choice and innovation in the long term .
intel dominates world chip market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chip making or deal making ?
intel replied that its conduct has been lawful , good for competition and beneficial to customers .
" we are confident that the microprocessor market segment is functioning normally and that intel 's conduct has been lawful , pro-competitive , and beneficial to consumers , " intel 's general counsel bruce sewell said .
intel controls 80 percent of the global market for the central processing units , or cpus .
the rest are made by amd .
focusing on price amd spokesman jens drews said pc manufacturers operate on thin margins and intel 's loyalty rebates have forced amd to focus on price rather than performance .
" their financial strength is poisoning the industry , " drews was quoted as saying by the associated press .
" what we see is that we have not been competing on a level playing field . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amd says chip quality has suffered from price wars intel has 10 weeks to reply to the statement and will then have the right to a hearing with eu regulators .
intel will face a fine if the commission finds it has engaged in anti-competitive conduct .
but most cases take several years before they are settled .
intel 's sewell said he 's awaiting a ruling on the microsoft case .

criminal charges could be next . two judges questioned villepin on friday morning about an attempt in 2003-2004 to discredit france 's current president , nicolas sarkozy , who was at the time a government minister and a political rival in the conservative ump party , in which both men as well as former french president jacques chirac were members .
the judges suspect villepin of involvement in the so-called clearstream affair , in which sarkozy 's name was wrongly linked to an illegal bank account in luxembourg .
the preliminary charges against him were for complicity to make false accusations , receiving stolen goods , breach of trust and complicity to use false documents .
villepin has denied breaking the law .
" i am anxious to restate this morning that at no point did i ask for an investigation into political figures , and at no moment did i partake in any political machination , " villepin said after being questioned on friday .
the affair started in 2003 when a list of clearstream bank-account holders surfaced who had allegedly received secret commissions from international arms sales .
the list , which included the names of sarkozy and other prominent politicians , was subsequently proven to be false .
chirac the mastermind ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac continues to claim presidential immunity experts retrieved documents from former intelligence chief philippe rondot 's computer two weeks ago that suggested villepin had instructed an associate , jean-louis gergorin , to leak the list to a judge to damage sarkozy 's reputation .
rondot had conducted a secret probe into the affair in 2004 .
the information on his laptop also indicated that then president chirac had initiated the smear campaign .
chirac has said he will not answer questions regarding the affair , claiming he remains protected by presidential immunity , a position legal experts are divided over .
earlier this month , gergorin , formerly the vice president of european aerospace company eads , admitted he wrote anonymous letters to justice officials smearing sarkozy .
last year , sarkozy declared himself a civil plaintiff in the suit and said he was determined to find out who tried to undermine him . article based on news reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the view was echoed by wolfgang bosbach of the cdu .

it foresees the building of a nuclear reactor in libya to supply drinking water from sea water .
german deputy foreign minister gernot erler condemned the deal , warning it was not just a bilateral matter and could damage german interests .
german interests at risk ?
" politically , this business is problematic , " erler told handelsblatt business daily .
" german interests are directly affected . "
erler was referring to german conglomerate siemens which has a 34-percent stake in framatome , a nuclear power joint venture it has with france 's areva , the world 's biggest maker of nuclear reactors .
areva is reported to supply the plant in libya .
the deal is also expected to offer areva access to libya 's vast energy resources .
libya is believed to have uranium stocks of 1,600 tons as well as unexploited reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder was the first german leader to visit libya in 2004 erler said germany had tried in the past to offer libya help with developing renewable energy , but said tripoli had failed to react .
he added that european security interests could be affected by the export of nuclear technology and that paris and berlin needed to discuss the issue .
" above all the risk of proliferation increases with every country using nuclear energy , " erler said .
in 2003 , libya agreed to halt a weapons program banned by the united nations , ending decades of international isolation .
in the following year , libya handed over its stocks of enriched uranium to the vienna-based nuclear watchdog , iaea .
" rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " sarkozy 's deal with gadhafi , which came just a day after tripoli handed over six foreign medics to bulgaria , has sparked criticism in europe and in france too .
daniel cohn-bendit , a german politician of the green party and a member of the european parliament described the deal as " ransom " paid by sarkozy to a " bloody dictator " for the release of the foreign medics .
in an interview with german station rtl , cohn-bendit said it was " absolutely mad " that sarkozy was " rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " with the nuclear treaty .
france 's opposition socialist party asked : " is it not a bit soon to be throwing ourselves into gadhafi 's arms and giving him our international endorsement ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya had imprisoned six foreign medics for eight years before releasing them last week the green party accused sarkozy of " boundless cynicism " rooted in the risk of striking a nuclear deal with an " undemocratic state . "
greenpeace france said the deal " poses an enormous problem in terms of nuclear proliferation " and branded it as " in keeping with the french policy of irresponsible export of nuclear technology . "
greenpeace pointed out that previous french presidents had signed nuclear deals with the former shah of iran , ex-iraqi dictator saddam hussein and with south africa during the apartheid era .
sarkozy insists deal will not lead to proliferation sarkozy however has defended france 's nuclear cooperation with libya , saying that a country which respects international laws can create a civilian nuclear industry .
" if you dare to say that civilian nuclear energy should be closed to the northern shore of the mediterranean and that the arab world is not responsible enough for civilian nuclear energy then you 're humiliating them and preparing for a clash of civilizations , " sarkozy told french paper le monde .
an official with france 's atomic energy commission -lrb- cea -rrb- insisted that international safeguards imposed after libya scrapped its military nuclear program would prevent any proliferation .
simon nisan told news agency afp international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- controls made it " almost impossible " to divert the technology to military use .
" the controls are so tight that you do n't have the right to remove the fuel without the presence of iaea inspectors , " he said . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the consumer climate showed stability at a strong level in july , " the gfk said , " with income expectations and buying propensity almost matching the record figures of the previous month . "
indictors show that germans expect incomes to continue rising and are therefore prepared to buy more goods , it said .
" with consumers in the mood to spend even more , retailers can hope to achieve higher sales in the second half of 2007 , " the gfk added .
caution creeps in but economic expectations were slightly more cautious , following the euphoria that led to an all-time high for the economic outlook indicator in may .
this was because rising interest rates , high energy prices and a strong euro triggered fears that the current dynamic growth in the german economy might start slowing down , the gfk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retailers can expect good sales for the rest of the year " german consumers do not believe that the current high growth rate of the economy can be maintained at quite the same level and expect the upturn to slow down over the coming months , " it said .
" if the euro continues to be valued at the present high level or even higher , this may impact negatively on export prospects in the medium term , which have been the key driver of the strong economy to date . "
losing momentum ?
however , the favorable trend on the labor market and expected future income growth largely compensated for these risks , the survey showed .
the survey was published a day after another key indicator , the ifo business climate index , showed business sentiment in germany dipped slightly in july .
higher oil prices , rising interest rates and a strong euro have fuelled fears that the german economy might lose momentum after posting a 2.8 percent growth rate in 2006 .
many economists project growth in 2007 would match or possibly surpass last year 's level but feel it might slip back towards 2 percent in 2008 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the consumer climate showed stability at a strong level in july , " the gfk said , " with income expectations and buying propensity almost matching the record figures of the previous month . "
indictors show that germans expect incomes to continue rising and are therefore prepared to buy more goods , it said .
" with consumers in the mood to spend even more , retailers can hope to achieve higher sales in the second half of 2007 , " the gfk added .
caution creeps in but economic expectations were slightly more cautious , following the euphoria that led to an all-time high for the economic outlook indicator in may .
this was because rising interest rates , high energy prices and a strong euro triggered fears that the current dynamic growth in the german economy might start slowing down , the gfk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retailers can expect good sales for the rest of the year " german consumers do not believe that the current high growth rate of the economy can be maintained at quite the same level and expect the upturn to slow down over the coming months , " it said .
" if the euro continues to be valued at the present high level or even higher , this may impact negatively on export prospects in the medium term , which have been the key driver of the strong economy to date . "
losing momentum ?
however , the favorable trend on the labor market and expected future income growth largely compensated for these risks , the survey showed .
the survey was published a day after another key indicator , the ifo business climate index , showed business sentiment in germany dipped slightly in july .
higher oil prices , rising interest rates and a strong euro have fuelled fears that the german economy might lose momentum after posting a 2.8 percent growth rate in 2006 .
many economists project growth in 2007 would match or possibly surpass last year 's level but feel it might slip back towards 2 percent in 2008 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rainer brüderle , deputy chairman of the fdp told mass market bild daily that china was " a successful hi-tech nation and not a developing country . "
the view was echoed by wolfgang bosbach of the cdu .
" the german government needs to examine whether it should continue paying development aid to china , " he said .
according to the news report , china will receive 67.5 million euros -lrb- $ 92.1 million -rrb- this year from the german ministry of economic cooperation and development .
german government rejects demands the german government , however , has rejected the demands from the two politicians , saying the money that flowed to china this year was transferred within the framework of long-term and successful economic cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government says china can now tackle poverty within its borders itself " china does n't receive any development aid from germany , " thomas steg , a press spokesman for the government said in berlin .
" this cooperation is explicitly in german interests . "
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul also stressed that development aid to china had been adapted to the country 's changing economic dynamics over the years .
" the funds by the german government are largely provided as loans with market conditions and are paid back by china , " the minister said .
china can now afford to fight poverty within its own borders on its own , wieczorek-zeul said .
she added that the bulk of current development money focused on boosting environmental protection as well as supporting legal and political reforms .
steg added that the former included promoting renewable energy and helping improve energy efficiency .
he pointed out that it " always results in renewed contracts for german companies . "
china is considered the world 's second biggest emitter of carbon dioxide , after the united states , and the biggest producer of sulfur dioxide .
chinese economy hurtles ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese exports are expected to soar by 20 percent this year the debate over putting the brakes on development aid to china follows the recent publication of statistics that show the asian country 's economy is galloping ahead at a rapid pace . it grew by 11.9 percent in the first quarter of this year , according to china 's national statistics bureau .
some experts say that if present economic growth rates are sustained , china could in five years replace germany as the world 's third largest economy after the us and japan , and other experts have said germany has already been knocked into fourth place .
china 's exports are expected to grow at an annual rate of 20 percent in 2007 and 2008 compared with 9 percent for german exports over the same period .
in 2005 , china surpassed britain to become the world 's fourth largest economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 27.07.2007 concerns mount over nuclear energy after series of scares großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sceptics say recent errors highlight the drawbacks of nuclear energy irregularities at nuclear reactors in germany and japan in recent weeks have rekindled safety fears and raised tough questions about nuclear energy amid increasing environmental concerns . the nuclear plant at brunsbüttel in the northern german state of schleswig-holstein is now the world 's safest .
it 's not surprising considering the reactor was shut down following a technical irregularity earlier this month .
the problem at brunsbüttel , one of 17 nuclear reactors in germany , is by no means the only mishap in recent months that has increasingly called the safety of atomic power into question .
earlier this month , an earthquake caused leaks at a reactor in northwestern japan and led to low-level radiation , reviving fears about nuclear safety , and the closure of the brunsbüttel plant in germany followed a fire at another reactor close to hamburg .
around the world , there are 438 nuclear plants currently in operation .
the majority are in industrialized nations - 104 in the us , 59 in france and 31 in russia .
how dangerous were the incidents ?
despite the recent slew of incidents at nuclear power stations , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said the errors in germany , sweden and japan were exceptions and certainly did not pose a danger .
that 's a view echoed by klaus kotthoff of the grs group , an independent nuclear assessment and research organization .
while there is no technology that 's free of errors , kotthoff pointed out that nuclear power plants are subject to a range of registration procedures and measures aimed at managing irregularities - as was the case at two nuclear plants in germany earlier this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire broke out last month at the krümmel nuclear plant near hamburg in germany " i believe these incidents were not noteworthy from a technical security point of view , " kotthoff said .
critics of nuclear energy , however , do n't buy the argument .
henrik paulitz of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- said the recent german incidents were dangerous .
" the reactor protection system was activated .
that only happens in serious cases , " paulitz said , adding that they were n't isolated cases .
there are several nuclear incidents in germany about which the public is not sufficiently informed , he said .
the information that is released is mostly " incomprehensible " and the controversial backgrounds are often concealed .
" serious security deficits are usually glossed over , " paulitz said .
experts split over nuclear safety experts remain divided about the safety of nuclear reactors .
while kotthoff said german plants are generally considered the safest , a 1997 study by the organization for economic cooperation and development ranked the german nuclear power station biblis b second to last in an international nuclear power plant comparison . only the maine yankee plant in the us fared worse , and it 's since been shut down .
but paulitz said other nuclear power stations too are n't much better .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is again debating whether to stick to a nuclear energy phase out " an unfortunate mixture of technical problems and human error can at any time cause a major nuclear meltdown anywhere , " he said .
the recent string of incidents comes at a time when nuclear energy seems to be undergoing somewhat of a revival .
considered one of the most cost-effective forms of generating electricity as prices of oil and gas rise , nuclear energy is largely favored by rapidly expanding economies in eastern europe and asia to meet their spiraling energy needs .
" the debates about climate change and reducing emissions also play a role here , " said alan mcdonald of the iaea .
" and naturally , it 's about securing production . "
nuclear energy plagued by problems nuclear energy production , however , remains problematic as most countries using nuclear energy need to import uranium .
according to the iaea , there are only 4.7 tons of economically viable uranium reserves worldwide .
given current levels of usage , experts believe stocks will only last for another 60 years .
that would mean that uranium would be depleted faster than oil and gas reserves .
experts also pointed to the unsolved problem of disposing nuclear waste , which remains radioactive for decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts estimate that uranium stocks will only last another 60 years paulitz said the environmental advantages of using nuclear energy are also limited since it only provides an estimated 1.2 percent of the world 's energy needs .
for nuclear energy to make a real difference in cutting greenhouse gas emissions , thousands of new reactors would have to be built , he said .
that is hardly possible given the nuclear industry 's low production capacity .
" it 's only about sustaining energy production on this low level and maintaining the technology - also because of interest in nuclear weapons , " paulitz said , adding that the world could easily do without this marginal energy source .
security poses biggest hurdle iaea 's mcdonald said that security issues increasingly pose the biggest hurdle when it comes to using nuclear energy .
the vienna-based nuclear watchdog has set up an entire department to explore ways of preventing the misuse of nuclear materials and terrorist attacks on reactors .
" terrorists who plant to blow up a nuclear reactor can do so with relatively easy means , " paulitz said .
" protecting against such attacks is just not possible . " ina rottscheidt -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's not surprising considering the reactor was shut down following a technical irregularity earlier this month .
the problem at brunsbüttel , one of 17 nuclear reactors in germany , is by no means the only mishap in recent months that has increasingly called the safety of atomic power into question .
earlier this month , an earthquake caused leaks at a reactor in northwestern japan and led to low-level radiation , reviving fears about nuclear safety , and the closure of the brunsbüttel plant in germany followed a fire at another reactor close to hamburg .
around the world , there are 438 nuclear plants currently in operation .
the majority are in industrialized nations - 104 in the us , 59 in france and 31 in russia .
how dangerous were the incidents ?
despite the recent slew of incidents at nuclear power stations , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said the errors in germany , sweden and japan were exceptions and certainly did not pose a danger .
that 's a view echoed by klaus kotthoff of the grs group , an independent nuclear assessment and research organization .
while there is no technology that 's free of errors , kotthoff pointed out that nuclear power plants are subject to a range of registration procedures and measures aimed at managing irregularities - as was the case at two nuclear plants in germany earlier this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire broke out last month at the krümmel nuclear plant near hamburg in germany " i believe these incidents were not noteworthy from a technical security point of view , " kotthoff said .
critics of nuclear energy , however , do n't buy the argument .
henrik paulitz of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- said the recent german incidents were dangerous .
" the reactor protection system was activated .
that only happens in serious cases , " paulitz said , adding that they were n't isolated cases .

intel denied the charges friday . the european commission said sent a " statement of objections " to intel on thursday alleging that it tried to exclude competitor advanced micro devices inc .
-lrb- amd -rrb- from the market .
intel could face fines if it is found guilty of infringing on eu antitrust rules .
intel has abused its dominant market position , the european union statement said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most computers have intel inside the eu said intel gave computer makers " substantial rebates " for buying their x86 cpus from intel .
they were allegedly offered below cost to strategic customers , such as governments and universities , according to the eu statement .
intel also allegedly paid manufacturers to delay or cancel product lines which used amd chips .
" the rebates offered by intel were of such a quantity and such an amount that an efficient competitor would be forced to price below cost , " european commission spokesman ton van lierop told reuters .
" we think that would be bad for competition and bad for consumers . "
the eu said below-cost or predatory pricing may be good for consumers in the short term , but is ultimately harmful because it kills off competition , which offers more choice and innovation in the long term .
intel dominates world chip market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chip making or deal making ?
intel replied that its conduct has been lawful , good for competition and beneficial to customers .
" we are confident that the microprocessor market segment is functioning normally and that intel 's conduct has been lawful , pro-competitive , and beneficial to consumers , " intel 's general counsel bruce sewell said .
intel controls 80 percent of the global market for the central processing units , or cpus .
the rest are made by amd .
focusing on price amd spokesman jens drews said pc manufacturers operate on thin margins and intel 's loyalty rebates have forced amd to focus on price rather than performance .
" their financial strength is poisoning the industry , " drews was quoted as saying by the associated press .
" what we see is that we have not been competing on a level playing field . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amd says chip quality has suffered from price wars intel has 10 weeks to reply to the statement and will then have the right to a hearing with eu regulators .
intel will face a fine if the commission finds it has engaged in anti-competitive conduct .
but most cases take several years before they are settled .
intel 's sewell said he 's awaiting a ruling on the microsoft case .
in 2004 , the european commission found microsoft had competed unfairly and levied a fine of nearly $ 500 million -lrb- $ 686 million -rrb- .

" the consumer climate showed stability at a strong level in july , " the gfk said , " with income expectations and buying propensity almost matching the record figures of the previous month . "
indictors show that germans expect incomes to continue rising and are therefore prepared to buy more goods , it said .
" with consumers in the mood to spend even more , retailers can hope to achieve higher sales in the second half of 2007 , " the gfk added .
caution creeps in but economic expectations were slightly more cautious , following the euphoria that led to an all-time high for the economic outlook indicator in may .
this was because rising interest rates , high energy prices and a strong euro triggered fears that the current dynamic growth in the german economy might start slowing down , the gfk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retailers can expect good sales for the rest of the year " german consumers do not believe that the current high growth rate of the economy can be maintained at quite the same level and expect the upturn to slow down over the coming months , " it said .
" if the euro continues to be valued at the present high level or even higher , this may impact negatively on export prospects in the medium term , which have been the key driver of the strong economy to date . "
losing momentum ?
however , the favorable trend on the labor market and expected future income growth largely compensated for these risks , the survey showed .
the survey was published a day after another key indicator , the ifo business climate index , showed business sentiment in germany dipped slightly in july .
higher oil prices , rising interest rates and a strong euro have fuelled fears that the german economy might lose momentum after posting a 2.8 percent growth rate in 2006 .

it foresees the building of a nuclear reactor in libya to supply drinking water from sea water .
german deputy foreign minister gernot erler condemned the deal , warning it was not just a bilateral matter and could damage german interests .
german interests at risk ?
" politically , this business is problematic , " erler told handelsblatt business daily .
" german interests are directly affected . "
erler was referring to german conglomerate siemens which has a 34-percent stake in framatome , a nuclear power joint venture it has with france 's areva , the world 's biggest maker of nuclear reactors .
areva is reported to supply the plant in libya .
the deal is also expected to offer areva access to libya 's vast energy resources .
libya is believed to have uranium stocks of 1,600 tons as well as unexploited reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder was the first german leader to visit libya in 2004 erler said germany had tried in the past to offer libya help with developing renewable energy , but said tripoli had failed to react .

" above all the risk of proliferation increases with every country using nuclear energy , " erler said .

" rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " sarkozy 's deal with gadhafi , which came just a day after tripoli handed over six foreign medics to bulgaria , has sparked criticism in europe and in france too .
daniel cohn-bendit , a german politician of the green party and a member of the european parliament described the deal as " ransom " paid by sarkozy to a " bloody dictator " for the release of the foreign medics .
in an interview with german station rtl , cohn-bendit said it was " absolutely mad " that sarkozy was " rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " with the nuclear treaty .
france 's opposition socialist party asked : " is it not a bit soon to be throwing ourselves into gadhafi 's arms and giving him our international endorsement ? "

it foresees the building of a nuclear reactor in libya to supply drinking water from sea water .
german deputy foreign minister gernot erler condemned the deal , warning it was not just a bilateral matter and could damage german interests .
german interests at risk ?
" politically , this business is problematic , " erler told handelsblatt business daily .
" german interests are directly affected . "
erler was referring to german conglomerate siemens which has a 34-percent stake in framatome , a nuclear power joint venture it has with france 's areva , the world 's biggest maker of nuclear reactors .
areva is reported to supply the plant in libya .
the deal is also expected to offer areva access to libya 's vast energy resources .
libya is believed to have uranium stocks of 1,600 tons as well as unexploited reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder was the first german leader to visit libya in 2004 erler said germany had tried in the past to offer libya help with developing renewable energy , but said tripoli had failed to react .
he added that european security interests could be affected by the export of nuclear technology and that paris and berlin needed to discuss the issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 27.07.2007 greens leader urges germany to boost activity in northern iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to do more to help in reconstruction efforts in iraq , roth said the head of germany 's green party , claudia roth , visited the kurdish northern part of iraq this week .
she 's called for her country to strengthen its diplomatic , economic and cultural presence in that part of the country . roth traveled to northern iraq this week to meet with top politicians and human rights activists and to get a feel for the security situation in the war-torn region .
she met with iraqi president jalal talabani , who asked that germany be more involved in iraq 's north , roth told german media outlets on friday . " germany has to take a new role , " she told german public broadcaster ard on friday .
" i expect the german government to be diplomatically , economically and politically present in kurdistan . " roth said germany should be more strongly engaged in the kurdish region and pointed out that other european union countries , including italy , great britain , france and the czech republic , were taking part in rebuilding efforts and cultural projects in northern iraq . though the autonomous northern part of the country is relatively calm compared to the rest of iraq , where suicide bombings are a regular occurrence , roth 's five-day trip to the region was the first visit from a german parliamentary delegation to the country since the us-led invasion began in 2003 . german military not in iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roth , left , wants to increase the german presence in iraq under then chancellor gerhard schröder , germany refused to take part in the us-led war in iraq and currently does not have a military presence in the country .
germany has participated in helping train iraqi military , but the program is conducted in germany and gulf countries . the opposition green party - which has pacifist roots and has traditionally spoken out against germany becoming involved in foreign military matters - was among the most vocal opponents to germany 's involvement in the us military campaigns in afghanistan and iraq . northern iraq critical to country 's stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has not taken part in the us-led war in iraq greens security expert winfried nachtwei said he viewed the situation in northern iraq to be relatively safe . " it seems to me that the situation is much , much more stable than in the north of afghanistan , " he said . germany has some 3,000 soldiers stationed in afghanistan , nearly all of whom are in the north , as part of international security forces in the country .
while members of the greens are divided on whether to extend bundeswehr mandates in afghanistan , nachtwei said it was right for germany not to become involved in the iraq war . the german foreign ministry has issued a general warning for all german nationals to leave iraq , including those in the country 's north .
it 's a warning roth said she does n't understand . " for me it is totally incomprehensible why there is neither diplomatic representation nor an attempt to support the capabilities of the people here through cultural exchange , such as setting up german schools , " she said , adding that many of politicians she met had lived in germany in the past and requested german involvement in afghanistan . returning refugees to iraq " shameless " germany is particularly interested in northern iraq because many german asylum-seekers come from the area .
roth pointed out that currently , people from the kurdish region must travel to baghdad or the turkish capital of ankara to get a visa to travel to germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern iraq is not experience violence on the same scale as baghdad many iraqi asylum seekers in germany have had a difficult time meeting requirements to become legal residents of germany and face deportation .

intel denied the charges friday . the european commission said sent a " statement of objections " to intel on thursday alleging that it tried to exclude competitor advanced micro devices inc .
-lrb- amd -rrb- from the market .
intel could face fines if it is found guilty of infringing on eu antitrust rules .
intel has abused its dominant market position , the european union statement said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most computers have intel inside the eu said intel gave computer makers " substantial rebates " for buying their x86 cpus from intel .
they were allegedly offered below cost to strategic customers , such as governments and universities , according to the eu statement .
intel also allegedly paid manufacturers to delay or cancel product lines which used amd chips .
" the rebates offered by intel were of such a quantity and such an amount that an efficient competitor would be forced to price below cost , " european commission spokesman ton van lierop told reuters .
" we think that would be bad for competition and bad for consumers . "
the eu said below-cost or predatory pricing may be good for consumers in the short term , but is ultimately harmful because it kills off competition , which offers more choice and innovation in the long term .
intel dominates world chip market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chip making or deal making ?
intel replied that its conduct has been lawful , good for competition and beneficial to customers .
" we are confident that the microprocessor market segment is functioning normally and that intel 's conduct has been lawful , pro-competitive , and beneficial to consumers , " intel 's general counsel bruce sewell said .
intel controls 80 percent of the global market for the central processing units , or cpus .
the rest are made by amd .
focusing on price amd spokesman jens drews said pc manufacturers operate on thin margins and intel 's loyalty rebates have forced amd to focus on price rather than performance .
" their financial strength is poisoning the industry , " drews was quoted as saying by the associated press .
" what we see is that we have not been competing on a level playing field . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amd says chip quality has suffered from price wars intel has 10 weeks to reply to the statement and will then have the right to a hearing with eu regulators .
intel will face a fine if the commission finds it has engaged in anti-competitive conduct .
but most cases take several years before they are settled .
intel 's sewell said he 's awaiting a ruling on the microsoft case .
in 2004 , the european commission found microsoft had competed unfairly and levied a fine of nearly $ 500 million -lrb- $ 686 million -rrb- .

criminal charges could be next . two judges questioned villepin on friday morning about an attempt in 2003-2004 to discredit france 's current president , nicolas sarkozy , who was at the time a government minister and a political rival in the conservative ump party , in which both men as well as former french president jacques chirac were members .
the judges suspect villepin of involvement in the so-called clearstream affair , in which sarkozy 's name was wrongly linked to an illegal bank account in luxembourg .
the preliminary charges against him were for complicity to make false accusations , receiving stolen goods , breach of trust and complicity to use false documents .
villepin has denied breaking the law .
" i am anxious to restate this morning that at no point did i ask for an investigation into political figures , and at no moment did i partake in any political machination , " villepin said after being questioned on friday .
the affair started in 2003 when a list of clearstream bank-account holders surfaced who had allegedly received secret commissions from international arms sales .
the list , which included the names of sarkozy and other prominent politicians , was subsequently proven to be false .
chirac the mastermind ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac continues to claim presidential immunity experts retrieved documents from former intelligence chief philippe rondot 's computer two weeks ago that suggested villepin had instructed an associate , jean-louis gergorin , to leak the list to a judge to damage sarkozy 's reputation .
rondot had conducted a secret probe into the affair in 2004 .
the information on his laptop also indicated that then president chirac had initiated the smear campaign .
chirac has said he will not answer questions regarding the affair , claiming he remains protected by presidential immunity , a position legal experts are divided over .
earlier this month , gergorin , formerly the vice president of european aerospace company eads , admitted he wrote anonymous letters to justice officials smearing sarkozy .

intel denied the charges friday . the european commission said sent a " statement of objections " to intel on thursday alleging that it tried to exclude competitor advanced micro devices inc .
-lrb- amd -rrb- from the market .
intel could face fines if it is found guilty of infringing on eu antitrust rules .
intel has abused its dominant market position , the european union statement said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most computers have intel inside the eu said intel gave computer makers " substantial rebates " for buying their x86 cpus from intel .
they were allegedly offered below cost to strategic customers , such as governments and universities , according to the eu statement .
intel also allegedly paid manufacturers to delay or cancel product lines which used amd chips .
" the rebates offered by intel were of such a quantity and such an amount that an efficient competitor would be forced to price below cost , " european commission spokesman ton van lierop told reuters .
" we think that would be bad for competition and bad for consumers . "
the eu said below-cost or predatory pricing may be good for consumers in the short term , but is ultimately harmful because it kills off competition , which offers more choice and innovation in the long term .
intel dominates world chip market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chip making or deal making ?
intel replied that its conduct has been lawful , good for competition and beneficial to customers .
" we are confident that the microprocessor market segment is functioning normally and that intel 's conduct has been lawful , pro-competitive , and beneficial to consumers , " intel 's general counsel bruce sewell said .
intel controls 80 percent of the global market for the central processing units , or cpus .
the rest are made by amd .
focusing on price amd spokesman jens drews said pc manufacturers operate on thin margins and intel 's loyalty rebates have forced amd to focus on price rather than performance .
" their financial strength is poisoning the industry , " drews was quoted as saying by the associated press .
" what we see is that we have not been competing on a level playing field . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amd says chip quality has suffered from price wars intel has 10 weeks to reply to the statement and will then have the right to a hearing with eu regulators .
intel will face a fine if the commission finds it has engaged in anti-competitive conduct .
but most cases take several years before they are settled .
intel 's sewell said he 's awaiting a ruling on the microsoft case .
in 2004 , the european commission found microsoft had competed unfairly and levied a fine of nearly $ 500 million -lrb- $ 686 million -rrb- .

criminal charges could be next . two judges questioned villepin on friday morning about an attempt in 2003-2004 to discredit france 's current president , nicolas sarkozy , who was at the time a government minister and a political rival in the conservative ump party , in which both men as well as former french president jacques chirac were members .
the judges suspect villepin of involvement in the so-called clearstream affair , in which sarkozy 's name was wrongly linked to an illegal bank account in luxembourg .
the preliminary charges against him were for complicity to make false accusations , receiving stolen goods , breach of trust and complicity to use false documents .
villepin has denied breaking the law .
" i am anxious to restate this morning that at no point did i ask for an investigation into political figures , and at no moment did i partake in any political machination , " villepin said after being questioned on friday .
the affair started in 2003 when a list of clearstream bank-account holders surfaced who had allegedly received secret commissions from international arms sales .
the list , which included the names of sarkozy and other prominent politicians , was subsequently proven to be false .
chirac the mastermind ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac continues to claim presidential immunity experts retrieved documents from former intelligence chief philippe rondot 's computer two weeks ago that suggested villepin had instructed an associate , jean-louis gergorin , to leak the list to a judge to damage sarkozy 's reputation .
rondot had conducted a secret probe into the affair in 2004 .
the information on his laptop also indicated that then president chirac had initiated the smear campaign .
chirac has said he will not answer questions regarding the affair , claiming he remains protected by presidential immunity , a position legal experts are divided over .
earlier this month , gergorin , formerly the vice president of european aerospace company eads , admitted he wrote anonymous letters to justice officials smearing sarkozy .
last year , sarkozy declared himself a civil plaintiff in the suit and said he was determined to find out who tried to undermine him . article based on news reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the view was echoed by wolfgang bosbach of the cdu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 27.07.2007 concerns mount over nuclear energy after series of scares großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sceptics say recent errors highlight the drawbacks of nuclear energy irregularities at nuclear reactors in germany and japan in recent weeks have rekindled safety fears and raised tough questions about nuclear energy amid increasing environmental concerns . the nuclear plant at brunsbüttel in the northern german state of schleswig-holstein is now the world 's safest .
it 's not surprising considering the reactor was shut down following a technical irregularity earlier this month .
the problem at brunsbüttel , one of 17 nuclear reactors in germany , is by no means the only mishap in recent months that has increasingly called the safety of atomic power into question .
earlier this month , an earthquake caused leaks at a reactor in northwestern japan and led to low-level radiation , reviving fears about nuclear safety , and the closure of the brunsbüttel plant in germany followed a fire at another reactor close to hamburg .
around the world , there are 438 nuclear plants currently in operation .
the majority are in industrialized nations - 104 in the us , 59 in france and 31 in russia .
how dangerous were the incidents ?
despite the recent slew of incidents at nuclear power stations , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said the errors in germany , sweden and japan were exceptions and certainly did not pose a danger .
that 's a view echoed by klaus kotthoff of the grs group , an independent nuclear assessment and research organization .
while there is no technology that 's free of errors , kotthoff pointed out that nuclear power plants are subject to a range of registration procedures and measures aimed at managing irregularities - as was the case at two nuclear plants in germany earlier this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire broke out last month at the krümmel nuclear plant near hamburg in germany " i believe these incidents were not noteworthy from a technical security point of view , " kotthoff said .
critics of nuclear energy , however , do n't buy the argument .
henrik paulitz of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- said the recent german incidents were dangerous .
" the reactor protection system was activated .
that only happens in serious cases , " paulitz said , adding that they were n't isolated cases .
there are several nuclear incidents in germany about which the public is not sufficiently informed , he said .
the information that is released is mostly " incomprehensible " and the controversial backgrounds are often concealed .
" serious security deficits are usually glossed over , " paulitz said .
experts split over nuclear safety experts remain divided about the safety of nuclear reactors .
while kotthoff said german plants are generally considered the safest , a 1997 study by the organization for economic cooperation and development ranked the german nuclear power station biblis b second to last in an international nuclear power plant comparison . only the maine yankee plant in the us fared worse , and it 's since been shut down .
but paulitz said other nuclear power stations too are n't much better .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is again debating whether to stick to a nuclear energy phase out " an unfortunate mixture of technical problems and human error can at any time cause a major nuclear meltdown anywhere , " he said .
the recent string of incidents comes at a time when nuclear energy seems to be undergoing somewhat of a revival .
considered one of the most cost-effective forms of generating electricity as prices of oil and gas rise , nuclear energy is largely favored by rapidly expanding economies in eastern europe and asia to meet their spiraling energy needs .
" the debates about climate change and reducing emissions also play a role here , " said alan mcdonald of the iaea .
" and naturally , it 's about securing production . "
nuclear energy plagued by problems nuclear energy production , however , remains problematic as most countries using nuclear energy need to import uranium .
according to the iaea , there are only 4.7 tons of economically viable uranium reserves worldwide .
given current levels of usage , experts believe stocks will only last for another 60 years .
that would mean that uranium would be depleted faster than oil and gas reserves .
experts also pointed to the unsolved problem of disposing nuclear waste , which remains radioactive for decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts estimate that uranium stocks will only last another 60 years paulitz said the environmental advantages of using nuclear energy are also limited since it only provides an estimated 1.2 percent of the world 's energy needs .
for nuclear energy to make a real difference in cutting greenhouse gas emissions , thousands of new reactors would have to be built , he said .
that is hardly possible given the nuclear industry 's low production capacity .
" it 's only about sustaining energy production on this low level and maintaining the technology - also because of interest in nuclear weapons , " paulitz said , adding that the world could easily do without this marginal energy source .
security poses biggest hurdle iaea 's mcdonald said that security issues increasingly pose the biggest hurdle when it comes to using nuclear energy .
the vienna-based nuclear watchdog has set up an entire department to explore ways of preventing the misuse of nuclear materials and terrorist attacks on reactors .
" terrorists who plant to blow up a nuclear reactor can do so with relatively easy means , " paulitz said .
" protecting against such attacks is just not possible . " ina rottscheidt -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's not surprising considering the reactor was shut down following a technical irregularity earlier this month .
the problem at brunsbüttel , one of 17 nuclear reactors in germany , is by no means the only mishap in recent months that has increasingly called the safety of atomic power into question .
earlier this month , an earthquake caused leaks at a reactor in northwestern japan and led to low-level radiation , reviving fears about nuclear safety , and the closure of the brunsbüttel plant in germany followed a fire at another reactor close to hamburg .
around the world , there are 438 nuclear plants currently in operation .
the majority are in industrialized nations - 104 in the us , 59 in france and 31 in russia .
how dangerous were the incidents ?
despite the recent slew of incidents at nuclear power stations , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said the errors in germany , sweden and japan were exceptions and certainly did not pose a danger .
that 's a view echoed by klaus kotthoff of the grs group , an independent nuclear assessment and research organization .
while there is no technology that 's free of errors , kotthoff pointed out that nuclear power plants are subject to a range of registration procedures and measures aimed at managing irregularities - as was the case at two nuclear plants in germany earlier this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire broke out last month at the krümmel nuclear plant near hamburg in germany " i believe these incidents were not noteworthy from a technical security point of view , " kotthoff said .
critics of nuclear energy , however , do n't buy the argument .
henrik paulitz of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- said the recent german incidents were dangerous .
" the reactor protection system was activated .
that only happens in serious cases , " paulitz said , adding that they were n't isolated cases .
there are several nuclear incidents in germany about which the public is not sufficiently informed , he said .
the information that is released is mostly " incomprehensible " and the controversial backgrounds are often concealed .
" serious security deficits are usually glossed over , " paulitz said .
experts split over nuclear safety experts remain divided about the safety of nuclear reactors .
while kotthoff said german plants are generally considered the safest , a 1997 study by the organization for economic cooperation and development ranked the german nuclear power station biblis b second to last in an international nuclear power plant comparison . only the maine yankee plant in the us fared worse , and it 's since been shut down .
but paulitz said other nuclear power stations too are n't much better .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is again debating whether to stick to a nuclear energy phase out " an unfortunate mixture of technical problems and human error can at any time cause a major nuclear meltdown anywhere , " he said .
the recent string of incidents comes at a time when nuclear energy seems to be undergoing somewhat of a revival .
considered one of the most cost-effective forms of generating electricity as prices of oil and gas rise , nuclear energy is largely favored by rapidly expanding economies in eastern europe and asia to meet their spiraling energy needs .
" the debates about climate change and reducing emissions also play a role here , " said alan mcdonald of the iaea .
" and naturally , it 's about securing production . "
nuclear energy plagued by problems nuclear energy production , however , remains problematic as most countries using nuclear energy need to import uranium .
according to the iaea , there are only 4.7 tons of economically viable uranium reserves worldwide .
given current levels of usage , experts believe stocks will only last for another 60 years .
that would mean that uranium would be depleted faster than oil and gas reserves .
experts also pointed to the unsolved problem of disposing nuclear waste , which remains radioactive for decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts estimate that uranium stocks will only last another 60 years paulitz said the environmental advantages of using nuclear energy are also limited since it only provides an estimated 1.2 percent of the world 's energy needs .
for nuclear energy to make a real difference in cutting greenhouse gas emissions , thousands of new reactors would have to be built , he said .
that is hardly possible given the nuclear industry 's low production capacity .
" it 's only about sustaining energy production on this low level and maintaining the technology - also because of interest in nuclear weapons , " paulitz said , adding that the world could easily do without this marginal energy source .
security poses biggest hurdle iaea 's mcdonald said that security issues increasingly pose the biggest hurdle when it comes to using nuclear energy .
the vienna-based nuclear watchdog has set up an entire department to explore ways of preventing the misuse of nuclear materials and terrorist attacks on reactors .
" terrorists who plant to blow up a nuclear reactor can do so with relatively easy means , " paulitz said .

it 's not surprising considering the reactor was shut down following a technical irregularity earlier this month .
the problem at brunsbüttel , one of 17 nuclear reactors in germany , is by no means the only mishap in recent months that has increasingly called the safety of atomic power into question .
earlier this month , an earthquake caused leaks at a reactor in northwestern japan and led to low-level radiation , reviving fears about nuclear safety , and the closure of the brunsbüttel plant in germany followed a fire at another reactor close to hamburg .
around the world , there are 438 nuclear plants currently in operation .
the majority are in industrialized nations - 104 in the us , 59 in france and 31 in russia .
how dangerous were the incidents ?
despite the recent slew of incidents at nuclear power stations , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said the errors in germany , sweden and japan were exceptions and certainly did not pose a danger .
that 's a view echoed by klaus kotthoff of the grs group , an independent nuclear assessment and research organization .
while there is no technology that 's free of errors , kotthoff pointed out that nuclear power plants are subject to a range of registration procedures and measures aimed at managing irregularities - as was the case at two nuclear plants in germany earlier this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire broke out last month at the krümmel nuclear plant near hamburg in germany " i believe these incidents were not noteworthy from a technical security point of view , " kotthoff said .
critics of nuclear energy , however , do n't buy the argument .
henrik paulitz of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- said the recent german incidents were dangerous .
" the reactor protection system was activated .
that only happens in serious cases , " paulitz said , adding that they were n't isolated cases .
there are several nuclear incidents in germany about which the public is not sufficiently informed , he said .
the information that is released is mostly " incomprehensible " and the controversial backgrounds are often concealed .
" serious security deficits are usually glossed over , " paulitz said .
experts split over nuclear safety experts remain divided about the safety of nuclear reactors .
while kotthoff said german plants are generally considered the safest , a 1997 study by the organization for economic cooperation and development ranked the german nuclear power station biblis b second to last in an international nuclear power plant comparison . only the maine yankee plant in the us fared worse , and it 's since been shut down .
but paulitz said other nuclear power stations too are n't much better .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is again debating whether to stick to a nuclear energy phase out " an unfortunate mixture of technical problems and human error can at any time cause a major nuclear meltdown anywhere , " he said .
the recent string of incidents comes at a time when nuclear energy seems to be undergoing somewhat of a revival .
considered one of the most cost-effective forms of generating electricity as prices of oil and gas rise , nuclear energy is largely favored by rapidly expanding economies in eastern europe and asia to meet their spiraling energy needs .
" the debates about climate change and reducing emissions also play a role here , " said alan mcdonald of the iaea .
" and naturally , it 's about securing production . "
nuclear energy plagued by problems nuclear energy production , however , remains problematic as most countries using nuclear energy need to import uranium .
according to the iaea , there are only 4.7 tons of economically viable uranium reserves worldwide .
given current levels of usage , experts believe stocks will only last for another 60 years .
that would mean that uranium would be depleted faster than oil and gas reserves .
experts also pointed to the unsolved problem of disposing nuclear waste , which remains radioactive for decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts estimate that uranium stocks will only last another 60 years paulitz said the environmental advantages of using nuclear energy are also limited since it only provides an estimated 1.2 percent of the world 's energy needs .
for nuclear energy to make a real difference in cutting greenhouse gas emissions , thousands of new reactors would have to be built , he said .
that is hardly possible given the nuclear industry 's low production capacity .
" it 's only about sustaining energy production on this low level and maintaining the technology - also because of interest in nuclear weapons , " paulitz said , adding that the world could easily do without this marginal energy source .
security poses biggest hurdle iaea 's mcdonald said that security issues increasingly pose the biggest hurdle when it comes to using nuclear energy .
the vienna-based nuclear watchdog has set up an entire department to explore ways of preventing the misuse of nuclear materials and terrorist attacks on reactors .
" terrorists who plant to blow up a nuclear reactor can do so with relatively easy means , " paulitz said .

it foresees the building of a nuclear reactor in libya to supply drinking water from sea water .
german deputy foreign minister gernot erler condemned the deal , warning it was not just a bilateral matter and could damage german interests .
german interests at risk ?
" politically , this business is problematic , " erler told handelsblatt business daily .
" german interests are directly affected . "
erler was referring to german conglomerate siemens which has a 34-percent stake in framatome , a nuclear power joint venture it has with france 's areva , the world 's biggest maker of nuclear reactors .
areva is reported to supply the plant in libya .
the deal is also expected to offer areva access to libya 's vast energy resources .
libya is believed to have uranium stocks of 1,600 tons as well as unexploited reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder was the first german leader to visit libya in 2004 erler said germany had tried in the past to offer libya help with developing renewable energy , but said tripoli had failed to react .
he added that european security interests could be affected by the export of nuclear technology and that paris and berlin needed to discuss the issue .
" above all the risk of proliferation increases with every country using nuclear energy , " erler said .
in 2003 , libya agreed to halt a weapons program banned by the united nations , ending decades of international isolation .
in the following year , libya handed over its stocks of enriched uranium to the vienna-based nuclear watchdog , iaea .
" rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " sarkozy 's deal with gadhafi , which came just a day after tripoli handed over six foreign medics to bulgaria , has sparked criticism in europe and in france too .
daniel cohn-bendit , a german politician of the green party and a member of the european parliament described the deal as " ransom " paid by sarkozy to a " bloody dictator " for the release of the foreign medics .
in an interview with german station rtl , cohn-bendit said it was " absolutely mad " that sarkozy was " rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " with the nuclear treaty .
france 's opposition socialist party asked : " is it not a bit soon to be throwing ourselves into gadhafi 's arms and giving him our international endorsement ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya had imprisoned six foreign medics for eight years before releasing them last week the green party accused sarkozy of " boundless cynicism " rooted in the risk of striking a nuclear deal with an " undemocratic state . "
greenpeace france said the deal " poses an enormous problem in terms of nuclear proliferation " and branded it as " in keeping with the french policy of irresponsible export of nuclear technology . "
greenpeace pointed out that previous french presidents had signed nuclear deals with the former shah of iran , ex-iraqi dictator saddam hussein and with south africa during the apartheid era .
sarkozy insists deal will not lead to proliferation sarkozy however has defended france 's nuclear cooperation with libya , saying that a country which respects international laws can create a civilian nuclear industry .
" if you dare to say that civilian nuclear energy should be closed to the northern shore of the mediterranean and that the arab world is not responsible enough for civilian nuclear energy then you 're humiliating them and preparing for a clash of civilizations , " sarkozy told french paper le monde .
an official with france 's atomic energy commission -lrb- cea -rrb- insisted that international safeguards imposed after libya scrapped its military nuclear program would prevent any proliferation .
simon nisan told news agency afp international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- controls made it " almost impossible " to divert the technology to military use .
" the controls are so tight that you do n't have the right to remove the fuel without the presence of iaea inspectors , " he said . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de sarkozy signs wide ranging agreements with libya french president nicolas sarkozy appeared to be rewarding libya for its cooperation in the freeing of six bulgarian medics by signing a number of military and trade accords with the north african state wednesday .

she 's called for her country to strengthen its diplomatic , economic and cultural presence in that part of the country . roth traveled to northern iraq this week to meet with top politicians and human rights activists and to get a feel for the security situation in the war-torn region .
she met with iraqi president jalal talabani , who asked that germany be more involved in iraq 's north , roth told german media outlets on friday . " germany has to take a new role , " she told german public broadcaster ard on friday .
" i expect the german government to be diplomatically , economically and politically present in kurdistan . " roth said germany should be more strongly engaged in the kurdish region and pointed out that other european union countries , including italy , great britain , france and the czech republic , were taking part in rebuilding efforts and cultural projects in northern iraq . though the autonomous northern part of the country is relatively calm compared to the rest of iraq , where suicide bombings are a regular occurrence , roth 's five-day trip to the region was the first visit from a german parliamentary delegation to the country since the us-led invasion began in 2003 . german military not in iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roth , left , wants to increase the german presence in iraq under then chancellor gerhard schröder , germany refused to take part in the us-led war in iraq and currently does not have a military presence in the country .

while members of the greens are divided on whether to extend bundeswehr mandates in afghanistan , nachtwei said it was right for germany not to become involved in the iraq war . the german foreign ministry has issued a general warning for all german nationals to leave iraq , including those in the country 's north .
it 's a warning roth said she does n't understand . " for me it is totally incomprehensible why there is neither diplomatic representation nor an attempt to support the capabilities of the people here through cultural exchange , such as setting up german schools , " she said , adding that many of politicians she met had lived in germany in the past and requested german involvement in afghanistan . returning refugees to iraq " shameless " germany is particularly interested in northern iraq because many german asylum-seekers come from the area .

it foresees the building of a nuclear reactor in libya to supply drinking water from sea water .
german deputy foreign minister gernot erler condemned the deal , warning it was not just a bilateral matter and could damage german interests .
german interests at risk ?
" politically , this business is problematic , " erler told handelsblatt business daily .
" german interests are directly affected . "
erler was referring to german conglomerate siemens which has a 34-percent stake in framatome , a nuclear power joint venture it has with france 's areva , the world 's biggest maker of nuclear reactors .
areva is reported to supply the plant in libya .
the deal is also expected to offer areva access to libya 's vast energy resources .
libya is believed to have uranium stocks of 1,600 tons as well as unexploited reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder was the first german leader to visit libya in 2004 erler said germany had tried in the past to offer libya help with developing renewable energy , but said tripoli had failed to react .
he added that european security interests could be affected by the export of nuclear technology and that paris and berlin needed to discuss the issue .
" above all the risk of proliferation increases with every country using nuclear energy , " erler said .
in 2003 , libya agreed to halt a weapons program banned by the united nations , ending decades of international isolation .
in the following year , libya handed over its stocks of enriched uranium to the vienna-based nuclear watchdog , iaea .
" rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " sarkozy 's deal with gadhafi , which came just a day after tripoli handed over six foreign medics to bulgaria , has sparked criticism in europe and in france too .
daniel cohn-bendit , a german politician of the green party and a member of the european parliament described the deal as " ransom " paid by sarkozy to a " bloody dictator " for the release of the foreign medics .
in an interview with german station rtl , cohn-bendit said it was " absolutely mad " that sarkozy was " rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " with the nuclear treaty .
france 's opposition socialist party asked : " is it not a bit soon to be throwing ourselves into gadhafi 's arms and giving him our international endorsement ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya had imprisoned six foreign medics for eight years before releasing them last week the green party accused sarkozy of " boundless cynicism " rooted in the risk of striking a nuclear deal with an " undemocratic state . "
greenpeace france said the deal " poses an enormous problem in terms of nuclear proliferation " and branded it as " in keeping with the french policy of irresponsible export of nuclear technology . "
greenpeace pointed out that previous french presidents had signed nuclear deals with the former shah of iran , ex-iraqi dictator saddam hussein and with south africa during the apartheid era .
sarkozy insists deal will not lead to proliferation sarkozy however has defended france 's nuclear cooperation with libya , saying that a country which respects international laws can create a civilian nuclear industry .
" if you dare to say that civilian nuclear energy should be closed to the northern shore of the mediterranean and that the arab world is not responsible enough for civilian nuclear energy then you 're humiliating them and preparing for a clash of civilizations , " sarkozy told french paper le monde .
an official with france 's atomic energy commission -lrb- cea -rrb- insisted that international safeguards imposed after libya scrapped its military nuclear program would prevent any proliferation .
simon nisan told news agency afp international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- controls made it " almost impossible " to divert the technology to military use .

it foresees the building of a nuclear reactor in libya to supply drinking water from sea water .
german deputy foreign minister gernot erler condemned the deal , warning it was not just a bilateral matter and could damage german interests .
german interests at risk ?
" politically , this business is problematic , " erler told handelsblatt business daily .
" german interests are directly affected . "
erler was referring to german conglomerate siemens which has a 34-percent stake in framatome , a nuclear power joint venture it has with france 's areva , the world 's biggest maker of nuclear reactors .
areva is reported to supply the plant in libya .
the deal is also expected to offer areva access to libya 's vast energy resources .
libya is believed to have uranium stocks of 1,600 tons as well as unexploited reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder was the first german leader to visit libya in 2004 erler said germany had tried in the past to offer libya help with developing renewable energy , but said tripoli had failed to react .
he added that european security interests could be affected by the export of nuclear technology and that paris and berlin needed to discuss the issue .
" above all the risk of proliferation increases with every country using nuclear energy , " erler said .
in 2003 , libya agreed to halt a weapons program banned by the united nations , ending decades of international isolation .
in the following year , libya handed over its stocks of enriched uranium to the vienna-based nuclear watchdog , iaea .
" rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " sarkozy 's deal with gadhafi , which came just a day after tripoli handed over six foreign medics to bulgaria , has sparked criticism in europe and in france too .
daniel cohn-bendit , a german politician of the green party and a member of the european parliament described the deal as " ransom " paid by sarkozy to a " bloody dictator " for the release of the foreign medics .
in an interview with german station rtl , cohn-bendit said it was " absolutely mad " that sarkozy was " rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " with the nuclear treaty .
france 's opposition socialist party asked : " is it not a bit soon to be throwing ourselves into gadhafi 's arms and giving him our international endorsement ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya had imprisoned six foreign medics for eight years before releasing them last week the green party accused sarkozy of " boundless cynicism " rooted in the risk of striking a nuclear deal with an " undemocratic state . "
greenpeace france said the deal " poses an enormous problem in terms of nuclear proliferation " and branded it as " in keeping with the french policy of irresponsible export of nuclear technology . "
greenpeace pointed out that previous french presidents had signed nuclear deals with the former shah of iran , ex-iraqi dictator saddam hussein and with south africa during the apartheid era .
sarkozy insists deal will not lead to proliferation sarkozy however has defended france 's nuclear cooperation with libya , saying that a country which respects international laws can create a civilian nuclear industry .
" if you dare to say that civilian nuclear energy should be closed to the northern shore of the mediterranean and that the arab world is not responsible enough for civilian nuclear energy then you 're humiliating them and preparing for a clash of civilizations , " sarkozy told french paper le monde .
an official with france 's atomic energy commission -lrb- cea -rrb- insisted that international safeguards imposed after libya scrapped its military nuclear program would prevent any proliferation .
simon nisan told news agency afp international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- controls made it " almost impossible " to divert the technology to military use .

" the consumer climate showed stability at a strong level in july , " the gfk said , " with income expectations and buying propensity almost matching the record figures of the previous month . "
indictors show that germans expect incomes to continue rising and are therefore prepared to buy more goods , it said .
" with consumers in the mood to spend even more , retailers can hope to achieve higher sales in the second half of 2007 , " the gfk added .
caution creeps in but economic expectations were slightly more cautious , following the euphoria that led to an all-time high for the economic outlook indicator in may .
this was because rising interest rates , high energy prices and a strong euro triggered fears that the current dynamic growth in the german economy might start slowing down , the gfk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retailers can expect good sales for the rest of the year " german consumers do not believe that the current high growth rate of the economy can be maintained at quite the same level and expect the upturn to slow down over the coming months , " it said .
" if the euro continues to be valued at the present high level or even higher , this may impact negatively on export prospects in the medium term , which have been the key driver of the strong economy to date . "
losing momentum ?
however , the favorable trend on the labor market and expected future income growth largely compensated for these risks , the survey showed .
the survey was published a day after another key indicator , the ifo business climate index , showed business sentiment in germany dipped slightly in july .
higher oil prices , rising interest rates and a strong euro have fuelled fears that the german economy might lose momentum after posting a 2.8 percent growth rate in 2006 .

criminal charges could be next . two judges questioned villepin on friday morning about an attempt in 2003-2004 to discredit france 's current president , nicolas sarkozy , who was at the time a government minister and a political rival in the conservative ump party , in which both men as well as former french president jacques chirac were members .
the judges suspect villepin of involvement in the so-called clearstream affair , in which sarkozy 's name was wrongly linked to an illegal bank account in luxembourg .
the preliminary charges against him were for complicity to make false accusations , receiving stolen goods , breach of trust and complicity to use false documents .
villepin has denied breaking the law .
" i am anxious to restate this morning that at no point did i ask for an investigation into political figures , and at no moment did i partake in any political machination , " villepin said after being questioned on friday .
the affair started in 2003 when a list of clearstream bank-account holders surfaced who had allegedly received secret commissions from international arms sales .
the list , which included the names of sarkozy and other prominent politicians , was subsequently proven to be false .

rondot had conducted a secret probe into the affair in 2004 .
the information on his laptop also indicated that then president chirac had initiated the smear campaign .
chirac has said he will not answer questions regarding the affair , claiming he remains protected by presidential immunity , a position legal experts are divided over .

the judges suspect villepin of involvement in the so-called clearstream affair , in which sarkozy 's name was wrongly linked to an illegal bank account in luxembourg .
the preliminary charges against him were for complicity to make false accusations , receiving stolen goods , breach of trust and complicity to use false documents .
villepin has denied breaking the law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 27.07.2007 sarkozy draws fire for nuclear deal with libya großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some , sarkozy , right , is getting uncomfortably close to libya 's gadhafi the german government has strongly rebuked france for signing a nuclear deal with libya to build a reactor , saying it 's politically problematic and can hurt german interests . the deal was signed during a visit to the north african country by french president nicolas sarkozy on wednesday .
it foresees the building of a nuclear reactor in libya to supply drinking water from sea water .
german deputy foreign minister gernot erler condemned the deal , warning it was not just a bilateral matter and could damage german interests .
german interests at risk ?
" politically , this business is problematic , " erler told handelsblatt business daily .
" german interests are directly affected . "
erler was referring to german conglomerate siemens which has a 34-percent stake in framatome , a nuclear power joint venture it has with france 's areva , the world 's biggest maker of nuclear reactors .
areva is reported to supply the plant in libya .
the deal is also expected to offer areva access to libya 's vast energy resources .
libya is believed to have uranium stocks of 1,600 tons as well as unexploited reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder was the first german leader to visit libya in 2004 erler said germany had tried in the past to offer libya help with developing renewable energy , but said tripoli had failed to react .
he added that european security interests could be affected by the export of nuclear technology and that paris and berlin needed to discuss the issue .
" above all the risk of proliferation increases with every country using nuclear energy , " erler said .
in 2003 , libya agreed to halt a weapons program banned by the united nations , ending decades of international isolation .
in the following year , libya handed over its stocks of enriched uranium to the vienna-based nuclear watchdog , iaea .
" rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " sarkozy 's deal with gadhafi , which came just a day after tripoli handed over six foreign medics to bulgaria , has sparked criticism in europe and in france too .
daniel cohn-bendit , a german politician of the green party and a member of the european parliament described the deal as " ransom " paid by sarkozy to a " bloody dictator " for the release of the foreign medics .
in an interview with german station rtl , cohn-bendit said it was " absolutely mad " that sarkozy was " rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " with the nuclear treaty .
france 's opposition socialist party asked : " is it not a bit soon to be throwing ourselves into gadhafi 's arms and giving him our international endorsement ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya had imprisoned six foreign medics for eight years before releasing them last week the green party accused sarkozy of " boundless cynicism " rooted in the risk of striking a nuclear deal with an " undemocratic state . "
greenpeace france said the deal " poses an enormous problem in terms of nuclear proliferation " and branded it as " in keeping with the french policy of irresponsible export of nuclear technology . "
greenpeace pointed out that previous french presidents had signed nuclear deals with the former shah of iran , ex-iraqi dictator saddam hussein and with south africa during the apartheid era .
sarkozy insists deal will not lead to proliferation sarkozy however has defended france 's nuclear cooperation with libya , saying that a country which respects international laws can create a civilian nuclear industry .
" if you dare to say that civilian nuclear energy should be closed to the northern shore of the mediterranean and that the arab world is not responsible enough for civilian nuclear energy then you 're humiliating them and preparing for a clash of civilizations , " sarkozy told french paper le monde .
an official with france 's atomic energy commission -lrb- cea -rrb- insisted that international safeguards imposed after libya scrapped its military nuclear program would prevent any proliferation .

it foresees the building of a nuclear reactor in libya to supply drinking water from sea water .
german deputy foreign minister gernot erler condemned the deal , warning it was not just a bilateral matter and could damage german interests .
german interests at risk ?
" politically , this business is problematic , " erler told handelsblatt business daily .
" german interests are directly affected . "
erler was referring to german conglomerate siemens which has a 34-percent stake in framatome , a nuclear power joint venture it has with france 's areva , the world 's biggest maker of nuclear reactors .
areva is reported to supply the plant in libya .
the deal is also expected to offer areva access to libya 's vast energy resources .
libya is believed to have uranium stocks of 1,600 tons as well as unexploited reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder was the first german leader to visit libya in 2004 erler said germany had tried in the past to offer libya help with developing renewable energy , but said tripoli had failed to react .
he added that european security interests could be affected by the export of nuclear technology and that paris and berlin needed to discuss the issue .
" above all the risk of proliferation increases with every country using nuclear energy , " erler said .
in 2003 , libya agreed to halt a weapons program banned by the united nations , ending decades of international isolation .
in the following year , libya handed over its stocks of enriched uranium to the vienna-based nuclear watchdog , iaea .
" rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " sarkozy 's deal with gadhafi , which came just a day after tripoli handed over six foreign medics to bulgaria , has sparked criticism in europe and in france too .
daniel cohn-bendit , a german politician of the green party and a member of the european parliament described the deal as " ransom " paid by sarkozy to a " bloody dictator " for the release of the foreign medics .
in an interview with german station rtl , cohn-bendit said it was " absolutely mad " that sarkozy was " rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " with the nuclear treaty .
france 's opposition socialist party asked : " is it not a bit soon to be throwing ourselves into gadhafi 's arms and giving him our international endorsement ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya had imprisoned six foreign medics for eight years before releasing them last week the green party accused sarkozy of " boundless cynicism " rooted in the risk of striking a nuclear deal with an " undemocratic state . "
greenpeace france said the deal " poses an enormous problem in terms of nuclear proliferation " and branded it as " in keeping with the french policy of irresponsible export of nuclear technology . "
greenpeace pointed out that previous french presidents had signed nuclear deals with the former shah of iran , ex-iraqi dictator saddam hussein and with south africa during the apartheid era .
sarkozy insists deal will not lead to proliferation sarkozy however has defended france 's nuclear cooperation with libya , saying that a country which respects international laws can create a civilian nuclear industry .
" if you dare to say that civilian nuclear energy should be closed to the northern shore of the mediterranean and that the arab world is not responsible enough for civilian nuclear energy then you 're humiliating them and preparing for a clash of civilizations , " sarkozy told french paper le monde .
an official with france 's atomic energy commission -lrb- cea -rrb- insisted that international safeguards imposed after libya scrapped its military nuclear program would prevent any proliferation .

it foresees the building of a nuclear reactor in libya to supply drinking water from sea water .
german deputy foreign minister gernot erler condemned the deal , warning it was not just a bilateral matter and could damage german interests .
german interests at risk ?
" politically , this business is problematic , " erler told handelsblatt business daily .
" german interests are directly affected . "
erler was referring to german conglomerate siemens which has a 34-percent stake in framatome , a nuclear power joint venture it has with france 's areva , the world 's biggest maker of nuclear reactors .
areva is reported to supply the plant in libya .
the deal is also expected to offer areva access to libya 's vast energy resources .
libya is believed to have uranium stocks of 1,600 tons as well as unexploited reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder was the first german leader to visit libya in 2004 erler said germany had tried in the past to offer libya help with developing renewable energy , but said tripoli had failed to react .
he added that european security interests could be affected by the export of nuclear technology and that paris and berlin needed to discuss the issue .
" above all the risk of proliferation increases with every country using nuclear energy , " erler said .
in 2003 , libya agreed to halt a weapons program banned by the united nations , ending decades of international isolation .
in the following year , libya handed over its stocks of enriched uranium to the vienna-based nuclear watchdog , iaea .
" rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " sarkozy 's deal with gadhafi , which came just a day after tripoli handed over six foreign medics to bulgaria , has sparked criticism in europe and in france too .
daniel cohn-bendit , a german politician of the green party and a member of the european parliament described the deal as " ransom " paid by sarkozy to a " bloody dictator " for the release of the foreign medics .
in an interview with german station rtl , cohn-bendit said it was " absolutely mad " that sarkozy was " rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " with the nuclear treaty .
france 's opposition socialist party asked : " is it not a bit soon to be throwing ourselves into gadhafi 's arms and giving him our international endorsement ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya had imprisoned six foreign medics for eight years before releasing them last week the green party accused sarkozy of " boundless cynicism " rooted in the risk of striking a nuclear deal with an " undemocratic state . "
greenpeace france said the deal " poses an enormous problem in terms of nuclear proliferation " and branded it as " in keeping with the french policy of irresponsible export of nuclear technology . "
greenpeace pointed out that previous french presidents had signed nuclear deals with the former shah of iran , ex-iraqi dictator saddam hussein and with south africa during the apartheid era .
sarkozy insists deal will not lead to proliferation sarkozy however has defended france 's nuclear cooperation with libya , saying that a country which respects international laws can create a civilian nuclear industry .
" if you dare to say that civilian nuclear energy should be closed to the northern shore of the mediterranean and that the arab world is not responsible enough for civilian nuclear energy then you 're humiliating them and preparing for a clash of civilizations , " sarkozy told french paper le monde .
an official with france 's atomic energy commission -lrb- cea -rrb- insisted that international safeguards imposed after libya scrapped its military nuclear program would prevent any proliferation .
simon nisan told news agency afp international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- controls made it " almost impossible " to divert the technology to military use .
" the controls are so tight that you do n't have the right to remove the fuel without the presence of iaea inspectors , " he said . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de sarkozy signs wide ranging agreements with libya french president nicolas sarkozy appeared to be rewarding libya for its cooperation in the freeing of six bulgarian medics by signing a number of military and trade accords with the north african state wednesday .

but the entire incident might lead to others blackmailing the west , says dw 's rainer sollich .

she 's called for her country to strengthen its diplomatic , economic and cultural presence in that part of the country . roth traveled to northern iraq this week to meet with top politicians and human rights activists and to get a feel for the security situation in the war-torn region .
she met with iraqi president jalal talabani , who asked that germany be more involved in iraq 's north , roth told german media outlets on friday . " germany has to take a new role , " she told german public broadcaster ard on friday .
" i expect the german government to be diplomatically , economically and politically present in kurdistan . " roth said germany should be more strongly engaged in the kurdish region and pointed out that other european union countries , including italy , great britain , france and the czech republic , were taking part in rebuilding efforts and cultural projects in northern iraq . though the autonomous northern part of the country is relatively calm compared to the rest of iraq , where suicide bombings are a regular occurrence , roth 's five-day trip to the region was the first visit from a german parliamentary delegation to the country since the us-led invasion began in 2003 . german military not in iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roth , left , wants to increase the german presence in iraq under then chancellor gerhard schröder , germany refused to take part in the us-led war in iraq and currently does not have a military presence in the country .
germany has participated in helping train iraqi military , but the program is conducted in germany and gulf countries . the opposition green party - which has pacifist roots and has traditionally spoken out against germany becoming involved in foreign military matters - was among the most vocal opponents to germany 's involvement in the us military campaigns in afghanistan and iraq . northern iraq critical to country 's stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has not taken part in the us-led war in iraq greens security expert winfried nachtwei said he viewed the situation in northern iraq to be relatively safe . " it seems to me that the situation is much , much more stable than in the north of afghanistan , " he said . germany has some 3,000 soldiers stationed in afghanistan , nearly all of whom are in the north , as part of international security forces in the country .
while members of the greens are divided on whether to extend bundeswehr mandates in afghanistan , nachtwei said it was right for germany not to become involved in the iraq war . the german foreign ministry has issued a general warning for all german nationals to leave iraq , including those in the country 's north .
it 's a warning roth said she does n't understand . " for me it is totally incomprehensible why there is neither diplomatic representation nor an attempt to support the capabilities of the people here through cultural exchange , such as setting up german schools , " she said , adding that many of politicians she met had lived in germany in the past and requested german involvement in afghanistan . returning refugees to iraq " shameless " germany is particularly interested in northern iraq because many german asylum-seekers come from the area .
roth pointed out that currently , people from the kurdish region must travel to baghdad or the turkish capital of ankara to get a visa to travel to germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern iraq is not experience violence on the same scale as baghdad many iraqi asylum seekers in germany have had a difficult time meeting requirements to become legal residents of germany and face deportation .
roth warned against programs that send iraqi refugees back to the war-torn country , calling them " rather shameless . " " that is not a constructive to the rebuilding efforts ; it 's absolutely destructive , " she said in an interview with deutschlandfunk radio . human rights watch recently criticized a german plan to strip iraqi refugees in germany of their status as asylum seekers .
besides meeting talabani , roth also met with massud barsani , who is the head of the kurdish area , as well as human rights activists and un representatives . article based on news reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 27.07.2007 concerns mount over nuclear energy after series of scares großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sceptics say recent errors highlight the drawbacks of nuclear energy irregularities at nuclear reactors in germany and japan in recent weeks have rekindled safety fears and raised tough questions about nuclear energy amid increasing environmental concerns . the nuclear plant at brunsbüttel in the northern german state of schleswig-holstein is now the world 's safest .
it 's not surprising considering the reactor was shut down following a technical irregularity earlier this month .
the problem at brunsbüttel , one of 17 nuclear reactors in germany , is by no means the only mishap in recent months that has increasingly called the safety of atomic power into question .
earlier this month , an earthquake caused leaks at a reactor in northwestern japan and led to low-level radiation , reviving fears about nuclear safety , and the closure of the brunsbüttel plant in germany followed a fire at another reactor close to hamburg .
around the world , there are 438 nuclear plants currently in operation .
the majority are in industrialized nations - 104 in the us , 59 in france and 31 in russia .
how dangerous were the incidents ?
despite the recent slew of incidents at nuclear power stations , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said the errors in germany , sweden and japan were exceptions and certainly did not pose a danger .
that 's a view echoed by klaus kotthoff of the grs group , an independent nuclear assessment and research organization .
while there is no technology that 's free of errors , kotthoff pointed out that nuclear power plants are subject to a range of registration procedures and measures aimed at managing irregularities - as was the case at two nuclear plants in germany earlier this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire broke out last month at the krümmel nuclear plant near hamburg in germany " i believe these incidents were not noteworthy from a technical security point of view , " kotthoff said .
critics of nuclear energy , however , do n't buy the argument .
henrik paulitz of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- said the recent german incidents were dangerous .
" the reactor protection system was activated .
that only happens in serious cases , " paulitz said , adding that they were n't isolated cases .
there are several nuclear incidents in germany about which the public is not sufficiently informed , he said .
the information that is released is mostly " incomprehensible " and the controversial backgrounds are often concealed .
" serious security deficits are usually glossed over , " paulitz said .
experts split over nuclear safety experts remain divided about the safety of nuclear reactors .
while kotthoff said german plants are generally considered the safest , a 1997 study by the organization for economic cooperation and development ranked the german nuclear power station biblis b second to last in an international nuclear power plant comparison . only the maine yankee plant in the us fared worse , and it 's since been shut down .
but paulitz said other nuclear power stations too are n't much better .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is again debating whether to stick to a nuclear energy phase out " an unfortunate mixture of technical problems and human error can at any time cause a major nuclear meltdown anywhere , " he said .
the recent string of incidents comes at a time when nuclear energy seems to be undergoing somewhat of a revival .
considered one of the most cost-effective forms of generating electricity as prices of oil and gas rise , nuclear energy is largely favored by rapidly expanding economies in eastern europe and asia to meet their spiraling energy needs .
" the debates about climate change and reducing emissions also play a role here , " said alan mcdonald of the iaea .
" and naturally , it 's about securing production . "
nuclear energy plagued by problems nuclear energy production , however , remains problematic as most countries using nuclear energy need to import uranium .
according to the iaea , there are only 4.7 tons of economically viable uranium reserves worldwide .
given current levels of usage , experts believe stocks will only last for another 60 years .
that would mean that uranium would be depleted faster than oil and gas reserves .
experts also pointed to the unsolved problem of disposing nuclear waste , which remains radioactive for decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts estimate that uranium stocks will only last another 60 years paulitz said the environmental advantages of using nuclear energy are also limited since it only provides an estimated 1.2 percent of the world 's energy needs .
for nuclear energy to make a real difference in cutting greenhouse gas emissions , thousands of new reactors would have to be built , he said .
that is hardly possible given the nuclear industry 's low production capacity .
" it 's only about sustaining energy production on this low level and maintaining the technology - also because of interest in nuclear weapons , " paulitz said , adding that the world could easily do without this marginal energy source .
security poses biggest hurdle iaea 's mcdonald said that security issues increasingly pose the biggest hurdle when it comes to using nuclear energy .
the vienna-based nuclear watchdog has set up an entire department to explore ways of preventing the misuse of nuclear materials and terrorist attacks on reactors .
" terrorists who plant to blow up a nuclear reactor can do so with relatively easy means , " paulitz said .
" protecting against such attacks is just not possible . " ina rottscheidt -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

earlier this month , an earthquake caused leaks at a reactor in northwestern japan and led to low-level radiation , reviving fears about nuclear safety , and the closure of the brunsbüttel plant in germany followed a fire at another reactor close to hamburg .
around the world , there are 438 nuclear plants currently in operation .
the majority are in industrialized nations - 104 in the us , 59 in france and 31 in russia .
how dangerous were the incidents ?
despite the recent slew of incidents at nuclear power stations , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said the errors in germany , sweden and japan were exceptions and certainly did not pose a danger .
that 's a view echoed by klaus kotthoff of the grs group , an independent nuclear assessment and research organization .
while there is no technology that 's free of errors , kotthoff pointed out that nuclear power plants are subject to a range of registration procedures and measures aimed at managing irregularities - as was the case at two nuclear plants in germany earlier this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire broke out last month at the krümmel nuclear plant near hamburg in germany " i believe these incidents were not noteworthy from a technical security point of view , " kotthoff said .
critics of nuclear energy , however , do n't buy the argument .
henrik paulitz of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- said the recent german incidents were dangerous .
" the reactor protection system was activated .
that only happens in serious cases , " paulitz said , adding that they were n't isolated cases .
there are several nuclear incidents in germany about which the public is not sufficiently informed , he said .
the information that is released is mostly " incomprehensible " and the controversial backgrounds are often concealed .
" serious security deficits are usually glossed over , " paulitz said .
experts split over nuclear safety experts remain divided about the safety of nuclear reactors .
while kotthoff said german plants are generally considered the safest , a 1997 study by the organization for economic cooperation and development ranked the german nuclear power station biblis b second to last in an international nuclear power plant comparison . only the maine yankee plant in the us fared worse , and it 's since been shut down .
but paulitz said other nuclear power stations too are n't much better .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is again debating whether to stick to a nuclear energy phase out " an unfortunate mixture of technical problems and human error can at any time cause a major nuclear meltdown anywhere , " he said .
the recent string of incidents comes at a time when nuclear energy seems to be undergoing somewhat of a revival .
considered one of the most cost-effective forms of generating electricity as prices of oil and gas rise , nuclear energy is largely favored by rapidly expanding economies in eastern europe and asia to meet their spiraling energy needs .
" the debates about climate change and reducing emissions also play a role here , " said alan mcdonald of the iaea .
" and naturally , it 's about securing production . "
nuclear energy plagued by problems nuclear energy production , however , remains problematic as most countries using nuclear energy need to import uranium .
according to the iaea , there are only 4.7 tons of economically viable uranium reserves worldwide .
given current levels of usage , experts believe stocks will only last for another 60 years .
that would mean that uranium would be depleted faster than oil and gas reserves .
experts also pointed to the unsolved problem of disposing nuclear waste , which remains radioactive for decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts estimate that uranium stocks will only last another 60 years paulitz said the environmental advantages of using nuclear energy are also limited since it only provides an estimated 1.2 percent of the world 's energy needs .
for nuclear energy to make a real difference in cutting greenhouse gas emissions , thousands of new reactors would have to be built , he said .
that is hardly possible given the nuclear industry 's low production capacity .
" it 's only about sustaining energy production on this low level and maintaining the technology - also because of interest in nuclear weapons , " paulitz said , adding that the world could easily do without this marginal energy source .
security poses biggest hurdle iaea 's mcdonald said that security issues increasingly pose the biggest hurdle when it comes to using nuclear energy .
the vienna-based nuclear watchdog has set up an entire department to explore ways of preventing the misuse of nuclear materials and terrorist attacks on reactors .

rainer brüderle , deputy chairman of the fdp told mass market bild daily that china was " a successful hi-tech nation and not a developing country . "
the view was echoed by wolfgang bosbach of the cdu .
" the german government needs to examine whether it should continue paying development aid to china , " he said .
according to the news report , china will receive 67.5 million euros -lrb- $ 92.1 million -rrb- this year from the german ministry of economic cooperation and development .

german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul also stressed that development aid to china had been adapted to the country 's changing economic dynamics over the years .
" the funds by the german government are largely provided as loans with market conditions and are paid back by china , " the minister said .
china can now afford to fight poverty within its own borders on its own , wieczorek-zeul said .
she added that the bulk of current development money focused on boosting environmental protection as well as supporting legal and political reforms .
steg added that the former included promoting renewable energy and helping improve energy efficiency .
he pointed out that it " always results in renewed contracts for german companies . "
china is considered the world 's second biggest emitter of carbon dioxide , after the united states , and the biggest producer of sulfur dioxide .
chinese economy hurtles ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese exports are expected to soar by 20 percent this year the debate over putting the brakes on development aid to china follows the recent publication of statistics that show the asian country 's economy is galloping ahead at a rapid pace . it grew by 11.9 percent in the first quarter of this year , according to china 's national statistics bureau .
some experts say that if present economic growth rates are sustained , china could in five years replace germany as the world 's third largest economy after the us and japan , and other experts have said germany has already been knocked into fourth place .
china 's exports are expected to grow at an annual rate of 20 percent in 2007 and 2008 compared with 9 percent for german exports over the same period .

rainer brüderle , deputy chairman of the fdp told mass market bild daily that china was " a successful hi-tech nation and not a developing country . "
the view was echoed by wolfgang bosbach of the cdu .
" the german government needs to examine whether it should continue paying development aid to china , " he said .
according to the news report , china will receive 67.5 million euros -lrb- $ 92.1 million -rrb- this year from the german ministry of economic cooperation and development .
german government rejects demands the german government , however , has rejected the demands from the two politicians , saying the money that flowed to china this year was transferred within the framework of long-term and successful economic cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government says china can now tackle poverty within its borders itself " china does n't receive any development aid from germany , " thomas steg , a press spokesman for the government said in berlin .
" this cooperation is explicitly in german interests . "
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul also stressed that development aid to china had been adapted to the country 's changing economic dynamics over the years .
" the funds by the german government are largely provided as loans with market conditions and are paid back by china , " the minister said .
china can now afford to fight poverty within its own borders on its own , wieczorek-zeul said .
she added that the bulk of current development money focused on boosting environmental protection as well as supporting legal and political reforms .
steg added that the former included promoting renewable energy and helping improve energy efficiency .
he pointed out that it " always results in renewed contracts for german companies . "
china is considered the world 's second biggest emitter of carbon dioxide , after the united states , and the biggest producer of sulfur dioxide .

criminal charges could be next . two judges questioned villepin on friday morning about an attempt in 2003-2004 to discredit france 's current president , nicolas sarkozy , who was at the time a government minister and a political rival in the conservative ump party , in which both men as well as former french president jacques chirac were members .
the judges suspect villepin of involvement in the so-called clearstream affair , in which sarkozy 's name was wrongly linked to an illegal bank account in luxembourg .
the preliminary charges against him were for complicity to make false accusations , receiving stolen goods , breach of trust and complicity to use false documents .
villepin has denied breaking the law .
" i am anxious to restate this morning that at no point did i ask for an investigation into political figures , and at no moment did i partake in any political machination , " villepin said after being questioned on friday .
the affair started in 2003 when a list of clearstream bank-account holders surfaced who had allegedly received secret commissions from international arms sales .
the list , which included the names of sarkozy and other prominent politicians , was subsequently proven to be false .
chirac the mastermind ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac continues to claim presidential immunity experts retrieved documents from former intelligence chief philippe rondot 's computer two weeks ago that suggested villepin had instructed an associate , jean-louis gergorin , to leak the list to a judge to damage sarkozy 's reputation .
rondot had conducted a secret probe into the affair in 2004 .
the information on his laptop also indicated that then president chirac had initiated the smear campaign .
chirac has said he will not answer questions regarding the affair , claiming he remains protected by presidential immunity , a position legal experts are divided over .
earlier this month , gergorin , formerly the vice president of european aerospace company eads , admitted he wrote anonymous letters to justice officials smearing sarkozy .

criminal charges could be next . two judges questioned villepin on friday morning about an attempt in 2003-2004 to discredit france 's current president , nicolas sarkozy , who was at the time a government minister and a political rival in the conservative ump party , in which both men as well as former french president jacques chirac were members .
the judges suspect villepin of involvement in the so-called clearstream affair , in which sarkozy 's name was wrongly linked to an illegal bank account in luxembourg .
the preliminary charges against him were for complicity to make false accusations , receiving stolen goods , breach of trust and complicity to use false documents .
villepin has denied breaking the law .
" i am anxious to restate this morning that at no point did i ask for an investigation into political figures , and at no moment did i partake in any political machination , " villepin said after being questioned on friday .
the affair started in 2003 when a list of clearstream bank-account holders surfaced who had allegedly received secret commissions from international arms sales .
the list , which included the names of sarkozy and other prominent politicians , was subsequently proven to be false .
chirac the mastermind ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac continues to claim presidential immunity experts retrieved documents from former intelligence chief philippe rondot 's computer two weeks ago that suggested villepin had instructed an associate , jean-louis gergorin , to leak the list to a judge to damage sarkozy 's reputation .
rondot had conducted a secret probe into the affair in 2004 .
the information on his laptop also indicated that then president chirac had initiated the smear campaign .
chirac has said he will not answer questions regarding the affair , claiming he remains protected by presidential immunity , a position legal experts are divided over .
earlier this month , gergorin , formerly the vice president of european aerospace company eads , admitted he wrote anonymous letters to justice officials smearing sarkozy .
last year , sarkozy declared himself a civil plaintiff in the suit and said he was determined to find out who tried to undermine him . article based on news reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it foresees the building of a nuclear reactor in libya to supply drinking water from sea water .
german deputy foreign minister gernot erler condemned the deal , warning it was not just a bilateral matter and could damage german interests .
german interests at risk ?
" politically , this business is problematic , " erler told handelsblatt business daily .
" german interests are directly affected . "
erler was referring to german conglomerate siemens which has a 34-percent stake in framatome , a nuclear power joint venture it has with france 's areva , the world 's biggest maker of nuclear reactors .
areva is reported to supply the plant in libya .
the deal is also expected to offer areva access to libya 's vast energy resources .
libya is believed to have uranium stocks of 1,600 tons as well as unexploited reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder was the first german leader to visit libya in 2004 erler said germany had tried in the past to offer libya help with developing renewable energy , but said tripoli had failed to react .
he added that european security interests could be affected by the export of nuclear technology and that paris and berlin needed to discuss the issue .
" above all the risk of proliferation increases with every country using nuclear energy , " erler said .
in 2003 , libya agreed to halt a weapons program banned by the united nations , ending decades of international isolation .
in the following year , libya handed over its stocks of enriched uranium to the vienna-based nuclear watchdog , iaea .
" rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " sarkozy 's deal with gadhafi , which came just a day after tripoli handed over six foreign medics to bulgaria , has sparked criticism in europe and in france too .
daniel cohn-bendit , a german politician of the green party and a member of the european parliament described the deal as " ransom " paid by sarkozy to a " bloody dictator " for the release of the foreign medics .
in an interview with german station rtl , cohn-bendit said it was " absolutely mad " that sarkozy was " rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " with the nuclear treaty .
france 's opposition socialist party asked : " is it not a bit soon to be throwing ourselves into gadhafi 's arms and giving him our international endorsement ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya had imprisoned six foreign medics for eight years before releasing them last week the green party accused sarkozy of " boundless cynicism " rooted in the risk of striking a nuclear deal with an " undemocratic state . "
greenpeace france said the deal " poses an enormous problem in terms of nuclear proliferation " and branded it as " in keeping with the french policy of irresponsible export of nuclear technology . "
greenpeace pointed out that previous french presidents had signed nuclear deals with the former shah of iran , ex-iraqi dictator saddam hussein and with south africa during the apartheid era .
sarkozy insists deal will not lead to proliferation sarkozy however has defended france 's nuclear cooperation with libya , saying that a country which respects international laws can create a civilian nuclear industry .
" if you dare to say that civilian nuclear energy should be closed to the northern shore of the mediterranean and that the arab world is not responsible enough for civilian nuclear energy then you 're humiliating them and preparing for a clash of civilizations , " sarkozy told french paper le monde .
an official with france 's atomic energy commission -lrb- cea -rrb- insisted that international safeguards imposed after libya scrapped its military nuclear program would prevent any proliferation .
simon nisan told news agency afp international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- controls made it " almost impossible " to divert the technology to military use .
" the controls are so tight that you do n't have the right to remove the fuel without the presence of iaea inspectors , " he said . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

criminal charges could be next . two judges questioned villepin on friday morning about an attempt in 2003-2004 to discredit france 's current president , nicolas sarkozy , who was at the time a government minister and a political rival in the conservative ump party , in which both men as well as former french president jacques chirac were members .
the judges suspect villepin of involvement in the so-called clearstream affair , in which sarkozy 's name was wrongly linked to an illegal bank account in luxembourg .
the preliminary charges against him were for complicity to make false accusations , receiving stolen goods , breach of trust and complicity to use false documents .
villepin has denied breaking the law .
" i am anxious to restate this morning that at no point did i ask for an investigation into political figures , and at no moment did i partake in any political machination , " villepin said after being questioned on friday .
the affair started in 2003 when a list of clearstream bank-account holders surfaced who had allegedly received secret commissions from international arms sales .
the list , which included the names of sarkozy and other prominent politicians , was subsequently proven to be false .
chirac the mastermind ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac continues to claim presidential immunity experts retrieved documents from former intelligence chief philippe rondot 's computer two weeks ago that suggested villepin had instructed an associate , jean-louis gergorin , to leak the list to a judge to damage sarkozy 's reputation .
rondot had conducted a secret probe into the affair in 2004 .
the information on his laptop also indicated that then president chirac had initiated the smear campaign .
chirac has said he will not answer questions regarding the affair , claiming he remains protected by presidential immunity , a position legal experts are divided over .
earlier this month , gergorin , formerly the vice president of european aerospace company eads , admitted he wrote anonymous letters to justice officials smearing sarkozy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 27.07.2007 concerns mount over nuclear energy after series of scares großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sceptics say recent errors highlight the drawbacks of nuclear energy irregularities at nuclear reactors in germany and japan in recent weeks have rekindled safety fears and raised tough questions about nuclear energy amid increasing environmental concerns . the nuclear plant at brunsbüttel in the northern german state of schleswig-holstein is now the world 's safest .
it 's not surprising considering the reactor was shut down following a technical irregularity earlier this month .
the problem at brunsbüttel , one of 17 nuclear reactors in germany , is by no means the only mishap in recent months that has increasingly called the safety of atomic power into question .
earlier this month , an earthquake caused leaks at a reactor in northwestern japan and led to low-level radiation , reviving fears about nuclear safety , and the closure of the brunsbüttel plant in germany followed a fire at another reactor close to hamburg .
around the world , there are 438 nuclear plants currently in operation .
the majority are in industrialized nations - 104 in the us , 59 in france and 31 in russia .
how dangerous were the incidents ?
despite the recent slew of incidents at nuclear power stations , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said the errors in germany , sweden and japan were exceptions and certainly did not pose a danger .
that 's a view echoed by klaus kotthoff of the grs group , an independent nuclear assessment and research organization .
while there is no technology that 's free of errors , kotthoff pointed out that nuclear power plants are subject to a range of registration procedures and measures aimed at managing irregularities - as was the case at two nuclear plants in germany earlier this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire broke out last month at the krümmel nuclear plant near hamburg in germany " i believe these incidents were not noteworthy from a technical security point of view , " kotthoff said .
critics of nuclear energy , however , do n't buy the argument .
henrik paulitz of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- said the recent german incidents were dangerous .
" the reactor protection system was activated .
that only happens in serious cases , " paulitz said , adding that they were n't isolated cases .
there are several nuclear incidents in germany about which the public is not sufficiently informed , he said .
the information that is released is mostly " incomprehensible " and the controversial backgrounds are often concealed .
" serious security deficits are usually glossed over , " paulitz said .
experts split over nuclear safety experts remain divided about the safety of nuclear reactors .
while kotthoff said german plants are generally considered the safest , a 1997 study by the organization for economic cooperation and development ranked the german nuclear power station biblis b second to last in an international nuclear power plant comparison . only the maine yankee plant in the us fared worse , and it 's since been shut down .
but paulitz said other nuclear power stations too are n't much better .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is again debating whether to stick to a nuclear energy phase out " an unfortunate mixture of technical problems and human error can at any time cause a major nuclear meltdown anywhere , " he said .
the recent string of incidents comes at a time when nuclear energy seems to be undergoing somewhat of a revival .
considered one of the most cost-effective forms of generating electricity as prices of oil and gas rise , nuclear energy is largely favored by rapidly expanding economies in eastern europe and asia to meet their spiraling energy needs .
" the debates about climate change and reducing emissions also play a role here , " said alan mcdonald of the iaea .
" and naturally , it 's about securing production . "
nuclear energy plagued by problems nuclear energy production , however , remains problematic as most countries using nuclear energy need to import uranium .
according to the iaea , there are only 4.7 tons of economically viable uranium reserves worldwide .
given current levels of usage , experts believe stocks will only last for another 60 years .
that would mean that uranium would be depleted faster than oil and gas reserves .
experts also pointed to the unsolved problem of disposing nuclear waste , which remains radioactive for decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts estimate that uranium stocks will only last another 60 years paulitz said the environmental advantages of using nuclear energy are also limited since it only provides an estimated 1.2 percent of the world 's energy needs .
for nuclear energy to make a real difference in cutting greenhouse gas emissions , thousands of new reactors would have to be built , he said .
that is hardly possible given the nuclear industry 's low production capacity .
" it 's only about sustaining energy production on this low level and maintaining the technology - also because of interest in nuclear weapons , " paulitz said , adding that the world could easily do without this marginal energy source .
security poses biggest hurdle iaea 's mcdonald said that security issues increasingly pose the biggest hurdle when it comes to using nuclear energy .
the vienna-based nuclear watchdog has set up an entire department to explore ways of preventing the misuse of nuclear materials and terrorist attacks on reactors .
" terrorists who plant to blow up a nuclear reactor can do so with relatively easy means , " paulitz said .
" protecting against such attacks is just not possible . " ina rottscheidt -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's not surprising considering the reactor was shut down following a technical irregularity earlier this month .
the problem at brunsbüttel , one of 17 nuclear reactors in germany , is by no means the only mishap in recent months that has increasingly called the safety of atomic power into question .
earlier this month , an earthquake caused leaks at a reactor in northwestern japan and led to low-level radiation , reviving fears about nuclear safety , and the closure of the brunsbüttel plant in germany followed a fire at another reactor close to hamburg .
around the world , there are 438 nuclear plants currently in operation .
the majority are in industrialized nations - 104 in the us , 59 in france and 31 in russia .
how dangerous were the incidents ?
despite the recent slew of incidents at nuclear power stations , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said the errors in germany , sweden and japan were exceptions and certainly did not pose a danger .
that 's a view echoed by klaus kotthoff of the grs group , an independent nuclear assessment and research organization .
while there is no technology that 's free of errors , kotthoff pointed out that nuclear power plants are subject to a range of registration procedures and measures aimed at managing irregularities - as was the case at two nuclear plants in germany earlier this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire broke out last month at the krümmel nuclear plant near hamburg in germany " i believe these incidents were not noteworthy from a technical security point of view , " kotthoff said .
critics of nuclear energy , however , do n't buy the argument .
henrik paulitz of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- said the recent german incidents were dangerous .
" the reactor protection system was activated .
that only happens in serious cases , " paulitz said , adding that they were n't isolated cases .
there are several nuclear incidents in germany about which the public is not sufficiently informed , he said .
the information that is released is mostly " incomprehensible " and the controversial backgrounds are often concealed .
" serious security deficits are usually glossed over , " paulitz said .
experts split over nuclear safety experts remain divided about the safety of nuclear reactors .
while kotthoff said german plants are generally considered the safest , a 1997 study by the organization for economic cooperation and development ranked the german nuclear power station biblis b second to last in an international nuclear power plant comparison . only the maine yankee plant in the us fared worse , and it 's since been shut down .
but paulitz said other nuclear power stations too are n't much better .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is again debating whether to stick to a nuclear energy phase out " an unfortunate mixture of technical problems and human error can at any time cause a major nuclear meltdown anywhere , " he said .
the recent string of incidents comes at a time when nuclear energy seems to be undergoing somewhat of a revival .
considered one of the most cost-effective forms of generating electricity as prices of oil and gas rise , nuclear energy is largely favored by rapidly expanding economies in eastern europe and asia to meet their spiraling energy needs .
" the debates about climate change and reducing emissions also play a role here , " said alan mcdonald of the iaea .
" and naturally , it 's about securing production . "
nuclear energy plagued by problems nuclear energy production , however , remains problematic as most countries using nuclear energy need to import uranium .
according to the iaea , there are only 4.7 tons of economically viable uranium reserves worldwide .
given current levels of usage , experts believe stocks will only last for another 60 years .
that would mean that uranium would be depleted faster than oil and gas reserves .
experts also pointed to the unsolved problem of disposing nuclear waste , which remains radioactive for decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts estimate that uranium stocks will only last another 60 years paulitz said the environmental advantages of using nuclear energy are also limited since it only provides an estimated 1.2 percent of the world 's energy needs .
for nuclear energy to make a real difference in cutting greenhouse gas emissions , thousands of new reactors would have to be built , he said .
that is hardly possible given the nuclear industry 's low production capacity .
" it 's only about sustaining energy production on this low level and maintaining the technology - also because of interest in nuclear weapons , " paulitz said , adding that the world could easily do without this marginal energy source .
security poses biggest hurdle iaea 's mcdonald said that security issues increasingly pose the biggest hurdle when it comes to using nuclear energy .
the vienna-based nuclear watchdog has set up an entire department to explore ways of preventing the misuse of nuclear materials and terrorist attacks on reactors .
" terrorists who plant to blow up a nuclear reactor can do so with relatively easy means , " paulitz said .

rainer brüderle , deputy chairman of the fdp told mass market bild daily that china was " a successful hi-tech nation and not a developing country . "
the view was echoed by wolfgang bosbach of the cdu .
" the german government needs to examine whether it should continue paying development aid to china , " he said .
according to the news report , china will receive 67.5 million euros -lrb- $ 92.1 million -rrb- this year from the german ministry of economic cooperation and development .
german government rejects demands the german government , however , has rejected the demands from the two politicians , saying the money that flowed to china this year was transferred within the framework of long-term and successful economic cooperation .

german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul also stressed that development aid to china had been adapted to the country 's changing economic dynamics over the years .
" the funds by the german government are largely provided as loans with market conditions and are paid back by china , " the minister said .
china can now afford to fight poverty within its own borders on its own , wieczorek-zeul said .
she added that the bulk of current development money focused on boosting environmental protection as well as supporting legal and political reforms .
steg added that the former included promoting renewable energy and helping improve energy efficiency .
he pointed out that it " always results in renewed contracts for german companies . "
china is considered the world 's second biggest emitter of carbon dioxide , after the united states , and the biggest producer of sulfur dioxide .

it foresees the building of a nuclear reactor in libya to supply drinking water from sea water .
german deputy foreign minister gernot erler condemned the deal , warning it was not just a bilateral matter and could damage german interests .
german interests at risk ?
" politically , this business is problematic , " erler told handelsblatt business daily .
" german interests are directly affected . "
erler was referring to german conglomerate siemens which has a 34-percent stake in framatome , a nuclear power joint venture it has with france 's areva , the world 's biggest maker of nuclear reactors .
areva is reported to supply the plant in libya .
the deal is also expected to offer areva access to libya 's vast energy resources .
libya is believed to have uranium stocks of 1,600 tons as well as unexploited reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder was the first german leader to visit libya in 2004 erler said germany had tried in the past to offer libya help with developing renewable energy , but said tripoli had failed to react .
he added that european security interests could be affected by the export of nuclear technology and that paris and berlin needed to discuss the issue .
" above all the risk of proliferation increases with every country using nuclear energy , " erler said .
in 2003 , libya agreed to halt a weapons program banned by the united nations , ending decades of international isolation .
in the following year , libya handed over its stocks of enriched uranium to the vienna-based nuclear watchdog , iaea .
" rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " sarkozy 's deal with gadhafi , which came just a day after tripoli handed over six foreign medics to bulgaria , has sparked criticism in europe and in france too .
daniel cohn-bendit , a german politician of the green party and a member of the european parliament described the deal as " ransom " paid by sarkozy to a " bloody dictator " for the release of the foreign medics .
in an interview with german station rtl , cohn-bendit said it was " absolutely mad " that sarkozy was " rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " with the nuclear treaty .
france 's opposition socialist party asked : " is it not a bit soon to be throwing ourselves into gadhafi 's arms and giving him our international endorsement ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya had imprisoned six foreign medics for eight years before releasing them last week the green party accused sarkozy of " boundless cynicism " rooted in the risk of striking a nuclear deal with an " undemocratic state . "
greenpeace france said the deal " poses an enormous problem in terms of nuclear proliferation " and branded it as " in keeping with the french policy of irresponsible export of nuclear technology . "
greenpeace pointed out that previous french presidents had signed nuclear deals with the former shah of iran , ex-iraqi dictator saddam hussein and with south africa during the apartheid era .
sarkozy insists deal will not lead to proliferation sarkozy however has defended france 's nuclear cooperation with libya , saying that a country which respects international laws can create a civilian nuclear industry .
" if you dare to say that civilian nuclear energy should be closed to the northern shore of the mediterranean and that the arab world is not responsible enough for civilian nuclear energy then you 're humiliating them and preparing for a clash of civilizations , " sarkozy told french paper le monde .
an official with france 's atomic energy commission -lrb- cea -rrb- insisted that international safeguards imposed after libya scrapped its military nuclear program would prevent any proliferation .
simon nisan told news agency afp international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- controls made it " almost impossible " to divert the technology to military use .
" the controls are so tight that you do n't have the right to remove the fuel without the presence of iaea inspectors , " he said . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rainer brüderle , deputy chairman of the fdp told mass market bild daily that china was " a successful hi-tech nation and not a developing country . "
the view was echoed by wolfgang bosbach of the cdu .
" the german government needs to examine whether it should continue paying development aid to china , " he said .
according to the news report , china will receive 67.5 million euros -lrb- $ 92.1 million -rrb- this year from the german ministry of economic cooperation and development .
german government rejects demands the german government , however , has rejected the demands from the two politicians , saying the money that flowed to china this year was transferred within the framework of long-term and successful economic cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government says china can now tackle poverty within its borders itself " china does n't receive any development aid from germany , " thomas steg , a press spokesman for the government said in berlin .
" this cooperation is explicitly in german interests . "
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul also stressed that development aid to china had been adapted to the country 's changing economic dynamics over the years .
" the funds by the german government are largely provided as loans with market conditions and are paid back by china , " the minister said .
china can now afford to fight poverty within its own borders on its own , wieczorek-zeul said .
she added that the bulk of current development money focused on boosting environmental protection as well as supporting legal and political reforms .
steg added that the former included promoting renewable energy and helping improve energy efficiency .
he pointed out that it " always results in renewed contracts for german companies . "
china is considered the world 's second biggest emitter of carbon dioxide , after the united states , and the biggest producer of sulfur dioxide .
chinese economy hurtles ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese exports are expected to soar by 20 percent this year the debate over putting the brakes on development aid to china follows the recent publication of statistics that show the asian country 's economy is galloping ahead at a rapid pace . it grew by 11.9 percent in the first quarter of this year , according to china 's national statistics bureau .
some experts say that if present economic growth rates are sustained , china could in five years replace germany as the world 's third largest economy after the us and japan , and other experts have said germany has already been knocked into fourth place .
china 's exports are expected to grow at an annual rate of 20 percent in 2007 and 2008 compared with 9 percent for german exports over the same period .

she 's called for her country to strengthen its diplomatic , economic and cultural presence in that part of the country . roth traveled to northern iraq this week to meet with top politicians and human rights activists and to get a feel for the security situation in the war-torn region .
she met with iraqi president jalal talabani , who asked that germany be more involved in iraq 's north , roth told german media outlets on friday . " germany has to take a new role , " she told german public broadcaster ard on friday .
" i expect the german government to be diplomatically , economically and politically present in kurdistan . " roth said germany should be more strongly engaged in the kurdish region and pointed out that other european union countries , including italy , great britain , france and the czech republic , were taking part in rebuilding efforts and cultural projects in northern iraq . though the autonomous northern part of the country is relatively calm compared to the rest of iraq , where suicide bombings are a regular occurrence , roth 's five-day trip to the region was the first visit from a german parliamentary delegation to the country since the us-led invasion began in 2003 . german military not in iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roth , left , wants to increase the german presence in iraq under then chancellor gerhard schröder , germany refused to take part in the us-led war in iraq and currently does not have a military presence in the country .
germany has participated in helping train iraqi military , but the program is conducted in germany and gulf countries . the opposition green party - which has pacifist roots and has traditionally spoken out against germany becoming involved in foreign military matters - was among the most vocal opponents to germany 's involvement in the us military campaigns in afghanistan and iraq . northern iraq critical to country 's stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has not taken part in the us-led war in iraq greens security expert winfried nachtwei said he viewed the situation in northern iraq to be relatively safe . " it seems to me that the situation is much , much more stable than in the north of afghanistan , " he said . germany has some 3,000 soldiers stationed in afghanistan , nearly all of whom are in the north , as part of international security forces in the country .
while members of the greens are divided on whether to extend bundeswehr mandates in afghanistan , nachtwei said it was right for germany not to become involved in the iraq war . the german foreign ministry has issued a general warning for all german nationals to leave iraq , including those in the country 's north .
it 's a warning roth said she does n't understand . " for me it is totally incomprehensible why there is neither diplomatic representation nor an attempt to support the capabilities of the people here through cultural exchange , such as setting up german schools , " she said , adding that many of politicians she met had lived in germany in the past and requested german involvement in afghanistan . returning refugees to iraq " shameless " germany is particularly interested in northern iraq because many german asylum-seekers come from the area .
roth pointed out that currently , people from the kurdish region must travel to baghdad or the turkish capital of ankara to get a visa to travel to germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern iraq is not experience violence on the same scale as baghdad many iraqi asylum seekers in germany have had a difficult time meeting requirements to become legal residents of germany and face deportation .
roth warned against programs that send iraqi refugees back to the war-torn country , calling them " rather shameless . " " that is not a constructive to the rebuilding efforts ; it 's absolutely destructive , " she said in an interview with deutschlandfunk radio . human rights watch recently criticized a german plan to strip iraqi refugees in germany of their status as asylum seekers .

she 's called for her country to strengthen its diplomatic , economic and cultural presence in that part of the country . roth traveled to northern iraq this week to meet with top politicians and human rights activists and to get a feel for the security situation in the war-torn region .
she met with iraqi president jalal talabani , who asked that germany be more involved in iraq 's north , roth told german media outlets on friday . " germany has to take a new role , " she told german public broadcaster ard on friday .
" i expect the german government to be diplomatically , economically and politically present in kurdistan . " roth said germany should be more strongly engaged in the kurdish region and pointed out that other european union countries , including italy , great britain , france and the czech republic , were taking part in rebuilding efforts and cultural projects in northern iraq . though the autonomous northern part of the country is relatively calm compared to the rest of iraq , where suicide bombings are a regular occurrence , roth 's five-day trip to the region was the first visit from a german parliamentary delegation to the country since the us-led invasion began in 2003 . german military not in iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roth , left , wants to increase the german presence in iraq under then chancellor gerhard schröder , germany refused to take part in the us-led war in iraq and currently does not have a military presence in the country .

while members of the greens are divided on whether to extend bundeswehr mandates in afghanistan , nachtwei said it was right for germany not to become involved in the iraq war . the german foreign ministry has issued a general warning for all german nationals to leave iraq , including those in the country 's north .
it 's a warning roth said she does n't understand . " for me it is totally incomprehensible why there is neither diplomatic representation nor an attempt to support the capabilities of the people here through cultural exchange , such as setting up german schools , " she said , adding that many of politicians she met had lived in germany in the past and requested german involvement in afghanistan . returning refugees to iraq " shameless " germany is particularly interested in northern iraq because many german asylum-seekers come from the area .

it 's not surprising considering the reactor was shut down following a technical irregularity earlier this month .
the problem at brunsbüttel , one of 17 nuclear reactors in germany , is by no means the only mishap in recent months that has increasingly called the safety of atomic power into question .
earlier this month , an earthquake caused leaks at a reactor in northwestern japan and led to low-level radiation , reviving fears about nuclear safety , and the closure of the brunsbüttel plant in germany followed a fire at another reactor close to hamburg .
around the world , there are 438 nuclear plants currently in operation .
the majority are in industrialized nations - 104 in the us , 59 in france and 31 in russia .
how dangerous were the incidents ?
despite the recent slew of incidents at nuclear power stations , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said the errors in germany , sweden and japan were exceptions and certainly did not pose a danger .
that 's a view echoed by klaus kotthoff of the grs group , an independent nuclear assessment and research organization .
while there is no technology that 's free of errors , kotthoff pointed out that nuclear power plants are subject to a range of registration procedures and measures aimed at managing irregularities - as was the case at two nuclear plants in germany earlier this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire broke out last month at the krümmel nuclear plant near hamburg in germany " i believe these incidents were not noteworthy from a technical security point of view , " kotthoff said .
critics of nuclear energy , however , do n't buy the argument .
henrik paulitz of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- said the recent german incidents were dangerous .
" the reactor protection system was activated .
that only happens in serious cases , " paulitz said , adding that they were n't isolated cases .
there are several nuclear incidents in germany about which the public is not sufficiently informed , he said .
the information that is released is mostly " incomprehensible " and the controversial backgrounds are often concealed .
" serious security deficits are usually glossed over , " paulitz said .
experts split over nuclear safety experts remain divided about the safety of nuclear reactors .
while kotthoff said german plants are generally considered the safest , a 1997 study by the organization for economic cooperation and development ranked the german nuclear power station biblis b second to last in an international nuclear power plant comparison . only the maine yankee plant in the us fared worse , and it 's since been shut down .
but paulitz said other nuclear power stations too are n't much better .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is again debating whether to stick to a nuclear energy phase out " an unfortunate mixture of technical problems and human error can at any time cause a major nuclear meltdown anywhere , " he said .
the recent string of incidents comes at a time when nuclear energy seems to be undergoing somewhat of a revival .
considered one of the most cost-effective forms of generating electricity as prices of oil and gas rise , nuclear energy is largely favored by rapidly expanding economies in eastern europe and asia to meet their spiraling energy needs .
" the debates about climate change and reducing emissions also play a role here , " said alan mcdonald of the iaea .
" and naturally , it 's about securing production . "
nuclear energy plagued by problems nuclear energy production , however , remains problematic as most countries using nuclear energy need to import uranium .
according to the iaea , there are only 4.7 tons of economically viable uranium reserves worldwide .
given current levels of usage , experts believe stocks will only last for another 60 years .
that would mean that uranium would be depleted faster than oil and gas reserves .
experts also pointed to the unsolved problem of disposing nuclear waste , which remains radioactive for decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts estimate that uranium stocks will only last another 60 years paulitz said the environmental advantages of using nuclear energy are also limited since it only provides an estimated 1.2 percent of the world 's energy needs .
for nuclear energy to make a real difference in cutting greenhouse gas emissions , thousands of new reactors would have to be built , he said .
that is hardly possible given the nuclear industry 's low production capacity .
" it 's only about sustaining energy production on this low level and maintaining the technology - also because of interest in nuclear weapons , " paulitz said , adding that the world could easily do without this marginal energy source .
security poses biggest hurdle iaea 's mcdonald said that security issues increasingly pose the biggest hurdle when it comes to using nuclear energy .
the vienna-based nuclear watchdog has set up an entire department to explore ways of preventing the misuse of nuclear materials and terrorist attacks on reactors .
" terrorists who plant to blow up a nuclear reactor can do so with relatively easy means , " paulitz said .
" protecting against such attacks is just not possible . " ina rottscheidt -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it foresees the building of a nuclear reactor in libya to supply drinking water from sea water .
german deputy foreign minister gernot erler condemned the deal , warning it was not just a bilateral matter and could damage german interests .
german interests at risk ?
" politically , this business is problematic , " erler told handelsblatt business daily .
" german interests are directly affected . "
erler was referring to german conglomerate siemens which has a 34-percent stake in framatome , a nuclear power joint venture it has with france 's areva , the world 's biggest maker of nuclear reactors .
areva is reported to supply the plant in libya .
the deal is also expected to offer areva access to libya 's vast energy resources .
libya is believed to have uranium stocks of 1,600 tons as well as unexploited reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder was the first german leader to visit libya in 2004 erler said germany had tried in the past to offer libya help with developing renewable energy , but said tripoli had failed to react .
he added that european security interests could be affected by the export of nuclear technology and that paris and berlin needed to discuss the issue .
" above all the risk of proliferation increases with every country using nuclear energy , " erler said .
in 2003 , libya agreed to halt a weapons program banned by the united nations , ending decades of international isolation .
in the following year , libya handed over its stocks of enriched uranium to the vienna-based nuclear watchdog , iaea .
" rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " sarkozy 's deal with gadhafi , which came just a day after tripoli handed over six foreign medics to bulgaria , has sparked criticism in europe and in france too .
daniel cohn-bendit , a german politician of the green party and a member of the european parliament described the deal as " ransom " paid by sarkozy to a " bloody dictator " for the release of the foreign medics .
in an interview with german station rtl , cohn-bendit said it was " absolutely mad " that sarkozy was " rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " with the nuclear treaty .
france 's opposition socialist party asked : " is it not a bit soon to be throwing ourselves into gadhafi 's arms and giving him our international endorsement ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya had imprisoned six foreign medics for eight years before releasing them last week the green party accused sarkozy of " boundless cynicism " rooted in the risk of striking a nuclear deal with an " undemocratic state . "

greenpeace pointed out that previous french presidents had signed nuclear deals with the former shah of iran , ex-iraqi dictator saddam hussein and with south africa during the apartheid era .
sarkozy insists deal will not lead to proliferation sarkozy however has defended france 's nuclear cooperation with libya , saying that a country which respects international laws can create a civilian nuclear industry .

it foresees the building of a nuclear reactor in libya to supply drinking water from sea water .
german deputy foreign minister gernot erler condemned the deal , warning it was not just a bilateral matter and could damage german interests .
german interests at risk ?
" politically , this business is problematic , " erler told handelsblatt business daily .
" german interests are directly affected . "
erler was referring to german conglomerate siemens which has a 34-percent stake in framatome , a nuclear power joint venture it has with france 's areva , the world 's biggest maker of nuclear reactors .
areva is reported to supply the plant in libya .
the deal is also expected to offer areva access to libya 's vast energy resources .
libya is believed to have uranium stocks of 1,600 tons as well as unexploited reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder was the first german leader to visit libya in 2004 erler said germany had tried in the past to offer libya help with developing renewable energy , but said tripoli had failed to react .
he added that european security interests could be affected by the export of nuclear technology and that paris and berlin needed to discuss the issue .
" above all the risk of proliferation increases with every country using nuclear energy , " erler said .
in 2003 , libya agreed to halt a weapons program banned by the united nations , ending decades of international isolation .
in the following year , libya handed over its stocks of enriched uranium to the vienna-based nuclear watchdog , iaea .
" rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " sarkozy 's deal with gadhafi , which came just a day after tripoli handed over six foreign medics to bulgaria , has sparked criticism in europe and in france too .
daniel cohn-bendit , a german politician of the green party and a member of the european parliament described the deal as " ransom " paid by sarkozy to a " bloody dictator " for the release of the foreign medics .
in an interview with german station rtl , cohn-bendit said it was " absolutely mad " that sarkozy was " rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " with the nuclear treaty .

" the consumer climate showed stability at a strong level in july , " the gfk said , " with income expectations and buying propensity almost matching the record figures of the previous month . "
indictors show that germans expect incomes to continue rising and are therefore prepared to buy more goods , it said .
" with consumers in the mood to spend even more , retailers can hope to achieve higher sales in the second half of 2007 , " the gfk added .
caution creeps in but economic expectations were slightly more cautious , following the euphoria that led to an all-time high for the economic outlook indicator in may .
this was because rising interest rates , high energy prices and a strong euro triggered fears that the current dynamic growth in the german economy might start slowing down , the gfk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retailers can expect good sales for the rest of the year " german consumers do not believe that the current high growth rate of the economy can be maintained at quite the same level and expect the upturn to slow down over the coming months , " it said .
" if the euro continues to be valued at the present high level or even higher , this may impact negatively on export prospects in the medium term , which have been the key driver of the strong economy to date . "
losing momentum ?
however , the favorable trend on the labor market and expected future income growth largely compensated for these risks , the survey showed .
the survey was published a day after another key indicator , the ifo business climate index , showed business sentiment in germany dipped slightly in july .
higher oil prices , rising interest rates and a strong euro have fuelled fears that the german economy might lose momentum after posting a 2.8 percent growth rate in 2006 .
many economists project growth in 2007 would match or possibly surpass last year 's level but feel it might slip back towards 2 percent in 2008 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

criminal charges could be next . two judges questioned villepin on friday morning about an attempt in 2003-2004 to discredit france 's current president , nicolas sarkozy , who was at the time a government minister and a political rival in the conservative ump party , in which both men as well as former french president jacques chirac were members .
the judges suspect villepin of involvement in the so-called clearstream affair , in which sarkozy 's name was wrongly linked to an illegal bank account in luxembourg .
the preliminary charges against him were for complicity to make false accusations , receiving stolen goods , breach of trust and complicity to use false documents .
villepin has denied breaking the law .
" i am anxious to restate this morning that at no point did i ask for an investigation into political figures , and at no moment did i partake in any political machination , " villepin said after being questioned on friday .
the affair started in 2003 when a list of clearstream bank-account holders surfaced who had allegedly received secret commissions from international arms sales .
the list , which included the names of sarkozy and other prominent politicians , was subsequently proven to be false .

rondot had conducted a secret probe into the affair in 2004 .
the information on his laptop also indicated that then president chirac had initiated the smear campaign .
chirac has said he will not answer questions regarding the affair , claiming he remains protected by presidential immunity , a position legal experts are divided over .

she 's called for her country to strengthen its diplomatic , economic and cultural presence in that part of the country . roth traveled to northern iraq this week to meet with top politicians and human rights activists and to get a feel for the security situation in the war-torn region .
she met with iraqi president jalal talabani , who asked that germany be more involved in iraq 's north , roth told german media outlets on friday . " germany has to take a new role , " she told german public broadcaster ard on friday .
" i expect the german government to be diplomatically , economically and politically present in kurdistan . " roth said germany should be more strongly engaged in the kurdish region and pointed out that other european union countries , including italy , great britain , france and the czech republic , were taking part in rebuilding efforts and cultural projects in northern iraq . though the autonomous northern part of the country is relatively calm compared to the rest of iraq , where suicide bombings are a regular occurrence , roth 's five-day trip to the region was the first visit from a german parliamentary delegation to the country since the us-led invasion began in 2003 . german military not in iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roth , left , wants to increase the german presence in iraq under then chancellor gerhard schröder , germany refused to take part in the us-led war in iraq and currently does not have a military presence in the country .
germany has participated in helping train iraqi military , but the program is conducted in germany and gulf countries . the opposition green party - which has pacifist roots and has traditionally spoken out against germany becoming involved in foreign military matters - was among the most vocal opponents to germany 's involvement in the us military campaigns in afghanistan and iraq . northern iraq critical to country 's stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has not taken part in the us-led war in iraq greens security expert winfried nachtwei said he viewed the situation in northern iraq to be relatively safe . " it seems to me that the situation is much , much more stable than in the north of afghanistan , " he said . germany has some 3,000 soldiers stationed in afghanistan , nearly all of whom are in the north , as part of international security forces in the country .
while members of the greens are divided on whether to extend bundeswehr mandates in afghanistan , nachtwei said it was right for germany not to become involved in the iraq war . the german foreign ministry has issued a general warning for all german nationals to leave iraq , including those in the country 's north .
it 's a warning roth said she does n't understand . " for me it is totally incomprehensible why there is neither diplomatic representation nor an attempt to support the capabilities of the people here through cultural exchange , such as setting up german schools , " she said , adding that many of politicians she met had lived in germany in the past and requested german involvement in afghanistan . returning refugees to iraq " shameless " germany is particularly interested in northern iraq because many german asylum-seekers come from the area .
roth pointed out that currently , people from the kurdish region must travel to baghdad or the turkish capital of ankara to get a visa to travel to germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern iraq is not experience violence on the same scale as baghdad many iraqi asylum seekers in germany have had a difficult time meeting requirements to become legal residents of germany and face deportation .
roth warned against programs that send iraqi refugees back to the war-torn country , calling them " rather shameless . " " that is not a constructive to the rebuilding efforts ; it 's absolutely destructive , " she said in an interview with deutschlandfunk radio . human rights watch recently criticized a german plan to strip iraqi refugees in germany of their status as asylum seekers .
besides meeting talabani , roth also met with massud barsani , who is the head of the kurdish area , as well as human rights activists and un representatives . article based on news reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

intel denied the charges friday . the european commission said sent a " statement of objections " to intel on thursday alleging that it tried to exclude competitor advanced micro devices inc .
-lrb- amd -rrb- from the market .
intel could face fines if it is found guilty of infringing on eu antitrust rules .
intel has abused its dominant market position , the european union statement said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most computers have intel inside the eu said intel gave computer makers " substantial rebates " for buying their x86 cpus from intel .
they were allegedly offered below cost to strategic customers , such as governments and universities , according to the eu statement .
intel also allegedly paid manufacturers to delay or cancel product lines which used amd chips .
" the rebates offered by intel were of such a quantity and such an amount that an efficient competitor would be forced to price below cost , " european commission spokesman ton van lierop told reuters .
" we think that would be bad for competition and bad for consumers . "
the eu said below-cost or predatory pricing may be good for consumers in the short term , but is ultimately harmful because it kills off competition , which offers more choice and innovation in the long term .
intel dominates world chip market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chip making or deal making ?
intel replied that its conduct has been lawful , good for competition and beneficial to customers .
" we are confident that the microprocessor market segment is functioning normally and that intel 's conduct has been lawful , pro-competitive , and beneficial to consumers , " intel 's general counsel bruce sewell said .
intel controls 80 percent of the global market for the central processing units , or cpus .
the rest are made by amd .
focusing on price amd spokesman jens drews said pc manufacturers operate on thin margins and intel 's loyalty rebates have forced amd to focus on price rather than performance .
" their financial strength is poisoning the industry , " drews was quoted as saying by the associated press .
" what we see is that we have not been competing on a level playing field . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amd says chip quality has suffered from price wars intel has 10 weeks to reply to the statement and will then have the right to a hearing with eu regulators .
intel will face a fine if the commission finds it has engaged in anti-competitive conduct .
but most cases take several years before they are settled .
intel 's sewell said he 's awaiting a ruling on the microsoft case .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 27.07.2007 german consumers in the mood to spend großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are feeling good about spending money declining unemployment and a robust economy continue to generate consumer confidence in germany , a key indicator showed friday . the consumer climate forecast by the nuremberg-based gfk market research organization improved slightly from a revised 8.5 points in july to 8.7 points in august .
" the consumer climate showed stability at a strong level in july , " the gfk said , " with income expectations and buying propensity almost matching the record figures of the previous month . "
indictors show that germans expect incomes to continue rising and are therefore prepared to buy more goods , it said .
" with consumers in the mood to spend even more , retailers can hope to achieve higher sales in the second half of 2007 , " the gfk added .
caution creeps in but economic expectations were slightly more cautious , following the euphoria that led to an all-time high for the economic outlook indicator in may .
this was because rising interest rates , high energy prices and a strong euro triggered fears that the current dynamic growth in the german economy might start slowing down , the gfk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retailers can expect good sales for the rest of the year " german consumers do not believe that the current high growth rate of the economy can be maintained at quite the same level and expect the upturn to slow down over the coming months , " it said .
" if the euro continues to be valued at the present high level or even higher , this may impact negatively on export prospects in the medium term , which have been the key driver of the strong economy to date . "
losing momentum ?
however , the favorable trend on the labor market and expected future income growth largely compensated for these risks , the survey showed .
the survey was published a day after another key indicator , the ifo business climate index , showed business sentiment in germany dipped slightly in july .
higher oil prices , rising interest rates and a strong euro have fuelled fears that the german economy might lose momentum after posting a 2.8 percent growth rate in 2006 .
many economists project growth in 2007 would match or possibly surpass last year 's level but feel it might slip back towards 2 percent in 2008 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the agreement to jointly use ... these interoperable civil signals demonstrates the close us and eu cooperation since 2004 to ensure that the global positioning system and galileo are compatible and interoperable at the user level , " said a european commission statement .
the european commission is hopeful that the agreement will help to ensure that galileo , which has yet to be launched , will be accepted alongside its popular rival , gps .

" the consumer climate showed stability at a strong level in july , " the gfk said , " with income expectations and buying propensity almost matching the record figures of the previous month . "
indictors show that germans expect incomes to continue rising and are therefore prepared to buy more goods , it said .
" with consumers in the mood to spend even more , retailers can hope to achieve higher sales in the second half of 2007 , " the gfk added .
caution creeps in but economic expectations were slightly more cautious , following the euphoria that led to an all-time high for the economic outlook indicator in may .
this was because rising interest rates , high energy prices and a strong euro triggered fears that the current dynamic growth in the german economy might start slowing down , the gfk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retailers can expect good sales for the rest of the year " german consumers do not believe that the current high growth rate of the economy can be maintained at quite the same level and expect the upturn to slow down over the coming months , " it said .
" if the euro continues to be valued at the present high level or even higher , this may impact negatively on export prospects in the medium term , which have been the key driver of the strong economy to date . "
losing momentum ?
however , the favorable trend on the labor market and expected future income growth largely compensated for these risks , the survey showed .
the survey was published a day after another key indicator , the ifo business climate index , showed business sentiment in germany dipped slightly in july .
higher oil prices , rising interest rates and a strong euro have fuelled fears that the german economy might lose momentum after posting a 2.8 percent growth rate in 2006 .
many economists project growth in 2007 would match or possibly surpass last year 's level but feel it might slip back towards 2 percent in 2008 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it foresees the building of a nuclear reactor in libya to supply drinking water from sea water .
german deputy foreign minister gernot erler condemned the deal , warning it was not just a bilateral matter and could damage german interests .
german interests at risk ?
" politically , this business is problematic , " erler told handelsblatt business daily .
" german interests are directly affected . "
erler was referring to german conglomerate siemens which has a 34-percent stake in framatome , a nuclear power joint venture it has with france 's areva , the world 's biggest maker of nuclear reactors .
areva is reported to supply the plant in libya .
the deal is also expected to offer areva access to libya 's vast energy resources .
libya is believed to have uranium stocks of 1,600 tons as well as unexploited reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder was the first german leader to visit libya in 2004 erler said germany had tried in the past to offer libya help with developing renewable energy , but said tripoli had failed to react .
he added that european security interests could be affected by the export of nuclear technology and that paris and berlin needed to discuss the issue .
" above all the risk of proliferation increases with every country using nuclear energy , " erler said .
in 2003 , libya agreed to halt a weapons program banned by the united nations , ending decades of international isolation .
in the following year , libya handed over its stocks of enriched uranium to the vienna-based nuclear watchdog , iaea .
" rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " sarkozy 's deal with gadhafi , which came just a day after tripoli handed over six foreign medics to bulgaria , has sparked criticism in europe and in france too .
daniel cohn-bendit , a german politician of the green party and a member of the european parliament described the deal as " ransom " paid by sarkozy to a " bloody dictator " for the release of the foreign medics .
in an interview with german station rtl , cohn-bendit said it was " absolutely mad " that sarkozy was " rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " with the nuclear treaty .
france 's opposition socialist party asked : " is it not a bit soon to be throwing ourselves into gadhafi 's arms and giving him our international endorsement ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya had imprisoned six foreign medics for eight years before releasing them last week the green party accused sarkozy of " boundless cynicism " rooted in the risk of striking a nuclear deal with an " undemocratic state . "
greenpeace france said the deal " poses an enormous problem in terms of nuclear proliferation " and branded it as " in keeping with the french policy of irresponsible export of nuclear technology . "
greenpeace pointed out that previous french presidents had signed nuclear deals with the former shah of iran , ex-iraqi dictator saddam hussein and with south africa during the apartheid era .
sarkozy insists deal will not lead to proliferation sarkozy however has defended france 's nuclear cooperation with libya , saying that a country which respects international laws can create a civilian nuclear industry .
" if you dare to say that civilian nuclear energy should be closed to the northern shore of the mediterranean and that the arab world is not responsible enough for civilian nuclear energy then you 're humiliating them and preparing for a clash of civilizations , " sarkozy told french paper le monde .

it foresees the building of a nuclear reactor in libya to supply drinking water from sea water .
german deputy foreign minister gernot erler condemned the deal , warning it was not just a bilateral matter and could damage german interests .
german interests at risk ?
" politically , this business is problematic , " erler told handelsblatt business daily .
" german interests are directly affected . "
erler was referring to german conglomerate siemens which has a 34-percent stake in framatome , a nuclear power joint venture it has with france 's areva , the world 's biggest maker of nuclear reactors .
areva is reported to supply the plant in libya .
the deal is also expected to offer areva access to libya 's vast energy resources .
libya is believed to have uranium stocks of 1,600 tons as well as unexploited reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder was the first german leader to visit libya in 2004 erler said germany had tried in the past to offer libya help with developing renewable energy , but said tripoli had failed to react .
he added that european security interests could be affected by the export of nuclear technology and that paris and berlin needed to discuss the issue .
" above all the risk of proliferation increases with every country using nuclear energy , " erler said .
in 2003 , libya agreed to halt a weapons program banned by the united nations , ending decades of international isolation .
in the following year , libya handed over its stocks of enriched uranium to the vienna-based nuclear watchdog , iaea .
" rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " sarkozy 's deal with gadhafi , which came just a day after tripoli handed over six foreign medics to bulgaria , has sparked criticism in europe and in france too .
daniel cohn-bendit , a german politician of the green party and a member of the european parliament described the deal as " ransom " paid by sarkozy to a " bloody dictator " for the release of the foreign medics .
in an interview with german station rtl , cohn-bendit said it was " absolutely mad " that sarkozy was " rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " with the nuclear treaty .
france 's opposition socialist party asked : " is it not a bit soon to be throwing ourselves into gadhafi 's arms and giving him our international endorsement ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya had imprisoned six foreign medics for eight years before releasing them last week the green party accused sarkozy of " boundless cynicism " rooted in the risk of striking a nuclear deal with an " undemocratic state . "
greenpeace france said the deal " poses an enormous problem in terms of nuclear proliferation " and branded it as " in keeping with the french policy of irresponsible export of nuclear technology . "
greenpeace pointed out that previous french presidents had signed nuclear deals with the former shah of iran , ex-iraqi dictator saddam hussein and with south africa during the apartheid era .
sarkozy insists deal will not lead to proliferation sarkozy however has defended france 's nuclear cooperation with libya , saying that a country which respects international laws can create a civilian nuclear industry .
" if you dare to say that civilian nuclear energy should be closed to the northern shore of the mediterranean and that the arab world is not responsible enough for civilian nuclear energy then you 're humiliating them and preparing for a clash of civilizations , " sarkozy told french paper le monde .

criminal charges could be next . two judges questioned villepin on friday morning about an attempt in 2003-2004 to discredit france 's current president , nicolas sarkozy , who was at the time a government minister and a political rival in the conservative ump party , in which both men as well as former french president jacques chirac were members .
the judges suspect villepin of involvement in the so-called clearstream affair , in which sarkozy 's name was wrongly linked to an illegal bank account in luxembourg .
the preliminary charges against him were for complicity to make false accusations , receiving stolen goods , breach of trust and complicity to use false documents .
villepin has denied breaking the law .
" i am anxious to restate this morning that at no point did i ask for an investigation into political figures , and at no moment did i partake in any political machination , " villepin said after being questioned on friday .
the affair started in 2003 when a list of clearstream bank-account holders surfaced who had allegedly received secret commissions from international arms sales .
the list , which included the names of sarkozy and other prominent politicians , was subsequently proven to be false .

rondot had conducted a secret probe into the affair in 2004 .
the information on his laptop also indicated that then president chirac had initiated the smear campaign .
chirac has said he will not answer questions regarding the affair , claiming he remains protected by presidential immunity , a position legal experts are divided over .

criminal charges could be next . two judges questioned villepin on friday morning about an attempt in 2003-2004 to discredit france 's current president , nicolas sarkozy , who was at the time a government minister and a political rival in the conservative ump party , in which both men as well as former french president jacques chirac were members .
the judges suspect villepin of involvement in the so-called clearstream affair , in which sarkozy 's name was wrongly linked to an illegal bank account in luxembourg .
the preliminary charges against him were for complicity to make false accusations , receiving stolen goods , breach of trust and complicity to use false documents .
villepin has denied breaking the law .
" i am anxious to restate this morning that at no point did i ask for an investigation into political figures , and at no moment did i partake in any political machination , " villepin said after being questioned on friday .
the affair started in 2003 when a list of clearstream bank-account holders surfaced who had allegedly received secret commissions from international arms sales .
the list , which included the names of sarkozy and other prominent politicians , was subsequently proven to be false .
chirac the mastermind ?

rondot had conducted a secret probe into the affair in 2004 .
the information on his laptop also indicated that then president chirac had initiated the smear campaign .
chirac has said he will not answer questions regarding the affair , claiming he remains protected by presidential immunity , a position legal experts are divided over .
earlier this month , gergorin , formerly the vice president of european aerospace company eads , admitted he wrote anonymous letters to justice officials smearing sarkozy .

" this cooperation is explicitly in german interests . "
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul also stressed that development aid to china had been adapted to the country 's changing economic dynamics over the years .
" the funds by the german government are largely provided as loans with market conditions and are paid back by china , " the minister said .
china can now afford to fight poverty within its own borders on its own , wieczorek-zeul said .
she added that the bulk of current development money focused on boosting environmental protection as well as supporting legal and political reforms .
steg added that the former included promoting renewable energy and helping improve energy efficiency .
he pointed out that it " always results in renewed contracts for german companies . "
china is considered the world 's second biggest emitter of carbon dioxide , after the united states , and the biggest producer of sulfur dioxide .

china 's exports are expected to grow at an annual rate of 20 percent in 2007 and 2008 compared with 9 percent for german exports over the same period .
in 2005 , china surpassed britain to become the world 's fourth largest economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 27.07.2007 concerns mount over nuclear energy after series of scares großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sceptics say recent errors highlight the drawbacks of nuclear energy irregularities at nuclear reactors in germany and japan in recent weeks have rekindled safety fears and raised tough questions about nuclear energy amid increasing environmental concerns . the nuclear plant at brunsbüttel in the northern german state of schleswig-holstein is now the world 's safest .
it 's not surprising considering the reactor was shut down following a technical irregularity earlier this month .
the problem at brunsbüttel , one of 17 nuclear reactors in germany , is by no means the only mishap in recent months that has increasingly called the safety of atomic power into question .
earlier this month , an earthquake caused leaks at a reactor in northwestern japan and led to low-level radiation , reviving fears about nuclear safety , and the closure of the brunsbüttel plant in germany followed a fire at another reactor close to hamburg .
around the world , there are 438 nuclear plants currently in operation .
the majority are in industrialized nations - 104 in the us , 59 in france and 31 in russia .
how dangerous were the incidents ?
despite the recent slew of incidents at nuclear power stations , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said the errors in germany , sweden and japan were exceptions and certainly did not pose a danger .
that 's a view echoed by klaus kotthoff of the grs group , an independent nuclear assessment and research organization .
while there is no technology that 's free of errors , kotthoff pointed out that nuclear power plants are subject to a range of registration procedures and measures aimed at managing irregularities - as was the case at two nuclear plants in germany earlier this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire broke out last month at the krümmel nuclear plant near hamburg in germany " i believe these incidents were not noteworthy from a technical security point of view , " kotthoff said .
critics of nuclear energy , however , do n't buy the argument .
henrik paulitz of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- said the recent german incidents were dangerous .
" the reactor protection system was activated .
that only happens in serious cases , " paulitz said , adding that they were n't isolated cases .
there are several nuclear incidents in germany about which the public is not sufficiently informed , he said .
the information that is released is mostly " incomprehensible " and the controversial backgrounds are often concealed .
" serious security deficits are usually glossed over , " paulitz said .
experts split over nuclear safety experts remain divided about the safety of nuclear reactors .
while kotthoff said german plants are generally considered the safest , a 1997 study by the organization for economic cooperation and development ranked the german nuclear power station biblis b second to last in an international nuclear power plant comparison . only the maine yankee plant in the us fared worse , and it 's since been shut down .
but paulitz said other nuclear power stations too are n't much better .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is again debating whether to stick to a nuclear energy phase out " an unfortunate mixture of technical problems and human error can at any time cause a major nuclear meltdown anywhere , " he said .
the recent string of incidents comes at a time when nuclear energy seems to be undergoing somewhat of a revival .
considered one of the most cost-effective forms of generating electricity as prices of oil and gas rise , nuclear energy is largely favored by rapidly expanding economies in eastern europe and asia to meet their spiraling energy needs .
" the debates about climate change and reducing emissions also play a role here , " said alan mcdonald of the iaea .
" and naturally , it 's about securing production . "
nuclear energy plagued by problems nuclear energy production , however , remains problematic as most countries using nuclear energy need to import uranium .
according to the iaea , there are only 4.7 tons of economically viable uranium reserves worldwide .
given current levels of usage , experts believe stocks will only last for another 60 years .
that would mean that uranium would be depleted faster than oil and gas reserves .
experts also pointed to the unsolved problem of disposing nuclear waste , which remains radioactive for decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts estimate that uranium stocks will only last another 60 years paulitz said the environmental advantages of using nuclear energy are also limited since it only provides an estimated 1.2 percent of the world 's energy needs .
for nuclear energy to make a real difference in cutting greenhouse gas emissions , thousands of new reactors would have to be built , he said .
that is hardly possible given the nuclear industry 's low production capacity .
" it 's only about sustaining energy production on this low level and maintaining the technology - also because of interest in nuclear weapons , " paulitz said , adding that the world could easily do without this marginal energy source .

it 's not surprising considering the reactor was shut down following a technical irregularity earlier this month .
the problem at brunsbüttel , one of 17 nuclear reactors in germany , is by no means the only mishap in recent months that has increasingly called the safety of atomic power into question .
earlier this month , an earthquake caused leaks at a reactor in northwestern japan and led to low-level radiation , reviving fears about nuclear safety , and the closure of the brunsbüttel plant in germany followed a fire at another reactor close to hamburg .
around the world , there are 438 nuclear plants currently in operation .
the majority are in industrialized nations - 104 in the us , 59 in france and 31 in russia .
how dangerous were the incidents ?
despite the recent slew of incidents at nuclear power stations , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said the errors in germany , sweden and japan were exceptions and certainly did not pose a danger .
that 's a view echoed by klaus kotthoff of the grs group , an independent nuclear assessment and research organization .
while there is no technology that 's free of errors , kotthoff pointed out that nuclear power plants are subject to a range of registration procedures and measures aimed at managing irregularities - as was the case at two nuclear plants in germany earlier this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire broke out last month at the krümmel nuclear plant near hamburg in germany " i believe these incidents were not noteworthy from a technical security point of view , " kotthoff said .
critics of nuclear energy , however , do n't buy the argument .
henrik paulitz of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- said the recent german incidents were dangerous .
" the reactor protection system was activated .
that only happens in serious cases , " paulitz said , adding that they were n't isolated cases .
there are several nuclear incidents in germany about which the public is not sufficiently informed , he said .
the information that is released is mostly " incomprehensible " and the controversial backgrounds are often concealed .
" serious security deficits are usually glossed over , " paulitz said .
experts split over nuclear safety experts remain divided about the safety of nuclear reactors .
while kotthoff said german plants are generally considered the safest , a 1997 study by the organization for economic cooperation and development ranked the german nuclear power station biblis b second to last in an international nuclear power plant comparison . only the maine yankee plant in the us fared worse , and it 's since been shut down .
but paulitz said other nuclear power stations too are n't much better .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is again debating whether to stick to a nuclear energy phase out " an unfortunate mixture of technical problems and human error can at any time cause a major nuclear meltdown anywhere , " he said .
the recent string of incidents comes at a time when nuclear energy seems to be undergoing somewhat of a revival .
considered one of the most cost-effective forms of generating electricity as prices of oil and gas rise , nuclear energy is largely favored by rapidly expanding economies in eastern europe and asia to meet their spiraling energy needs .
" the debates about climate change and reducing emissions also play a role here , " said alan mcdonald of the iaea .
" and naturally , it 's about securing production . "
nuclear energy plagued by problems nuclear energy production , however , remains problematic as most countries using nuclear energy need to import uranium .
according to the iaea , there are only 4.7 tons of economically viable uranium reserves worldwide .
given current levels of usage , experts believe stocks will only last for another 60 years .
that would mean that uranium would be depleted faster than oil and gas reserves .
experts also pointed to the unsolved problem of disposing nuclear waste , which remains radioactive for decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts estimate that uranium stocks will only last another 60 years paulitz said the environmental advantages of using nuclear energy are also limited since it only provides an estimated 1.2 percent of the world 's energy needs .
for nuclear energy to make a real difference in cutting greenhouse gas emissions , thousands of new reactors would have to be built , he said .
that is hardly possible given the nuclear industry 's low production capacity .
" it 's only about sustaining energy production on this low level and maintaining the technology - also because of interest in nuclear weapons , " paulitz said , adding that the world could easily do without this marginal energy source .

intel denied the charges friday . the european commission said sent a " statement of objections " to intel on thursday alleging that it tried to exclude competitor advanced micro devices inc .
-lrb- amd -rrb- from the market .
intel could face fines if it is found guilty of infringing on eu antitrust rules .
intel has abused its dominant market position , the european union statement said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most computers have intel inside the eu said intel gave computer makers " substantial rebates " for buying their x86 cpus from intel .
they were allegedly offered below cost to strategic customers , such as governments and universities , according to the eu statement .
intel also allegedly paid manufacturers to delay or cancel product lines which used amd chips .
" the rebates offered by intel were of such a quantity and such an amount that an efficient competitor would be forced to price below cost , " european commission spokesman ton van lierop told reuters .
" we think that would be bad for competition and bad for consumers . "
the eu said below-cost or predatory pricing may be good for consumers in the short term , but is ultimately harmful because it kills off competition , which offers more choice and innovation in the long term .
intel dominates world chip market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chip making or deal making ?
intel replied that its conduct has been lawful , good for competition and beneficial to customers .
" we are confident that the microprocessor market segment is functioning normally and that intel 's conduct has been lawful , pro-competitive , and beneficial to consumers , " intel 's general counsel bruce sewell said .
intel controls 80 percent of the global market for the central processing units , or cpus .
the rest are made by amd .
focusing on price amd spokesman jens drews said pc manufacturers operate on thin margins and intel 's loyalty rebates have forced amd to focus on price rather than performance .
" their financial strength is poisoning the industry , " drews was quoted as saying by the associated press .
" what we see is that we have not been competing on a level playing field . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amd says chip quality has suffered from price wars intel has 10 weeks to reply to the statement and will then have the right to a hearing with eu regulators .
intel will face a fine if the commission finds it has engaged in anti-competitive conduct .
but most cases take several years before they are settled .
intel 's sewell said he 's awaiting a ruling on the microsoft case .
in 2004 , the european commission found microsoft had competed unfairly and levied a fine of nearly $ 500 million -lrb- $ 686 million -rrb- .

it foresees the building of a nuclear reactor in libya to supply drinking water from sea water .
german deputy foreign minister gernot erler condemned the deal , warning it was not just a bilateral matter and could damage german interests .
german interests at risk ?
" politically , this business is problematic , " erler told handelsblatt business daily .
" german interests are directly affected . "
erler was referring to german conglomerate siemens which has a 34-percent stake in framatome , a nuclear power joint venture it has with france 's areva , the world 's biggest maker of nuclear reactors .
areva is reported to supply the plant in libya .
the deal is also expected to offer areva access to libya 's vast energy resources .
libya is believed to have uranium stocks of 1,600 tons as well as unexploited reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder was the first german leader to visit libya in 2004 erler said germany had tried in the past to offer libya help with developing renewable energy , but said tripoli had failed to react .
he added that european security interests could be affected by the export of nuclear technology and that paris and berlin needed to discuss the issue .
" above all the risk of proliferation increases with every country using nuclear energy , " erler said .
in 2003 , libya agreed to halt a weapons program banned by the united nations , ending decades of international isolation .
in the following year , libya handed over its stocks of enriched uranium to the vienna-based nuclear watchdog , iaea .
" rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " sarkozy 's deal with gadhafi , which came just a day after tripoli handed over six foreign medics to bulgaria , has sparked criticism in europe and in france too .
daniel cohn-bendit , a german politician of the green party and a member of the european parliament described the deal as " ransom " paid by sarkozy to a " bloody dictator " for the release of the foreign medics .
in an interview with german station rtl , cohn-bendit said it was " absolutely mad " that sarkozy was " rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " with the nuclear treaty .
france 's opposition socialist party asked : " is it not a bit soon to be throwing ourselves into gadhafi 's arms and giving him our international endorsement ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya had imprisoned six foreign medics for eight years before releasing them last week the green party accused sarkozy of " boundless cynicism " rooted in the risk of striking a nuclear deal with an " undemocratic state . "
greenpeace france said the deal " poses an enormous problem in terms of nuclear proliferation " and branded it as " in keeping with the french policy of irresponsible export of nuclear technology . "
greenpeace pointed out that previous french presidents had signed nuclear deals with the former shah of iran , ex-iraqi dictator saddam hussein and with south africa during the apartheid era .
sarkozy insists deal will not lead to proliferation sarkozy however has defended france 's nuclear cooperation with libya , saying that a country which respects international laws can create a civilian nuclear industry .
" if you dare to say that civilian nuclear energy should be closed to the northern shore of the mediterranean and that the arab world is not responsible enough for civilian nuclear energy then you 're humiliating them and preparing for a clash of civilizations , " sarkozy told french paper le monde .
an official with france 's atomic energy commission -lrb- cea -rrb- insisted that international safeguards imposed after libya scrapped its military nuclear program would prevent any proliferation .
simon nisan told news agency afp international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- controls made it " almost impossible " to divert the technology to military use .
" the controls are so tight that you do n't have the right to remove the fuel without the presence of iaea inspectors , " he said . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the consumer climate showed stability at a strong level in july , " the gfk said , " with income expectations and buying propensity almost matching the record figures of the previous month . "
indictors show that germans expect incomes to continue rising and are therefore prepared to buy more goods , it said .
" with consumers in the mood to spend even more , retailers can hope to achieve higher sales in the second half of 2007 , " the gfk added .
caution creeps in but economic expectations were slightly more cautious , following the euphoria that led to an all-time high for the economic outlook indicator in may .
this was because rising interest rates , high energy prices and a strong euro triggered fears that the current dynamic growth in the german economy might start slowing down , the gfk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retailers can expect good sales for the rest of the year " german consumers do not believe that the current high growth rate of the economy can be maintained at quite the same level and expect the upturn to slow down over the coming months , " it said .
" if the euro continues to be valued at the present high level or even higher , this may impact negatively on export prospects in the medium term , which have been the key driver of the strong economy to date . "
losing momentum ?
however , the favorable trend on the labor market and expected future income growth largely compensated for these risks , the survey showed .
the survey was published a day after another key indicator , the ifo business climate index , showed business sentiment in germany dipped slightly in july .
higher oil prices , rising interest rates and a strong euro have fuelled fears that the german economy might lose momentum after posting a 2.8 percent growth rate in 2006 .
many economists project growth in 2007 would match or possibly surpass last year 's level but feel it might slip back towards 2 percent in 2008 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she 's called for her country to strengthen its diplomatic , economic and cultural presence in that part of the country . roth traveled to northern iraq this week to meet with top politicians and human rights activists and to get a feel for the security situation in the war-torn region .

" i expect the german government to be diplomatically , economically and politically present in kurdistan . " roth said germany should be more strongly engaged in the kurdish region and pointed out that other european union countries , including italy , great britain , france and the czech republic , were taking part in rebuilding efforts and cultural projects in northern iraq . though the autonomous northern part of the country is relatively calm compared to the rest of iraq , where suicide bombings are a regular occurrence , roth 's five-day trip to the region was the first visit from a german parliamentary delegation to the country since the us-led invasion began in 2003 . german military not in iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roth , left , wants to increase the german presence in iraq under then chancellor gerhard schröder , germany refused to take part in the us-led war in iraq and currently does not have a military presence in the country .

it 's a warning roth said she does n't understand . " for me it is totally incomprehensible why there is neither diplomatic representation nor an attempt to support the capabilities of the people here through cultural exchange , such as setting up german schools , " she said , adding that many of politicians she met had lived in germany in the past and requested german involvement in afghanistan . returning refugees to iraq " shameless " germany is particularly interested in northern iraq because many german asylum-seekers come from the area .

the view was echoed by wolfgang bosbach of the cdu .
" the german government needs to examine whether it should continue paying development aid to china , " he said .

she added that the bulk of current development money focused on boosting environmental protection as well as supporting legal and political reforms .
steg added that the former included promoting renewable energy and helping improve energy efficiency .
he pointed out that it " always results in renewed contracts for german companies . "

criminal charges could be next . two judges questioned villepin on friday morning about an attempt in 2003-2004 to discredit france 's current president , nicolas sarkozy , who was at the time a government minister and a political rival in the conservative ump party , in which both men as well as former french president jacques chirac were members .
the judges suspect villepin of involvement in the so-called clearstream affair , in which sarkozy 's name was wrongly linked to an illegal bank account in luxembourg .
the preliminary charges against him were for complicity to make false accusations , receiving stolen goods , breach of trust and complicity to use false documents .
villepin has denied breaking the law .
" i am anxious to restate this morning that at no point did i ask for an investigation into political figures , and at no moment did i partake in any political machination , " villepin said after being questioned on friday .
the affair started in 2003 when a list of clearstream bank-account holders surfaced who had allegedly received secret commissions from international arms sales .
the list , which included the names of sarkozy and other prominent politicians , was subsequently proven to be false .
chirac the mastermind ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac continues to claim presidential immunity experts retrieved documents from former intelligence chief philippe rondot 's computer two weeks ago that suggested villepin had instructed an associate , jean-louis gergorin , to leak the list to a judge to damage sarkozy 's reputation .
rondot had conducted a secret probe into the affair in 2004 .
the information on his laptop also indicated that then president chirac had initiated the smear campaign .
chirac has said he will not answer questions regarding the affair , claiming he remains protected by presidential immunity , a position legal experts are divided over .
earlier this month , gergorin , formerly the vice president of european aerospace company eads , admitted he wrote anonymous letters to justice officials smearing sarkozy .
last year , sarkozy declared himself a civil plaintiff in the suit and said he was determined to find out who tried to undermine him . article based on news reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

criminal charges could be next . two judges questioned villepin on friday morning about an attempt in 2003-2004 to discredit france 's current president , nicolas sarkozy , who was at the time a government minister and a political rival in the conservative ump party , in which both men as well as former french president jacques chirac were members .
the judges suspect villepin of involvement in the so-called clearstream affair , in which sarkozy 's name was wrongly linked to an illegal bank account in luxembourg .
the preliminary charges against him were for complicity to make false accusations , receiving stolen goods , breach of trust and complicity to use false documents .
villepin has denied breaking the law .
" i am anxious to restate this morning that at no point did i ask for an investigation into political figures , and at no moment did i partake in any political machination , " villepin said after being questioned on friday .
the affair started in 2003 when a list of clearstream bank-account holders surfaced who had allegedly received secret commissions from international arms sales .
the list , which included the names of sarkozy and other prominent politicians , was subsequently proven to be false .
chirac the mastermind ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac continues to claim presidential immunity experts retrieved documents from former intelligence chief philippe rondot 's computer two weeks ago that suggested villepin had instructed an associate , jean-louis gergorin , to leak the list to a judge to damage sarkozy 's reputation .
rondot had conducted a secret probe into the affair in 2004 .
the information on his laptop also indicated that then president chirac had initiated the smear campaign .
chirac has said he will not answer questions regarding the affair , claiming he remains protected by presidential immunity , a position legal experts are divided over .
earlier this month , gergorin , formerly the vice president of european aerospace company eads , admitted he wrote anonymous letters to justice officials smearing sarkozy .
last year , sarkozy declared himself a civil plaintiff in the suit and said he was determined to find out who tried to undermine him . article based on news reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 27.07.2007 concerns mount over nuclear energy after series of scares großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sceptics say recent errors highlight the drawbacks of nuclear energy irregularities at nuclear reactors in germany and japan in recent weeks have rekindled safety fears and raised tough questions about nuclear energy amid increasing environmental concerns . the nuclear plant at brunsbüttel in the northern german state of schleswig-holstein is now the world 's safest .
it 's not surprising considering the reactor was shut down following a technical irregularity earlier this month .
the problem at brunsbüttel , one of 17 nuclear reactors in germany , is by no means the only mishap in recent months that has increasingly called the safety of atomic power into question .
earlier this month , an earthquake caused leaks at a reactor in northwestern japan and led to low-level radiation , reviving fears about nuclear safety , and the closure of the brunsbüttel plant in germany followed a fire at another reactor close to hamburg .
around the world , there are 438 nuclear plants currently in operation .
the majority are in industrialized nations - 104 in the us , 59 in france and 31 in russia .
how dangerous were the incidents ?
despite the recent slew of incidents at nuclear power stations , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said the errors in germany , sweden and japan were exceptions and certainly did not pose a danger .
that 's a view echoed by klaus kotthoff of the grs group , an independent nuclear assessment and research organization .
while there is no technology that 's free of errors , kotthoff pointed out that nuclear power plants are subject to a range of registration procedures and measures aimed at managing irregularities - as was the case at two nuclear plants in germany earlier this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire broke out last month at the krümmel nuclear plant near hamburg in germany " i believe these incidents were not noteworthy from a technical security point of view , " kotthoff said .
critics of nuclear energy , however , do n't buy the argument .
henrik paulitz of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- said the recent german incidents were dangerous .
" the reactor protection system was activated .
that only happens in serious cases , " paulitz said , adding that they were n't isolated cases .
there are several nuclear incidents in germany about which the public is not sufficiently informed , he said .
the information that is released is mostly " incomprehensible " and the controversial backgrounds are often concealed .
" serious security deficits are usually glossed over , " paulitz said .
experts split over nuclear safety experts remain divided about the safety of nuclear reactors .
while kotthoff said german plants are generally considered the safest , a 1997 study by the organization for economic cooperation and development ranked the german nuclear power station biblis b second to last in an international nuclear power plant comparison . only the maine yankee plant in the us fared worse , and it 's since been shut down .
but paulitz said other nuclear power stations too are n't much better .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is again debating whether to stick to a nuclear energy phase out " an unfortunate mixture of technical problems and human error can at any time cause a major nuclear meltdown anywhere , " he said .
the recent string of incidents comes at a time when nuclear energy seems to be undergoing somewhat of a revival .
considered one of the most cost-effective forms of generating electricity as prices of oil and gas rise , nuclear energy is largely favored by rapidly expanding economies in eastern europe and asia to meet their spiraling energy needs .
" the debates about climate change and reducing emissions also play a role here , " said alan mcdonald of the iaea .
" and naturally , it 's about securing production . "
nuclear energy plagued by problems nuclear energy production , however , remains problematic as most countries using nuclear energy need to import uranium .
according to the iaea , there are only 4.7 tons of economically viable uranium reserves worldwide .
given current levels of usage , experts believe stocks will only last for another 60 years .
that would mean that uranium would be depleted faster than oil and gas reserves .
experts also pointed to the unsolved problem of disposing nuclear waste , which remains radioactive for decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts estimate that uranium stocks will only last another 60 years paulitz said the environmental advantages of using nuclear energy are also limited since it only provides an estimated 1.2 percent of the world 's energy needs .
for nuclear energy to make a real difference in cutting greenhouse gas emissions , thousands of new reactors would have to be built , he said .
that is hardly possible given the nuclear industry 's low production capacity .
" it 's only about sustaining energy production on this low level and maintaining the technology - also because of interest in nuclear weapons , " paulitz said , adding that the world could easily do without this marginal energy source .
security poses biggest hurdle iaea 's mcdonald said that security issues increasingly pose the biggest hurdle when it comes to using nuclear energy .
the vienna-based nuclear watchdog has set up an entire department to explore ways of preventing the misuse of nuclear materials and terrorist attacks on reactors .
" terrorists who plant to blow up a nuclear reactor can do so with relatively easy means , " paulitz said .
" protecting against such attacks is just not possible . " ina rottscheidt -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the problem at brunsbüttel , one of 17 nuclear reactors in germany , is by no means the only mishap in recent months that has increasingly called the safety of atomic power into question .
earlier this month , an earthquake caused leaks at a reactor in northwestern japan and led to low-level radiation , reviving fears about nuclear safety , and the closure of the brunsbüttel plant in germany followed a fire at another reactor close to hamburg .
around the world , there are 438 nuclear plants currently in operation .
the majority are in industrialized nations - 104 in the us , 59 in france and 31 in russia .
how dangerous were the incidents ?
despite the recent slew of incidents at nuclear power stations , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said the errors in germany , sweden and japan were exceptions and certainly did not pose a danger .
that 's a view echoed by klaus kotthoff of the grs group , an independent nuclear assessment and research organization .
while there is no technology that 's free of errors , kotthoff pointed out that nuclear power plants are subject to a range of registration procedures and measures aimed at managing irregularities - as was the case at two nuclear plants in germany earlier this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire broke out last month at the krümmel nuclear plant near hamburg in germany " i believe these incidents were not noteworthy from a technical security point of view , " kotthoff said .
critics of nuclear energy , however , do n't buy the argument .
henrik paulitz of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- said the recent german incidents were dangerous .
" the reactor protection system was activated .
that only happens in serious cases , " paulitz said , adding that they were n't isolated cases .
there are several nuclear incidents in germany about which the public is not sufficiently informed , he said .
the information that is released is mostly " incomprehensible " and the controversial backgrounds are often concealed .
" serious security deficits are usually glossed over , " paulitz said .
experts split over nuclear safety experts remain divided about the safety of nuclear reactors .
while kotthoff said german plants are generally considered the safest , a 1997 study by the organization for economic cooperation and development ranked the german nuclear power station biblis b second to last in an international nuclear power plant comparison . only the maine yankee plant in the us fared worse , and it 's since been shut down .
but paulitz said other nuclear power stations too are n't much better .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is again debating whether to stick to a nuclear energy phase out " an unfortunate mixture of technical problems and human error can at any time cause a major nuclear meltdown anywhere , " he said .
the recent string of incidents comes at a time when nuclear energy seems to be undergoing somewhat of a revival .
considered one of the most cost-effective forms of generating electricity as prices of oil and gas rise , nuclear energy is largely favored by rapidly expanding economies in eastern europe and asia to meet their spiraling energy needs .
" the debates about climate change and reducing emissions also play a role here , " said alan mcdonald of the iaea .
" and naturally , it 's about securing production . "
nuclear energy plagued by problems nuclear energy production , however , remains problematic as most countries using nuclear energy need to import uranium .
according to the iaea , there are only 4.7 tons of economically viable uranium reserves worldwide .
given current levels of usage , experts believe stocks will only last for another 60 years .
that would mean that uranium would be depleted faster than oil and gas reserves .
experts also pointed to the unsolved problem of disposing nuclear waste , which remains radioactive for decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts estimate that uranium stocks will only last another 60 years paulitz said the environmental advantages of using nuclear energy are also limited since it only provides an estimated 1.2 percent of the world 's energy needs .
for nuclear energy to make a real difference in cutting greenhouse gas emissions , thousands of new reactors would have to be built , he said .
that is hardly possible given the nuclear industry 's low production capacity .
" it 's only about sustaining energy production on this low level and maintaining the technology - also because of interest in nuclear weapons , " paulitz said , adding that the world could easily do without this marginal energy source .
security poses biggest hurdle iaea 's mcdonald said that security issues increasingly pose the biggest hurdle when it comes to using nuclear energy .
the vienna-based nuclear watchdog has set up an entire department to explore ways of preventing the misuse of nuclear materials and terrorist attacks on reactors .
" terrorists who plant to blow up a nuclear reactor can do so with relatively easy means , " paulitz said .

criminal charges could be next . two judges questioned villepin on friday morning about an attempt in 2003-2004 to discredit france 's current president , nicolas sarkozy , who was at the time a government minister and a political rival in the conservative ump party , in which both men as well as former french president jacques chirac were members .
the judges suspect villepin of involvement in the so-called clearstream affair , in which sarkozy 's name was wrongly linked to an illegal bank account in luxembourg .
the preliminary charges against him were for complicity to make false accusations , receiving stolen goods , breach of trust and complicity to use false documents .
villepin has denied breaking the law .
" i am anxious to restate this morning that at no point did i ask for an investigation into political figures , and at no moment did i partake in any political machination , " villepin said after being questioned on friday .
the affair started in 2003 when a list of clearstream bank-account holders surfaced who had allegedly received secret commissions from international arms sales .
the list , which included the names of sarkozy and other prominent politicians , was subsequently proven to be false .

rondot had conducted a secret probe into the affair in 2004 .
the information on his laptop also indicated that then president chirac had initiated the smear campaign .
chirac has said he will not answer questions regarding the affair , claiming he remains protected by presidential immunity , a position legal experts are divided over .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.07.2007 former french premier villepin under investigation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villepin and chirac were both allegedly involved in a campaign to tarnish sarkozy former french prime minister dominique de villepin on friday was formally placed under investigation over a smear campaign against one-time rival and now french president nicolas sarkozy .
criminal charges could be next . two judges questioned villepin on friday morning about an attempt in 2003-2004 to discredit france 's current president , nicolas sarkozy , who was at the time a government minister and a political rival in the conservative ump party , in which both men as well as former french president jacques chirac were members .
the judges suspect villepin of involvement in the so-called clearstream affair , in which sarkozy 's name was wrongly linked to an illegal bank account in luxembourg .
the preliminary charges against him were for complicity to make false accusations , receiving stolen goods , breach of trust and complicity to use false documents .
villepin has denied breaking the law .
" i am anxious to restate this morning that at no point did i ask for an investigation into political figures , and at no moment did i partake in any political machination , " villepin said after being questioned on friday .
the affair started in 2003 when a list of clearstream bank-account holders surfaced who had allegedly received secret commissions from international arms sales .
the list , which included the names of sarkozy and other prominent politicians , was subsequently proven to be false .
chirac the mastermind ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac continues to claim presidential immunity experts retrieved documents from former intelligence chief philippe rondot 's computer two weeks ago that suggested villepin had instructed an associate , jean-louis gergorin , to leak the list to a judge to damage sarkozy 's reputation .
rondot had conducted a secret probe into the affair in 2004 .
the information on his laptop also indicated that then president chirac had initiated the smear campaign .
chirac has said he will not answer questions regarding the affair , claiming he remains protected by presidential immunity , a position legal experts are divided over .
earlier this month , gergorin , formerly the vice president of european aerospace company eads , admitted he wrote anonymous letters to justice officials smearing sarkozy .
last year , sarkozy declared himself a civil plaintiff in the suit and said he was determined to find out who tried to undermine him . article based on news reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it foresees the building of a nuclear reactor in libya to supply drinking water from sea water .
german deputy foreign minister gernot erler condemned the deal , warning it was not just a bilateral matter and could damage german interests .
german interests at risk ?
" politically , this business is problematic , " erler told handelsblatt business daily .
" german interests are directly affected . "
erler was referring to german conglomerate siemens which has a 34-percent stake in framatome , a nuclear power joint venture it has with france 's areva , the world 's biggest maker of nuclear reactors .
areva is reported to supply the plant in libya .
the deal is also expected to offer areva access to libya 's vast energy resources .
libya is believed to have uranium stocks of 1,600 tons as well as unexploited reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder was the first german leader to visit libya in 2004 erler said germany had tried in the past to offer libya help with developing renewable energy , but said tripoli had failed to react .
he added that european security interests could be affected by the export of nuclear technology and that paris and berlin needed to discuss the issue .
" above all the risk of proliferation increases with every country using nuclear energy , " erler said .
in 2003 , libya agreed to halt a weapons program banned by the united nations , ending decades of international isolation .
in the following year , libya handed over its stocks of enriched uranium to the vienna-based nuclear watchdog , iaea .
" rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " sarkozy 's deal with gadhafi , which came just a day after tripoli handed over six foreign medics to bulgaria , has sparked criticism in europe and in france too .
daniel cohn-bendit , a german politician of the green party and a member of the european parliament described the deal as " ransom " paid by sarkozy to a " bloody dictator " for the release of the foreign medics .
in an interview with german station rtl , cohn-bendit said it was " absolutely mad " that sarkozy was " rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " with the nuclear treaty .
france 's opposition socialist party asked : " is it not a bit soon to be throwing ourselves into gadhafi 's arms and giving him our international endorsement ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya had imprisoned six foreign medics for eight years before releasing them last week the green party accused sarkozy of " boundless cynicism " rooted in the risk of striking a nuclear deal with an " undemocratic state . "
greenpeace france said the deal " poses an enormous problem in terms of nuclear proliferation " and branded it as " in keeping with the french policy of irresponsible export of nuclear technology . "
greenpeace pointed out that previous french presidents had signed nuclear deals with the former shah of iran , ex-iraqi dictator saddam hussein and with south africa during the apartheid era .
sarkozy insists deal will not lead to proliferation sarkozy however has defended france 's nuclear cooperation with libya , saying that a country which respects international laws can create a civilian nuclear industry .
" if you dare to say that civilian nuclear energy should be closed to the northern shore of the mediterranean and that the arab world is not responsible enough for civilian nuclear energy then you 're humiliating them and preparing for a clash of civilizations , " sarkozy told french paper le monde .

it foresees the building of a nuclear reactor in libya to supply drinking water from sea water .
german deputy foreign minister gernot erler condemned the deal , warning it was not just a bilateral matter and could damage german interests .
german interests at risk ?
" politically , this business is problematic , " erler told handelsblatt business daily .
" german interests are directly affected . "
erler was referring to german conglomerate siemens which has a 34-percent stake in framatome , a nuclear power joint venture it has with france 's areva , the world 's biggest maker of nuclear reactors .
areva is reported to supply the plant in libya .
the deal is also expected to offer areva access to libya 's vast energy resources .
libya is believed to have uranium stocks of 1,600 tons as well as unexploited reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder was the first german leader to visit libya in 2004 erler said germany had tried in the past to offer libya help with developing renewable energy , but said tripoli had failed to react .
he added that european security interests could be affected by the export of nuclear technology and that paris and berlin needed to discuss the issue .
" above all the risk of proliferation increases with every country using nuclear energy , " erler said .
in 2003 , libya agreed to halt a weapons program banned by the united nations , ending decades of international isolation .
in the following year , libya handed over its stocks of enriched uranium to the vienna-based nuclear watchdog , iaea .
" rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " sarkozy 's deal with gadhafi , which came just a day after tripoli handed over six foreign medics to bulgaria , has sparked criticism in europe and in france too .
daniel cohn-bendit , a german politician of the green party and a member of the european parliament described the deal as " ransom " paid by sarkozy to a " bloody dictator " for the release of the foreign medics .
in an interview with german station rtl , cohn-bendit said it was " absolutely mad " that sarkozy was " rehabilitating an incumbent dictator " with the nuclear treaty .
france 's opposition socialist party asked : " is it not a bit soon to be throwing ourselves into gadhafi 's arms and giving him our international endorsement ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libya had imprisoned six foreign medics for eight years before releasing them last week the green party accused sarkozy of " boundless cynicism " rooted in the risk of striking a nuclear deal with an " undemocratic state . "
greenpeace france said the deal " poses an enormous problem in terms of nuclear proliferation " and branded it as " in keeping with the french policy of irresponsible export of nuclear technology . "
greenpeace pointed out that previous french presidents had signed nuclear deals with the former shah of iran , ex-iraqi dictator saddam hussein and with south africa during the apartheid era .
sarkozy insists deal will not lead to proliferation sarkozy however has defended france 's nuclear cooperation with libya , saying that a country which respects international laws can create a civilian nuclear industry .
" if you dare to say that civilian nuclear energy should be closed to the northern shore of the mediterranean and that the arab world is not responsible enough for civilian nuclear energy then you 're humiliating them and preparing for a clash of civilizations , " sarkozy told french paper le monde .

rainer brüderle , deputy chairman of the fdp told mass market bild daily that china was " a successful hi-tech nation and not a developing country . "
the view was echoed by wolfgang bosbach of the cdu .
" the german government needs to examine whether it should continue paying development aid to china , " he said .
according to the news report , china will receive 67.5 million euros -lrb- $ 92.1 million -rrb- this year from the german ministry of economic cooperation and development .
german government rejects demands the german government , however , has rejected the demands from the two politicians , saying the money that flowed to china this year was transferred within the framework of long-term and successful economic cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government says china can now tackle poverty within its borders itself " china does n't receive any development aid from germany , " thomas steg , a press spokesman for the government said in berlin .
" this cooperation is explicitly in german interests . "
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul also stressed that development aid to china had been adapted to the country 's changing economic dynamics over the years .
" the funds by the german government are largely provided as loans with market conditions and are paid back by china , " the minister said .
china can now afford to fight poverty within its own borders on its own , wieczorek-zeul said .
she added that the bulk of current development money focused on boosting environmental protection as well as supporting legal and political reforms .
steg added that the former included promoting renewable energy and helping improve energy efficiency .
he pointed out that it " always results in renewed contracts for german companies . "
china is considered the world 's second biggest emitter of carbon dioxide , after the united states , and the biggest producer of sulfur dioxide .
chinese economy hurtles ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese exports are expected to soar by 20 percent this year the debate over putting the brakes on development aid to china follows the recent publication of statistics that show the asian country 's economy is galloping ahead at a rapid pace . it grew by 11.9 percent in the first quarter of this year , according to china 's national statistics bureau .
some experts say that if present economic growth rates are sustained , china could in five years replace germany as the world 's third largest economy after the us and japan , and other experts have said germany has already been knocked into fourth place .
china 's exports are expected to grow at an annual rate of 20 percent in 2007 and 2008 compared with 9 percent for german exports over the same period .
in 2005 , china surpassed britain to become the world 's fourth largest economy .

it 's not surprising considering the reactor was shut down following a technical irregularity earlier this month .
the problem at brunsbüttel , one of 17 nuclear reactors in germany , is by no means the only mishap in recent months that has increasingly called the safety of atomic power into question .
earlier this month , an earthquake caused leaks at a reactor in northwestern japan and led to low-level radiation , reviving fears about nuclear safety , and the closure of the brunsbüttel plant in germany followed a fire at another reactor close to hamburg .
around the world , there are 438 nuclear plants currently in operation .
the majority are in industrialized nations - 104 in the us , 59 in france and 31 in russia .
how dangerous were the incidents ?
despite the recent slew of incidents at nuclear power stations , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said the errors in germany , sweden and japan were exceptions and certainly did not pose a danger .
that 's a view echoed by klaus kotthoff of the grs group , an independent nuclear assessment and research organization .
while there is no technology that 's free of errors , kotthoff pointed out that nuclear power plants are subject to a range of registration procedures and measures aimed at managing irregularities - as was the case at two nuclear plants in germany earlier this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fire broke out last month at the krümmel nuclear plant near hamburg in germany " i believe these incidents were not noteworthy from a technical security point of view , " kotthoff said .
critics of nuclear energy , however , do n't buy the argument .
henrik paulitz of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war -lrb- ippnw -rrb- said the recent german incidents were dangerous .
" the reactor protection system was activated .
that only happens in serious cases , " paulitz said , adding that they were n't isolated cases .
there are several nuclear incidents in germany about which the public is not sufficiently informed , he said .
the information that is released is mostly " incomprehensible " and the controversial backgrounds are often concealed .
" serious security deficits are usually glossed over , " paulitz said .
experts split over nuclear safety experts remain divided about the safety of nuclear reactors .
while kotthoff said german plants are generally considered the safest , a 1997 study by the organization for economic cooperation and development ranked the german nuclear power station biblis b second to last in an international nuclear power plant comparison . only the maine yankee plant in the us fared worse , and it 's since been shut down .
but paulitz said other nuclear power stations too are n't much better .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is again debating whether to stick to a nuclear energy phase out " an unfortunate mixture of technical problems and human error can at any time cause a major nuclear meltdown anywhere , " he said .
the recent string of incidents comes at a time when nuclear energy seems to be undergoing somewhat of a revival .
considered one of the most cost-effective forms of generating electricity as prices of oil and gas rise , nuclear energy is largely favored by rapidly expanding economies in eastern europe and asia to meet their spiraling energy needs .
" the debates about climate change and reducing emissions also play a role here , " said alan mcdonald of the iaea .
" and naturally , it 's about securing production . "
nuclear energy plagued by problems nuclear energy production , however , remains problematic as most countries using nuclear energy need to import uranium .
according to the iaea , there are only 4.7 tons of economically viable uranium reserves worldwide .
given current levels of usage , experts believe stocks will only last for another 60 years .
that would mean that uranium would be depleted faster than oil and gas reserves .
experts also pointed to the unsolved problem of disposing nuclear waste , which remains radioactive for decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts estimate that uranium stocks will only last another 60 years paulitz said the environmental advantages of using nuclear energy are also limited since it only provides an estimated 1.2 percent of the world 's energy needs .
for nuclear energy to make a real difference in cutting greenhouse gas emissions , thousands of new reactors would have to be built , he said .
that is hardly possible given the nuclear industry 's low production capacity .
" it 's only about sustaining energy production on this low level and maintaining the technology - also because of interest in nuclear weapons , " paulitz said , adding that the world could easily do without this marginal energy source .
security poses biggest hurdle iaea 's mcdonald said that security issues increasingly pose the biggest hurdle when it comes to using nuclear energy .
the vienna-based nuclear watchdog has set up an entire department to explore ways of preventing the misuse of nuclear materials and terrorist attacks on reactors .

now a new generation of film makers are running the studio and making comedies they hope will attract a global audience and win major box office receipts .
film producer and head of ealing studios , barnaby thompson 's latest film is a new chapter in the tale of the naughtiest girls ' school in fiction : st trinian 's .
it 's a £ 7m production , starring rupert everett and colin firth which he hopes will resurrect interest in the st. trinian 's brand , his studio and put ealing back on the global film map .
there 's a lot to live up to , as in the 1940s and 1950s legendary producer sir michael balcon made a string of comedy film hits at ealing .
classics including " kind hearts and coronets " , " whisky galore " , " passport to pimlico " and the oscar-winning " lavender hill mob " ensured that ealing studios represented a high water mark in british film making .
sold to the bbc despite international success , the growing popularity of television made the film business increasingly more difficult and in 1959 the studios were sold to the bbc .
in 2000 barnaby thompson led a consortium that brought the studios back and invested millions in modernising the soundstages and production facilities .
they wanted to create a modern studio business model that could withstand the boom-and-bust nature of the industry .
to do this they have opened up other revenue sources by renting ealing 's facilities to other film makers , including woody allen and gurinder chadha - who is based on the site .
office space is rented out and there 's also a comedy club and a film school based on site .
st trinians but ultimately it 's the films that the company is known for , and the success of st.trinians is critical for its future .
barnaby made a strong start at ealing with a remake of " the importance of being earnest " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- and the uk 's first computer generated animation film , " valiant " -lrb- 2003 -rrb- .
but more recent productions , including ant and dec in " alien autopsy " -lrb- 2005 -rrb- and its most recent release " i want candy " -lrb- 2007 -rrb- , performed poorly with both critics and at the box office .
barnaby thompson says : " it 's always disappointing when your films do n't work because we 're an industry that feeds off hits .
" if " i want candy " had done as well as i thought it was going to do we stood to make a lot of money out of it . "
the ealing crew are hoping to bounce back with st. trinian 's .
despite its british subject , cast and sense of humour , the team believe its universal theme of " girl power " will help deliver a global hit .
cannes pitch join the discussion are remakes a cynical cashing-in exercise ?
putting on a good sales drive to international distributors at the 2007 cannes film festival is crucial to its commercial success .
natalie brenner , ealing 's head of sales and james spring , managing director of ealing studios put themselves through an exhausting fortnight of meetings .
they attempted to get st trinian 's noticed alongside the big studios who were in town promoting blockbusters oceans thirteen and the simpsons movie .
the sales team had some success at cannes .
it sold rights to the film to be shown in 41 countries around the world and made back a quarter of the film 's £ 7 million budget .
but it wo n't be until december 2007 , when st. trinian 's goes on release in the uk , that barnaby and the rest of his team will know if the dream of re-creating ealing 's golden days has become a reality .
the money programme : once more with ealing will be broadcast on bbc two at 1900 bst on july 27th .

many of the rooms have been taken by people whose houses were wrecked by the floods , explains the receptionist at the holiday inn hull marina .
" you 'd be lucky to find a room within a 50-mile radius , " agrees his colleague at a nearby travelodge as he hands over a set of keys to a group of builders , here to sort out the mess .
surveying the devastated shell of a terraced house in hessle , one of the city 's worst hit areas , local builder bill hanson is philosophical .
" it 's not the ideal way of getting work , " he says .
" but it 's got to be done by somebody . "
slow process mr hanson and his colleague rob gardiner , both of laurhan building & joinery services , are hard at work , gutting a house in princes avenue , a narrow road of semis just off one of hessle 's shopping streets . "

in amongst all of this is a scattering of caravans that are expected to house families for months to come .
everyone knows there is no quick fix , explains mr hanson , having just ripped out the kitchen and chipped off the plaster , lifted the floorboards and pulled out the wiring .
now the house must be left for weeks , if not months , before any more work can be done .
it is clear that there will be plenty of work for the building trade well into 2008 and beyond .
" it is almost like building a new house , " explains frank sciabica who has come up from essex to help with the flood damage restoration in the region .
" you ca n't put carpets into a property that has n't been dried out and decorated . "
brisk retailing around the corner from princes avenue , paul brannon , a salesman at dennis cowen carpets , is run off his feet . "
we 've picked up an awful lot of business from flood-damaged engines " car dealer nigel demaline july has been very busy , " he says .
" but the work 's got to be done .
there are a lot of elderly people on their own , sat in their home with the wet carpets down . "
most of the customers coming in are asking for quotes to send to the insurers , or to compare with the insurance companies ' valuations , mr brannon explains .
and then there are those eager to beat the anticipated rush .
" yesterday , i took a month 's worth of orders in a morning , " mr brannon says .
" and it was n't a lot of flood work .
" people realise that ' crikey , all the carpet shops in hull are going to be swamped ' , so they 're placing orders before the flood work comes in . "
shopping lists there seems to be a natural order to hull 's embryonic shopping spree , which is set to balloon once the city 's revival gathers pace .
first things first , explains mr brannon .
" you ca n't buy wellington boots in hull for love nor money , and try to get a caravan ?
you ca n't get them either . "
local car dealers also report that business is brisk , as people come in to replace flood-damaged cars that have been written off , or to have them repaired .
" we 've picked up an awful lot of business from flood-damaged engines , " says nigel demaline , general manager of a cluster of car dealerships selling nissan , vauxhall , renault and citroen .
" we 've had some major , major work . "
then , once the absolute necessities have been acquired , people soon start buying anything that goes into comfort areas - such as televisions and stereos .
and of course , adds mr brannon , all the white goods will need to be replaced .
" washing machines , fridges .
things that sit on the floor . "
decorative items , such as flowers and plants , come low on the flood victims ' shopping lists .
in the florist 's shop window , down the road from the carpet shop , the sale signs loom large .

surveying the devastated shell of a terraced house in hessle , one of the city 's worst hit areas , local builder bill hanson is philosophical .
" it 's not the ideal way of getting work , " he says .
" but it 's got to be done by somebody . "

now a new generation of film makers are running the studio and making comedies they hope will attract a global audience and win major box office receipts .
film producer and head of ealing studios , barnaby thompson 's latest film is a new chapter in the tale of the naughtiest girls ' school in fiction : st trinian 's .
it 's a £ 7m production , starring rupert everett and colin firth which he hopes will resurrect interest in the st. trinian 's brand , his studio and put ealing back on the global film map .
there 's a lot to live up to , as in the 1940s and 1950s legendary producer sir michael balcon made a string of comedy film hits at ealing .
classics including " kind hearts and coronets " , " whisky galore " , " passport to pimlico " and the oscar-winning " lavender hill mob " ensured that ealing studios represented a high water mark in british film making .

st trinian 's has been filming in trafalgar square , london in 2000 barnaby thompson led a consortium that brought the studios back and invested millions in modernising the soundstages and production facilities .
they wanted to create a modern studio business model that could withstand the boom-and-bust nature of the industry .
to do this they have opened up other revenue sources by renting ealing 's facilities to other film makers , including woody allen and gurinder chadha - who is based on the site .

st trinians but ultimately it 's the films that the company is known for , and the success of st.trinians is critical for its future .
barnaby made a strong start at ealing with a remake of " the importance of being earnest " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- and the uk 's first computer generated animation film , " valiant " -lrb- 2003 -rrb- .
but more recent productions , including ant and dec in " alien autopsy " -lrb- 2005 -rrb- and its most recent release " i want candy " -lrb- 2007 -rrb- , performed poorly with both critics and at the box office .
barnaby thompson says : " it 's always disappointing when your films do n't work because we 're an industry that feeds off hits .
" if " i want candy " had done as well as i thought it was going to do we stood to make a lot of money out of it . "
the ealing crew are hoping to bounce back with st. trinian 's .

putting on a good sales drive to international distributors at the 2007 cannes film festival is crucial to its commercial success .

film producer and head of ealing studios , barnaby thompson 's latest film is a new chapter in the tale of the naughtiest girls ' school in fiction : st trinian 's .
it 's a £ 7m production , starring rupert everett and colin firth which he hopes will resurrect interest in the st. trinian 's brand , his studio and put ealing back on the global film map .
there 's a lot to live up to , as in the 1940s and 1950s legendary producer sir michael balcon made a string of comedy film hits at ealing .
classics including " kind hearts and coronets " , " whisky galore " , " passport to pimlico " and the oscar-winning " lavender hill mob " ensured that ealing studios represented a high water mark in british film making .

but more recent productions , including ant and dec in " alien autopsy " -lrb- 2005 -rrb- and its most recent release " i want candy " -lrb- 2007 -rrb- , performed poorly with both critics and at the box office .

many of the rooms have been taken by people whose houses were wrecked by the floods , explains the receptionist at the holiday inn hull marina .
" you 'd be lucky to find a room within a 50-mile radius , " agrees his colleague at a nearby travelodge as he hands over a set of keys to a group of builders , here to sort out the mess .
surveying the devastated shell of a terraced house in hessle , one of the city 's worst hit areas , local builder bill hanson is philosophical .
" it 's not the ideal way of getting work , " he says .
" but it 's got to be done by somebody . "
slow process mr hanson and his colleague rob gardiner , both of laurhan building & joinery services , are hard at work , gutting a house in princes avenue , a narrow road of semis just off one of hessle 's shopping streets .
people realise that ' crikey , all the carpet shops in hull are going to be swamped ' , so they 're placing orders before the flood work comes in paul brannon , dennis cowen carpets flooded homes total is revealed theirs is one of dozens of builders ' trucks lining the streets of hull these days , amidst skips filled to the brim with everything from rubble and floorboards to fridges and televisions .
in amongst all of this is a scattering of caravans that are expected to house families for months to come .
everyone knows there is no quick fix , explains mr hanson , having just ripped out the kitchen and chipped off the plaster , lifted the floorboards and pulled out the wiring .
now the house must be left for weeks , if not months , before any more work can be done .
it is clear that there will be plenty of work for the building trade well into 2008 and beyond .
" it is almost like building a new house , " explains frank sciabica who has come up from essex to help with the flood damage restoration in the region .
" you ca n't put carpets into a property that has n't been dried out and decorated . "
brisk retailing around the corner from princes avenue , paul brannon , a salesman at dennis cowen carpets , is run off his feet .
we 've picked up an awful lot of business from flood-damaged engines car dealer nigel demaline july has been very busy , " he says .
" but the work 's got to be done .
there are a lot of elderly people on their own , sat in their home with the wet carpets down . "
most of the customers coming in are asking for quotes to send to the insurers , or to compare with the insurance companies ' valuations , mr brannon explains .
and then there are those eager to beat the anticipated rush .
" yesterday , i took a month 's worth of orders in a morning , " mr brannon says .
" and it was n't a lot of flood work .
" people realise that ' crikey , all the carpet shops in hull are going to be swamped ' , so they 're placing orders before the flood work comes in . "
shopping lists there seems to be a natural order to hull 's embryonic shopping spree , which is set to balloon once the city 's revival gathers pace .
caravans and builders ' trucks line the streets of hull first things first , explains mr brannon .
" you ca n't buy wellington boots in hull for love nor money , and try to get a caravan ?
you ca n't get them either . "
local car dealers also report that business is brisk , as people come in to replace flood-damaged cars that have been written off , or to have them repaired .
" we 've picked up an awful lot of business from flood-damaged engines , " says nigel demaline , general manager of a cluster of car dealerships selling nissan , vauxhall , renault and citroen .
" we 've had some major , major work . "
then , once the absolute necessities have been acquired , people soon start buying anything that goes into comfort areas - such as televisions and stereos .
and of course , adds mr brannon , all the white goods will need to be replaced .
" washing machines , fridges .
things that sit on the floor . "
decorative items , such as flowers and plants , come low on the flood victims ' shopping lists .
in the florist 's shop window , down the road from the carpet shop , the sale signs loom large .

fifteen main routes into the city centre will be chargeable manchester stands on the brink of a decision which could lead to drivers paying up to £ 5 a day to make a return journey to the city centre .
but is congestion charging really the answer to transport problems ?
what do john mcgoldrick , from the national alliance against tolls -lrb- naat -rrb- and roger jones , chairman of the greater manchester passenger transport authority -lrb- gmpta -rrb- , believe the charges would bring ?
will charging reduce congestion ?
john mcgoldrick : charging does reduce the number of vehicles and people entering the tolled areas and in london it did have a short-term effect in increasing traffic speeds .
but the fifth annual monitoring report issued by transport for london in july showed traffic speeds in the charge zone were back to where they were before the charge was introduced - under nine miles per hour during the day .
even if it did work , a toll tax is very expensive and inefficient .
the london charge costs £ 7 per vehicle per day to collect or £ 4 if you offset the cost with the income from late payment fines that start at £ 100 .
roger jones : for greater manchester , congestion charging alone would not reduce congestion enough to halt its negative impact on the city region 's economy .
what has been proposed is a £ 3bn public transport revolution - including the extension of the metrolink , more and better buses , longer trains and more routes linking all 10 districts of greater manchester - followed by a limited congestion charge , introduced only once these improvements are in place .
the independent modelling undertaken on behalf of the gmpta shows the provision of safe , reliable , quality alternatives to car travel at peak times alongside a targeted congestion charge would reduce congestion on the region 's roads to a level that would allow its economy to continue to grow .
will charging reduce pollution ?
roger jones : congestion charging alone can only have a limited impact on changing travel behaviour .
however , greater manchester 's proposals are for a combination of vastly improved public transport choices alongside the targeted congestion charge , and it is predicted that this will encourage changes in travel behaviour resulting in a 10 % reduction in co2 emissions during rush hour .
both agree that the charge would have a limited impact on pollution john mcgoldrick : no .
the suggestion that any form of tolls reduces " global pollution " is a red herring .
the way to encourage fuel economy and minimise emissions from vehicles is through improvements to vehicle engines and exhausts and through existing fuel taxes .
tolls in any form do nothing to encourage fuel economy and will make it worse as some drivers will make longer journeys to avoid tolls .
will charging affect local jobs ?
john mcgoldrick : it has been suggested that jobs will be lost if charges are not introduced but common sense says that people , businesses and their customers will avoid a tolled area where there is a choice .
the last survey -lrb- august 2005 -rrb- carried out by the london chamber of commerce said 84 % of retailers in the central charging zone reported a fall in takings during the first eighteen months of the scheme .
almost 63 % reported a fall in customer numbers .
37 % of retailers in the central charging zone reduced their staffing levels as a result of the congestion charge roger jones : the economy of greater manchester is booming .
however , one of the key constraints on this growth is the growing problem of congestion .
if congestion in greater manchester continues to grow unchecked , by 2021 the city region will have lost out on 30,000 jobs .
this is unacceptable , and the combination of £ 3bn of public transport improvements and a targeted congestion charge within the proposals would ensure that each of the new 210,000 jobs predicted to be created in greater manchester can be realised and sustained .
many leading cities across the world are benefiting from the introduction of successful congestion charging schemes .
can charging create enough cash for public transport ?
roger jones : the £ 3bn funding package breaks down as follows . £ 1.2bn would come directly from the transport innovation fund -lrb- tif -rrb- with the other £ 1.8bn borrowed from central government - to be paid back with the revenue of 30 years of the congestion charge .
this financial package is robust , and the repayment scheme conservatively calculated - allowing for a considerable drop in the number of cars once the public transport improvements are in place and the congestion charge introduced .
john mcgoldrick : only at a terrible cost to people and businesses .
the greater manchester plan includes borrowing nearly £ 2bn to spend on transport and to repay that over 25 years or so from the road tolls .
the interest will nearly double the amount to be repaid .
but worst of all is that based on the cost of collecting the london charge , if the manchester daily toll was fixed at £ 5 per vehicle you would make a profit of only about £ 1 per vehicle from the tolls and late payment fines .
you would need to collect many billions from drivers and business to make enough profits to repay the £ 2 billion and the interest on it .
is the charge unfair on poorer people ?
john mcgoldrick : yes , of course it is .
part of the purpose of any road toll is to discourage drivers .
it is bound to be the less well off who are driven off the road .
it has been suggested that there could be some form of scheme whereby poorer drivers would get a discount on the toll .
can anybody really believe that such a means tested scheme would be practical or cover all of the worst off drivers ?
roger jones : greater manchester 's tif proposals are for a vast £ 3bn improvement in public transport right across greater manchester - the biggest public transport investment in the uk ever outside london - followed by a targeted congestion charge .
under our proposals greater manchester 's congestion charge would be discounted for vulnerable groups , it would only operate between 7-9.30am towards manchester city centre and 4-6.30pm outbound .
therefore a majority of journeys during the day , away from the flow of traffic , orbital journeys , or at weekend would not be charged .
greater manchester 's tif proposals are about providing alternatives to the car , providing a sustainable future for our children , and allowing the economy of the city region to continue to flourish as it should .

roger jones : the £ 3bn funding package breaks down as follows . £ 1.2bn would come directly from the transport innovation fund -lrb- tif -rrb- with the other £ 1.8bn borrowed from central government - to be paid back with the revenue of 30 years of the congestion charge .
this financial package is robust , and the repayment scheme conservatively calculated - allowing for a considerable drop in the number of cars once the public transport improvements are in place and the congestion charge introduced .
john mcgoldrick : only at a terrible cost to people and businesses .
the greater manchester plan includes borrowing nearly £ 2bn to spend on transport and to repay that over 25 years or so from the road tolls .
the interest will nearly double the amount to be repaid .
but worst of all is that based on the cost of collecting the london charge , if the manchester daily toll was fixed at £ 5 per vehicle you would make a profit of only about £ 1 per vehicle from the tolls and late payment fines .
you would need to collect many billions from drivers and business to make enough profits to repay the £ 2 billion and the interest on it .
is the charge unfair on poorer people ?
john mcgoldrick : yes , of course it is .
part of the purpose of any road toll is to discourage drivers .
it is bound to be the less well off who are driven off the road .
it has been suggested that there could be some form of scheme whereby poorer drivers would get a discount on the toll .
can anybody really believe that such a means tested scheme would be practical or cover all of the worst off drivers ?
roger jones : greater manchester 's tif proposals are for a vast £ 3bn improvement in public transport right across greater manchester - the biggest public transport investment in the uk ever outside london - followed by a targeted congestion charge .
under our proposals greater manchester 's congestion charge would be discounted for vulnerable groups , it would only operate between 7-9.30am towards manchester city centre and 4-6.30pm outbound .
therefore a majority of journeys during the day , away from the flow of traffic , orbital journeys , or at weekend would not be charged .
greater manchester 's tif proposals are about providing alternatives to the car , providing a sustainable future for our children , and allowing the economy of the city region to continue to flourish as it should .

fifteen main routes into the city centre will be chargeable manchester stands on the brink of a decision which could lead to drivers paying up to £ 5 a day to make a return journey to the city centre .
but is congestion charging really the answer to transport problems ?
what do john mcgoldrick , from the national alliance against tolls -lrb- naat -rrb- and roger jones , chairman of the greater manchester passenger transport authority -lrb- gmpta -rrb- , believe the charges would bring ?
will charging reduce congestion ?
john mcgoldrick : charging does reduce the number of vehicles and people entering the tolled areas and in london it did have a short-term effect in increasing traffic speeds .
but the fifth annual monitoring report issued by transport for london in july showed traffic speeds in the charge zone were back to where they were before the charge was introduced - under nine miles per hour during the day .
even if it did work , a toll tax is very expensive and inefficient .
the london charge costs £ 7 per vehicle per day to collect or £ 4 if you offset the cost with the income from late payment fines that start at £ 100 .
roger jones : for greater manchester , congestion charging alone would not reduce congestion enough to halt its negative impact on the city region 's economy .
what has been proposed is a £ 3bn public transport revolution - including the extension of the metrolink , more and better buses , longer trains and more routes linking all 10 districts of greater manchester - followed by a limited congestion charge , introduced only once these improvements are in place .
the independent modelling undertaken on behalf of the gmpta shows the provision of safe , reliable , quality alternatives to car travel at peak times alongside a targeted congestion charge would reduce congestion on the region 's roads to a level that would allow its economy to continue to grow .
will charging reduce pollution ?
roger jones : congestion charging alone can only have a limited impact on changing travel behaviour .
however , greater manchester 's proposals are for a combination of vastly improved public transport choices alongside the targeted congestion charge , and it is predicted that this will encourage changes in travel behaviour resulting in a 10 % reduction in co2 emissions during rush hour .
both agree that the charge would have a limited impact on pollution john mcgoldrick : no .
the suggestion that any form of tolls reduces " global pollution " is a red herring .
the way to encourage fuel economy and minimise emissions from vehicles is through improvements to vehicle engines and exhausts and through existing fuel taxes .
tolls in any form do nothing to encourage fuel economy and will make it worse as some drivers will make longer journeys to avoid tolls .
will charging affect local jobs ?
john mcgoldrick : it has been suggested that jobs will be lost if charges are not introduced but common sense says that people , businesses and their customers will avoid a tolled area where there is a choice .
the last survey -lrb- august 2005 -rrb- carried out by the london chamber of commerce said 84 % of retailers in the central charging zone reported a fall in takings during the first eighteen months of the scheme .
almost 63 % reported a fall in customer numbers .
37 % of retailers in the central charging zone reduced their staffing levels as a result of the congestion charge roger jones : the economy of greater manchester is booming .
however , one of the key constraints on this growth is the growing problem of congestion .
if congestion in greater manchester continues to grow unchecked , by 2021 the city region will have lost out on 30,000 jobs .
this is unacceptable , and the combination of £ 3bn of public transport improvements and a targeted congestion charge within the proposals would ensure that each of the new 210,000 jobs predicted to be created in greater manchester can be realised and sustained .

roger jones : greater manchester 's tif proposals are for a vast £ 3bn improvement in public transport right across greater manchester - the biggest public transport investment in the uk ever outside london - followed by a targeted congestion charge .
under our proposals greater manchester 's congestion charge would be discounted for vulnerable groups , it would only operate between 7-9.30am towards manchester city centre and 4-6.30pm outbound .
therefore a majority of journeys during the day , away from the flow of traffic , orbital journeys , or at weekend would not be charged .
greater manchester 's tif proposals are about providing alternatives to the car , providing a sustainable future for our children , and allowing the economy of the city region to continue to flourish as it should .

fifteen main routes into the city centre will be chargeable manchester stands on the brink of a decision which could lead to drivers paying up to £ 5 a day to make a return journey to the city centre .
but is congestion charging really the answer to transport problems ?
what do john mcgoldrick , from the national alliance against tolls -lrb- naat -rrb- and roger jones , chairman of the greater manchester passenger transport authority -lrb- gmpta -rrb- , believe the charges would bring ?
will charging reduce congestion ?
john mcgoldrick : charging does reduce the number of vehicles and people entering the tolled areas and in london it did have a short-term effect in increasing traffic speeds .
but the fifth annual monitoring report issued by transport for london in july showed traffic speeds in the charge zone were back to where they were before the charge was introduced - under nine miles per hour during the day .
even if it did work , a toll tax is very expensive and inefficient .
the london charge costs £ 7 per vehicle per day to collect or £ 4 if you offset the cost with the income from late payment fines that start at £ 100 .
roger jones : for greater manchester , congestion charging alone would not reduce congestion enough to halt its negative impact on the city region 's economy .
what has been proposed is a £ 3bn public transport revolution - including the extension of the metrolink , more and better buses , longer trains and more routes linking all 10 districts of greater manchester - followed by a limited congestion charge , introduced only once these improvements are in place .
the independent modelling undertaken on behalf of the gmpta shows the provision of safe , reliable , quality alternatives to car travel at peak times alongside a targeted congestion charge would reduce congestion on the region 's roads to a level that would allow its economy to continue to grow .
will charging reduce pollution ?
roger jones : congestion charging alone can only have a limited impact on changing travel behaviour .
however , greater manchester 's proposals are for a combination of vastly improved public transport choices alongside the targeted congestion charge , and it is predicted that this will encourage changes in travel behaviour resulting in a 10 % reduction in co2 emissions during rush hour .
both agree that the charge would have a limited impact on pollution john mcgoldrick : no .
the suggestion that any form of tolls reduces " global pollution " is a red herring .
the way to encourage fuel economy and minimise emissions from vehicles is through improvements to vehicle engines and exhausts and through existing fuel taxes .
tolls in any form do nothing to encourage fuel economy and will make it worse as some drivers will make longer journeys to avoid tolls .
will charging affect local jobs ?
john mcgoldrick : it has been suggested that jobs will be lost if charges are not introduced but common sense says that people , businesses and their customers will avoid a tolled area where there is a choice .
the last survey -lrb- august 2005 -rrb- carried out by the london chamber of commerce said 84 % of retailers in the central charging zone reported a fall in takings during the first eighteen months of the scheme .
almost 63 % reported a fall in customer numbers .
37 % of retailers in the central charging zone reduced their staffing levels as a result of the congestion charge roger jones : the economy of greater manchester is booming .
however , one of the key constraints on this growth is the growing problem of congestion .
if congestion in greater manchester continues to grow unchecked , by 2021 the city region will have lost out on 30,000 jobs .
this is unacceptable , and the combination of £ 3bn of public transport improvements and a targeted congestion charge within the proposals would ensure that each of the new 210,000 jobs predicted to be created in greater manchester can be realised and sustained .
many leading cities across the world are benefiting from the introduction of successful congestion charging schemes .
can charging create enough cash for public transport ?
roger jones : the £ 3bn funding package breaks down as follows . £ 1.2bn would come directly from the transport innovation fund -lrb- tif -rrb- with the other £ 1.8bn borrowed from central government - to be paid back with the revenue of 30 years of the congestion charge .
this financial package is robust , and the repayment scheme conservatively calculated - allowing for a considerable drop in the number of cars once the public transport improvements are in place and the congestion charge introduced .
john mcgoldrick : only at a terrible cost to people and businesses .
the greater manchester plan includes borrowing nearly £ 2bn to spend on transport and to repay that over 25 years or so from the road tolls .
the interest will nearly double the amount to be repaid .
but worst of all is that based on the cost of collecting the london charge , if the manchester daily toll was fixed at £ 5 per vehicle you would make a profit of only about £ 1 per vehicle from the tolls and late payment fines .
you would need to collect many billions from drivers and business to make enough profits to repay the £ 2 billion and the interest on it .

fifteen main routes into the city centre will be chargeable manchester stands on the brink of a decision which could lead to drivers paying up to £ 5 a day to make a return journey to the city centre .
but is congestion charging really the answer to transport problems ?
what do john mcgoldrick , from the national alliance against tolls -lrb- naat -rrb- and roger jones , chairman of the greater manchester passenger transport authority -lrb- gmpta -rrb- , believe the charges would bring ?
will charging reduce congestion ?
john mcgoldrick : charging does reduce the number of vehicles and people entering the tolled areas and in london it did have a short-term effect in increasing traffic speeds .
but the fifth annual monitoring report issued by transport for london in july showed traffic speeds in the charge zone were back to where they were before the charge was introduced - under nine miles per hour during the day .
even if it did work , a toll tax is very expensive and inefficient .
the london charge costs £ 7 per vehicle per day to collect or £ 4 if you offset the cost with the income from late payment fines that start at £ 100 .
roger jones : for greater manchester , congestion charging alone would not reduce congestion enough to halt its negative impact on the city region 's economy .
what has been proposed is a £ 3bn public transport revolution - including the extension of the metrolink , more and better buses , longer trains and more routes linking all 10 districts of greater manchester - followed by a limited congestion charge , introduced only once these improvements are in place .
the independent modelling undertaken on behalf of the gmpta shows the provision of safe , reliable , quality alternatives to car travel at peak times alongside a targeted congestion charge would reduce congestion on the region 's roads to a level that would allow its economy to continue to grow .
will charging reduce pollution ?
roger jones : congestion charging alone can only have a limited impact on changing travel behaviour .
however , greater manchester 's proposals are for a combination of vastly improved public transport choices alongside the targeted congestion charge , and it is predicted that this will encourage changes in travel behaviour resulting in a 10 % reduction in co2 emissions during rush hour .
both agree that the charge would have a limited impact on pollution john mcgoldrick : no .
the suggestion that any form of tolls reduces " global pollution " is a red herring .
the way to encourage fuel economy and minimise emissions from vehicles is through improvements to vehicle engines and exhausts and through existing fuel taxes .
tolls in any form do nothing to encourage fuel economy and will make it worse as some drivers will make longer journeys to avoid tolls .
will charging affect local jobs ?
john mcgoldrick : it has been suggested that jobs will be lost if charges are not introduced but common sense says that people , businesses and their customers will avoid a tolled area where there is a choice .
the last survey -lrb- august 2005 -rrb- carried out by the london chamber of commerce said 84 % of retailers in the central charging zone reported a fall in takings during the first eighteen months of the scheme .
almost 63 % reported a fall in customer numbers .
37 % of retailers in the central charging zone reduced their staffing levels as a result of the congestion charge roger jones : the economy of greater manchester is booming .
however , one of the key constraints on this growth is the growing problem of congestion .
if congestion in greater manchester continues to grow unchecked , by 2021 the city region will have lost out on 30,000 jobs .
this is unacceptable , and the combination of £ 3bn of public transport improvements and a targeted congestion charge within the proposals would ensure that each of the new 210,000 jobs predicted to be created in greater manchester can be realised and sustained .
many leading cities across the world are benefiting from the introduction of successful congestion charging schemes .
can charging create enough cash for public transport ?
roger jones : the £ 3bn funding package breaks down as follows . £ 1.2bn would come directly from the transport innovation fund -lrb- tif -rrb- with the other £ 1.8bn borrowed from central government - to be paid back with the revenue of 30 years of the congestion charge .
this financial package is robust , and the repayment scheme conservatively calculated - allowing for a considerable drop in the number of cars once the public transport improvements are in place and the congestion charge introduced .
john mcgoldrick : only at a terrible cost to people and businesses .
the greater manchester plan includes borrowing nearly £ 2bn to spend on transport and to repay that over 25 years or so from the road tolls .
the interest will nearly double the amount to be repaid .
but worst of all is that based on the cost of collecting the london charge , if the manchester daily toll was fixed at £ 5 per vehicle you would make a profit of only about £ 1 per vehicle from the tolls and late payment fines .
you would need to collect many billions from drivers and business to make enough profits to repay the £ 2 billion and the interest on it .
is the charge unfair on poorer people ?
john mcgoldrick : yes , of course it is .
part of the purpose of any road toll is to discourage drivers .
it is bound to be the less well off who are driven off the road .
it has been suggested that there could be some form of scheme whereby poorer drivers would get a discount on the toll .
can anybody really believe that such a means tested scheme would be practical or cover all of the worst off drivers ?
roger jones : greater manchester 's tif proposals are for a vast £ 3bn improvement in public transport right across greater manchester - the biggest public transport investment in the uk ever outside london - followed by a targeted congestion charge .
under our proposals greater manchester 's congestion charge would be discounted for vulnerable groups , it would only operate between 7-9.30am towards manchester city centre and 4-6.30pm outbound .
therefore a majority of journeys during the day , away from the flow of traffic , orbital journeys , or at weekend would not be charged .
greater manchester 's tif proposals are about providing alternatives to the car , providing a sustainable future for our children , and allowing the economy of the city region to continue to flourish as it should .

the probe , one of few of its kind in the uk , was bought by morriston hospital using donated money .
it can be used in open-heart surgery to enable surgeons to see real-time 3d images of a patient 's beating heart on a computer screen .
they describe the 3d images from the £ 60,000 machine as " like being able to take a walk inside a patient 's heart " .
consultant cardiologist adrian ionescu said : " the quality of the pictures is unparalleled , as there is no intervening structure between the probe and the heart .
" this is not experimental , but it 's certainly very , very new and hardly done in the uk . "
he said the probe would make a " significant difference " for some patients with complex heart problems . "

" the surgery is very difficult because often these ruptures occur in an area of the heart which the surgeon has great difficulty to see , even on a non-beating open heart .

the hospital 's cardiac unit has so far used the probe with around 15 patients , and is currently assessing early data with a view to publishing their findings later this year .

i would urge people to come and support the national eisteddfod . "

mr edwards said : " the weather is looking pretty good into next week .

pre-tax profits for the year to june fell 9 % to £ 724m .
sky says its profits " reflect investment for future growth " .
sky broadband reported a net operating loss of £ 169m , but signed up 716,000 new subscribers .
bskyb 's operating profit fell 7 % to £ 815m , but that was still better than analysts had been expecting .
bskyb released its subscriber numbers earlier this month , which showed that subscribers had grown 406,000 to 8.58 million .

" pay-as-you-go " technology records motorists ' movements as they ease smoothly across the city - in less than half the time it took back in the bad old days of 2007 .
the money raised through the congestion charge has brought more trams , taking you to rochdale , oldham and even ashton-under-lyne - connections only dreamed of back in 2004 .
there are hundreds of buses criss-crossing the city in dedicated lanes , whisking students , the elderly and sharp suited businessmen to their destinations .
more efficient but will it really be like that ?

in other words , income from motorists paying to enter the zones will be ploughed back into providing more buses and extra tram lines .
manchester is seeking £ 1bn from the government 's transport innovation fund -lrb- tif -rrb- and plans to borrow a further £ 2bn , which will be repaid by income from the congestion fees .
one of the key clauses to get the agreement for the congestion charge is that public transport must be improved .
in london , money raised from when the scheme began in 2003 until the end of financial year in 2006 just about covered the start up costs .
transport for london said that about 70,000 fewer cars a day entered the zone last year due to the £ 8 toll and that £ 123m was generated for the city .
that money is being used to improve bus services .
' fewer accidents ' so when and how will manchester see a benefit from the c-charge ?
professor chris nash , from the institute of transport studies , believes in five years time with the introduction of a congestion charge there will be significantly less traffic .
" faster journey times , an improved environment , fewer accidents on the roads and better road conditions for buses are all possible benefits , " he added .
businesses say that congestion charging is a price worth paying the london charge has been expensive to implement , but successful in cutting down the number of vehicles entering the capital .
but they already had a long established tube , rail and bus network .
what about manchester ?
" with improved bus services , which reduced congestion facilitates , plus the tram and train it has a good starting point , " professor nash said .
manchester 's chamber of commerce surveyed its members and found that for many the current congestion problem was costing them money .
just over half those who responded felt congestion charging was a price worth paying for angie robinson , greater manchester chamber of commerce angie robinson , chief executive of greater manchester chamber of commerce , said its survey had generated the most responses ever .
" just over half those who responded felt congestion charging was a price worth paying for reduced congestion on the road if linked to guaranteed public transport improvements . "
this , of course , means that the other half of businesses are against the charge , a statistic which emerged from agma 's public opinion poll .
one vocal opponent has been peel holdings , owner of the trafford centre and liverpool john lennon airport .
its managing director andrew simpson has said the proposed charge was " of serious concern " to businesses and could drive away potential investors in the city .
there is a risk that some businesses , particularly in retail , may move out of the city to where they can avoid the charge but from professor nash 's experience , most businesses will gain .
so what lessons can manchester learn from other places that have the charge ?
professor nash said : " generally the experience of london , stockholm , oslo and singapore has been positive , although all cities are different and each scheme needs to be tailored to individual circumstances .
" the manchester scheme is complex , there are two rings of charges and two charge periods , but it should be fairer and more effective . "

" faster journey times , an improved environment , fewer accidents on the roads and better road conditions for buses are all possible benefits , " he added .
businesses say that congestion charging is a price worth paying the london charge has been expensive to implement , but successful in cutting down the number of vehicles entering the capital .
but they already had a long established tube , rail and bus network .
what about manchester ?
" with improved bus services , which reduced congestion facilitates , plus the tram and train it has a good starting point , " professor nash said .
manchester 's chamber of commerce surveyed its members and found that for many the current congestion problem was costing them money .
just over half those who responded felt congestion charging was a price worth paying for angie robinson , greater manchester chamber of commerce angie robinson , chief executive of greater manchester chamber of commerce , said its survey had generated the most responses ever .
" just over half those who responded felt congestion charging was a price worth paying for reduced congestion on the road if linked to guaranteed public transport improvements . "
this , of course , means that the other half of businesses are against the charge , a statistic which emerged from agma 's public opinion poll .
one vocal opponent has been peel holdings , owner of the trafford centre and liverpool john lennon airport .
its managing director andrew simpson has said the proposed charge was " of serious concern " to businesses and could drive away potential investors in the city .
there is a risk that some businesses , particularly in retail , may move out of the city to where they can avoid the charge but from professor nash 's experience , most businesses will gain .
so what lessons can manchester learn from other places that have the charge ?
professor nash said : " generally the experience of london , stockholm , oslo and singapore has been positive , although all cities are different and each scheme needs to be tailored to individual circumstances .
" the manchester scheme is complex , there are two rings of charges and two charge periods , but it should be fairer and more effective . "

" pay-as-you-go " technology records motorists ' movements as they ease smoothly across the city - in less than half the time it took back in the bad old days of 2007 .
the money raised through the congestion charge has brought more trams , taking you to rochdale , oldham and even ashton-under-lyne - connections only dreamed of back in 2004 .
there are hundreds of buses criss-crossing the city in dedicated lanes , whisking students , the elderly and sharp suited businessmen to their destinations .

in other words , income from motorists paying to enter the zones will be ploughed back into providing more buses and extra tram lines .
manchester is seeking £ 1bn from the government 's transport innovation fund -lrb- tif -rrb- and plans to borrow a further £ 2bn , which will be repaid by income from the congestion fees .
one of the key clauses to get the agreement for the congestion charge is that public transport must be improved .
in london , money raised from when the scheme began in 2003 until the end of financial year in 2006 just about covered the start up costs .
transport for london said that about 70,000 fewer cars a day entered the zone last year due to the £ 8 toll and that £ 123m was generated for the city .
that money is being used to improve bus services .
