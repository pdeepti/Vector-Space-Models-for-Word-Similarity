" the case undoubtedly has a large practical importance , " said gerda müller , the karlsruhe court 's vice president .
she added that the verdict also applies to sites that allow parties to reply directly to the accusations against them . the case in question was initiated when the head of an association to fight child pornography was labeled a pedophile twice in an internet forum dealing with sexual abuse .
though the authors in both cases left the message with pseudonyms , the association 's head was able to obtain the name of the author for one entry . the association 's head sued for the removal of the two entries from the forum .
the high court 's decision to hold both the author and forum 's operators responsible for entries overturned a lower court 's decision that forced operators to remove forum entries only when they were written anonymously . careful screening required the main point of debate in the case was whether individuals can hold site operators accountable for content posted by third parties , with the defendant 's lawyers arguing the sites simply provide a forum for public discussion and can not control what is said .
lawyers for the plaintiff said that forum operators should be held accountable for messages their forums spread . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling may change what information forum operators require from users the decision will force internet forum operators to undertake more efforts validate users ' identities before allowing them to post comments , ralf möbius , an internet lawyer in hanover said . " they will definitely have to check their sites more regularly , " he told die zeit newspaper .
" for a long time the perception was that one could not pursue legal action against the place where wrongdoing occurs .
naturally the operator has to do something about entries in his forum .

" tolerated " refugees in germany , those who have not been given asylum status but could not be sent back to the country of origin for humanitarian reasons .
under the agreement , long-term foreigners in germany who have be given until the end of 2009 to find a job . " it creates a new staring point for affected people who want to live here in germany , " christian democratic union migration expert maria böhmer told deutschlandfunk radio , adding that joining the workforce would aid foreigners ' integration . sebastian edathy , the head of the bundestag 's interior committee and social democratic party member told rbb-inforadio the compromise was " sensible and humane " because " the long-time tolerated are not required to live off welfare and instead are allowed to work . " there are currently about 180,000 people , mainly from afghanistan , iraq and kosovo , in germany with " tolerated " status after their applications for asylum denied .
edathy said it would be difficult to estimate how many of them would be able to find jobs in germany . language skills highlighted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians said being able to speak german was crucial for foreigners additionally , the compromise requires spouses who immigrate to germany be at least 18 years old and have basic german language skills .
the deal also threatens unspecified sanctions for foreigners who refuse to participate in language and integration courses . an emphasis on language proficiency in the nearly 500-page bill , which requires parliamentary approval before becoming law , was a crucial point for hans-peter uhl , the christian conservatives ' interior affairs expert . he said being able to converse in german was " the least that can be expected when someone who wants to move the center of his life to germany . " openness to foreigners needed the government also called for germans to be open to the immigrants living around them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's interior minister called for openness and tolerance toward foreigners " in addition to what the state is doing and the honest willingness of migrants to work , we also need support from the general population to confront the people coming to us in a open and tolerant manner , " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble wrote in an op-ed for die zeit newspaper . co-leader of the opposition greens party , claudia roth , had harsh words for the draft , calling it the result of a " competition in paltriness " that would only benefit those " who proved economically useful " while those truly in need of protection would get no help at all . organizations representing foreigners in germany also expressed their unhappiness about the deal in an open letter to chancellor angela merkel . signed by germany 's protestant and catholic churches as well as amnesty international and pro aysl , the letter was critical of the language requirements saying that courses were difficult for foreigners living in rural areas to attend and that requiring language skills for spouses was discriminatory . a spokeswoman for the dgb trade union federation said the new regulations " are not a solution to better integration , but only deal with old cases which only benefit a minority .

6 , if germany did not pull its troops out of afghanistan by the beginning of last week .
the german government has refused to meet the demand . the hostages ' fate remains unknown more than a week after the kidnappers ' ultimatum ran out . they are n't the first germans to be kidnapped in iraq .
despite clear instructions from the foreign ministry not to travel to or stay in iraq and a string of incidents involving the kidnapping of german nationals by local militias , some 100 germans still remain in the country . ministry spokesman jens plötner said that number included embassy officials , people traveling there for short trips and germans with family bonds to iraqis - mainly german women who are married to iraqis and have lived in the country for decades . businesses looking for locals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin crisis staff said they are " very concerned " about the kidnapped germans but whether they are married to iraqis and live in the country or are only in iraq a short time , foreigners are at greater danger than locals since they make higher profile targets , according to nadine flache of the berlin-based rebuild iraq recruitment program , which matches german and other european companies with local workers . given the rampant instablity in the country , most german companies are now relying heavily on locals to represent them instead of risking sending their own staff to iraq . " german and european companies can run projects in iraq while keeping their staff 's travel to a minimum , " she said , adding that iraqis with university degrees and technical skills are among the most sought after , but companies have also looked for tax advisors and cooks . though gelan khulusi , head of midan , a german-iraqi association for midsized businesses , would not name the handful of german companies in iraq he advises , he said germans are making short trips to iraq . germans keep visits short and get help " some iraqi ministries or companies sometimes require german or other foreign partners to be present to sign contracts , " he told german public broadcaster zdf .

" people are very surprised when we confront them with actual number on attacks , shootings and how many people are killed in other regions , " he said . while wary of stating hard numbers , breingan said he and his team of about 800 bodyguards has worked with mid-sized and large german companies in the past and that more and more germans have recently contacted him to protect their projects and employees . he said his company offers means of protection in iraq , varying from high-profile convoys to less conspicuous drivers at costs of between 4,000 euros and 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 5,337 and $ 10,675 -rrb- per day depending on the task and location . aid organizations ' work impaired aid organizations ' staff members are also at risk - at least 84 aid workers have been killed in iraq since 2003 , according to international ngo coordination group ncci - but the groups ' regular and long-term contact with iraqis makes it difficult for them to avoid becoming kidnapping targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : care international 's margaret hassan was kidnapped and killed in iraq in 2004 bonn-based help , the last german aid organization working in iraq , stopped its projects at the beginning of march , spokesman berthold engelmann said .
the group had been working on supplying water and defusing mines and unexploded bombs . " we stopped using international workers in september 2004 , " he said .
" we continued working with local workers until the end of february but because of the security situation , we ca n't work there at all at the moment . " kidnappings drove organization away should the country become relatively safer , frank mc areavey , who organized help 's programs in iraq , said he would have no qualms about returning to the country , adding that there had never been any reprisals against help workers . " when workers arrived in april 2003 there was no reason to be scared , " he said from amman , where he is evaluating future help projects .

currently , italy and greece are seen as potential key holdouts . public access to the records " is a moral and humanitarian imperative , " especially because of " the short time left to holocaust survivors , " the house committee said . the panel is chaired by tom lantos , 79 , a hungarian-born democratic representative from california and the only holocaust survivor in the us congress .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 28.03.2007 euro 2008 half-time report card : qualifying surprises abound großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eyes on the prize : euro 2008 may be over a year away but the trophy is on everyone 's mind the euro 2008 qualifiers reached the half-way stage wednesday .
while a few of the groups are reverting to type , others have thrown up a number of surprises .
dw-world.de takes a look at the standings . germany are on course to qualify in style for next summer 's european championships in austria and switzerland .
with four wins and a draw in their first five group d games , jogi löw 's team sit on top with 13 points at the halfway mark .
with six games to go in the qualifiers , germany would have to suffer a major reverse in fortunes to find themselves out of the tournament before it even begins . elsewhere in the qualification groups , things are not going so swimmingly for other nations with high hopes of making it to the championships and mounting a serious challenge for the euro 2008 title . group a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's ever-modest ronaldo scored twice saturday things are evenly poised in group a with poland , finland , portugal and serbia all contesting the two qualifying places .
leaders poland thrashed the minnows of azerbaijan 5-0 on saturday and could be in for another hatful against armenia on wednesday . finland could maintain pressure on the poles by adding more misery to the azerbaijanis and portugal , who romped to a 4-0 win over belgium at the weekend , could put some distance between themselves and serbia in fourth by beating the serbians in oporto .
given the form of the top three teams and their opposition , the table is unlikely to change after wednesday 's matches . group b fans of the game will probably view group b 's current status with a lot of surprise and maybe a little happiness .
scotland sit atop of a group which includes world champions italy , world cup runners-up france and quarter-finalists ukraine .
if the scots , under new manager alex mcleish , reach the finals , it will be the first major championship they 've been to since the 1996 european championships in england .
equal on points with raymond domenech 's les bleus , scotland take on fourth-placed italy on wednesday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup success has not been carried over for italy roberto donadoni inherited the world champions from predecessor marcello lippi but has not been able to instill the same level of performance from the azzurri .
two wins , a draw and a defeat in their four games leave the italians needing a win against scotland to keep pace with the unlikely group leaders .
meanwhile , france take a break from qualification by playing austria in a friendly after beating lithuania 1-0 on saturday . group c turkey 's annihilation of greece in piraeus at the weekend was a victory in every way .
the 4-1 away win took turkey three points clear of their bitter sporting , historical and geopolitical rival and gave the turks the spoils in the contest for national pride .
their next opponents , fourth-placed norway , could improve their group position by two places if reigning euro champs greece lose to malta .
third-placed bosnia-herzegovina do n't play another qualifier until june when they take on current leaders turkey at home . group d unbeaten germany can look down from the top of the group on wednesday knowing that even if the second-placed czech republic beat strugglers cyprus in prague , which they should , jogi löw 's free-scoring team will still be leaders on goal difference with a game in hand on their nearest rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish and czechs are chasing leaders germany elsewhere , the republic of ireland in third look to get another three points on the board against slovakia in fourth .
the irish have been disappointing and under-fire coach steve staunton will take little solace in a win on wednesday , even though it would take them up to second if the czechs inexplicably lose .
ireland will have played two games more than germany and one more than the czech republic , meaning the breathing space afforded them by victory over slovakia could be short-lived . group e croatia and russia continue to battle it out for supremacy in group e with favorites for qualification england languishing in third .
both the top two teams remain unbeaten , with russia in second after drawing one more game than leaders croatia .
neither team plays again in group e until june which gives england a chance to collect some much needed points .
a loss against croatia , and goalless draws with macedonia and israel have left steve mcclaren 's team floundering in their worst competitive run since 1981 with just one goal in their last five matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wayne rooney and england are having scoring problems even a comprehensive win against bottom team andorra could see england drop to fourth if israel win against second-from-bottom estonia .
uefa 's placing system means that teams drawn on points are placed in regard to their results against each other .
the draw in tel-aviv would be counted in israel 's favor and could spell darker days for england even if they run riot in barcelona . group f there are more surprises in group f where favorites spain find themselves stuttering in fourth place , six points behind group leaders sweden .
luis aragones ' unquestionably talented team are once again under-achieving and despite beating third-placed denmark 2-1 at the weekend , spain are already looking like a team which could struggle to qualify . northern ireland , however , a team which at the start of the campaign looked certain to finish way off the qualifying places , inhabit second place ahead of their top two clash with sweden on wednesday .
a win over lars lagerbaek 's team will lift them to the summit , albeit having played a game more . group g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : group g hug : the dutch intend to keep out in front group leaders holland look comfortable on eleven points ahead of wednesday 's matches but after playing a game more than both bulgaria in second and romania in third , their three point lead over the two eastern european teams could look more fragile after the coming round . bulgaria have a break until june , but romania could move up a place if they beat bottom team luxembourg as expected .
the dutch entertain the tricky slovenians at home and will hope to put some daylight between themselves and the hunting pack immediately behind by ending fifth-placed slovenia hopes of overtaking non-competing belarus in fourth . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de löw to blood german youngsters much to denmark 's chagrin germany 's coach joachim löw will ring the changes for wednesday night 's friendly against denmark by announcing an inexperienced 16-man squad aimed at blooding some of his rising stars .

" since the spanish government has still not withdrawn the illegal measures ... the commission has decided to refer the case -lrb- to court -rrb- , " the commission said in a statement . e.on made a take-over bid for spain 's biggest energy company endesa last year .
although eu regulators approved the merger unconditionally , it met with strong resistance from spanish politicians .
the spanish energy regulator cne then set a number of requirements for the sale . the commission ruled in september 2006 that these conditions violated eu rules by breaching measures on the free movement of capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain does n't want e.on to sell off endesa assests in the canary or balearic islands in response , spain lifted part of the conditions and limited their duration , but argued that the requirements were necessary to secure the national energy supply and did not create a problem because e.on had accepted them . the spanish government bound e.on to hold onto endesa 's brand name for five years , to refrain from selling off endesa 's electricity assets outside mainland spain and to keep using spanish fuel in endesa 's coal-powered plants . eu wants energy sector to open up the commission 's decision to refer the cast to court is the latest twist in a test case for european cross-border deals in the energy sector , underlining the eu executive 's determination to crack down on what it sees as spain 's protectionist behavior . the move comes just two days after e.on scored a key victory in its long-running battle for control of endesa .
on monday , endesa 's board backed e.on 's bid of 42.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 56.5 billion -rrb- for the takeover . counter bid for endesa however , spanish construction firm acciona and italian electricity company enel , both endesa shareholders , said they would launch a joint counter-bid for the spanish power company and would improve on e.on 's offer by at least one euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is fighting tooth and nail to stop the eon take-over of endesa while e.on 's latest bid values endesa at 42.4 billion euros , the enel-acciona offer would bring endesa 's value to 43.4 billion euros . e.on announced on tuesday had secured caja madrid 's 9.9 percent stake in endesa by means of a swap agreement with the spanish bank .
the german company , however , needs at least 50 percent for its bid to succeed . enel and acciona together already hold about a 46 per cent stake in endesa . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de endesa bidding war heats up as board backs e.on german energy giant e.on ag scored a key victory monday in its long-running battle for control of endesa after the spanish power company 's board backed its 42.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 56.5 billion -rrb- to take over the group .
-lrb- 26.03.2007 -rrb- e.on calls for european energy market , lowers endesa bid the head of germany 's largest energy concern , e.on , has called for a european energy market , grouping germany and six of its neighbors .
the company also watered down its bid for the planned takeover of spanish endesa .
-lrb- 07.03.2007 -rrb- eu condemns spain for hindering e.on 's endesa bid the european commission ruled tuesday that spain had breached eu regulations in trying to protect spanish electricity giant endesa from a takeover bid by german energy group e.on. -lrb- 26.09.2006 -rrb- audios and videos on the topic the eu will take spain to court over the endesa takeover battle feedback do you think the eu is doing the right thing ? send us an e-mail .

6 , if germany did not pull its troops out of afghanistan by the beginning of last week .
the german government has refused to meet the demand . the hostages ' fate remains unknown more than a week after the kidnappers ' ultimatum ran out . they are n't the first germans to be kidnapped in iraq .
despite clear instructions from the foreign ministry not to travel to or stay in iraq and a string of incidents involving the kidnapping of german nationals by local militias , some 100 germans still remain in the country . ministry spokesman jens plötner said that number included embassy officials , people traveling there for short trips and germans with family bonds to iraqis - mainly german women who are married to iraqis and have lived in the country for decades . businesses looking for locals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin crisis staff said they are " very concerned " about the kidnapped germans but whether they are married to iraqis and live in the country or are only in iraq a short time , foreigners are at greater danger than locals since they make higher profile targets , according to nadine flache of the berlin-based rebuild iraq recruitment program , which matches german and other european companies with local workers . given the rampant instablity in the country , most german companies are now relying heavily on locals to represent them instead of risking sending their own staff to iraq . " german and european companies can run projects in iraq while keeping their staff 's travel to a minimum , " she said , adding that iraqis with university degrees and technical skills are among the most sought after , but companies have also looked for tax advisors and cooks . though gelan khulusi , head of midan , a german-iraqi association for midsized businesses , would not name the handful of german companies in iraq he advises , he said germans are making short trips to iraq . germans keep visits short and get help " some iraqi ministries or companies sometimes require german or other foreign partners to be present to sign contracts , " he told german public broadcaster zdf .
" that 's a reason german businesspeople are in baghdad from time to time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an array of security companies offer their services to visitors in iraq but visitors to iraq are seldom aware of the danger the country poses outside of baghdad , according to private security consultant alex breingan , head of praetoria consulting . " people are very surprised when we confront them with actual number on attacks , shootings and how many people are killed in other regions , " he said . while wary of stating hard numbers , breingan said he and his team of about 800 bodyguards has worked with mid-sized and large german companies in the past and that more and more germans have recently contacted him to protect their projects and employees . he said his company offers means of protection in iraq , varying from high-profile convoys to less conspicuous drivers at costs of between 4,000 euros and 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 5,337 and $ 10,675 -rrb- per day depending on the task and location . aid organizations ' work impaired aid organizations ' staff members are also at risk - at least 84 aid workers have been killed in iraq since 2003 , according to international ngo coordination group ncci - but the groups ' regular and long-term contact with iraqis makes it difficult for them to avoid becoming kidnapping targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : care international 's margaret hassan was kidnapped and killed in iraq in 2004 bonn-based help , the last german aid organization working in iraq , stopped its projects at the beginning of march , spokesman berthold engelmann said .
the group had been working on supplying water and defusing mines and unexploded bombs . " we stopped using international workers in september 2004 , " he said .
" we continued working with local workers until the end of february but because of the security situation , we ca n't work there at all at the moment . " kidnappings drove organization away should the country become relatively safer , frank mc areavey , who organized help 's programs in iraq , said he would have no qualms about returning to the country , adding that there had never been any reprisals against help workers . " when workers arrived in april 2003 there was no reason to be scared , " he said from amman , where he is evaluating future help projects .
" the situation changed in august 2003 when the united nations was bombed in baghdad and the increasing number of kidnapped foreigners was the deciding reason for leaving .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 28.03.2007 euro 2008 half-time report card : qualifying surprises abound großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eyes on the prize : euro 2008 may be over a year away but the trophy is on everyone 's mind the euro 2008 qualifiers reached the half-way stage wednesday .
while a few of the groups are reverting to type , others have thrown up a number of surprises .
dw-world.de takes a look at the standings . germany are on course to qualify in style for next summer 's european championships in austria and switzerland .
with four wins and a draw in their first five group d games , jogi löw 's team sit on top with 13 points at the halfway mark .
with six games to go in the qualifiers , germany would have to suffer a major reverse in fortunes to find themselves out of the tournament before it even begins . elsewhere in the qualification groups , things are not going so swimmingly for other nations with high hopes of making it to the championships and mounting a serious challenge for the euro 2008 title . group a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's ever-modest ronaldo scored twice saturday things are evenly poised in group a with poland , finland , portugal and serbia all contesting the two qualifying places .
leaders poland thrashed the minnows of azerbaijan 5-0 on saturday and could be in for another hatful against armenia on wednesday . finland could maintain pressure on the poles by adding more misery to the azerbaijanis and portugal , who romped to a 4-0 win over belgium at the weekend , could put some distance between themselves and serbia in fourth by beating the serbians in oporto .
given the form of the top three teams and their opposition , the table is unlikely to change after wednesday 's matches . group b fans of the game will probably view group b 's current status with a lot of surprise and maybe a little happiness .
scotland sit atop of a group which includes world champions italy , world cup runners-up france and quarter-finalists ukraine .
if the scots , under new manager alex mcleish , reach the finals , it will be the first major championship they 've been to since the 1996 european championships in england .
equal on points with raymond domenech 's les bleus , scotland take on fourth-placed italy on wednesday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup success has not been carried over for italy roberto donadoni inherited the world champions from predecessor marcello lippi but has not been able to instill the same level of performance from the azzurri .
two wins , a draw and a defeat in their four games leave the italians needing a win against scotland to keep pace with the unlikely group leaders .
meanwhile , france take a break from qualification by playing austria in a friendly after beating lithuania 1-0 on saturday . group c turkey 's annihilation of greece in piraeus at the weekend was a victory in every way .
the 4-1 away win took turkey three points clear of their bitter sporting , historical and geopolitical rival and gave the turks the spoils in the contest for national pride .
their next opponents , fourth-placed norway , could improve their group position by two places if reigning euro champs greece lose to malta .
third-placed bosnia-herzegovina do n't play another qualifier until june when they take on current leaders turkey at home . group d unbeaten germany can look down from the top of the group on wednesday knowing that even if the second-placed czech republic beat strugglers cyprus in prague , which they should , jogi löw 's free-scoring team will still be leaders on goal difference with a game in hand on their nearest rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish and czechs are chasing leaders germany elsewhere , the republic of ireland in third look to get another three points on the board against slovakia in fourth .
the irish have been disappointing and under-fire coach steve staunton will take little solace in a win on wednesday , even though it would take them up to second if the czechs inexplicably lose .
ireland will have played two games more than germany and one more than the czech republic , meaning the breathing space afforded them by victory over slovakia could be short-lived . group e croatia and russia continue to battle it out for supremacy in group e with favorites for qualification england languishing in third .
both the top two teams remain unbeaten , with russia in second after drawing one more game than leaders croatia .
neither team plays again in group e until june which gives england a chance to collect some much needed points .
a loss against croatia , and goalless draws with macedonia and israel have left steve mcclaren 's team floundering in their worst competitive run since 1981 with just one goal in their last five matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wayne rooney and england are having scoring problems even a comprehensive win against bottom team andorra could see england drop to fourth if israel win against second-from-bottom estonia .
uefa 's placing system means that teams drawn on points are placed in regard to their results against each other .
the draw in tel-aviv would be counted in israel 's favor and could spell darker days for england even if they run riot in barcelona . group f there are more surprises in group f where favorites spain find themselves stuttering in fourth place , six points behind group leaders sweden .
luis aragones ' unquestionably talented team are once again under-achieving and despite beating third-placed denmark 2-1 at the weekend , spain are already looking like a team which could struggle to qualify . northern ireland , however , a team which at the start of the campaign looked certain to finish way off the qualifying places , inhabit second place ahead of their top two clash with sweden on wednesday .
a win over lars lagerbaek 's team will lift them to the summit , albeit having played a game more . group g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : group g hug : the dutch intend to keep out in front group leaders holland look comfortable on eleven points ahead of wednesday 's matches but after playing a game more than both bulgaria in second and romania in third , their three point lead over the two eastern european teams could look more fragile after the coming round . bulgaria have a break until june , but romania could move up a place if they beat bottom team luxembourg as expected .
the dutch entertain the tricky slovenians at home and will hope to put some daylight between themselves and the hunting pack immediately behind by ending fifth-placed slovenia hopes of overtaking non-competing belarus in fourth . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de löw to blood german youngsters much to denmark 's chagrin germany 's coach joachim löw will ring the changes for wednesday night 's friendly against denmark by announcing an inexperienced 16-man squad aimed at blooding some of his rising stars .

" it 's all about giving other players their opportunity , " löw said .
" saturday 's game was an important and hard fought win for us .
the team played well as a unit and put together some intelligent phases of play , but we need to look at other options with a view to the future . " back-in-favor kuranyi leads the line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi will be germany 's most experienced player having only come back into the national side in last month 's 3-1 win over switzerland , 25-year-old kuranyi is staking a strong case for his place in the first-choice side and is hoping to build on a superb performance . " kuranyi has proved that he is in a good vein of form and is scoring some good goals , " löw said .
" it 's nice to have some options up front . " kuranyi is likely to partner bayer leverkusen forward paul freier in attack against the danes , while the squad 's goalkeepers , uncapped robert enke and reserve timo hildebrand , get their chance to stake a claim . pacy midfielder clemens fritz from werder bremen will start alongside bremen left-back christian schulz and defender vfl wolfsburg 's alexander madlung , who is set to add to his single cap he won last autumn in the 2-0 win over georgia .
bayer leverkusen midfielder simon rolfes will also get his chance . jogi looks to the future in euro break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a break in qualifiers , jogi can experiment the friendly is a sensible time for löw , who has an impressive record as coach of seven wins and a draw having succeeded jürgen klinsmann last year , to look to the future . with no more euro 2008 qualifying fixtures until the visit of minnows san marino in june , denmark , who lost 2-1 to spain in madrid at the weekend , will provide a good work out for his inexperienced side . however , morten olsen , the opposing coach , is less than happy about facing a deliberately under-strength germany team in duisburg . danes not amused " this is very disrespectful , " olsen was quoted as saying by german media on tuesday .
" we had a clear agreement to field our strongest teams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morten olsen 's denmark are having a torrid campaign " i was n't told about it by the dfb -lrb- german soccer association -rrb- .
i read about it in the newspapers and you do n't do that . " the 57-year-old also fears that a game against a weakened germany will hamper his preparations for their euro 2008 qualifier against sweden in june . but 25-year-old rolfes was adamant germany will be no push-overs at duisburg 's msv-arena and olsen 's worries will be proved wrong . " the danes do not need to underestimate us , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.03.2007 in unstable iraq , german firms rely on local help to do the job großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lack of security has made german firms and aid groups reconsider their projects in iraq violence , kidnappings and crumbling security in iraq has meant that german businesses and aid groups are increasingly turning to local iraqis to run the show . in a recent video message , kidnappers from a militia in iraq threatened to kill two german nationals , a 61-year-old woman and her 20-year-old son who were taken hostage on feb .
6 , if germany did not pull its troops out of afghanistan by the beginning of last week .
the german government has refused to meet the demand . the hostages ' fate remains unknown more than a week after the kidnappers ' ultimatum ran out . they are n't the first germans to be kidnapped in iraq .
despite clear instructions from the foreign ministry not to travel to or stay in iraq and a string of incidents involving the kidnapping of german nationals by local militias , some 100 germans still remain in the country . ministry spokesman jens plötner said that number included embassy officials , people traveling there for short trips and germans with family bonds to iraqis - mainly german women who are married to iraqis and have lived in the country for decades . businesses looking for locals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin crisis staff said they are " very concerned " about the kidnapped germans but whether they are married to iraqis and live in the country or are only in iraq a short time , foreigners are at greater danger than locals since they make higher profile targets , according to nadine flache of the berlin-based rebuild iraq recruitment program , which matches german and other european companies with local workers . given the rampant instablity in the country , most german companies are now relying heavily on locals to represent them instead of risking sending their own staff to iraq . " german and european companies can run projects in iraq while keeping their staff 's travel to a minimum , " she said , adding that iraqis with university degrees and technical skills are among the most sought after , but companies have also looked for tax advisors and cooks . though gelan khulusi , head of midan , a german-iraqi association for midsized businesses , would not name the handful of german companies in iraq he advises , he said germans are making short trips to iraq . germans keep visits short and get help " some iraqi ministries or companies sometimes require german or other foreign partners to be present to sign contracts , " he told german public broadcaster zdf .
" that 's a reason german businesspeople are in baghdad from time to time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an array of security companies offer their services to visitors in iraq but visitors to iraq are seldom aware of the danger the country poses outside of baghdad , according to private security consultant alex breingan , head of praetoria consulting . " people are very surprised when we confront them with actual number on attacks , shootings and how many people are killed in other regions , " he said . while wary of stating hard numbers , breingan said he and his team of about 800 bodyguards has worked with mid-sized and large german companies in the past and that more and more germans have recently contacted him to protect their projects and employees . he said his company offers means of protection in iraq , varying from high-profile convoys to less conspicuous drivers at costs of between 4,000 euros and 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 5,337 and $ 10,675 -rrb- per day depending on the task and location . aid organizations ' work impaired aid organizations ' staff members are also at risk - at least 84 aid workers have been killed in iraq since 2003 , according to international ngo coordination group ncci - but the groups ' regular and long-term contact with iraqis makes it difficult for them to avoid becoming kidnapping targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : care international 's margaret hassan was kidnapped and killed in iraq in 2004 bonn-based help , the last german aid organization working in iraq , stopped its projects at the beginning of march , spokesman berthold engelmann said .
the group had been working on supplying water and defusing mines and unexploded bombs . " we stopped using international workers in september 2004 , " he said .
" we continued working with local workers until the end of february but because of the security situation , we ca n't work there at all at the moment . " kidnappings drove organization away should the country become relatively safer , frank mc areavey , who organized help 's programs in iraq , said he would have no qualms about returning to the country , adding that there had never been any reprisals against help workers . " when workers arrived in april 2003 there was no reason to be scared , " he said from amman , where he is evaluating future help projects .
" the situation changed in august 2003 when the united nations was bombed in baghdad and the increasing number of kidnapped foreigners was the deciding reason for leaving .

" it 's all about giving other players their opportunity , " löw said .
" saturday 's game was an important and hard fought win for us .
the team played well as a unit and put together some intelligent phases of play , but we need to look at other options with a view to the future . " back-in-favor kuranyi leads the line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi will be germany 's most experienced player having only come back into the national side in last month 's 3-1 win over switzerland , 25-year-old kuranyi is staking a strong case for his place in the first-choice side and is hoping to build on a superb performance . " kuranyi has proved that he is in a good vein of form and is scoring some good goals , " löw said .
" it 's nice to have some options up front . " kuranyi is likely to partner bayer leverkusen forward paul freier in attack against the danes , while the squad 's goalkeepers , uncapped robert enke and reserve timo hildebrand , get their chance to stake a claim . pacy midfielder clemens fritz from werder bremen will start alongside bremen left-back christian schulz and defender vfl wolfsburg 's alexander madlung , who is set to add to his single cap he won last autumn in the 2-0 win over georgia .
bayer leverkusen midfielder simon rolfes will also get his chance . jogi looks to the future in euro break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a break in qualifiers , jogi can experiment the friendly is a sensible time for löw , who has an impressive record as coach of seven wins and a draw having succeeded jürgen klinsmann last year , to look to the future . with no more euro 2008 qualifying fixtures until the visit of minnows san marino in june , denmark , who lost 2-1 to spain in madrid at the weekend , will provide a good work out for his inexperienced side . however , morten olsen , the opposing coach , is less than happy about facing a deliberately under-strength germany team in duisburg . danes not amused " this is very disrespectful , " olsen was quoted as saying by german media on tuesday .
" we had a clear agreement to field our strongest teams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morten olsen 's denmark are having a torrid campaign " i was n't told about it by the dfb -lrb- german soccer association -rrb- .
i read about it in the newspapers and you do n't do that . " the 57-year-old also fears that a game against a weakened germany will hamper his preparations for their euro 2008 qualifier against sweden in june . but 25-year-old rolfes was adamant germany will be no push-overs at duisburg 's msv-arena and olsen 's worries will be proved wrong . " the danes do not need to underestimate us , " he said .
" this is a huge challenge for us , we want to prove we are good enough for the national side . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de training germany 's next soccer elite germany head into euro 2008 with loads of good youngsters .

" the case undoubtedly has a large practical importance , " said gerda müller , the karlsruhe court 's vice president .
she added that the verdict also applies to sites that allow parties to reply directly to the accusations against them . the case in question was initiated when the head of an association to fight child pornography was labeled a pedophile twice in an internet forum dealing with sexual abuse .
though the authors in both cases left the message with pseudonyms , the association 's head was able to obtain the name of the author for one entry . the association 's head sued for the removal of the two entries from the forum .
the high court 's decision to hold both the author and forum 's operators responsible for entries overturned a lower court 's decision that forced operators to remove forum entries only when they were written anonymously . careful screening required the main point of debate in the case was whether individuals can hold site operators accountable for content posted by third parties , with the defendant 's lawyers arguing the sites simply provide a forum for public discussion and can not control what is said .
lawyers for the plaintiff said that forum operators should be held accountable for messages their forums spread . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling may change what information forum operators require from users the decision will force internet forum operators to undertake more efforts validate users ' identities before allowing them to post comments , ralf möbius , an internet lawyer in hanover said .

" the period of weakness in the consumer climate appears to have come to an end , at least for now , " the gfk said . the renewed rise in consumers ' willingness to spend was causing the change , according to the institute . the improvement in consumer sentiment in germany also follows signs of a pickup in the nation 's unemployment rate and the prospects of higher pay settlements this year after a protracted period of weak wage growth . rosier outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower unemployment could be enhancing consumer sentiment economists expect data to be released thursday that will show seasonally adjusted unemployment in germany falling by 50,000 in march after a 79,000 fall in february - with employers hiring more in the wake of the economic upswing that started last year . " the rosier outlook for jobs also led consumers to hope that the collective wage bargaining and salary rises would be higher in some industries this year than in past years , " the gfk said . based on a survey of about 2,000 consumers , the gfk 's poll measuring consumers ' propensity to spend rose to minus 12.3 from minus 16 , while an index measuring income expectations jumped to 15.9 from 2.9 .
income expectations also rose . coming in the wake of tuesday 's surprise rise in german business confidence , the gfk index is the latest sign that the increase in the country 's vat from 16 to 19 percent in january has had only a minimal impact on the nation 's economy . the gfk also found that households are more optimistic with regard to their future income than they have been in five and a half years , with that sub-index rising by 10.1 points to plus 13 points . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's economy continues growth spurt germany 's economy will have a higher growth rate in 2007 than originally predicted , according to a forecast released monday .

while a few of the groups are reverting to type , others have thrown up a number of surprises .
dw-world.de takes a look at the standings . germany are on course to qualify in style for next summer 's european championships in austria and switzerland .
with four wins and a draw in their first five group d games , jogi löw 's team sit on top with 13 points at the halfway mark .
with six games to go in the qualifiers , germany would have to suffer a major reverse in fortunes to find themselves out of the tournament before it even begins . elsewhere in the qualification groups , things are not going so swimmingly for other nations with high hopes of making it to the championships and mounting a serious challenge for the euro 2008 title . group a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's ever-modest ronaldo scored twice saturday things are evenly poised in group a with poland , finland , portugal and serbia all contesting the two qualifying places .
leaders poland thrashed the minnows of azerbaijan 5-0 on saturday and could be in for another hatful against armenia on wednesday . finland could maintain pressure on the poles by adding more misery to the azerbaijanis and portugal , who romped to a 4-0 win over belgium at the weekend , could put some distance between themselves and serbia in fourth by beating the serbians in oporto .
given the form of the top three teams and their opposition , the table is unlikely to change after wednesday 's matches . group b fans of the game will probably view group b 's current status with a lot of surprise and maybe a little happiness .
scotland sit atop of a group which includes world champions italy , world cup runners-up france and quarter-finalists ukraine .
if the scots , under new manager alex mcleish , reach the finals , it will be the first major championship they 've been to since the 1996 european championships in england .
equal on points with raymond domenech 's les bleus , scotland take on fourth-placed italy on wednesday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup success has not been carried over for italy roberto donadoni inherited the world champions from predecessor marcello lippi but has not been able to instill the same level of performance from the azzurri .
two wins , a draw and a defeat in their four games leave the italians needing a win against scotland to keep pace with the unlikely group leaders .
meanwhile , france take a break from qualification by playing austria in a friendly after beating lithuania 1-0 on saturday . group c turkey 's annihilation of greece in piraeus at the weekend was a victory in every way .
the 4-1 away win took turkey three points clear of their bitter sporting , historical and geopolitical rival and gave the turks the spoils in the contest for national pride .
their next opponents , fourth-placed norway , could improve their group position by two places if reigning euro champs greece lose to malta .
third-placed bosnia-herzegovina do n't play another qualifier until june when they take on current leaders turkey at home . group d unbeaten germany can look down from the top of the group on wednesday knowing that even if the second-placed czech republic beat strugglers cyprus in prague , which they should , jogi löw 's free-scoring team will still be leaders on goal difference with a game in hand on their nearest rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish and czechs are chasing leaders germany elsewhere , the republic of ireland in third look to get another three points on the board against slovakia in fourth .
the irish have been disappointing and under-fire coach steve staunton will take little solace in a win on wednesday , even though it would take them up to second if the czechs inexplicably lose .
ireland will have played two games more than germany and one more than the czech republic , meaning the breathing space afforded them by victory over slovakia could be short-lived . group e croatia and russia continue to battle it out for supremacy in group e with favorites for qualification england languishing in third .
both the top two teams remain unbeaten , with russia in second after drawing one more game than leaders croatia .
neither team plays again in group e until june which gives england a chance to collect some much needed points .
a loss against croatia , and goalless draws with macedonia and israel have left steve mcclaren 's team floundering in their worst competitive run since 1981 with just one goal in their last five matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wayne rooney and england are having scoring problems even a comprehensive win against bottom team andorra could see england drop to fourth if israel win against second-from-bottom estonia .
uefa 's placing system means that teams drawn on points are placed in regard to their results against each other .
the draw in tel-aviv would be counted in israel 's favor and could spell darker days for england even if they run riot in barcelona . group f there are more surprises in group f where favorites spain find themselves stuttering in fourth place , six points behind group leaders sweden .
luis aragones ' unquestionably talented team are once again under-achieving and despite beating third-placed denmark 2-1 at the weekend , spain are already looking like a team which could struggle to qualify . northern ireland , however , a team which at the start of the campaign looked certain to finish way off the qualifying places , inhabit second place ahead of their top two clash with sweden on wednesday .
a win over lars lagerbaek 's team will lift them to the summit , albeit having played a game more . group g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : group g hug : the dutch intend to keep out in front group leaders holland look comfortable on eleven points ahead of wednesday 's matches but after playing a game more than both bulgaria in second and romania in third , their three point lead over the two eastern european teams could look more fragile after the coming round . bulgaria have a break until june , but romania could move up a place if they beat bottom team luxembourg as expected .
the dutch entertain the tricky slovenians at home and will hope to put some daylight between themselves and the hunting pack immediately behind by ending fifth-placed slovenia hopes of overtaking non-competing belarus in fourth . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de löw to blood german youngsters much to denmark 's chagrin germany 's coach joachim löw will ring the changes for wednesday night 's friendly against denmark by announcing an inexperienced 16-man squad aimed at blooding some of his rising stars .

the spanish energy regulator cne then set a number of requirements for the sale . the commission ruled in september 2006 that these conditions violated eu rules by breaching measures on the free movement of capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain does n't want e.on to sell off endesa assests in the canary or balearic islands in response , spain lifted part of the conditions and limited their duration , but argued that the requirements were necessary to secure the national energy supply and did not create a problem because e.on had accepted them . the spanish government bound e.on to hold onto endesa 's brand name for five years , to refrain from selling off endesa 's electricity assets outside mainland spain and to keep using spanish fuel in endesa 's coal-powered plants . eu wants energy sector to open up the commission 's decision to refer the cast to court is the latest twist in a test case for european cross-border deals in the energy sector , underlining the eu executive 's determination to crack down on what it sees as spain 's protectionist behavior . the move comes just two days after e.on scored a key victory in its long-running battle for control of endesa .
on monday , endesa 's board backed e.on 's bid of 42.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 56.5 billion -rrb- for the takeover . counter bid for endesa however , spanish construction firm acciona and italian electricity company enel , both endesa shareholders , said they would launch a joint counter-bid for the spanish power company and would improve on e.on 's offer by at least one euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is fighting tooth and nail to stop the eon take-over of endesa while e.on 's latest bid values endesa at 42.4 billion euros , the enel-acciona offer would bring endesa 's value to 43.4 billion euros . e.on announced on tuesday had secured caja madrid 's 9.9 percent stake in endesa by means of a swap agreement with the spanish bank .
the german company , however , needs at least 50 percent for its bid to succeed . enel and acciona together already hold about a 46 per cent stake in endesa . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de endesa bidding war heats up as board backs e.on german energy giant e.on ag scored a key victory monday in its long-running battle for control of endesa after the spanish power company 's board backed its 42.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 56.5 billion -rrb- to take over the group .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 28.03.2007 euro 2008 half-time report card : qualifying surprises abound großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eyes on the prize : euro 2008 may be over a year away but the trophy is on everyone 's mind the euro 2008 qualifiers reached the half-way stage wednesday .
while a few of the groups are reverting to type , others have thrown up a number of surprises .
dw-world.de takes a look at the standings . germany are on course to qualify in style for next summer 's european championships in austria and switzerland .
with four wins and a draw in their first five group d games , jogi löw 's team sit on top with 13 points at the halfway mark .
with six games to go in the qualifiers , germany would have to suffer a major reverse in fortunes to find themselves out of the tournament before it even begins . elsewhere in the qualification groups , things are not going so swimmingly for other nations with high hopes of making it to the championships and mounting a serious challenge for the euro 2008 title . group a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's ever-modest ronaldo scored twice saturday things are evenly poised in group a with poland , finland , portugal and serbia all contesting the two qualifying places .
leaders poland thrashed the minnows of azerbaijan 5-0 on saturday and could be in for another hatful against armenia on wednesday . finland could maintain pressure on the poles by adding more misery to the azerbaijanis and portugal , who romped to a 4-0 win over belgium at the weekend , could put some distance between themselves and serbia in fourth by beating the serbians in oporto .
given the form of the top three teams and their opposition , the table is unlikely to change after wednesday 's matches . group b fans of the game will probably view group b 's current status with a lot of surprise and maybe a little happiness .
scotland sit atop of a group which includes world champions italy , world cup runners-up france and quarter-finalists ukraine .
if the scots , under new manager alex mcleish , reach the finals , it will be the first major championship they 've been to since the 1996 european championships in england .
equal on points with raymond domenech 's les bleus , scotland take on fourth-placed italy on wednesday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup success has not been carried over for italy roberto donadoni inherited the world champions from predecessor marcello lippi but has not been able to instill the same level of performance from the azzurri .
two wins , a draw and a defeat in their four games leave the italians needing a win against scotland to keep pace with the unlikely group leaders .
meanwhile , france take a break from qualification by playing austria in a friendly after beating lithuania 1-0 on saturday . group c turkey 's annihilation of greece in piraeus at the weekend was a victory in every way .
the 4-1 away win took turkey three points clear of their bitter sporting , historical and geopolitical rival and gave the turks the spoils in the contest for national pride .
their next opponents , fourth-placed norway , could improve their group position by two places if reigning euro champs greece lose to malta .
third-placed bosnia-herzegovina do n't play another qualifier until june when they take on current leaders turkey at home . group d unbeaten germany can look down from the top of the group on wednesday knowing that even if the second-placed czech republic beat strugglers cyprus in prague , which they should , jogi löw 's free-scoring team will still be leaders on goal difference with a game in hand on their nearest rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish and czechs are chasing leaders germany elsewhere , the republic of ireland in third look to get another three points on the board against slovakia in fourth .
the irish have been disappointing and under-fire coach steve staunton will take little solace in a win on wednesday , even though it would take them up to second if the czechs inexplicably lose .
ireland will have played two games more than germany and one more than the czech republic , meaning the breathing space afforded them by victory over slovakia could be short-lived . group e croatia and russia continue to battle it out for supremacy in group e with favorites for qualification england languishing in third .
both the top two teams remain unbeaten , with russia in second after drawing one more game than leaders croatia .
neither team plays again in group e until june which gives england a chance to collect some much needed points .
a loss against croatia , and goalless draws with macedonia and israel have left steve mcclaren 's team floundering in their worst competitive run since 1981 with just one goal in their last five matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wayne rooney and england are having scoring problems even a comprehensive win against bottom team andorra could see england drop to fourth if israel win against second-from-bottom estonia .
uefa 's placing system means that teams drawn on points are placed in regard to their results against each other .
the draw in tel-aviv would be counted in israel 's favor and could spell darker days for england even if they run riot in barcelona . group f there are more surprises in group f where favorites spain find themselves stuttering in fourth place , six points behind group leaders sweden .
luis aragones ' unquestionably talented team are once again under-achieving and despite beating third-placed denmark 2-1 at the weekend , spain are already looking like a team which could struggle to qualify . northern ireland , however , a team which at the start of the campaign looked certain to finish way off the qualifying places , inhabit second place ahead of their top two clash with sweden on wednesday .
a win over lars lagerbaek 's team will lift them to the summit , albeit having played a game more . group g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : group g hug : the dutch intend to keep out in front group leaders holland look comfortable on eleven points ahead of wednesday 's matches but after playing a game more than both bulgaria in second and romania in third , their three point lead over the two eastern european teams could look more fragile after the coming round . bulgaria have a break until june , but romania could move up a place if they beat bottom team luxembourg as expected .
the dutch entertain the tricky slovenians at home and will hope to put some daylight between themselves and the hunting pack immediately behind by ending fifth-placed slovenia hopes of overtaking non-competing belarus in fourth . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de löw to blood german youngsters much to denmark 's chagrin germany 's coach joachim löw will ring the changes for wednesday night 's friendly against denmark by announcing an inexperienced 16-man squad aimed at blooding some of his rising stars .

" opening the archive " is a vital contribution to the world 's collective memory and understanding of the holocaust , " the resolution said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 28.03.2007 euro 2008 half-time report card : qualifying surprises abound großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eyes on the prize : euro 2008 may be over a year away but the trophy is on everyone 's mind the euro 2008 qualifiers reached the half-way stage wednesday .
while a few of the groups are reverting to type , others have thrown up a number of surprises .
dw-world.de takes a look at the standings . germany are on course to qualify in style for next summer 's european championships in austria and switzerland .
with four wins and a draw in their first five group d games , jogi löw 's team sit on top with 13 points at the halfway mark .
with six games to go in the qualifiers , germany would have to suffer a major reverse in fortunes to find themselves out of the tournament before it even begins . elsewhere in the qualification groups , things are not going so swimmingly for other nations with high hopes of making it to the championships and mounting a serious challenge for the euro 2008 title . group a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's ever-modest ronaldo scored twice saturday things are evenly poised in group a with poland , finland , portugal and serbia all contesting the two qualifying places .
leaders poland thrashed the minnows of azerbaijan 5-0 on saturday and could be in for another hatful against armenia on wednesday . finland could maintain pressure on the poles by adding more misery to the azerbaijanis and portugal , who romped to a 4-0 win over belgium at the weekend , could put some distance between themselves and serbia in fourth by beating the serbians in oporto .
given the form of the top three teams and their opposition , the table is unlikely to change after wednesday 's matches . group b fans of the game will probably view group b 's current status with a lot of surprise and maybe a little happiness .
scotland sit atop of a group which includes world champions italy , world cup runners-up france and quarter-finalists ukraine .
if the scots , under new manager alex mcleish , reach the finals , it will be the first major championship they 've been to since the 1996 european championships in england .
equal on points with raymond domenech 's les bleus , scotland take on fourth-placed italy on wednesday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup success has not been carried over for italy roberto donadoni inherited the world champions from predecessor marcello lippi but has not been able to instill the same level of performance from the azzurri .
two wins , a draw and a defeat in their four games leave the italians needing a win against scotland to keep pace with the unlikely group leaders .
meanwhile , france take a break from qualification by playing austria in a friendly after beating lithuania 1-0 on saturday . group c turkey 's annihilation of greece in piraeus at the weekend was a victory in every way .
the 4-1 away win took turkey three points clear of their bitter sporting , historical and geopolitical rival and gave the turks the spoils in the contest for national pride .
their next opponents , fourth-placed norway , could improve their group position by two places if reigning euro champs greece lose to malta .
third-placed bosnia-herzegovina do n't play another qualifier until june when they take on current leaders turkey at home . group d unbeaten germany can look down from the top of the group on wednesday knowing that even if the second-placed czech republic beat strugglers cyprus in prague , which they should , jogi löw 's free-scoring team will still be leaders on goal difference with a game in hand on their nearest rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish and czechs are chasing leaders germany elsewhere , the republic of ireland in third look to get another three points on the board against slovakia in fourth .
the irish have been disappointing and under-fire coach steve staunton will take little solace in a win on wednesday , even though it would take them up to second if the czechs inexplicably lose .
ireland will have played two games more than germany and one more than the czech republic , meaning the breathing space afforded them by victory over slovakia could be short-lived . group e croatia and russia continue to battle it out for supremacy in group e with favorites for qualification england languishing in third .
both the top two teams remain unbeaten , with russia in second after drawing one more game than leaders croatia .
neither team plays again in group e until june which gives england a chance to collect some much needed points .
a loss against croatia , and goalless draws with macedonia and israel have left steve mcclaren 's team floundering in their worst competitive run since 1981 with just one goal in their last five matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wayne rooney and england are having scoring problems even a comprehensive win against bottom team andorra could see england drop to fourth if israel win against second-from-bottom estonia .
uefa 's placing system means that teams drawn on points are placed in regard to their results against each other .
the draw in tel-aviv would be counted in israel 's favor and could spell darker days for england even if they run riot in barcelona . group f there are more surprises in group f where favorites spain find themselves stuttering in fourth place , six points behind group leaders sweden .
luis aragones ' unquestionably talented team are once again under-achieving and despite beating third-placed denmark 2-1 at the weekend , spain are already looking like a team which could struggle to qualify . northern ireland , however , a team which at the start of the campaign looked certain to finish way off the qualifying places , inhabit second place ahead of their top two clash with sweden on wednesday .
a win over lars lagerbaek 's team will lift them to the summit , albeit having played a game more . group g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : group g hug : the dutch intend to keep out in front group leaders holland look comfortable on eleven points ahead of wednesday 's matches but after playing a game more than both bulgaria in second and romania in third , their three point lead over the two eastern european teams could look more fragile after the coming round . bulgaria have a break until june , but romania could move up a place if they beat bottom team luxembourg as expected .
the dutch entertain the tricky slovenians at home and will hope to put some daylight between themselves and the hunting pack immediately behind by ending fifth-placed slovenia hopes of overtaking non-competing belarus in fourth . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de löw to blood german youngsters much to denmark 's chagrin germany 's coach joachim löw will ring the changes for wednesday night 's friendly against denmark by announcing an inexperienced 16-man squad aimed at blooding some of his rising stars .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 28.03.2007 euro 2008 half-time report card : qualifying surprises abound großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eyes on the prize : euro 2008 may be over a year away but the trophy is on everyone 's mind the euro 2008 qualifiers reached the half-way stage wednesday .
while a few of the groups are reverting to type , others have thrown up a number of surprises .
dw-world.de takes a look at the standings . germany are on course to qualify in style for next summer 's european championships in austria and switzerland .
with four wins and a draw in their first five group d games , jogi löw 's team sit on top with 13 points at the halfway mark .
with six games to go in the qualifiers , germany would have to suffer a major reverse in fortunes to find themselves out of the tournament before it even begins . elsewhere in the qualification groups , things are not going so swimmingly for other nations with high hopes of making it to the championships and mounting a serious challenge for the euro 2008 title . group a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's ever-modest ronaldo scored twice saturday things are evenly poised in group a with poland , finland , portugal and serbia all contesting the two qualifying places .
leaders poland thrashed the minnows of azerbaijan 5-0 on saturday and could be in for another hatful against armenia on wednesday . finland could maintain pressure on the poles by adding more misery to the azerbaijanis and portugal , who romped to a 4-0 win over belgium at the weekend , could put some distance between themselves and serbia in fourth by beating the serbians in oporto .
given the form of the top three teams and their opposition , the table is unlikely to change after wednesday 's matches . group b fans of the game will probably view group b 's current status with a lot of surprise and maybe a little happiness .
scotland sit atop of a group which includes world champions italy , world cup runners-up france and quarter-finalists ukraine .
if the scots , under new manager alex mcleish , reach the finals , it will be the first major championship they 've been to since the 1996 european championships in england .
equal on points with raymond domenech 's les bleus , scotland take on fourth-placed italy on wednesday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup success has not been carried over for italy roberto donadoni inherited the world champions from predecessor marcello lippi but has not been able to instill the same level of performance from the azzurri .
two wins , a draw and a defeat in their four games leave the italians needing a win against scotland to keep pace with the unlikely group leaders .
meanwhile , france take a break from qualification by playing austria in a friendly after beating lithuania 1-0 on saturday . group c turkey 's annihilation of greece in piraeus at the weekend was a victory in every way .
the 4-1 away win took turkey three points clear of their bitter sporting , historical and geopolitical rival and gave the turks the spoils in the contest for national pride .
their next opponents , fourth-placed norway , could improve their group position by two places if reigning euro champs greece lose to malta .
third-placed bosnia-herzegovina do n't play another qualifier until june when they take on current leaders turkey at home . group d unbeaten germany can look down from the top of the group on wednesday knowing that even if the second-placed czech republic beat strugglers cyprus in prague , which they should , jogi löw 's free-scoring team will still be leaders on goal difference with a game in hand on their nearest rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish and czechs are chasing leaders germany elsewhere , the republic of ireland in third look to get another three points on the board against slovakia in fourth .
the irish have been disappointing and under-fire coach steve staunton will take little solace in a win on wednesday , even though it would take them up to second if the czechs inexplicably lose .
ireland will have played two games more than germany and one more than the czech republic , meaning the breathing space afforded them by victory over slovakia could be short-lived . group e croatia and russia continue to battle it out for supremacy in group e with favorites for qualification england languishing in third .
both the top two teams remain unbeaten , with russia in second after drawing one more game than leaders croatia .
neither team plays again in group e until june which gives england a chance to collect some much needed points .
a loss against croatia , and goalless draws with macedonia and israel have left steve mcclaren 's team floundering in their worst competitive run since 1981 with just one goal in their last five matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wayne rooney and england are having scoring problems even a comprehensive win against bottom team andorra could see england drop to fourth if israel win against second-from-bottom estonia .
uefa 's placing system means that teams drawn on points are placed in regard to their results against each other .
the draw in tel-aviv would be counted in israel 's favor and could spell darker days for england even if they run riot in barcelona . group f there are more surprises in group f where favorites spain find themselves stuttering in fourth place , six points behind group leaders sweden .
luis aragones ' unquestionably talented team are once again under-achieving and despite beating third-placed denmark 2-1 at the weekend , spain are already looking like a team which could struggle to qualify . northern ireland , however , a team which at the start of the campaign looked certain to finish way off the qualifying places , inhabit second place ahead of their top two clash with sweden on wednesday .
a win over lars lagerbaek 's team will lift them to the summit , albeit having played a game more . group g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : group g hug : the dutch intend to keep out in front group leaders holland look comfortable on eleven points ahead of wednesday 's matches but after playing a game more than both bulgaria in second and romania in third , their three point lead over the two eastern european teams could look more fragile after the coming round . bulgaria have a break until june , but romania could move up a place if they beat bottom team luxembourg as expected .
the dutch entertain the tricky slovenians at home and will hope to put some daylight between themselves and the hunting pack immediately behind by ending fifth-placed slovenia hopes of overtaking non-competing belarus in fourth . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de löw to blood german youngsters much to denmark 's chagrin germany 's coach joachim löw will ring the changes for wednesday night 's friendly against denmark by announcing an inexperienced 16-man squad aimed at blooding some of his rising stars .

she added that the verdict also applies to sites that allow parties to reply directly to the accusations against them . the case in question was initiated when the head of an association to fight child pornography was labeled a pedophile twice in an internet forum dealing with sexual abuse .

the high court 's decision to hold both the author and forum 's operators responsible for entries overturned a lower court 's decision that forced operators to remove forum entries only when they were written anonymously . careful screening required the main point of debate in the case was whether individuals can hold site operators accountable for content posted by third parties , with the defendant 's lawyers arguing the sites simply provide a forum for public discussion and can not control what is said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 28.03.2007 euro 2008 half-time report card : qualifying surprises abound großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eyes on the prize : euro 2008 may be over a year away but the trophy is on everyone 's mind the euro 2008 qualifiers reached the half-way stage wednesday .
while a few of the groups are reverting to type , others have thrown up a number of surprises .
dw-world.de takes a look at the standings . germany are on course to qualify in style for next summer 's european championships in austria and switzerland .
with four wins and a draw in their first five group d games , jogi löw 's team sit on top with 13 points at the halfway mark .
with six games to go in the qualifiers , germany would have to suffer a major reverse in fortunes to find themselves out of the tournament before it even begins . elsewhere in the qualification groups , things are not going so swimmingly for other nations with high hopes of making it to the championships and mounting a serious challenge for the euro 2008 title . group a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's ever-modest ronaldo scored twice saturday things are evenly poised in group a with poland , finland , portugal and serbia all contesting the two qualifying places .
leaders poland thrashed the minnows of azerbaijan 5-0 on saturday and could be in for another hatful against armenia on wednesday . finland could maintain pressure on the poles by adding more misery to the azerbaijanis and portugal , who romped to a 4-0 win over belgium at the weekend , could put some distance between themselves and serbia in fourth by beating the serbians in oporto .
given the form of the top three teams and their opposition , the table is unlikely to change after wednesday 's matches . group b fans of the game will probably view group b 's current status with a lot of surprise and maybe a little happiness .
scotland sit atop of a group which includes world champions italy , world cup runners-up france and quarter-finalists ukraine .
if the scots , under new manager alex mcleish , reach the finals , it will be the first major championship they 've been to since the 1996 european championships in england .
equal on points with raymond domenech 's les bleus , scotland take on fourth-placed italy on wednesday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup success has not been carried over for italy roberto donadoni inherited the world champions from predecessor marcello lippi but has not been able to instill the same level of performance from the azzurri .
two wins , a draw and a defeat in their four games leave the italians needing a win against scotland to keep pace with the unlikely group leaders .
meanwhile , france take a break from qualification by playing austria in a friendly after beating lithuania 1-0 on saturday . group c turkey 's annihilation of greece in piraeus at the weekend was a victory in every way .
the 4-1 away win took turkey three points clear of their bitter sporting , historical and geopolitical rival and gave the turks the spoils in the contest for national pride .
their next opponents , fourth-placed norway , could improve their group position by two places if reigning euro champs greece lose to malta .
third-placed bosnia-herzegovina do n't play another qualifier until june when they take on current leaders turkey at home . group d unbeaten germany can look down from the top of the group on wednesday knowing that even if the second-placed czech republic beat strugglers cyprus in prague , which they should , jogi löw 's free-scoring team will still be leaders on goal difference with a game in hand on their nearest rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish and czechs are chasing leaders germany elsewhere , the republic of ireland in third look to get another three points on the board against slovakia in fourth .
the irish have been disappointing and under-fire coach steve staunton will take little solace in a win on wednesday , even though it would take them up to second if the czechs inexplicably lose .
ireland will have played two games more than germany and one more than the czech republic , meaning the breathing space afforded them by victory over slovakia could be short-lived . group e croatia and russia continue to battle it out for supremacy in group e with favorites for qualification england languishing in third .
both the top two teams remain unbeaten , with russia in second after drawing one more game than leaders croatia .
neither team plays again in group e until june which gives england a chance to collect some much needed points .
a loss against croatia , and goalless draws with macedonia and israel have left steve mcclaren 's team floundering in their worst competitive run since 1981 with just one goal in their last five matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wayne rooney and england are having scoring problems even a comprehensive win against bottom team andorra could see england drop to fourth if israel win against second-from-bottom estonia .
uefa 's placing system means that teams drawn on points are placed in regard to their results against each other .
the draw in tel-aviv would be counted in israel 's favor and could spell darker days for england even if they run riot in barcelona . group f there are more surprises in group f where favorites spain find themselves stuttering in fourth place , six points behind group leaders sweden .
luis aragones ' unquestionably talented team are once again under-achieving and despite beating third-placed denmark 2-1 at the weekend , spain are already looking like a team which could struggle to qualify . northern ireland , however , a team which at the start of the campaign looked certain to finish way off the qualifying places , inhabit second place ahead of their top two clash with sweden on wednesday .
a win over lars lagerbaek 's team will lift them to the summit , albeit having played a game more . group g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : group g hug : the dutch intend to keep out in front group leaders holland look comfortable on eleven points ahead of wednesday 's matches but after playing a game more than both bulgaria in second and romania in third , their three point lead over the two eastern european teams could look more fragile after the coming round . bulgaria have a break until june , but romania could move up a place if they beat bottom team luxembourg as expected .
the dutch entertain the tricky slovenians at home and will hope to put some daylight between themselves and the hunting pack immediately behind by ending fifth-placed slovenia hopes of overtaking non-competing belarus in fourth . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de löw to blood german youngsters much to denmark 's chagrin germany 's coach joachim löw will ring the changes for wednesday night 's friendly against denmark by announcing an inexperienced 16-man squad aimed at blooding some of his rising stars .

" the case undoubtedly has a large practical importance , " said gerda müller , the karlsruhe court 's vice president .
she added that the verdict also applies to sites that allow parties to reply directly to the accusations against them . the case in question was initiated when the head of an association to fight child pornography was labeled a pedophile twice in an internet forum dealing with sexual abuse .
though the authors in both cases left the message with pseudonyms , the association 's head was able to obtain the name of the author for one entry . the association 's head sued for the removal of the two entries from the forum .
the high court 's decision to hold both the author and forum 's operators responsible for entries overturned a lower court 's decision that forced operators to remove forum entries only when they were written anonymously . careful screening required the main point of debate in the case was whether individuals can hold site operators accountable for content posted by third parties , with the defendant 's lawyers arguing the sites simply provide a forum for public discussion and can not control what is said .
lawyers for the plaintiff said that forum operators should be held accountable for messages their forums spread . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling may change what information forum operators require from users the decision will force internet forum operators to undertake more efforts validate users ' identities before allowing them to post comments , ralf möbius , an internet lawyer in hanover said . " they will definitely have to check their sites more regularly , " he told die zeit newspaper .
" for a long time the perception was that one could not pursue legal action against the place where wrongdoing occurs .
naturally the operator has to do something about entries in his forum .

" since the spanish government has still not withdrawn the illegal measures ... the commission has decided to refer the case -lrb- to court -rrb- , " the commission said in a statement . e.on made a take-over bid for spain 's biggest energy company endesa last year .
although eu regulators approved the merger unconditionally , it met with strong resistance from spanish politicians .
the spanish energy regulator cne then set a number of requirements for the sale . the commission ruled in september 2006 that these conditions violated eu rules by breaching measures on the free movement of capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain does n't want e.on to sell off endesa assests in the canary or balearic islands in response , spain lifted part of the conditions and limited their duration , but argued that the requirements were necessary to secure the national energy supply and did not create a problem because e.on had accepted them . the spanish government bound e.on to hold onto endesa 's brand name for five years , to refrain from selling off endesa 's electricity assets outside mainland spain and to keep using spanish fuel in endesa 's coal-powered plants . eu wants energy sector to open up the commission 's decision to refer the cast to court is the latest twist in a test case for european cross-border deals in the energy sector , underlining the eu executive 's determination to crack down on what it sees as spain 's protectionist behavior . the move comes just two days after e.on scored a key victory in its long-running battle for control of endesa .
on monday , endesa 's board backed e.on 's bid of 42.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 56.5 billion -rrb- for the takeover . counter bid for endesa however , spanish construction firm acciona and italian electricity company enel , both endesa shareholders , said they would launch a joint counter-bid for the spanish power company and would improve on e.on 's offer by at least one euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is fighting tooth and nail to stop the eon take-over of endesa while e.on 's latest bid values endesa at 42.4 billion euros , the enel-acciona offer would bring endesa 's value to 43.4 billion euros . e.on announced on tuesday had secured caja madrid 's 9.9 percent stake in endesa by means of a swap agreement with the spanish bank .
the german company , however , needs at least 50 percent for its bid to succeed . enel and acciona together already hold about a 46 per cent stake in endesa . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de endesa bidding war heats up as board backs e.on german energy giant e.on ag scored a key victory monday in its long-running battle for control of endesa after the spanish power company 's board backed its 42.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 56.5 billion -rrb- to take over the group .
-lrb- 26.03.2007 -rrb- e.on calls for european energy market , lowers endesa bid the head of germany 's largest energy concern , e.on , has called for a european energy market , grouping germany and six of its neighbors .
the company also watered down its bid for the planned takeover of spanish endesa .
-lrb- 07.03.2007 -rrb- eu condemns spain for hindering e.on 's endesa bid the european commission ruled tuesday that spain had breached eu regulations in trying to protect spanish electricity giant endesa from a takeover bid by german energy group e.on. -lrb- 26.09.2006 -rrb- audios and videos on the topic the eu will take spain to court over the endesa takeover battle feedback do you think the eu is doing the right thing ? send us an e-mail .

the german government has refused to meet the demand . the hostages ' fate remains unknown more than a week after the kidnappers ' ultimatum ran out . they are n't the first germans to be kidnapped in iraq .
despite clear instructions from the foreign ministry not to travel to or stay in iraq and a string of incidents involving the kidnapping of german nationals by local militias , some 100 germans still remain in the country . ministry spokesman jens plötner said that number included embassy officials , people traveling there for short trips and germans with family bonds to iraqis - mainly german women who are married to iraqis and have lived in the country for decades . businesses looking for locals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin crisis staff said they are " very concerned " about the kidnapped germans but whether they are married to iraqis and live in the country or are only in iraq a short time , foreigners are at greater danger than locals since they make higher profile targets , according to nadine flache of the berlin-based rebuild iraq recruitment program , which matches german and other european companies with local workers . given the rampant instablity in the country , most german companies are now relying heavily on locals to represent them instead of risking sending their own staff to iraq . " german and european companies can run projects in iraq while keeping their staff 's travel to a minimum , " she said , adding that iraqis with university degrees and technical skills are among the most sought after , but companies have also looked for tax advisors and cooks . though gelan khulusi , head of midan , a german-iraqi association for midsized businesses , would not name the handful of german companies in iraq he advises , he said germans are making short trips to iraq . germans keep visits short and get help " some iraqi ministries or companies sometimes require german or other foreign partners to be present to sign contracts , " he told german public broadcaster zdf .

" people are very surprised when we confront them with actual number on attacks , shootings and how many people are killed in other regions , " he said . while wary of stating hard numbers , breingan said he and his team of about 800 bodyguards has worked with mid-sized and large german companies in the past and that more and more germans have recently contacted him to protect their projects and employees . he said his company offers means of protection in iraq , varying from high-profile convoys to less conspicuous drivers at costs of between 4,000 euros and 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 5,337 and $ 10,675 -rrb- per day depending on the task and location . aid organizations ' work impaired aid organizations ' staff members are also at risk - at least 84 aid workers have been killed in iraq since 2003 , according to international ngo coordination group ncci - but the groups ' regular and long-term contact with iraqis makes it difficult for them to avoid becoming kidnapping targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : care international 's margaret hassan was kidnapped and killed in iraq in 2004 bonn-based help , the last german aid organization working in iraq , stopped its projects at the beginning of march , spokesman berthold engelmann said .
the group had been working on supplying water and defusing mines and unexploded bombs . " we stopped using international workers in september 2004 , " he said .
" we continued working with local workers until the end of february but because of the security situation , we ca n't work there at all at the moment . " kidnappings drove organization away should the country become relatively safer , frank mc areavey , who organized help 's programs in iraq , said he would have no qualms about returning to the country , adding that there had never been any reprisals against help workers . " when workers arrived in april 2003 there was no reason to be scared , " he said from amman , where he is evaluating future help projects .

bayer leverkusen midfielder simon rolfes will also get his chance . jogi looks to the future in euro break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a break in qualifiers , jogi can experiment the friendly is a sensible time for löw , who has an impressive record as coach of seven wins and a draw having succeeded jürgen klinsmann last year , to look to the future . with no more euro 2008 qualifying fixtures until the visit of minnows san marino in june , denmark , who lost 2-1 to spain in madrid at the weekend , will provide a good work out for his inexperienced side . however , morten olsen , the opposing coach , is less than happy about facing a deliberately under-strength germany team in duisburg . danes not amused " this is very disrespectful , " olsen was quoted as saying by german media on tuesday .
" we had a clear agreement to field our strongest teams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morten olsen 's denmark are having a torrid campaign " i was n't told about it by the dfb -lrb- german soccer association -rrb- .
i read about it in the newspapers and you do n't do that . " the 57-year-old also fears that a game against a weakened germany will hamper his preparations for their euro 2008 qualifier against sweden in june . but 25-year-old rolfes was adamant germany will be no push-overs at duisburg 's msv-arena and olsen 's worries will be proved wrong .

while a few of the groups are reverting to type , others have thrown up a number of surprises .
dw-world.de takes a look at the standings . germany are on course to qualify in style for next summer 's european championships in austria and switzerland .
with four wins and a draw in their first five group d games , jogi löw 's team sit on top with 13 points at the halfway mark .
with six games to go in the qualifiers , germany would have to suffer a major reverse in fortunes to find themselves out of the tournament before it even begins . elsewhere in the qualification groups , things are not going so swimmingly for other nations with high hopes of making it to the championships and mounting a serious challenge for the euro 2008 title . group a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's ever-modest ronaldo scored twice saturday things are evenly poised in group a with poland , finland , portugal and serbia all contesting the two qualifying places .
leaders poland thrashed the minnows of azerbaijan 5-0 on saturday and could be in for another hatful against armenia on wednesday . finland could maintain pressure on the poles by adding more misery to the azerbaijanis and portugal , who romped to a 4-0 win over belgium at the weekend , could put some distance between themselves and serbia in fourth by beating the serbians in oporto .
given the form of the top three teams and their opposition , the table is unlikely to change after wednesday 's matches . group b fans of the game will probably view group b 's current status with a lot of surprise and maybe a little happiness .
scotland sit atop of a group which includes world champions italy , world cup runners-up france and quarter-finalists ukraine .
if the scots , under new manager alex mcleish , reach the finals , it will be the first major championship they 've been to since the 1996 european championships in england .
equal on points with raymond domenech 's les bleus , scotland take on fourth-placed italy on wednesday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup success has not been carried over for italy roberto donadoni inherited the world champions from predecessor marcello lippi but has not been able to instill the same level of performance from the azzurri .
two wins , a draw and a defeat in their four games leave the italians needing a win against scotland to keep pace with the unlikely group leaders .
meanwhile , france take a break from qualification by playing austria in a friendly after beating lithuania 1-0 on saturday . group c turkey 's annihilation of greece in piraeus at the weekend was a victory in every way .
the 4-1 away win took turkey three points clear of their bitter sporting , historical and geopolitical rival and gave the turks the spoils in the contest for national pride .
their next opponents , fourth-placed norway , could improve their group position by two places if reigning euro champs greece lose to malta .
third-placed bosnia-herzegovina do n't play another qualifier until june when they take on current leaders turkey at home . group d unbeaten germany can look down from the top of the group on wednesday knowing that even if the second-placed czech republic beat strugglers cyprus in prague , which they should , jogi löw 's free-scoring team will still be leaders on goal difference with a game in hand on their nearest rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish and czechs are chasing leaders germany elsewhere , the republic of ireland in third look to get another three points on the board against slovakia in fourth .
the irish have been disappointing and under-fire coach steve staunton will take little solace in a win on wednesday , even though it would take them up to second if the czechs inexplicably lose .
ireland will have played two games more than germany and one more than the czech republic , meaning the breathing space afforded them by victory over slovakia could be short-lived . group e croatia and russia continue to battle it out for supremacy in group e with favorites for qualification england languishing in third .
both the top two teams remain unbeaten , with russia in second after drawing one more game than leaders croatia .
neither team plays again in group e until june which gives england a chance to collect some much needed points .
a loss against croatia , and goalless draws with macedonia and israel have left steve mcclaren 's team floundering in their worst competitive run since 1981 with just one goal in their last five matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wayne rooney and england are having scoring problems even a comprehensive win against bottom team andorra could see england drop to fourth if israel win against second-from-bottom estonia .
uefa 's placing system means that teams drawn on points are placed in regard to their results against each other .
the draw in tel-aviv would be counted in israel 's favor and could spell darker days for england even if they run riot in barcelona . group f there are more surprises in group f where favorites spain find themselves stuttering in fourth place , six points behind group leaders sweden .
luis aragones ' unquestionably talented team are once again under-achieving and despite beating third-placed denmark 2-1 at the weekend , spain are already looking like a team which could struggle to qualify . northern ireland , however , a team which at the start of the campaign looked certain to finish way off the qualifying places , inhabit second place ahead of their top two clash with sweden on wednesday .
a win over lars lagerbaek 's team will lift them to the summit , albeit having played a game more . group g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : group g hug : the dutch intend to keep out in front group leaders holland look comfortable on eleven points ahead of wednesday 's matches but after playing a game more than both bulgaria in second and romania in third , their three point lead over the two eastern european teams could look more fragile after the coming round . bulgaria have a break until june , but romania could move up a place if they beat bottom team luxembourg as expected .
the dutch entertain the tricky slovenians at home and will hope to put some daylight between themselves and the hunting pack immediately behind by ending fifth-placed slovenia hopes of overtaking non-competing belarus in fourth . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de löw to blood german youngsters much to denmark 's chagrin germany 's coach joachim löw will ring the changes for wednesday night 's friendly against denmark by announcing an inexperienced 16-man squad aimed at blooding some of his rising stars .

6 , if germany did not pull its troops out of afghanistan by the beginning of last week .
the german government has refused to meet the demand . the hostages ' fate remains unknown more than a week after the kidnappers ' ultimatum ran out . they are n't the first germans to be kidnapped in iraq .
despite clear instructions from the foreign ministry not to travel to or stay in iraq and a string of incidents involving the kidnapping of german nationals by local militias , some 100 germans still remain in the country . ministry spokesman jens plötner said that number included embassy officials , people traveling there for short trips and germans with family bonds to iraqis - mainly german women who are married to iraqis and have lived in the country for decades . businesses looking for locals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin crisis staff said they are " very concerned " about the kidnapped germans but whether they are married to iraqis and live in the country or are only in iraq a short time , foreigners are at greater danger than locals since they make higher profile targets , according to nadine flache of the berlin-based rebuild iraq recruitment program , which matches german and other european companies with local workers . given the rampant instablity in the country , most german companies are now relying heavily on locals to represent them instead of risking sending their own staff to iraq . " german and european companies can run projects in iraq while keeping their staff 's travel to a minimum , " she said , adding that iraqis with university degrees and technical skills are among the most sought after , but companies have also looked for tax advisors and cooks . though gelan khulusi , head of midan , a german-iraqi association for midsized businesses , would not name the handful of german companies in iraq he advises , he said germans are making short trips to iraq . germans keep visits short and get help " some iraqi ministries or companies sometimes require german or other foreign partners to be present to sign contracts , " he told german public broadcaster zdf .
" that 's a reason german businesspeople are in baghdad from time to time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an array of security companies offer their services to visitors in iraq but visitors to iraq are seldom aware of the danger the country poses outside of baghdad , according to private security consultant alex breingan , head of praetoria consulting . " people are very surprised when we confront them with actual number on attacks , shootings and how many people are killed in other regions , " he said . while wary of stating hard numbers , breingan said he and his team of about 800 bodyguards has worked with mid-sized and large german companies in the past and that more and more germans have recently contacted him to protect their projects and employees . he said his company offers means of protection in iraq , varying from high-profile convoys to less conspicuous drivers at costs of between 4,000 euros and 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 5,337 and $ 10,675 -rrb- per day depending on the task and location . aid organizations ' work impaired aid organizations ' staff members are also at risk - at least 84 aid workers have been killed in iraq since 2003 , according to international ngo coordination group ncci - but the groups ' regular and long-term contact with iraqis makes it difficult for them to avoid becoming kidnapping targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : care international 's margaret hassan was kidnapped and killed in iraq in 2004 bonn-based help , the last german aid organization working in iraq , stopped its projects at the beginning of march , spokesman berthold engelmann said .
the group had been working on supplying water and defusing mines and unexploded bombs . " we stopped using international workers in september 2004 , " he said .
" we continued working with local workers until the end of february but because of the security situation , we ca n't work there at all at the moment . " kidnappings drove organization away should the country become relatively safer , frank mc areavey , who organized help 's programs in iraq , said he would have no qualms about returning to the country , adding that there had never been any reprisals against help workers . " when workers arrived in april 2003 there was no reason to be scared , " he said from amman , where he is evaluating future help projects .
" the situation changed in august 2003 when the united nations was bombed in baghdad and the increasing number of kidnapped foreigners was the deciding reason for leaving .

" it 's all about giving other players their opportunity , " löw said .
" saturday 's game was an important and hard fought win for us .
the team played well as a unit and put together some intelligent phases of play , but we need to look at other options with a view to the future . " back-in-favor kuranyi leads the line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi will be germany 's most experienced player having only come back into the national side in last month 's 3-1 win over switzerland , 25-year-old kuranyi is staking a strong case for his place in the first-choice side and is hoping to build on a superb performance . " kuranyi has proved that he is in a good vein of form and is scoring some good goals , " löw said .
" it 's nice to have some options up front . " kuranyi is likely to partner bayer leverkusen forward paul freier in attack against the danes , while the squad 's goalkeepers , uncapped robert enke and reserve timo hildebrand , get their chance to stake a claim . pacy midfielder clemens fritz from werder bremen will start alongside bremen left-back christian schulz and defender vfl wolfsburg 's alexander madlung , who is set to add to his single cap he won last autumn in the 2-0 win over georgia .
bayer leverkusen midfielder simon rolfes will also get his chance . jogi looks to the future in euro break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a break in qualifiers , jogi can experiment the friendly is a sensible time for löw , who has an impressive record as coach of seven wins and a draw having succeeded jürgen klinsmann last year , to look to the future . with no more euro 2008 qualifying fixtures until the visit of minnows san marino in june , denmark , who lost 2-1 to spain in madrid at the weekend , will provide a good work out for his inexperienced side . however , morten olsen , the opposing coach , is less than happy about facing a deliberately under-strength germany team in duisburg . danes not amused " this is very disrespectful , " olsen was quoted as saying by german media on tuesday .
" we had a clear agreement to field our strongest teams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morten olsen 's denmark are having a torrid campaign " i was n't told about it by the dfb -lrb- german soccer association -rrb- .
i read about it in the newspapers and you do n't do that . " the 57-year-old also fears that a game against a weakened germany will hamper his preparations for their euro 2008 qualifier against sweden in june . but 25-year-old rolfes was adamant germany will be no push-overs at duisburg 's msv-arena and olsen 's worries will be proved wrong . " the danes do not need to underestimate us , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 28.03.2007 euro 2008 half-time report card : qualifying surprises abound großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eyes on the prize : euro 2008 may be over a year away but the trophy is on everyone 's mind the euro 2008 qualifiers reached the half-way stage wednesday .
while a few of the groups are reverting to type , others have thrown up a number of surprises .
dw-world.de takes a look at the standings . germany are on course to qualify in style for next summer 's european championships in austria and switzerland .
with four wins and a draw in their first five group d games , jogi löw 's team sit on top with 13 points at the halfway mark .
with six games to go in the qualifiers , germany would have to suffer a major reverse in fortunes to find themselves out of the tournament before it even begins . elsewhere in the qualification groups , things are not going so swimmingly for other nations with high hopes of making it to the championships and mounting a serious challenge for the euro 2008 title . group a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's ever-modest ronaldo scored twice saturday things are evenly poised in group a with poland , finland , portugal and serbia all contesting the two qualifying places .
leaders poland thrashed the minnows of azerbaijan 5-0 on saturday and could be in for another hatful against armenia on wednesday . finland could maintain pressure on the poles by adding more misery to the azerbaijanis and portugal , who romped to a 4-0 win over belgium at the weekend , could put some distance between themselves and serbia in fourth by beating the serbians in oporto .
given the form of the top three teams and their opposition , the table is unlikely to change after wednesday 's matches . group b fans of the game will probably view group b 's current status with a lot of surprise and maybe a little happiness .
scotland sit atop of a group which includes world champions italy , world cup runners-up france and quarter-finalists ukraine .
if the scots , under new manager alex mcleish , reach the finals , it will be the first major championship they 've been to since the 1996 european championships in england .
equal on points with raymond domenech 's les bleus , scotland take on fourth-placed italy on wednesday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup success has not been carried over for italy roberto donadoni inherited the world champions from predecessor marcello lippi but has not been able to instill the same level of performance from the azzurri .
two wins , a draw and a defeat in their four games leave the italians needing a win against scotland to keep pace with the unlikely group leaders .
meanwhile , france take a break from qualification by playing austria in a friendly after beating lithuania 1-0 on saturday . group c turkey 's annihilation of greece in piraeus at the weekend was a victory in every way .
the 4-1 away win took turkey three points clear of their bitter sporting , historical and geopolitical rival and gave the turks the spoils in the contest for national pride .
their next opponents , fourth-placed norway , could improve their group position by two places if reigning euro champs greece lose to malta .
third-placed bosnia-herzegovina do n't play another qualifier until june when they take on current leaders turkey at home . group d unbeaten germany can look down from the top of the group on wednesday knowing that even if the second-placed czech republic beat strugglers cyprus in prague , which they should , jogi löw 's free-scoring team will still be leaders on goal difference with a game in hand on their nearest rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish and czechs are chasing leaders germany elsewhere , the republic of ireland in third look to get another three points on the board against slovakia in fourth .
the irish have been disappointing and under-fire coach steve staunton will take little solace in a win on wednesday , even though it would take them up to second if the czechs inexplicably lose .
ireland will have played two games more than germany and one more than the czech republic , meaning the breathing space afforded them by victory over slovakia could be short-lived . group e croatia and russia continue to battle it out for supremacy in group e with favorites for qualification england languishing in third .
both the top two teams remain unbeaten , with russia in second after drawing one more game than leaders croatia .
neither team plays again in group e until june which gives england a chance to collect some much needed points .
a loss against croatia , and goalless draws with macedonia and israel have left steve mcclaren 's team floundering in their worst competitive run since 1981 with just one goal in their last five matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wayne rooney and england are having scoring problems even a comprehensive win against bottom team andorra could see england drop to fourth if israel win against second-from-bottom estonia .
uefa 's placing system means that teams drawn on points are placed in regard to their results against each other .
the draw in tel-aviv would be counted in israel 's favor and could spell darker days for england even if they run riot in barcelona . group f there are more surprises in group f where favorites spain find themselves stuttering in fourth place , six points behind group leaders sweden .
luis aragones ' unquestionably talented team are once again under-achieving and despite beating third-placed denmark 2-1 at the weekend , spain are already looking like a team which could struggle to qualify . northern ireland , however , a team which at the start of the campaign looked certain to finish way off the qualifying places , inhabit second place ahead of their top two clash with sweden on wednesday .
a win over lars lagerbaek 's team will lift them to the summit , albeit having played a game more . group g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : group g hug : the dutch intend to keep out in front group leaders holland look comfortable on eleven points ahead of wednesday 's matches but after playing a game more than both bulgaria in second and romania in third , their three point lead over the two eastern european teams could look more fragile after the coming round . bulgaria have a break until june , but romania could move up a place if they beat bottom team luxembourg as expected .
the dutch entertain the tricky slovenians at home and will hope to put some daylight between themselves and the hunting pack immediately behind by ending fifth-placed slovenia hopes of overtaking non-competing belarus in fourth . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de löw to blood german youngsters much to denmark 's chagrin germany 's coach joachim löw will ring the changes for wednesday night 's friendly against denmark by announcing an inexperienced 16-man squad aimed at blooding some of his rising stars .

while a few of the groups are reverting to type , others have thrown up a number of surprises .
dw-world.de takes a look at the standings . germany are on course to qualify in style for next summer 's european championships in austria and switzerland .
with four wins and a draw in their first five group d games , jogi löw 's team sit on top with 13 points at the halfway mark .
with six games to go in the qualifiers , germany would have to suffer a major reverse in fortunes to find themselves out of the tournament before it even begins . elsewhere in the qualification groups , things are not going so swimmingly for other nations with high hopes of making it to the championships and mounting a serious challenge for the euro 2008 title . group a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's ever-modest ronaldo scored twice saturday things are evenly poised in group a with poland , finland , portugal and serbia all contesting the two qualifying places .
leaders poland thrashed the minnows of azerbaijan 5-0 on saturday and could be in for another hatful against armenia on wednesday . finland could maintain pressure on the poles by adding more misery to the azerbaijanis and portugal , who romped to a 4-0 win over belgium at the weekend , could put some distance between themselves and serbia in fourth by beating the serbians in oporto .
given the form of the top three teams and their opposition , the table is unlikely to change after wednesday 's matches . group b fans of the game will probably view group b 's current status with a lot of surprise and maybe a little happiness .
scotland sit atop of a group which includes world champions italy , world cup runners-up france and quarter-finalists ukraine .
if the scots , under new manager alex mcleish , reach the finals , it will be the first major championship they 've been to since the 1996 european championships in england .
equal on points with raymond domenech 's les bleus , scotland take on fourth-placed italy on wednesday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup success has not been carried over for italy roberto donadoni inherited the world champions from predecessor marcello lippi but has not been able to instill the same level of performance from the azzurri .
two wins , a draw and a defeat in their four games leave the italians needing a win against scotland to keep pace with the unlikely group leaders .
meanwhile , france take a break from qualification by playing austria in a friendly after beating lithuania 1-0 on saturday . group c turkey 's annihilation of greece in piraeus at the weekend was a victory in every way .
the 4-1 away win took turkey three points clear of their bitter sporting , historical and geopolitical rival and gave the turks the spoils in the contest for national pride .
their next opponents , fourth-placed norway , could improve their group position by two places if reigning euro champs greece lose to malta .
third-placed bosnia-herzegovina do n't play another qualifier until june when they take on current leaders turkey at home . group d unbeaten germany can look down from the top of the group on wednesday knowing that even if the second-placed czech republic beat strugglers cyprus in prague , which they should , jogi löw 's free-scoring team will still be leaders on goal difference with a game in hand on their nearest rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish and czechs are chasing leaders germany elsewhere , the republic of ireland in third look to get another three points on the board against slovakia in fourth .
the irish have been disappointing and under-fire coach steve staunton will take little solace in a win on wednesday , even though it would take them up to second if the czechs inexplicably lose .
ireland will have played two games more than germany and one more than the czech republic , meaning the breathing space afforded them by victory over slovakia could be short-lived . group e croatia and russia continue to battle it out for supremacy in group e with favorites for qualification england languishing in third .
both the top two teams remain unbeaten , with russia in second after drawing one more game than leaders croatia .
neither team plays again in group e until june which gives england a chance to collect some much needed points .
a loss against croatia , and goalless draws with macedonia and israel have left steve mcclaren 's team floundering in their worst competitive run since 1981 with just one goal in their last five matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wayne rooney and england are having scoring problems even a comprehensive win against bottom team andorra could see england drop to fourth if israel win against second-from-bottom estonia .
uefa 's placing system means that teams drawn on points are placed in regard to their results against each other .
the draw in tel-aviv would be counted in israel 's favor and could spell darker days for england even if they run riot in barcelona . group f there are more surprises in group f where favorites spain find themselves stuttering in fourth place , six points behind group leaders sweden .
luis aragones ' unquestionably talented team are once again under-achieving and despite beating third-placed denmark 2-1 at the weekend , spain are already looking like a team which could struggle to qualify . northern ireland , however , a team which at the start of the campaign looked certain to finish way off the qualifying places , inhabit second place ahead of their top two clash with sweden on wednesday .
a win over lars lagerbaek 's team will lift them to the summit , albeit having played a game more . group g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : group g hug : the dutch intend to keep out in front group leaders holland look comfortable on eleven points ahead of wednesday 's matches but after playing a game more than both bulgaria in second and romania in third , their three point lead over the two eastern european teams could look more fragile after the coming round . bulgaria have a break until june , but romania could move up a place if they beat bottom team luxembourg as expected .
the dutch entertain the tricky slovenians at home and will hope to put some daylight between themselves and the hunting pack immediately behind by ending fifth-placed slovenia hopes of overtaking non-competing belarus in fourth . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de löw to blood german youngsters much to denmark 's chagrin germany 's coach joachim löw will ring the changes for wednesday night 's friendly against denmark by announcing an inexperienced 16-man squad aimed at blooding some of his rising stars .

while a few of the groups are reverting to type , others have thrown up a number of surprises .
dw-world.de takes a look at the standings . germany are on course to qualify in style for next summer 's european championships in austria and switzerland .
with four wins and a draw in their first five group d games , jogi löw 's team sit on top with 13 points at the halfway mark .
with six games to go in the qualifiers , germany would have to suffer a major reverse in fortunes to find themselves out of the tournament before it even begins . elsewhere in the qualification groups , things are not going so swimmingly for other nations with high hopes of making it to the championships and mounting a serious challenge for the euro 2008 title . group a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's ever-modest ronaldo scored twice saturday things are evenly poised in group a with poland , finland , portugal and serbia all contesting the two qualifying places .
leaders poland thrashed the minnows of azerbaijan 5-0 on saturday and could be in for another hatful against armenia on wednesday . finland could maintain pressure on the poles by adding more misery to the azerbaijanis and portugal , who romped to a 4-0 win over belgium at the weekend , could put some distance between themselves and serbia in fourth by beating the serbians in oporto .
given the form of the top three teams and their opposition , the table is unlikely to change after wednesday 's matches . group b fans of the game will probably view group b 's current status with a lot of surprise and maybe a little happiness .
scotland sit atop of a group which includes world champions italy , world cup runners-up france and quarter-finalists ukraine .

" the case undoubtedly has a large practical importance , " said gerda müller , the karlsruhe court 's vice president .
she added that the verdict also applies to sites that allow parties to reply directly to the accusations against them . the case in question was initiated when the head of an association to fight child pornography was labeled a pedophile twice in an internet forum dealing with sexual abuse .
though the authors in both cases left the message with pseudonyms , the association 's head was able to obtain the name of the author for one entry . the association 's head sued for the removal of the two entries from the forum .
the high court 's decision to hold both the author and forum 's operators responsible for entries overturned a lower court 's decision that forced operators to remove forum entries only when they were written anonymously . careful screening required the main point of debate in the case was whether individuals can hold site operators accountable for content posted by third parties , with the defendant 's lawyers arguing the sites simply provide a forum for public discussion and can not control what is said .

" the european union should concern itself with the future rather than the past , " turkish foreign minister abdullah gül told reporters when asked about the mug . " if the eu has a future vision , it should look to the future , " he said .
" harping on the past does not befit the eu vision . " turkish newspapers said that the mug depicted napoleon 's 1799 victory over ottoman forces in egypt and reflected hostility towards turkey . it was given to chirac as a retirement gift by german chancellor angela merkel at celebrations of the eu 's 50th anniversary over the weekend . merkel is opposed to full membership for turkey and has instead advocated a special partnership with the sizeable mainly muslim country . mixed feelings about turkey 's accession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish foreign minister gül turkey 's bid suffered a serious blow in december when the eu froze its membership talks in eight of the 35 policy areas that candidates are required to complete in response to ankara 's refusal to grant trade privileges to cyprus . turkey had also complained before the weekend celebration that accession candidates like itself had not been being invited to the eu 's 50th birthday party , saying " it would have been meaningful , in terms of demonstrating once again the unity of the european family . " this unity has given way to " enlargement fatigue " in countries like germany where polls show there is little appetite to take on more members after the 12 mostly eastern european nations that have joined since 2004 . but other states like ireland and britain are in favor of newcomers joining the bloc , which has seen its population balloon to nearly 500 million since the founding treaty of rome was signed in 1957 . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de readers respond to 50 years of european unity europe was on readers ' minds this week , as they weighed in on the eu 's 50th birthday in berlin , european identity and the role of religion in eu constitution .

" there are currently about 180,000 people , mainly from afghanistan , iraq and kosovo , in germany with " tolerated " status after their applications for asylum denied .

6 , if germany did not pull its troops out of afghanistan by the beginning of last week .
the german government has refused to meet the demand . the hostages ' fate remains unknown more than a week after the kidnappers ' ultimatum ran out . they are n't the first germans to be kidnapped in iraq .
despite clear instructions from the foreign ministry not to travel to or stay in iraq and a string of incidents involving the kidnapping of german nationals by local militias , some 100 germans still remain in the country . ministry spokesman jens plötner said that number included embassy officials , people traveling there for short trips and germans with family bonds to iraqis - mainly german women who are married to iraqis and have lived in the country for decades . businesses looking for locals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin crisis staff said they are " very concerned " about the kidnapped germans but whether they are married to iraqis and live in the country or are only in iraq a short time , foreigners are at greater danger than locals since they make higher profile targets , according to nadine flache of the berlin-based rebuild iraq recruitment program , which matches german and other european companies with local workers . given the rampant instablity in the country , most german companies are now relying heavily on locals to represent them instead of risking sending their own staff to iraq . " german and european companies can run projects in iraq while keeping their staff 's travel to a minimum , " she said , adding that iraqis with university degrees and technical skills are among the most sought after , but companies have also looked for tax advisors and cooks . though gelan khulusi , head of midan , a german-iraqi association for midsized businesses , would not name the handful of german companies in iraq he advises , he said germans are making short trips to iraq . germans keep visits short and get help " some iraqi ministries or companies sometimes require german or other foreign partners to be present to sign contracts , " he told german public broadcaster zdf .
" that 's a reason german businesspeople are in baghdad from time to time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an array of security companies offer their services to visitors in iraq but visitors to iraq are seldom aware of the danger the country poses outside of baghdad , according to private security consultant alex breingan , head of praetoria consulting . " people are very surprised when we confront them with actual number on attacks , shootings and how many people are killed in other regions , " he said . while wary of stating hard numbers , breingan said he and his team of about 800 bodyguards has worked with mid-sized and large german companies in the past and that more and more germans have recently contacted him to protect their projects and employees . he said his company offers means of protection in iraq , varying from high-profile convoys to less conspicuous drivers at costs of between 4,000 euros and 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 5,337 and $ 10,675 -rrb- per day depending on the task and location . aid organizations ' work impaired aid organizations ' staff members are also at risk - at least 84 aid workers have been killed in iraq since 2003 , according to international ngo coordination group ncci - but the groups ' regular and long-term contact with iraqis makes it difficult for them to avoid becoming kidnapping targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : care international 's margaret hassan was kidnapped and killed in iraq in 2004 bonn-based help , the last german aid organization working in iraq , stopped its projects at the beginning of march , spokesman berthold engelmann said .
the group had been working on supplying water and defusing mines and unexploded bombs . " we stopped using international workers in september 2004 , " he said .
" we continued working with local workers until the end of february but because of the security situation , we ca n't work there at all at the moment . " kidnappings drove organization away should the country become relatively safer , frank mc areavey , who organized help 's programs in iraq , said he would have no qualms about returning to the country , adding that there had never been any reprisals against help workers . " when workers arrived in april 2003 there was no reason to be scared , " he said from amman , where he is evaluating future help projects .
" the situation changed in august 2003 when the united nations was bombed in baghdad and the increasing number of kidnapped foreigners was the deciding reason for leaving .

a very youthful german side lose out by a single goal no michael ballack , no miroslav klose and no jens lehmann : in their place robert enke , simon rolfes and roberto hibert .
including substitutes , a total of 7 players wore national team colours for the first time ever in the friendly against denmark in duisburg .
as coach joachim löw was able to experiment without the pressure of a qualifying match .
but löw paid the price in the end , with his first defeat in charge of the national side .
danish striker niclas bendtner scored the only in the 82nd minute after some good wing play by jesper groenkjar .
however trainer joachim löw was happy with his fledgling stars .
" there were a lot of young players out there " .
löw commented after the game , adding that the experience was very important for their development .
" one day they will have to replace frings , ballack or klose .
we took the risk that we might lose the game , but it was great experience for the youngsters " , löw said .
it was the first international game to be played in duisburg since 1933 , and although the fans were a little disappointed at not seeing their heroes from the world cup , the new , young team did inspire the crowd in the first half with some neat passing movements .
however the tempo dropped a little after the restart as both teams took the meaning " friendly " rather too literally .
not many fouls and not much energy .
denmark , fielding their strongest side had the better of the chances in the 2nd half the most impressive of the debutants doesn ’ t even play top-flight football .
patrick helmes , from 2nd division cologne , had 3 great chances despite only coming on late in the game .
helmes said it had been a great honour but he was still disappointed at not winning .
" a goal would have topped it off " , he smiled and cheekily added he would have to try better in koblenz on sunday .

a very youthful german side lose out by a single goal no michael ballack , no miroslav klose and no jens lehmann : in their place robert enke , simon rolfes and roberto hibert .
including substitutes , a total of 7 players wore national team colours for the first time ever in the friendly against denmark in duisburg .
as coach joachim löw was able to experiment without the pressure of a qualifying match .
but löw paid the price in the end , with his first defeat in charge of the national side .
danish striker niclas bendtner scored the only in the 82nd minute after some good wing play by jesper groenkjar .
however trainer joachim löw was happy with his fledgling stars .
" there were a lot of young players out there " .
löw commented after the game , adding that the experience was very important for their development .
" one day they will have to replace frings , ballack or klose .
we took the risk that we might lose the game , but it was great experience for the youngsters " , löw said .
it was the first international game to be played in duisburg since 1933 , and although the fans were a little disappointed at not seeing their heroes from the world cup , the new , young team did inspire the crowd in the first half with some neat passing movements .
however the tempo dropped a little after the restart as both teams took the meaning " friendly " rather too literally .
not many fouls and not much energy .
denmark , fielding their strongest side had the better of the chances in the 2nd half the most impressive of the debutants doesn ’ t even play top-flight football .
patrick helmes , from 2nd division cologne , had 3 great chances despite only coming on late in the game .
helmes said it had been a great honour but he was still disappointed at not winning .
" a goal would have topped it off " , he smiled and cheekily added he would have to try better in koblenz on sunday .
despite some signs of dissatisfaction from the supporters , a very young and inexperienced germany side certainly held their own on the international stage – a promising sign for the future . rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

" kuranyi has proved that he is in a good vein of form and is scoring some good goals , " löw said .
" it 's nice to have some options up front . " kuranyi is likely to partner bayer leverkusen forward paul freier in attack against the danes , while the squad 's goalkeepers , uncapped robert enke and reserve timo hildebrand , get their chance to stake a claim . pacy midfielder clemens fritz from werder bremen will start alongside bremen left-back christian schulz and defender vfl wolfsburg 's alexander madlung , who is set to add to his single cap he won last autumn in the 2-0 win over georgia .
bayer leverkusen midfielder simon rolfes will also get his chance . jogi looks to the future in euro break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a break in qualifiers , jogi can experiment the friendly is a sensible time for löw , who has an impressive record as coach of seven wins and a draw having succeeded jürgen klinsmann last year , to look to the future . with no more euro 2008 qualifying fixtures until the visit of minnows san marino in june , denmark , who lost 2-1 to spain in madrid at the weekend , will provide a good work out for his inexperienced side . however , morten olsen , the opposing coach , is less than happy about facing a deliberately under-strength germany team in duisburg . danes not amused " this is very disrespectful , " olsen was quoted as saying by german media on tuesday .
" we had a clear agreement to field our strongest teams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morten olsen 's denmark are having a torrid campaign " i was n't told about it by the dfb -lrb- german soccer association -rrb- .
i read about it in the newspapers and you do n't do that . " the 57-year-old also fears that a game against a weakened germany will hamper his preparations for their euro 2008 qualifier against sweden in june . but 25-year-old rolfes was adamant germany will be no push-overs at duisburg 's msv-arena and olsen 's worries will be proved wrong . " the danes do not need to underestimate us , " he said .
" this is a huge challenge for us , we want to prove we are good enough for the national side . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de training germany 's next soccer elite germany head into euro 2008 with loads of good youngsters .

" opening the archive " is a vital contribution to the world 's collective memory and understanding of the holocaust , " the resolution said .
it needs the full house 's approval to formally take effect . long-debated issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opening up archives to defy holocaust deniers ?
of the 11 countries that oversee the archive 's administration , israel , the united states , poland and the netherlands have ratified changes in a 1955 treaty that banned the use of files for research . belgium , france , germany , greece , italy , luxembourg and britain have yet to ratify the changes . the archive 's 11-nation steering committee meets in may , and the panel urged members to agree to open the records at that meeting if any ratification are still pending at that point . the us government and the us holocaust memorial museum in washington have led international pressure to open the storehouse , which is administered by the swiss-based international committee of the red cross . in a major step , the german government agreed last year to support the changes .
currently , italy and greece are seen as potential key holdouts . public access to the records " is a moral and humanitarian imperative , " especially because of " the short time left to holocaust survivors , " the house committee said . the panel is chaired by tom lantos , 79 , a hungarian-born democratic representative from california and the only holocaust survivor in the us congress .
the democratic-led committee passed the measure by a voice vote . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us presses for quicker opening of nazi archives american lawmakers are concerned that further delays in granting access to the nazi files constitutes an injustice to elderly holocaust survivors .

" the case undoubtedly has a large practical importance , " said gerda müller , the karlsruhe court 's vice president .
she added that the verdict also applies to sites that allow parties to reply directly to the accusations against them . the case in question was initiated when the head of an association to fight child pornography was labeled a pedophile twice in an internet forum dealing with sexual abuse .
though the authors in both cases left the message with pseudonyms , the association 's head was able to obtain the name of the author for one entry . the association 's head sued for the removal of the two entries from the forum .
the high court 's decision to hold both the author and forum 's operators responsible for entries overturned a lower court 's decision that forced operators to remove forum entries only when they were written anonymously . careful screening required the main point of debate in the case was whether individuals can hold site operators accountable for content posted by third parties , with the defendant 's lawyers arguing the sites simply provide a forum for public discussion and can not control what is said .
lawyers for the plaintiff said that forum operators should be held accountable for messages their forums spread . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling may change what information forum operators require from users the decision will force internet forum operators to undertake more efforts validate users ' identities before allowing them to post comments , ralf möbius , an internet lawyer in hanover said . " they will definitely have to check their sites more regularly , " he told die zeit newspaper .
" for a long time the perception was that one could not pursue legal action against the place where wrongdoing occurs .
naturally the operator has to do something about entries in his forum .

while a few of the groups are reverting to type , others have thrown up a number of surprises .
dw-world.de takes a look at the standings . germany are on course to qualify in style for next summer 's european championships in austria and switzerland .
with four wins and a draw in their first five group d games , jogi löw 's team sit on top with 13 points at the halfway mark .
with six games to go in the qualifiers , germany would have to suffer a major reverse in fortunes to find themselves out of the tournament before it even begins . elsewhere in the qualification groups , things are not going so swimmingly for other nations with high hopes of making it to the championships and mounting a serious challenge for the euro 2008 title . group a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's ever-modest ronaldo scored twice saturday things are evenly poised in group a with poland , finland , portugal and serbia all contesting the two qualifying places .
leaders poland thrashed the minnows of azerbaijan 5-0 on saturday and could be in for another hatful against armenia on wednesday . finland could maintain pressure on the poles by adding more misery to the azerbaijanis and portugal , who romped to a 4-0 win over belgium at the weekend , could put some distance between themselves and serbia in fourth by beating the serbians in oporto .
given the form of the top three teams and their opposition , the table is unlikely to change after wednesday 's matches . group b fans of the game will probably view group b 's current status with a lot of surprise and maybe a little happiness .
scotland sit atop of a group which includes world champions italy , world cup runners-up france and quarter-finalists ukraine .
if the scots , under new manager alex mcleish , reach the finals , it will be the first major championship they 've been to since the 1996 european championships in england .
equal on points with raymond domenech 's les bleus , scotland take on fourth-placed italy on wednesday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup success has not been carried over for italy roberto donadoni inherited the world champions from predecessor marcello lippi but has not been able to instill the same level of performance from the azzurri .
two wins , a draw and a defeat in their four games leave the italians needing a win against scotland to keep pace with the unlikely group leaders .
meanwhile , france take a break from qualification by playing austria in a friendly after beating lithuania 1-0 on saturday . group c turkey 's annihilation of greece in piraeus at the weekend was a victory in every way .
the 4-1 away win took turkey three points clear of their bitter sporting , historical and geopolitical rival and gave the turks the spoils in the contest for national pride .
their next opponents , fourth-placed norway , could improve their group position by two places if reigning euro champs greece lose to malta .
third-placed bosnia-herzegovina do n't play another qualifier until june when they take on current leaders turkey at home . group d unbeaten germany can look down from the top of the group on wednesday knowing that even if the second-placed czech republic beat strugglers cyprus in prague , which they should , jogi löw 's free-scoring team will still be leaders on goal difference with a game in hand on their nearest rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish and czechs are chasing leaders germany elsewhere , the republic of ireland in third look to get another three points on the board against slovakia in fourth .
the irish have been disappointing and under-fire coach steve staunton will take little solace in a win on wednesday , even though it would take them up to second if the czechs inexplicably lose .
ireland will have played two games more than germany and one more than the czech republic , meaning the breathing space afforded them by victory over slovakia could be short-lived . group e croatia and russia continue to battle it out for supremacy in group e with favorites for qualification england languishing in third .
both the top two teams remain unbeaten , with russia in second after drawing one more game than leaders croatia .
neither team plays again in group e until june which gives england a chance to collect some much needed points .
a loss against croatia , and goalless draws with macedonia and israel have left steve mcclaren 's team floundering in their worst competitive run since 1981 with just one goal in their last five matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wayne rooney and england are having scoring problems even a comprehensive win against bottom team andorra could see england drop to fourth if israel win against second-from-bottom estonia .
uefa 's placing system means that teams drawn on points are placed in regard to their results against each other .
the draw in tel-aviv would be counted in israel 's favor and could spell darker days for england even if they run riot in barcelona . group f there are more surprises in group f where favorites spain find themselves stuttering in fourth place , six points behind group leaders sweden .
luis aragones ' unquestionably talented team are once again under-achieving and despite beating third-placed denmark 2-1 at the weekend , spain are already looking like a team which could struggle to qualify . northern ireland , however , a team which at the start of the campaign looked certain to finish way off the qualifying places , inhabit second place ahead of their top two clash with sweden on wednesday .
a win over lars lagerbaek 's team will lift them to the summit , albeit having played a game more . group g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : group g hug : the dutch intend to keep out in front group leaders holland look comfortable on eleven points ahead of wednesday 's matches but after playing a game more than both bulgaria in second and romania in third , their three point lead over the two eastern european teams could look more fragile after the coming round . bulgaria have a break until june , but romania could move up a place if they beat bottom team luxembourg as expected .
the dutch entertain the tricky slovenians at home and will hope to put some daylight between themselves and the hunting pack immediately behind by ending fifth-placed slovenia hopes of overtaking non-competing belarus in fourth . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de löw to blood german youngsters much to denmark 's chagrin germany 's coach joachim löw will ring the changes for wednesday night 's friendly against denmark by announcing an inexperienced 16-man squad aimed at blooding some of his rising stars .

their next opponents , fourth-placed norway , could improve their group position by two places if reigning euro champs greece lose to malta .
third-placed bosnia-herzegovina do n't play another qualifier until june when they take on current leaders turkey at home . group d unbeaten germany can look down from the top of the group on wednesday knowing that even if the second-placed czech republic beat strugglers cyprus in prague , which they should , jogi löw 's free-scoring team will still be leaders on goal difference with a game in hand on their nearest rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish and czechs are chasing leaders germany elsewhere , the republic of ireland in third look to get another three points on the board against slovakia in fourth .
the irish have been disappointing and under-fire coach steve staunton will take little solace in a win on wednesday , even though it would take them up to second if the czechs inexplicably lose .
ireland will have played two games more than germany and one more than the czech republic , meaning the breathing space afforded them by victory over slovakia could be short-lived . group e croatia and russia continue to battle it out for supremacy in group e with favorites for qualification england languishing in third .
both the top two teams remain unbeaten , with russia in second after drawing one more game than leaders croatia .
neither team plays again in group e until june which gives england a chance to collect some much needed points .
a loss against croatia , and goalless draws with macedonia and israel have left steve mcclaren 's team floundering in their worst competitive run since 1981 with just one goal in their last five matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wayne rooney and england are having scoring problems even a comprehensive win against bottom team andorra could see england drop to fourth if israel win against second-from-bottom estonia .
uefa 's placing system means that teams drawn on points are placed in regard to their results against each other .
the draw in tel-aviv would be counted in israel 's favor and could spell darker days for england even if they run riot in barcelona . group f there are more surprises in group f where favorites spain find themselves stuttering in fourth place , six points behind group leaders sweden .
luis aragones ' unquestionably talented team are once again under-achieving and despite beating third-placed denmark 2-1 at the weekend , spain are already looking like a team which could struggle to qualify . northern ireland , however , a team which at the start of the campaign looked certain to finish way off the qualifying places , inhabit second place ahead of their top two clash with sweden on wednesday .
a win over lars lagerbaek 's team will lift them to the summit , albeit having played a game more . group g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : group g hug : the dutch intend to keep out in front group leaders holland look comfortable on eleven points ahead of wednesday 's matches but after playing a game more than both bulgaria in second and romania in third , their three point lead over the two eastern european teams could look more fragile after the coming round . bulgaria have a break until june , but romania could move up a place if they beat bottom team luxembourg as expected .

while a few of the groups are reverting to type , others have thrown up a number of surprises .
dw-world.de takes a look at the standings . germany are on course to qualify in style for next summer 's european championships in austria and switzerland .
with four wins and a draw in their first five group d games , jogi löw 's team sit on top with 13 points at the halfway mark .
with six games to go in the qualifiers , germany would have to suffer a major reverse in fortunes to find themselves out of the tournament before it even begins . elsewhere in the qualification groups , things are not going so swimmingly for other nations with high hopes of making it to the championships and mounting a serious challenge for the euro 2008 title . group a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's ever-modest ronaldo scored twice saturday things are evenly poised in group a with poland , finland , portugal and serbia all contesting the two qualifying places .
leaders poland thrashed the minnows of azerbaijan 5-0 on saturday and could be in for another hatful against armenia on wednesday . finland could maintain pressure on the poles by adding more misery to the azerbaijanis and portugal , who romped to a 4-0 win over belgium at the weekend , could put some distance between themselves and serbia in fourth by beating the serbians in oporto .
given the form of the top three teams and their opposition , the table is unlikely to change after wednesday 's matches . group b fans of the game will probably view group b 's current status with a lot of surprise and maybe a little happiness .
scotland sit atop of a group which includes world champions italy , world cup runners-up france and quarter-finalists ukraine .
if the scots , under new manager alex mcleish , reach the finals , it will be the first major championship they 've been to since the 1996 european championships in england .
equal on points with raymond domenech 's les bleus , scotland take on fourth-placed italy on wednesday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup success has not been carried over for italy roberto donadoni inherited the world champions from predecessor marcello lippi but has not been able to instill the same level of performance from the azzurri .

" there are currently about 180,000 people , mainly from afghanistan , iraq and kosovo , in germany with " tolerated " status after their applications for asylum denied .
edathy said it would be difficult to estimate how many of them would be able to find jobs in germany . language skills highlighted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians said being able to speak german was crucial for foreigners additionally , the compromise requires spouses who immigrate to germany be at least 18 years old and have basic german language skills .
the deal also threatens unspecified sanctions for foreigners who refuse to participate in language and integration courses . an emphasis on language proficiency in the nearly 500-page bill , which requires parliamentary approval before becoming law , was a crucial point for hans-peter uhl , the christian conservatives ' interior affairs expert . he said being able to converse in german was " the least that can be expected when someone who wants to move the center of his life to germany . " openness to foreigners needed the government also called for germans to be open to the immigrants living around them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's interior minister called for openness and tolerance toward foreigners " in addition to what the state is doing and the honest willingness of migrants to work , we also need support from the general population to confront the people coming to us in a open and tolerant manner , " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble wrote in an op-ed for die zeit newspaper . co-leader of the opposition greens party , claudia roth , had harsh words for the draft , calling it the result of a " competition in paltriness " that would only benefit those " who proved economically useful " while those truly in need of protection would get no help at all . organizations representing foreigners in germany also expressed their unhappiness about the deal in an open letter to chancellor angela merkel . signed by germany 's protestant and catholic churches as well as amnesty international and pro aysl , the letter was critical of the language requirements saying that courses were difficult for foreigners living in rural areas to attend and that requiring language skills for spouses was discriminatory . a spokeswoman for the dgb trade union federation said the new regulations " are not a solution to better integration , but only deal with old cases which only benefit a minority .

" since the spanish government has still not withdrawn the illegal measures ... the commission has decided to refer the case -lrb- to court -rrb- , " the commission said in a statement . e.on made a take-over bid for spain 's biggest energy company endesa last year .
although eu regulators approved the merger unconditionally , it met with strong resistance from spanish politicians .
the spanish energy regulator cne then set a number of requirements for the sale . the commission ruled in september 2006 that these conditions violated eu rules by breaching measures on the free movement of capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain does n't want e.on to sell off endesa assests in the canary or balearic islands in response , spain lifted part of the conditions and limited their duration , but argued that the requirements were necessary to secure the national energy supply and did not create a problem because e.on had accepted them . the spanish government bound e.on to hold onto endesa 's brand name for five years , to refrain from selling off endesa 's electricity assets outside mainland spain and to keep using spanish fuel in endesa 's coal-powered plants . eu wants energy sector to open up the commission 's decision to refer the cast to court is the latest twist in a test case for european cross-border deals in the energy sector , underlining the eu executive 's determination to crack down on what it sees as spain 's protectionist behavior . the move comes just two days after e.on scored a key victory in its long-running battle for control of endesa .
on monday , endesa 's board backed e.on 's bid of 42.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 56.5 billion -rrb- for the takeover . counter bid for endesa however , spanish construction firm acciona and italian electricity company enel , both endesa shareholders , said they would launch a joint counter-bid for the spanish power company and would improve on e.on 's offer by at least one euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is fighting tooth and nail to stop the eon take-over of endesa while e.on 's latest bid values endesa at 42.4 billion euros , the enel-acciona offer would bring endesa 's value to 43.4 billion euros . e.on announced on tuesday had secured caja madrid 's 9.9 percent stake in endesa by means of a swap agreement with the spanish bank .
the german company , however , needs at least 50 percent for its bid to succeed . enel and acciona together already hold about a 46 per cent stake in endesa . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de endesa bidding war heats up as board backs e.on german energy giant e.on ag scored a key victory monday in its long-running battle for control of endesa after the spanish power company 's board backed its 42.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 56.5 billion -rrb- to take over the group .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.03.2007 in unstable iraq , german firms rely on local help to do the job großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lack of security has made german firms and aid groups reconsider their projects in iraq violence , kidnappings and crumbling security in iraq has meant that german businesses and aid groups are increasingly turning to local iraqis to run the show . in a recent video message , kidnappers from a militia in iraq threatened to kill two german nationals , a 61-year-old woman and her 20-year-old son who were taken hostage on feb .
6 , if germany did not pull its troops out of afghanistan by the beginning of last week .
the german government has refused to meet the demand . the hostages ' fate remains unknown more than a week after the kidnappers ' ultimatum ran out . they are n't the first germans to be kidnapped in iraq .
despite clear instructions from the foreign ministry not to travel to or stay in iraq and a string of incidents involving the kidnapping of german nationals by local militias , some 100 germans still remain in the country . ministry spokesman jens plötner said that number included embassy officials , people traveling there for short trips and germans with family bonds to iraqis - mainly german women who are married to iraqis and have lived in the country for decades . businesses looking for locals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin crisis staff said they are " very concerned " about the kidnapped germans but whether they are married to iraqis and live in the country or are only in iraq a short time , foreigners are at greater danger than locals since they make higher profile targets , according to nadine flache of the berlin-based rebuild iraq recruitment program , which matches german and other european companies with local workers . given the rampant instablity in the country , most german companies are now relying heavily on locals to represent them instead of risking sending their own staff to iraq . " german and european companies can run projects in iraq while keeping their staff 's travel to a minimum , " she said , adding that iraqis with university degrees and technical skills are among the most sought after , but companies have also looked for tax advisors and cooks . though gelan khulusi , head of midan , a german-iraqi association for midsized businesses , would not name the handful of german companies in iraq he advises , he said germans are making short trips to iraq . germans keep visits short and get help " some iraqi ministries or companies sometimes require german or other foreign partners to be present to sign contracts , " he told german public broadcaster zdf .
" that 's a reason german businesspeople are in baghdad from time to time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an array of security companies offer their services to visitors in iraq but visitors to iraq are seldom aware of the danger the country poses outside of baghdad , according to private security consultant alex breingan , head of praetoria consulting . " people are very surprised when we confront them with actual number on attacks , shootings and how many people are killed in other regions , " he said . while wary of stating hard numbers , breingan said he and his team of about 800 bodyguards has worked with mid-sized and large german companies in the past and that more and more germans have recently contacted him to protect their projects and employees . he said his company offers means of protection in iraq , varying from high-profile convoys to less conspicuous drivers at costs of between 4,000 euros and 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 5,337 and $ 10,675 -rrb- per day depending on the task and location . aid organizations ' work impaired aid organizations ' staff members are also at risk - at least 84 aid workers have been killed in iraq since 2003 , according to international ngo coordination group ncci - but the groups ' regular and long-term contact with iraqis makes it difficult for them to avoid becoming kidnapping targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : care international 's margaret hassan was kidnapped and killed in iraq in 2004 bonn-based help , the last german aid organization working in iraq , stopped its projects at the beginning of march , spokesman berthold engelmann said .
the group had been working on supplying water and defusing mines and unexploded bombs . " we stopped using international workers in september 2004 , " he said .
" we continued working with local workers until the end of february but because of the security situation , we ca n't work there at all at the moment . " kidnappings drove organization away should the country become relatively safer , frank mc areavey , who organized help 's programs in iraq , said he would have no qualms about returning to the country , adding that there had never been any reprisals against help workers . " when workers arrived in april 2003 there was no reason to be scared , " he said from amman , where he is evaluating future help projects .
" the situation changed in august 2003 when the united nations was bombed in baghdad and the increasing number of kidnapped foreigners was the deciding reason for leaving .

but relatives of claus schenk graf von stauffenberg have criticized the casting , fearing cruise will bring scientology into the film . caspar schenk graf von stauffenberg , one of the officer 's 12 grandchildren , told germany 's bild am sonntag newspaper that he had nothing against new films about his grandfather .
however , he said he and " other family members are worried that the picture will be financed by -lrb- scientologists -rrb- and be used to get across its propaganda . " " unfortunately the family stauffenberg can do nothing about this , " he was quoted as saying .
" my grandfather is a figure from history . " resistance hero claus von stauffenberg was a german wehrmacht officer who joined the resistance against the nazis because he believed hitler 's military ambitions would destroy the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the heavy damage to the briefing room , hitler survived the bomb attack on july 20 1944 , stauffenberg planted a bomb in a briefing room next to adolph hitler .
the bomb exploded and killed several high-ranking officers but the führer survived because a massive oak table took the brunt of the explosion . the assassination of hitler was supposed to trigger a military coup , named " operation valkyrie " .
stauffenberg was subsequently caught and shot by firing squad the same night .

" the period of weakness in the consumer climate appears to have come to an end , at least for now , " the gfk said . the renewed rise in consumers ' willingness to spend was causing the change , according to the institute . the improvement in consumer sentiment in germany also follows signs of a pickup in the nation 's unemployment rate and the prospects of higher pay settlements this year after a protracted period of weak wage growth . rosier outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower unemployment could be enhancing consumer sentiment economists expect data to be released thursday that will show seasonally adjusted unemployment in germany falling by 50,000 in march after a 79,000 fall in february - with employers hiring more in the wake of the economic upswing that started last year . " the rosier outlook for jobs also led consumers to hope that the collective wage bargaining and salary rises would be higher in some industries this year than in past years , " the gfk said . based on a survey of about 2,000 consumers , the gfk 's poll measuring consumers ' propensity to spend rose to minus 12.3 from minus 16 , while an index measuring income expectations jumped to 15.9 from 2.9 .

while a few of the groups are reverting to type , others have thrown up a number of surprises .
dw-world.de takes a look at the standings . germany are on course to qualify in style for next summer 's european championships in austria and switzerland .
with four wins and a draw in their first five group d games , jogi löw 's team sit on top with 13 points at the halfway mark .
with six games to go in the qualifiers , germany would have to suffer a major reverse in fortunes to find themselves out of the tournament before it even begins . elsewhere in the qualification groups , things are not going so swimmingly for other nations with high hopes of making it to the championships and mounting a serious challenge for the euro 2008 title . group a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's ever-modest ronaldo scored twice saturday things are evenly poised in group a with poland , finland , portugal and serbia all contesting the two qualifying places .
leaders poland thrashed the minnows of azerbaijan 5-0 on saturday and could be in for another hatful against armenia on wednesday . finland could maintain pressure on the poles by adding more misery to the azerbaijanis and portugal , who romped to a 4-0 win over belgium at the weekend , could put some distance between themselves and serbia in fourth by beating the serbians in oporto .
given the form of the top three teams and their opposition , the table is unlikely to change after wednesday 's matches . group b fans of the game will probably view group b 's current status with a lot of surprise and maybe a little happiness .
scotland sit atop of a group which includes world champions italy , world cup runners-up france and quarter-finalists ukraine .
if the scots , under new manager alex mcleish , reach the finals , it will be the first major championship they 've been to since the 1996 european championships in england .
equal on points with raymond domenech 's les bleus , scotland take on fourth-placed italy on wednesday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup success has not been carried over for italy roberto donadoni inherited the world champions from predecessor marcello lippi but has not been able to instill the same level of performance from the azzurri .
two wins , a draw and a defeat in their four games leave the italians needing a win against scotland to keep pace with the unlikely group leaders .
meanwhile , france take a break from qualification by playing austria in a friendly after beating lithuania 1-0 on saturday . group c turkey 's annihilation of greece in piraeus at the weekend was a victory in every way .
the 4-1 away win took turkey three points clear of their bitter sporting , historical and geopolitical rival and gave the turks the spoils in the contest for national pride .
their next opponents , fourth-placed norway , could improve their group position by two places if reigning euro champs greece lose to malta .
third-placed bosnia-herzegovina do n't play another qualifier until june when they take on current leaders turkey at home . group d unbeaten germany can look down from the top of the group on wednesday knowing that even if the second-placed czech republic beat strugglers cyprus in prague , which they should , jogi löw 's free-scoring team will still be leaders on goal difference with a game in hand on their nearest rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish and czechs are chasing leaders germany elsewhere , the republic of ireland in third look to get another three points on the board against slovakia in fourth .
the irish have been disappointing and under-fire coach steve staunton will take little solace in a win on wednesday , even though it would take them up to second if the czechs inexplicably lose .
ireland will have played two games more than germany and one more than the czech republic , meaning the breathing space afforded them by victory over slovakia could be short-lived . group e croatia and russia continue to battle it out for supremacy in group e with favorites for qualification england languishing in third .
both the top two teams remain unbeaten , with russia in second after drawing one more game than leaders croatia .
neither team plays again in group e until june which gives england a chance to collect some much needed points .
a loss against croatia , and goalless draws with macedonia and israel have left steve mcclaren 's team floundering in their worst competitive run since 1981 with just one goal in their last five matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wayne rooney and england are having scoring problems even a comprehensive win against bottom team andorra could see england drop to fourth if israel win against second-from-bottom estonia .
uefa 's placing system means that teams drawn on points are placed in regard to their results against each other .
the draw in tel-aviv would be counted in israel 's favor and could spell darker days for england even if they run riot in barcelona . group f there are more surprises in group f where favorites spain find themselves stuttering in fourth place , six points behind group leaders sweden .
luis aragones ' unquestionably talented team are once again under-achieving and despite beating third-placed denmark 2-1 at the weekend , spain are already looking like a team which could struggle to qualify . northern ireland , however , a team which at the start of the campaign looked certain to finish way off the qualifying places , inhabit second place ahead of their top two clash with sweden on wednesday .
a win over lars lagerbaek 's team will lift them to the summit , albeit having played a game more . group g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : group g hug : the dutch intend to keep out in front group leaders holland look comfortable on eleven points ahead of wednesday 's matches but after playing a game more than both bulgaria in second and romania in third , their three point lead over the two eastern european teams could look more fragile after the coming round . bulgaria have a break until june , but romania could move up a place if they beat bottom team luxembourg as expected .
the dutch entertain the tricky slovenians at home and will hope to put some daylight between themselves and the hunting pack immediately behind by ending fifth-placed slovenia hopes of overtaking non-competing belarus in fourth . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de löw to blood german youngsters much to denmark 's chagrin germany 's coach joachim löw will ring the changes for wednesday night 's friendly against denmark by announcing an inexperienced 16-man squad aimed at blooding some of his rising stars .

while a few of the groups are reverting to type , others have thrown up a number of surprises .
dw-world.de takes a look at the standings . germany are on course to qualify in style for next summer 's european championships in austria and switzerland .
with four wins and a draw in their first five group d games , jogi löw 's team sit on top with 13 points at the halfway mark .
with six games to go in the qualifiers , germany would have to suffer a major reverse in fortunes to find themselves out of the tournament before it even begins . elsewhere in the qualification groups , things are not going so swimmingly for other nations with high hopes of making it to the championships and mounting a serious challenge for the euro 2008 title . group a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's ever-modest ronaldo scored twice saturday things are evenly poised in group a with poland , finland , portugal and serbia all contesting the two qualifying places .
leaders poland thrashed the minnows of azerbaijan 5-0 on saturday and could be in for another hatful against armenia on wednesday . finland could maintain pressure on the poles by adding more misery to the azerbaijanis and portugal , who romped to a 4-0 win over belgium at the weekend , could put some distance between themselves and serbia in fourth by beating the serbians in oporto .
given the form of the top three teams and their opposition , the table is unlikely to change after wednesday 's matches . group b fans of the game will probably view group b 's current status with a lot of surprise and maybe a little happiness .
scotland sit atop of a group which includes world champions italy , world cup runners-up france and quarter-finalists ukraine .
if the scots , under new manager alex mcleish , reach the finals , it will be the first major championship they 've been to since the 1996 european championships in england .
equal on points with raymond domenech 's les bleus , scotland take on fourth-placed italy on wednesday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup success has not been carried over for italy roberto donadoni inherited the world champions from predecessor marcello lippi but has not been able to instill the same level of performance from the azzurri .
two wins , a draw and a defeat in their four games leave the italians needing a win against scotland to keep pace with the unlikely group leaders .
meanwhile , france take a break from qualification by playing austria in a friendly after beating lithuania 1-0 on saturday . group c turkey 's annihilation of greece in piraeus at the weekend was a victory in every way .
the 4-1 away win took turkey three points clear of their bitter sporting , historical and geopolitical rival and gave the turks the spoils in the contest for national pride .
their next opponents , fourth-placed norway , could improve their group position by two places if reigning euro champs greece lose to malta .
third-placed bosnia-herzegovina do n't play another qualifier until june when they take on current leaders turkey at home . group d unbeaten germany can look down from the top of the group on wednesday knowing that even if the second-placed czech republic beat strugglers cyprus in prague , which they should , jogi löw 's free-scoring team will still be leaders on goal difference with a game in hand on their nearest rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish and czechs are chasing leaders germany elsewhere , the republic of ireland in third look to get another three points on the board against slovakia in fourth .
the irish have been disappointing and under-fire coach steve staunton will take little solace in a win on wednesday , even though it would take them up to second if the czechs inexplicably lose .
ireland will have played two games more than germany and one more than the czech republic , meaning the breathing space afforded them by victory over slovakia could be short-lived . group e croatia and russia continue to battle it out for supremacy in group e with favorites for qualification england languishing in third .

while a few of the groups are reverting to type , others have thrown up a number of surprises .
dw-world.de takes a look at the standings . germany are on course to qualify in style for next summer 's european championships in austria and switzerland .
with four wins and a draw in their first five group d games , jogi löw 's team sit on top with 13 points at the halfway mark .
with six games to go in the qualifiers , germany would have to suffer a major reverse in fortunes to find themselves out of the tournament before it even begins . elsewhere in the qualification groups , things are not going so swimmingly for other nations with high hopes of making it to the championships and mounting a serious challenge for the euro 2008 title . group a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's ever-modest ronaldo scored twice saturday things are evenly poised in group a with poland , finland , portugal and serbia all contesting the two qualifying places .
leaders poland thrashed the minnows of azerbaijan 5-0 on saturday and could be in for another hatful against armenia on wednesday . finland could maintain pressure on the poles by adding more misery to the azerbaijanis and portugal , who romped to a 4-0 win over belgium at the weekend , could put some distance between themselves and serbia in fourth by beating the serbians in oporto .
given the form of the top three teams and their opposition , the table is unlikely to change after wednesday 's matches . group b fans of the game will probably view group b 's current status with a lot of surprise and maybe a little happiness .
scotland sit atop of a group which includes world champions italy , world cup runners-up france and quarter-finalists ukraine .
if the scots , under new manager alex mcleish , reach the finals , it will be the first major championship they 've been to since the 1996 european championships in england .
equal on points with raymond domenech 's les bleus , scotland take on fourth-placed italy on wednesday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup success has not been carried over for italy roberto donadoni inherited the world champions from predecessor marcello lippi but has not been able to instill the same level of performance from the azzurri .
two wins , a draw and a defeat in their four games leave the italians needing a win against scotland to keep pace with the unlikely group leaders .
meanwhile , france take a break from qualification by playing austria in a friendly after beating lithuania 1-0 on saturday . group c turkey 's annihilation of greece in piraeus at the weekend was a victory in every way .
the 4-1 away win took turkey three points clear of their bitter sporting , historical and geopolitical rival and gave the turks the spoils in the contest for national pride .
their next opponents , fourth-placed norway , could improve their group position by two places if reigning euro champs greece lose to malta .
third-placed bosnia-herzegovina do n't play another qualifier until june when they take on current leaders turkey at home . group d unbeaten germany can look down from the top of the group on wednesday knowing that even if the second-placed czech republic beat strugglers cyprus in prague , which they should , jogi löw 's free-scoring team will still be leaders on goal difference with a game in hand on their nearest rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish and czechs are chasing leaders germany elsewhere , the republic of ireland in third look to get another three points on the board against slovakia in fourth .
the irish have been disappointing and under-fire coach steve staunton will take little solace in a win on wednesday , even though it would take them up to second if the czechs inexplicably lose .
ireland will have played two games more than germany and one more than the czech republic , meaning the breathing space afforded them by victory over slovakia could be short-lived . group e croatia and russia continue to battle it out for supremacy in group e with favorites for qualification england languishing in third .
both the top two teams remain unbeaten , with russia in second after drawing one more game than leaders croatia .
neither team plays again in group e until june which gives england a chance to collect some much needed points .
a loss against croatia , and goalless draws with macedonia and israel have left steve mcclaren 's team floundering in their worst competitive run since 1981 with just one goal in their last five matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wayne rooney and england are having scoring problems even a comprehensive win against bottom team andorra could see england drop to fourth if israel win against second-from-bottom estonia .
uefa 's placing system means that teams drawn on points are placed in regard to their results against each other .
the draw in tel-aviv would be counted in israel 's favor and could spell darker days for england even if they run riot in barcelona . group f there are more surprises in group f where favorites spain find themselves stuttering in fourth place , six points behind group leaders sweden .
luis aragones ' unquestionably talented team are once again under-achieving and despite beating third-placed denmark 2-1 at the weekend , spain are already looking like a team which could struggle to qualify . northern ireland , however , a team which at the start of the campaign looked certain to finish way off the qualifying places , inhabit second place ahead of their top two clash with sweden on wednesday .
a win over lars lagerbaek 's team will lift them to the summit , albeit having played a game more . group g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : group g hug : the dutch intend to keep out in front group leaders holland look comfortable on eleven points ahead of wednesday 's matches but after playing a game more than both bulgaria in second and romania in third , their three point lead over the two eastern european teams could look more fragile after the coming round . bulgaria have a break until june , but romania could move up a place if they beat bottom team luxembourg as expected .
the dutch entertain the tricky slovenians at home and will hope to put some daylight between themselves and the hunting pack immediately behind by ending fifth-placed slovenia hopes of overtaking non-competing belarus in fourth . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de löw to blood german youngsters much to denmark 's chagrin germany 's coach joachim löw will ring the changes for wednesday night 's friendly against denmark by announcing an inexperienced 16-man squad aimed at blooding some of his rising stars .

" tolerated " refugees in germany , those who have not been given asylum status but could not be sent back to the country of origin for humanitarian reasons .
under the agreement , long-term foreigners in germany who have be given until the end of 2009 to find a job . " it creates a new staring point for affected people who want to live here in germany , " christian democratic union migration expert maria böhmer told deutschlandfunk radio , adding that joining the workforce would aid foreigners ' integration . sebastian edathy , the head of the bundestag 's interior committee and social democratic party member told rbb-inforadio the compromise was " sensible and humane " because " the long-time tolerated are not required to live off welfare and instead are allowed to work . " there are currently about 180,000 people , mainly from afghanistan , iraq and kosovo , in germany with " tolerated " status after their applications for asylum denied .
edathy said it would be difficult to estimate how many of them would be able to find jobs in germany . language skills highlighted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians said being able to speak german was crucial for foreigners additionally , the compromise requires spouses who immigrate to germany be at least 18 years old and have basic german language skills .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.03.2007 in unstable iraq , german firms rely on local help to do the job großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lack of security has made german firms and aid groups reconsider their projects in iraq violence , kidnappings and crumbling security in iraq has meant that german businesses and aid groups are increasingly turning to local iraqis to run the show . in a recent video message , kidnappers from a militia in iraq threatened to kill two german nationals , a 61-year-old woman and her 20-year-old son who were taken hostage on feb .
6 , if germany did not pull its troops out of afghanistan by the beginning of last week .
the german government has refused to meet the demand . the hostages ' fate remains unknown more than a week after the kidnappers ' ultimatum ran out . they are n't the first germans to be kidnapped in iraq .
despite clear instructions from the foreign ministry not to travel to or stay in iraq and a string of incidents involving the kidnapping of german nationals by local militias , some 100 germans still remain in the country . ministry spokesman jens plötner said that number included embassy officials , people traveling there for short trips and germans with family bonds to iraqis - mainly german women who are married to iraqis and have lived in the country for decades . businesses looking for locals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin crisis staff said they are " very concerned " about the kidnapped germans but whether they are married to iraqis and live in the country or are only in iraq a short time , foreigners are at greater danger than locals since they make higher profile targets , according to nadine flache of the berlin-based rebuild iraq recruitment program , which matches german and other european companies with local workers . given the rampant instablity in the country , most german companies are now relying heavily on locals to represent them instead of risking sending their own staff to iraq . " german and european companies can run projects in iraq while keeping their staff 's travel to a minimum , " she said , adding that iraqis with university degrees and technical skills are among the most sought after , but companies have also looked for tax advisors and cooks . though gelan khulusi , head of midan , a german-iraqi association for midsized businesses , would not name the handful of german companies in iraq he advises , he said germans are making short trips to iraq . germans keep visits short and get help " some iraqi ministries or companies sometimes require german or other foreign partners to be present to sign contracts , " he told german public broadcaster zdf .
" that 's a reason german businesspeople are in baghdad from time to time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an array of security companies offer their services to visitors in iraq but visitors to iraq are seldom aware of the danger the country poses outside of baghdad , according to private security consultant alex breingan , head of praetoria consulting . " people are very surprised when we confront them with actual number on attacks , shootings and how many people are killed in other regions , " he said . while wary of stating hard numbers , breingan said he and his team of about 800 bodyguards has worked with mid-sized and large german companies in the past and that more and more germans have recently contacted him to protect their projects and employees . he said his company offers means of protection in iraq , varying from high-profile convoys to less conspicuous drivers at costs of between 4,000 euros and 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 5,337 and $ 10,675 -rrb- per day depending on the task and location . aid organizations ' work impaired aid organizations ' staff members are also at risk - at least 84 aid workers have been killed in iraq since 2003 , according to international ngo coordination group ncci - but the groups ' regular and long-term contact with iraqis makes it difficult for them to avoid becoming kidnapping targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : care international 's margaret hassan was kidnapped and killed in iraq in 2004 bonn-based help , the last german aid organization working in iraq , stopped its projects at the beginning of march , spokesman berthold engelmann said .
the group had been working on supplying water and defusing mines and unexploded bombs . " we stopped using international workers in september 2004 , " he said .
" we continued working with local workers until the end of february but because of the security situation , we ca n't work there at all at the moment . " kidnappings drove organization away should the country become relatively safer , frank mc areavey , who organized help 's programs in iraq , said he would have no qualms about returning to the country , adding that there had never been any reprisals against help workers . " when workers arrived in april 2003 there was no reason to be scared , " he said from amman , where he is evaluating future help projects .
" the situation changed in august 2003 when the united nations was bombed in baghdad and the increasing number of kidnapped foreigners was the deciding reason for leaving .

" opening the archive " is a vital contribution to the world 's collective memory and understanding of the holocaust , " the resolution said .

of the 11 countries that oversee the archive 's administration , israel , the united states , poland and the netherlands have ratified changes in a 1955 treaty that banned the use of files for research . belgium , france , germany , greece , italy , luxembourg and britain have yet to ratify the changes . the archive 's 11-nation steering committee meets in may , and the panel urged members to agree to open the records at that meeting if any ratification are still pending at that point . the us government and the us holocaust memorial museum in washington have led international pressure to open the storehouse , which is administered by the swiss-based international committee of the red cross . in a major step , the german government agreed last year to support the changes .
currently , italy and greece are seen as potential key holdouts . public access to the records " is a moral and humanitarian imperative , " especially because of " the short time left to holocaust survivors , " the house committee said . the panel is chaired by tom lantos , 79 , a hungarian-born democratic representative from california and the only holocaust survivor in the us congress .
the democratic-led committee passed the measure by a voice vote . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us presses for quicker opening of nazi archives american lawmakers are concerned that further delays in granting access to the nazi files constitutes an injustice to elderly holocaust survivors .

while a few of the groups are reverting to type , others have thrown up a number of surprises .
dw-world.de takes a look at the standings . germany are on course to qualify in style for next summer 's european championships in austria and switzerland .
with four wins and a draw in their first five group d games , jogi löw 's team sit on top with 13 points at the halfway mark .
with six games to go in the qualifiers , germany would have to suffer a major reverse in fortunes to find themselves out of the tournament before it even begins . elsewhere in the qualification groups , things are not going so swimmingly for other nations with high hopes of making it to the championships and mounting a serious challenge for the euro 2008 title . group a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's ever-modest ronaldo scored twice saturday things are evenly poised in group a with poland , finland , portugal and serbia all contesting the two qualifying places .
leaders poland thrashed the minnows of azerbaijan 5-0 on saturday and could be in for another hatful against armenia on wednesday . finland could maintain pressure on the poles by adding more misery to the azerbaijanis and portugal , who romped to a 4-0 win over belgium at the weekend , could put some distance between themselves and serbia in fourth by beating the serbians in oporto .
given the form of the top three teams and their opposition , the table is unlikely to change after wednesday 's matches . group b fans of the game will probably view group b 's current status with a lot of surprise and maybe a little happiness .
scotland sit atop of a group which includes world champions italy , world cup runners-up france and quarter-finalists ukraine .
if the scots , under new manager alex mcleish , reach the finals , it will be the first major championship they 've been to since the 1996 european championships in england .
equal on points with raymond domenech 's les bleus , scotland take on fourth-placed italy on wednesday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup success has not been carried over for italy roberto donadoni inherited the world champions from predecessor marcello lippi but has not been able to instill the same level of performance from the azzurri .
two wins , a draw and a defeat in their four games leave the italians needing a win against scotland to keep pace with the unlikely group leaders .
meanwhile , france take a break from qualification by playing austria in a friendly after beating lithuania 1-0 on saturday . group c turkey 's annihilation of greece in piraeus at the weekend was a victory in every way .
the 4-1 away win took turkey three points clear of their bitter sporting , historical and geopolitical rival and gave the turks the spoils in the contest for national pride .
their next opponents , fourth-placed norway , could improve their group position by two places if reigning euro champs greece lose to malta .
third-placed bosnia-herzegovina do n't play another qualifier until june when they take on current leaders turkey at home . group d unbeaten germany can look down from the top of the group on wednesday knowing that even if the second-placed czech republic beat strugglers cyprus in prague , which they should , jogi löw 's free-scoring team will still be leaders on goal difference with a game in hand on their nearest rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish and czechs are chasing leaders germany elsewhere , the republic of ireland in third look to get another three points on the board against slovakia in fourth .
the irish have been disappointing and under-fire coach steve staunton will take little solace in a win on wednesday , even though it would take them up to second if the czechs inexplicably lose .
ireland will have played two games more than germany and one more than the czech republic , meaning the breathing space afforded them by victory over slovakia could be short-lived . group e croatia and russia continue to battle it out for supremacy in group e with favorites for qualification england languishing in third .
both the top two teams remain unbeaten , with russia in second after drawing one more game than leaders croatia .
neither team plays again in group e until june which gives england a chance to collect some much needed points .
a loss against croatia , and goalless draws with macedonia and israel have left steve mcclaren 's team floundering in their worst competitive run since 1981 with just one goal in their last five matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wayne rooney and england are having scoring problems even a comprehensive win against bottom team andorra could see england drop to fourth if israel win against second-from-bottom estonia .
uefa 's placing system means that teams drawn on points are placed in regard to their results against each other .
the draw in tel-aviv would be counted in israel 's favor and could spell darker days for england even if they run riot in barcelona . group f there are more surprises in group f where favorites spain find themselves stuttering in fourth place , six points behind group leaders sweden .
luis aragones ' unquestionably talented team are once again under-achieving and despite beating third-placed denmark 2-1 at the weekend , spain are already looking like a team which could struggle to qualify . northern ireland , however , a team which at the start of the campaign looked certain to finish way off the qualifying places , inhabit second place ahead of their top two clash with sweden on wednesday .
a win over lars lagerbaek 's team will lift them to the summit , albeit having played a game more . group g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : group g hug : the dutch intend to keep out in front group leaders holland look comfortable on eleven points ahead of wednesday 's matches but after playing a game more than both bulgaria in second and romania in third , their three point lead over the two eastern european teams could look more fragile after the coming round . bulgaria have a break until june , but romania could move up a place if they beat bottom team luxembourg as expected .
the dutch entertain the tricky slovenians at home and will hope to put some daylight between themselves and the hunting pack immediately behind by ending fifth-placed slovenia hopes of overtaking non-competing belarus in fourth . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de löw to blood german youngsters much to denmark 's chagrin germany 's coach joachim löw will ring the changes for wednesday night 's friendly against denmark by announcing an inexperienced 16-man squad aimed at blooding some of his rising stars .

while a few of the groups are reverting to type , others have thrown up a number of surprises .
dw-world.de takes a look at the standings . germany are on course to qualify in style for next summer 's european championships in austria and switzerland .
with four wins and a draw in their first five group d games , jogi löw 's team sit on top with 13 points at the halfway mark .
with six games to go in the qualifiers , germany would have to suffer a major reverse in fortunes to find themselves out of the tournament before it even begins . elsewhere in the qualification groups , things are not going so swimmingly for other nations with high hopes of making it to the championships and mounting a serious challenge for the euro 2008 title . group a bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's ever-modest ronaldo scored twice saturday things are evenly poised in group a with poland , finland , portugal and serbia all contesting the two qualifying places .
leaders poland thrashed the minnows of azerbaijan 5-0 on saturday and could be in for another hatful against armenia on wednesday . finland could maintain pressure on the poles by adding more misery to the azerbaijanis and portugal , who romped to a 4-0 win over belgium at the weekend , could put some distance between themselves and serbia in fourth by beating the serbians in oporto .
given the form of the top three teams and their opposition , the table is unlikely to change after wednesday 's matches . group b fans of the game will probably view group b 's current status with a lot of surprise and maybe a little happiness .
scotland sit atop of a group which includes world champions italy , world cup runners-up france and quarter-finalists ukraine .
if the scots , under new manager alex mcleish , reach the finals , it will be the first major championship they 've been to since the 1996 european championships in england .
equal on points with raymond domenech 's les bleus , scotland take on fourth-placed italy on wednesday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup success has not been carried over for italy roberto donadoni inherited the world champions from predecessor marcello lippi but has not been able to instill the same level of performance from the azzurri .

" opening the archive " is a vital contribution to the world 's collective memory and understanding of the holocaust , " the resolution said .
it needs the full house 's approval to formally take effect . long-debated issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opening up archives to defy holocaust deniers ?
of the 11 countries that oversee the archive 's administration , israel , the united states , poland and the netherlands have ratified changes in a 1955 treaty that banned the use of files for research . belgium , france , germany , greece , italy , luxembourg and britain have yet to ratify the changes . the archive 's 11-nation steering committee meets in may , and the panel urged members to agree to open the records at that meeting if any ratification are still pending at that point . the us government and the us holocaust memorial museum in washington have led international pressure to open the storehouse , which is administered by the swiss-based international committee of the red cross . in a major step , the german government agreed last year to support the changes .
currently , italy and greece are seen as potential key holdouts . public access to the records " is a moral and humanitarian imperative , " especially because of " the short time left to holocaust survivors , " the house committee said . the panel is chaired by tom lantos , 79 , a hungarian-born democratic representative from california and the only holocaust survivor in the us congress .
the democratic-led committee passed the measure by a voice vote . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us presses for quicker opening of nazi archives american lawmakers are concerned that further delays in granting access to the nazi files constitutes an injustice to elderly holocaust survivors .

currently , italy and greece are seen as potential key holdouts . public access to the records " is a moral and humanitarian imperative , " especially because of " the short time left to holocaust survivors , " the house committee said . the panel is chaired by tom lantos , 79 , a hungarian-born democratic representative from california and the only holocaust survivor in the us congress .

" since the spanish government has still not withdrawn the illegal measures ... the commission has decided to refer the case -lrb- to court -rrb- , " the commission said in a statement . e.on made a take-over bid for spain 's biggest energy company endesa last year .

" since the spanish government has still not withdrawn the illegal measures ... the commission has decided to refer the case -lrb- to court -rrb- , " the commission said in a statement . e.on made a take-over bid for spain 's biggest energy company endesa last year .
although eu regulators approved the merger unconditionally , it met with strong resistance from spanish politicians .
the spanish energy regulator cne then set a number of requirements for the sale . the commission ruled in september 2006 that these conditions violated eu rules by breaching measures on the free movement of capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain does n't want e.on to sell off endesa assests in the canary or balearic islands in response , spain lifted part of the conditions and limited their duration , but argued that the requirements were necessary to secure the national energy supply and did not create a problem because e.on had accepted them . the spanish government bound e.on to hold onto endesa 's brand name for five years , to refrain from selling off endesa 's electricity assets outside mainland spain and to keep using spanish fuel in endesa 's coal-powered plants . eu wants energy sector to open up the commission 's decision to refer the cast to court is the latest twist in a test case for european cross-border deals in the energy sector , underlining the eu executive 's determination to crack down on what it sees as spain 's protectionist behavior . the move comes just two days after e.on scored a key victory in its long-running battle for control of endesa .
on monday , endesa 's board backed e.on 's bid of 42.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 56.5 billion -rrb- for the takeover . counter bid for endesa however , spanish construction firm acciona and italian electricity company enel , both endesa shareholders , said they would launch a joint counter-bid for the spanish power company and would improve on e.on 's offer by at least one euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is fighting tooth and nail to stop the eon take-over of endesa while e.on 's latest bid values endesa at 42.4 billion euros , the enel-acciona offer would bring endesa 's value to 43.4 billion euros . e.on announced on tuesday had secured caja madrid 's 9.9 percent stake in endesa by means of a swap agreement with the spanish bank .
the german company , however , needs at least 50 percent for its bid to succeed . enel and acciona together already hold about a 46 per cent stake in endesa . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de endesa bidding war heats up as board backs e.on german energy giant e.on ag scored a key victory monday in its long-running battle for control of endesa after the spanish power company 's board backed its 42.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 56.5 billion -rrb- to take over the group .

" since the spanish government has still not withdrawn the illegal measures ... the commission has decided to refer the case -lrb- to court -rrb- , " the commission said in a statement . e.on made a take-over bid for spain 's biggest energy company endesa last year .
although eu regulators approved the merger unconditionally , it met with strong resistance from spanish politicians .
the spanish energy regulator cne then set a number of requirements for the sale . the commission ruled in september 2006 that these conditions violated eu rules by breaching measures on the free movement of capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain does n't want e.on to sell off endesa assests in the canary or balearic islands in response , spain lifted part of the conditions and limited their duration , but argued that the requirements were necessary to secure the national energy supply and did not create a problem because e.on had accepted them . the spanish government bound e.on to hold onto endesa 's brand name for five years , to refrain from selling off endesa 's electricity assets outside mainland spain and to keep using spanish fuel in endesa 's coal-powered plants . eu wants energy sector to open up the commission 's decision to refer the cast to court is the latest twist in a test case for european cross-border deals in the energy sector , underlining the eu executive 's determination to crack down on what it sees as spain 's protectionist behavior . the move comes just two days after e.on scored a key victory in its long-running battle for control of endesa .
on monday , endesa 's board backed e.on 's bid of 42.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 56.5 billion -rrb- for the takeover . counter bid for endesa however , spanish construction firm acciona and italian electricity company enel , both endesa shareholders , said they would launch a joint counter-bid for the spanish power company and would improve on e.on 's offer by at least one euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is fighting tooth and nail to stop the eon take-over of endesa while e.on 's latest bid values endesa at 42.4 billion euros , the enel-acciona offer would bring endesa 's value to 43.4 billion euros . e.on announced on tuesday had secured caja madrid 's 9.9 percent stake in endesa by means of a swap agreement with the spanish bank .
the german company , however , needs at least 50 percent for its bid to succeed . enel and acciona together already hold about a 46 per cent stake in endesa . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de endesa bidding war heats up as board backs e.on german energy giant e.on ag scored a key victory monday in its long-running battle for control of endesa after the spanish power company 's board backed its 42.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 56.5 billion -rrb- to take over the group .
-lrb- 26.03.2007 -rrb- e.on calls for european energy market , lowers endesa bid the head of germany 's largest energy concern , e.on , has called for a european energy market , grouping germany and six of its neighbors .
the company also watered down its bid for the planned takeover of spanish endesa .

" this unity has given way to " enlargement fatigue " in countries like germany where polls show there is little appetite to take on more members after the 12 mostly eastern european nations that have joined since 2004 . but other states like ireland and britain are in favor of newcomers joining the bloc , which has seen its population balloon to nearly 500 million since the founding treaty of rome was signed in 1957 . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de readers respond to 50 years of european unity europe was on readers ' minds this week , as they weighed in on the eu 's 50th birthday in berlin , european identity and the role of religion in eu constitution .

the team played well as a unit and put together some intelligent phases of play , but we need to look at other options with a view to the future . " back-in-favor kuranyi leads the line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi will be germany 's most experienced player having only come back into the national side in last month 's 3-1 win over switzerland , 25-year-old kuranyi is staking a strong case for his place in the first-choice side and is hoping to build on a superb performance . " kuranyi has proved that he is in a good vein of form and is scoring some good goals , " löw said .
" it 's nice to have some options up front . " kuranyi is likely to partner bayer leverkusen forward paul freier in attack against the danes , while the squad 's goalkeepers , uncapped robert enke and reserve timo hildebrand , get their chance to stake a claim . pacy midfielder clemens fritz from werder bremen will start alongside bremen left-back christian schulz and defender vfl wolfsburg 's alexander madlung , who is set to add to his single cap he won last autumn in the 2-0 win over georgia .
bayer leverkusen midfielder simon rolfes will also get his chance . jogi looks to the future in euro break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a break in qualifiers , jogi can experiment the friendly is a sensible time for löw , who has an impressive record as coach of seven wins and a draw having succeeded jürgen klinsmann last year , to look to the future . with no more euro 2008 qualifying fixtures until the visit of minnows san marino in june , denmark , who lost 2-1 to spain in madrid at the weekend , will provide a good work out for his inexperienced side . however , morten olsen , the opposing coach , is less than happy about facing a deliberately under-strength germany team in duisburg . danes not amused " this is very disrespectful , " olsen was quoted as saying by german media on tuesday .
" we had a clear agreement to field our strongest teams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morten olsen 's denmark are having a torrid campaign " i was n't told about it by the dfb -lrb- german soccer association -rrb- .
i read about it in the newspapers and you do n't do that . " the 57-year-old also fears that a game against a weakened germany will hamper his preparations for their euro 2008 qualifier against sweden in june . but 25-year-old rolfes was adamant germany will be no push-overs at duisburg 's msv-arena and olsen 's worries will be proved wrong .

currently , italy and greece are seen as potential key holdouts . public access to the records " is a moral and humanitarian imperative , " especially because of " the short time left to holocaust survivors , " the house committee said . the panel is chaired by tom lantos , 79 , a hungarian-born democratic representative from california and the only holocaust survivor in the us congress .

6 , if germany did not pull its troops out of afghanistan by the beginning of last week .
the german government has refused to meet the demand . the hostages ' fate remains unknown more than a week after the kidnappers ' ultimatum ran out . they are n't the first germans to be kidnapped in iraq .
despite clear instructions from the foreign ministry not to travel to or stay in iraq and a string of incidents involving the kidnapping of german nationals by local militias , some 100 germans still remain in the country . ministry spokesman jens plötner said that number included embassy officials , people traveling there for short trips and germans with family bonds to iraqis - mainly german women who are married to iraqis and have lived in the country for decades . businesses looking for locals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin crisis staff said they are " very concerned " about the kidnapped germans but whether they are married to iraqis and live in the country or are only in iraq a short time , foreigners are at greater danger than locals since they make higher profile targets , according to nadine flache of the berlin-based rebuild iraq recruitment program , which matches german and other european companies with local workers . given the rampant instablity in the country , most german companies are now relying heavily on locals to represent them instead of risking sending their own staff to iraq . " german and european companies can run projects in iraq while keeping their staff 's travel to a minimum , " she said , adding that iraqis with university degrees and technical skills are among the most sought after , but companies have also looked for tax advisors and cooks . though gelan khulusi , head of midan , a german-iraqi association for midsized businesses , would not name the handful of german companies in iraq he advises , he said germans are making short trips to iraq . germans keep visits short and get help " some iraqi ministries or companies sometimes require german or other foreign partners to be present to sign contracts , " he told german public broadcaster zdf .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an array of security companies offer their services to visitors in iraq but visitors to iraq are seldom aware of the danger the country poses outside of baghdad , according to private security consultant alex breingan , head of praetoria consulting . " people are very surprised when we confront them with actual number on attacks , shootings and how many people are killed in other regions , " he said . while wary of stating hard numbers , breingan said he and his team of about 800 bodyguards has worked with mid-sized and large german companies in the past and that more and more germans have recently contacted him to protect their projects and employees . he said his company offers means of protection in iraq , varying from high-profile convoys to less conspicuous drivers at costs of between 4,000 euros and 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 5,337 and $ 10,675 -rrb- per day depending on the task and location . aid organizations ' work impaired aid organizations ' staff members are also at risk - at least 84 aid workers have been killed in iraq since 2003 , according to international ngo coordination group ncci - but the groups ' regular and long-term contact with iraqis makes it difficult for them to avoid becoming kidnapping targets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : care international 's margaret hassan was kidnapped and killed in iraq in 2004 bonn-based help , the last german aid organization working in iraq , stopped its projects at the beginning of march , spokesman berthold engelmann said .
the group had been working on supplying water and defusing mines and unexploded bombs . " we stopped using international workers in september 2004 , " he said .
" we continued working with local workers until the end of february but because of the security situation , we ca n't work there at all at the moment . " kidnappings drove organization away should the country become relatively safer , frank mc areavey , who organized help 's programs in iraq , said he would have no qualms about returning to the country , adding that there had never been any reprisals against help workers . " when workers arrived in april 2003 there was no reason to be scared , " he said from amman , where he is evaluating future help projects .

under the agreement , long-term foreigners in germany who have be given until the end of 2009 to find a job .

" there are currently about 180,000 people , mainly from afghanistan , iraq and kosovo , in germany with " tolerated " status after their applications for asylum denied .
edathy said it would be difficult to estimate how many of them would be able to find jobs in germany . language skills highlighted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians said being able to speak german was crucial for foreigners additionally , the compromise requires spouses who immigrate to germany be at least 18 years old and have basic german language skills .

bbc news -pipe- south asia -pipe- tiny island with a global warning bbc news / south asia graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- wednesday , 28 march 2007 , 04:08 gmt 05:08 uk tiny island with a global warning in the first of a series of reports , bbc world affairs correspondent mark doyle analyses the state of food production and consumption across the globe .
the tiny indian island of ghoramara , in the delta where the river ganges meets the bay of bengal , is a symbol of the crisis the world is facing as it struggles to feed a growing population .
it is a tiny place - just a few kilometres across - and it is getting tinier .
the island , part of a chain called the sundarbans , was first settled by farmers in colonial times when the authorities decided to expand rice production to feed the multitudes in the city of calcutta .
but when i visited ghoramara there was powerful evidence that soil erosion caused in part by farming and the rising surrounding sea level caused by global warming were gradually making the island disappear .
ajoy kumar patra , the headman on the island , stood on the shore looking across the broad choppy waters .
in the far distance a couple of kilometres away i could just make out another low-lying spit of land : " this island and that piece of land over there used to be separated by just a narrow channel of water " , says mr patra .
" all the land which is now underwater used to be rice paddies " .
man-made problems dr sugarto hazra , an oceanographer at the university of calcutta says there is more than one cause of the problem .
" cutting down the mangrove that used to cover the island , to make way for farming , destroyed the ecology , " he says .
the mangrove used to bind the topsoil in position .
now it is being washed away .
the farmers also used to dig wells to get fresh water for irrigating their paddies .
but in time , dr hazra says , underground reservoirs emptied and then collapsed .
added to all that , " the sea level is rising around here , as it is everywhere in response to global warming " , the oceanographer said .
" so the land is subsiding and at the same time the sea is advancing . "
the farmers of ghoramara have tried to save their island by building dykes around the edges .
but dr hazra says this is just a short term solution that may make the situation worse .
" the problem with the dykes is that they stop the sediment the river would normally deposit here from nourishing the island 's soil .
" the sediment is being washed out to sea rather than compensating for the rising water level . "
so the agriculture designed to feed the community on the island is in fact contributing to its death .
' tip-toeing into crisis ' experts in food production say ghoramara is a symbol of the dramatic combination of factors which mean the world is heading for extreme food shortages in the coming decades .
similar phenomena are taking place on other islands and in low-lying coastal plains around the world .
the factors which are impacting on food production include soil erosion caused by intensive farming , and global warming which could reduce the yield of staple grains or make weather patterns less predictable for farmers .
the relatively new phenomenon of bio-fuels - for example , the production of ethanol from corn which can be used to supplement petrol - may take a huge proportion of the output of the big grain farms in the american midwest .
" the global figures already show a drop in food stocks .
we have got less buffer stocks than we have had for many , many decades , " said dr tim lang , a food and nutrition expert at the city university in london .
" we are tip-toeing into the most enormous crisis . "
the over-consumption of food in many parts of the world is another issue .
there are now more overweight people than chronically hungry , and the number of people with " diseases of the rich " like diabetes is increasing , including in developing countries .
limits to growth ?
on current united nations projections , world population is set to increase from 6.6bn today to over 9bn by 2050 .
" in terms of the basic cereals like rice , wheat and maize , we probably need 50-60 % t more production by , say , 2030 " , warns mark rosegrant of the international food policy research institute in washington .
" and on meat production - pork , poultry and beef particularly - you really need a doubling . "
in the next report in this series , i will be exploring the factors which may limit the big increases in staple food output that the world 's expanding population will require .

the island of ghoramara is gradually disappearing the tiny indian island of ghoramara , in the delta where the river ganges meets the bay of bengal , is a symbol of the crisis the world is facing as it struggles to feed a growing population .
it is a tiny place - just a few kilometres across - and it is getting tinier .
the island , part of a chain called the sundarbans , was first settled by farmers in colonial times when the authorities decided to expand rice production to feed the multitudes in the city of calcutta .
but when i visited ghoramara there was powerful evidence that soil erosion caused in part by farming and the rising surrounding sea level caused by global warming were gradually making the island disappear .
ajoy kumar patra , the headman on the island , stood on the shore looking across the broad choppy waters .
in the far distance a couple of kilometres away i could just make out another low-lying spit of land : " this island and that piece of land over there used to be separated by just a narrow channel of water " , says mr patra .
" all the land which is now underwater used to be rice paddies " .
man-made problems dr sugarto hazra , an oceanographer at the university of calcutta says there is more than one cause of the problem .
ajoy kumar patra says his island is being washed away " cutting down the mangrove that used to cover the island , to make way for farming , destroyed the ecology , " he says .
the mangrove used to bind the topsoil in position .
now it is being washed away .
the farmers also used to dig wells to get fresh water for irrigating their paddies .
but in time , dr hazra says , underground reservoirs emptied and then collapsed .
added to all that , " the sea level is rising around here , as it is everywhere in response to global warming " , the oceanographer said .
" so the land is subsiding and at the same time the sea is advancing . "
the farmers of ghoramara have tried to save their island by building dykes around the edges .
but dr hazra says this is just a short term solution that may make the situation worse .
" the problem with the dykes is that they stop the sediment the river would normally deposit here from nourishing the island 's soil .
" the sediment is being washed out to sea rather than compensating for the rising water level . "
so the agriculture designed to feed the community on the island is in fact contributing to its death .
' tip-toeing into crisis ' experts in food production say ghoramara is a symbol of the dramatic combination of factors which mean the world is heading for extreme food shortages in the coming decades .
similar phenomena are taking place on other islands and in low-lying coastal plains around the world .
the dykes around the island are only a short-term solution the factors which are impacting on food production include soil erosion caused by intensive farming , and global warming which could reduce the yield of staple grains or make weather patterns less predictable for farmers .
the relatively new phenomenon of bio-fuels - for example , the production of ethanol from corn which can be used to supplement petrol - may take a huge proportion of the output of the big grain farms in the american midwest .
" the global figures already show a drop in food stocks .
we have got less buffer stocks than we have had for many , many decades , " said dr tim lang , a food and nutrition expert at the city university in london .
" we are tip-toeing into the most enormous crisis . "
the over-consumption of food in many parts of the world is another issue .
there are now more overweight people than chronically hungry , and the number of people with " diseases of the rich " like diabetes is increasing , including in developing countries .
limits to growth ?
on current united nations projections , world population is set to increase from 6.6bn today to over 9bn by 2050 .
" in terms of the basic cereals like rice , wheat and maize , we probably need 50-60 % t more production by , say , 2030 " , warns mark rosegrant of the international food policy research institute in washington .
" and on meat production - pork , poultry and beef particularly - you really need a doubling . "
in the next report in this series , i will be exploring the factors which may limit the big increases in staple food output that the world 's expanding population will require .
i will be asking if , like the islanders on ghoramara , we appear to have hit the buffers in terms of food production .

winds and waves have torn away the metal steps to the disused point of ayr lighthouse at talacre , flintshire .
it has left a gaping hole at the base of the 60ft -lrb- 18m -rrb- brick structure , owned by a nearby holiday caravan park .
peter angelides , of talacre beach group , said repairs had already been ordered and would include a new gangway as well as building work at the base .
the lighthouse in the dee estuary helped protect shipping along the coast from when it was built in 1776 until it was decommissioned in 1844 .
it was sold in 1922 .
it has remained a feature of the coastline where it is known as the talacre lighthouse , after a nearby resort , close to prestatyn .
adam corkhill , 24 , was visiting from salford , greater manchester , with his girlfriend when he photographed the storm damage .
he said : " it looks really bad up close .
the stairs are just hanging .
it looks like someone has laid them down on the ground but they must have been blown by the wind .
" it looks brilliant when it 's done up , but when it 's looking like that it might as well not be there . "
mr angelides said the lighthouse had come into the group 's ownership in recent years and underwent repairs and repainting routinely .
he said : " this is probably the most severe damage we 've seen , it 's purely storm damage .
it only happened last week . "
he said galvanised steps had already been ordered and the building would be repainted at the end of the summer .

the bank says plans by the children 's investment fund -lrb- tci -rrb- , which include selling all or parts of abn amro , would not best serve shareholders .
shareholders will vote on tci 's plans on 26 april at their next meeting .
uk bank barclays , which is in exclusive talks over a merger with abn , said on tuesday that it was in a " strong position " regarding a tie-up .
merger plans abn - the netherlands ' biggest bank - said : " we do not believe the interests of our shareholders would be best served by the mere short-term cash generation actions embodied in the proposals that tci has put forward for consideration . "
a month ago tci sent a letter to abn shareholder 's outlining five issues that they would have to vote on .
that prompted talks between barclays and abn amro over a possible merger .
last week , barclays and abn said that , if they were to merge , the combined company would be listed in london but have its headquarters in amsterdam .

the gardner arts centre , based on the university of sussex campus on the outskirts of brighton , is closing after 38 years due to a lack of funding .
the grade ii-listed building needs £ 6m worth of repairs , and the centre can not get an arts council grant without it .
the final curtain will come down on wednesday after a performance by a hip hop theatre company .

but their parents are not much better informed , the survey of 1,000 adults and 500 young people for the department for education and skills says .
four out of 10 young people did not understand interest rate terms such as apr -lrb- annual percentage rate -rrb- , says the survey .
a talking money guide is available to help students with their finances .
this publication from the education department includes tips and advice from personal finance expert , martin lewis . "
we are encouraging parents and their children to sit down and talk about money together " bill rammell higher education minister he said that all too often money was a taboo subject at home .
" it 's time parents and students started talking , considering their cash , understanding how the system actually works and discussing how to live within a budget .
" do that and there is no one who should be put off entering higher education because of worries about student debt , " mr lewis added .
higher education minister bill rammell said the guide was designed to raise awareness of the fact that financial help is available to cover the cost of higher education in the form of loans , grants and bursaries .
" we are encouraging parents and their children to sit down and talk about money together . "
concern about student debt has grown in recent years following the introduction of variable tuition fees .
from last september , universities have been able to charge undergraduates up to £ 3,000 a year .
the " back to basics " guide includes explanations of key financial jargon and tips on budgeting .
' like a nag ' it also includes details of the kind of financial help available for students in different circumstances .
the poll commissioned by the dfes revealed that many parents were put off talking about money because of their children 's attitudes .
some 22 % said their child did not think money matters were important , nearly half -lrb- 48 % -rrb- feared seeming " like a nag " and 13 % said their children found money talk " boring " .
however a quarter of 16 to 21-year-olds said they would not tell parents if they went overdrawn and 21 % said they would not own up to having a credit card .
although many youngsters said they did not understand key financial terms , the majority knew the implications of borrowing what you could not pay back .
two thirds knew about ivas - individual voluntary arrangements - where a person makes an agreement to pay back a sum with their creditors , and 85 % understood about being declared bankrupt .

the report from mps said that more research was needed into finding more effective ways to reduce bullying .

the committee called for pupils to be involved in setting punishments for children who are bullies , such as picking up litter or cleaning up around the school .

" we would expect previous bullying to be taken into account when deciding on appropriate disciplinary measures , " the report urged .
' bureaucratic ' committee chairman barry sheerman said : " the idea that bullying is in some way character building and simply part of childhood is wrong and should be challenged . "
schools minister jim knight said teachers were about to get stronger legal powers against bullying .
" we support a zero tolerance approach to bullying in schools and we welcome the committee 's recognition of our work in this area , " he said .

special needs conservative spokesman nick gibb said : " bullying is traumatic for children and its prevalence is a sign of poor behaviour and discipline within a school . "

around a million people around the world take part in the sport .
the turkish study found head injuries in kickboxing can cause damage to the pituitary gland , which affects the body 's metabolism and stress response .
in clinical endocrinology , researchers say amateurs with head injuries should be screened .
but kickboxers say they are unaware of such injuries .
people who take part in combative sports and are exposed to repeated head trauma should be screened to ensure their pituitary is working properly professor fahrettin kelestimur , researcher the pituitary is a pea-sized gland , weighing no more than a gram , which is found at the base of the brain , just behind the bridge of the nose .
it produces a range of hormones which control , among other things , the body 's regulation of metabolism , coping with daily stress , general wellbeing and sex drive amongst other areas .
the team at erciyes university medical school in turkey measured the levels of these hormones in 22 amateur kickboxers -lrb- 16 men and six women -rrb- and compared these to healthy people of the same age and sex .
it was found that 27 % - six - of the kickboxers were deficient in at least one hormone compared with the healthy group .
the researchers say the head is one of the most common sites of injury for both amateur and professional kickboxers .
they said more research was needed to understand how the pituitary gland is damaged and to develop more effective head protection gear for kickboxers .
' critical role ' professor fahrettin kelestimur , who led the research , said : " this is the first time that amateur kickboxing has been shown to cause damage to the pituitary , resulting in insufficient hormone production .
" our study shows that kickboxers experience an increased risk of suffering from hypopituitarism , a condition where the pituitary fails to produce enough hormones .
" in healthy people , hormones produced by the pituitary fulfil a critical role in helping the body maintain a healthy metabolism and cope with daily stress . "
he suggested that , if the results of the study were extrapolated out to everyone who kickboxed , a quarter of a million people worldwide could be producing decreased amounts of hormones as a direct result of head injuries sustained during kickboxing .
professor kelestimur added : " we recommend that people who take part in combative sports , like boxing or kickboxing , and are exposed to repeated head trauma should be screened to ensure their pituitary is working properly . "
a spokesman for the world kickboxing association said : " i have never heard of any such damage . "
he added that amateurs , though not professionals , already wore head protection .

" our study shows that kickboxers experience an increased risk of suffering from hypopituitarism , a condition where the pituitary fails to produce enough hormones .
" in healthy people , hormones produced by the pituitary fulfil a critical role in helping the body maintain a healthy metabolism and cope with daily stress . "
he suggested that , if the results of the study were extrapolated out to everyone who kickboxed , a quarter of a million people worldwide could be producing decreased amounts of hormones as a direct result of head injuries sustained during kickboxing .
professor kelestimur added : " we recommend that people who take part in combative sports , like boxing or kickboxing , and are exposed to repeated head trauma should be screened to ensure their pituitary is working properly . "
a spokesman for the world kickboxing association said : " i have never heard of any such damage . "
he added that amateurs , though not professionals , already wore head protection .

around a million people around the world take part in the sport .
the turkish study found head injuries in kickboxing can cause damage to the pituitary gland , which affects the body 's metabolism and stress response .
in clinical endocrinology , researchers say amateurs with head injuries should be screened .
but kickboxers say they are unaware of such injuries .
people who take part in combative sports and are exposed to repeated head trauma should be screened to ensure their pituitary is working properly professor fahrettin kelestimur , researcher the pituitary is a pea-sized gland , weighing no more than a gram , which is found at the base of the brain , just behind the bridge of the nose .
it produces a range of hormones which control , among other things , the body 's regulation of metabolism , coping with daily stress , general wellbeing and sex drive amongst other areas .
the team at erciyes university medical school in turkey measured the levels of these hormones in 22 amateur kickboxers -lrb- 16 men and six women -rrb- and compared these to healthy people of the same age and sex .
it was found that 27 % - six - of the kickboxers were deficient in at least one hormone compared with the healthy group .
the researchers say the head is one of the most common sites of injury for both amateur and professional kickboxers .
they said more research was needed to understand how the pituitary gland is damaged and to develop more effective head protection gear for kickboxers .

highland higher education institution uhi millennium institute has been trying to win full university status .
uhi has produced a four-page briefing paper for the region 's scottish prospective parliamentary candidates .
it calls on the scottish executive to give uhi substantial funding to support research and new buildings .
principal professor bob cormack said the institute was making progress at its facility in inverness where it has been researching therapies for diabetics .
it has also been performing well at its marine science establishment in dunstaffnage and at the thurso site , where it has been investigating how to handle nuclear waste .
however , prof cormack said uhi had not received the levels of funding awarded to universities which were established in 1962 and 1992 .
uhi history granted higher education institution status in april 2001 thirteen academic locations across the region uhi student council was formed in june 1998 the institute has received plenty of political support but this has not been matched in cash terms , the professor said .
he said : " we have a catchment of half a million people , but do not have a university .
" one half of scotland has 14 universities and our half does n't .
" if you look at the 14 other universities in scotland they have all been significantly endowed . "
uhi does not have a central campus and students attend at centres across the highlands and islands .
if you look at the 14 other universities in scotland they have all been significantly endowed prof bob cormack prof cormack said setting up and maintaining this network was expensive .
uhi had hoped to attain full university status in 2007 - the highland year of culture .
however , that hope suffered a blow last year when the quality assurance agency for higher education said more time was needed for the institute to become the university of the highlands and islands .
the agency said uhi programmes were of a high quality but said there was a need for a stronger university structure .
the drive to establish the university won backing in the house of commons last december when david cairns , parliamentary under-secretary of state for scotland , said he was " convinced " by the bid .
he was responding to a question from ross , skye and lochaber mp charles kennedy during scottish question time .

" we are delighted , " said tate director sir nicholas serota , who hopes to open the 11-floor glass building in time for the 2012 olympics in london .
" this decision would not have been possible without the involvement and support of local residents , " he added .
an electricity sub-station will have to be moved to make way for the building on london 's south bank .
the site is intended to provide more space for the tate 's collection and will help combat overcrowding at the gallery , which received 4.9m visitors last year .
the 23,000 square metres of space will include areas for contemporary art , several galleries and two performance zones .
tate director sir nicholas serota is " confident " it will open in 2012 " facilities for young people will be central to the new development , and learning and visitor engagement will be at its heart , " said a tate spokeswoman .
the project was designed by swiss architects herzog and de meuron .
last month , they received the royal institute of british architects ' gold medal for work including their redevelopment of the tate modern .
the cost is expected to be comparable to tate modern 's original construction bill .
the london development agency - overseen by the capital 's mayor ken livingstone - is providing £ 7m towards the project .
what do you think of the plans for the tate modern ?
you sent us your comments .
this is an absolute abomination !
i have no issue with modern design , but in the right setting .
this is more suited to a silicone valley environment .
please , approve something that will enhance the area , not stick out like a sore thumb .
linda , essex i like the design as it shows architecture can be a good thing when considered properly but i have one gripe , why could they not simply buy battersea power station and use that instead ?
it is a far grander building , has more space surrounding it for parking space and outside exhibitions and would , at last , provide some meaning to a much-loved icon .
mary jane repulsive and out of character michael dupree , london , uk i am not sure if i suffer from prince charles syndrome but that really is the most repulsive and out of character extension i have ever seen .
another london landmark to be ruined .
michael dupree , london , uk at least when you see this horrific ' work of modern art ' , you will know what you 're going to see when you get in there !
jordan taylor , london like any piece of art , it is impossible to appreciate the impact and effect without experiencing it up close .
a tiny picture on a computer or tv screen or in a newspaper or magazine is going to give you a very limited impression of what it will be really like .
you ca n't look at a picture of a glass of wine to decide whether it is good wine or not .
dominic , enfield , uk the extension is an engaging , modern and eye-catching design that works exceptionally well in tandem with the simple lines of bankside power station .
as one of the worlds most popular art galleries , the tate modern deserves only the best possible extension of its space to allow it to maintain is rightful place on the world stage .
however i have no doubt whatsoever that the nimbyies who opposed the original conversion of a decaying eyesore will just kneel over and allow this expansion to be built .
i implore all those who care one iota about architecture and indeed art to stand firm in the state of such criticism and voice their support for this wonderful and necessary build .
jack tindale , barnsley , south yorkshire i visit the tate modern about 3 - 4 times a year .
i find it a particularly vibrant , people friendly and accessible gallery .
the variety of the permanent collection -lrb- including the impressive rothko room -rrb- and quality of exhibitions is superb .
susan miller , cambridge uk it looks fantastic john , london it looks fantastic .
why ca n't we have more creative architecture ?
everyone raved about tate modern when it opened - it is , quite frankly , the dullest modern art museum i have ever been in .
dull as dishwater , conservative victoriana .
with this , and the shard , we may actually become known for more than our historical buildings .
john , london it is as ugly as the art on display in the tate modern .
nigel crane , romford , england tate modern is a great institution and needs more space , but why does it have to be in glass .
the 1930s brick of the old power station has lasted well .
will the proposed extension be in such a good state in even 20 years ?
i think not .
jeremy hodge , aylesbury , uk all power to the tate 's elbow !
their 's has been a spectacular success story in terms of visitor count , and the new extension is well in keeping with the image of the tate modern .
and hats off to southwark council and local residents for showing such farsightedness .
david grant the design breaks imaginary and architectural boundaries and expresses a need for a more modern london , visually and contextually .
the tate modern design will be our sydney opera house , our ny guggenheim .
and not another millennium dome .
paul c davies , new malden , surrey another abomination to pollute the london skyline dw roberts , london , uk oh dear .
yet another abomination to pollute the london skyline .
it is a shame that councils seem hell-bent on destroying any architectural coherence that the city might once have had .
who really enjoys these things anyway ?
let us hope that the predictably poor planning and rocketing costs put pay to this disaster before it is completed .
dwr .
dw roberts , london , uk from these pictures , it looks like the extension will overwhelm and vastly detract from the strikingly beautiful older building .
peter , aldershot , hampshire i 've entered the tate modern several times and rarely progressed further than the turbine hall , which seems to me to be an enormous waste of space which could accommodate the contents of the proposed extension several times over .
if anything other than public money was being spent here methinks that something a little more attractive and practical would be built .
peter , hampshire i think it is a fantastic addition , and celebrates the tate 's legacy of being forward thinking .
i would also like to see the tate modern have a dedicated space for up and coming artists who could apply direct to the tate with their portfolio .
