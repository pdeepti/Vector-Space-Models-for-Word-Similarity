the new signatories of the schengen treaty , named after the luxembourg border village where the no-frontiers pact was born in 1985 , will join the current 15 members in enjoying the benefits of deregulated cross-border movement .
it 's a bit like an early christmas present at a peak travel time - some 400 million europeans will be able to travel by road , rail and ship with increased ease .
after two years of preparation , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia , and slovenia will join the oldest eu states - britain and the republic of ireland excluded - plus iceland and norway in the extended zone pushing the area 's outmost borders hundreds of kilometers eastwards .
the expansion is expected to continue with cyprus and switzerland planning to sign on soon .
london and dublin prefer to remain outside and keep their own visa regimes , rather than the " one visa for all " policy that applies to the schengen countries .
as well as having border controls removed , the nine signatories will also see travel document checks abolished at their airports in march .
all border controls can be re-established temporarily in case of emergency , for security reasons or when people move en-masse , such as for sporting events .
new border , new responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officers will pass border duties to polish cops in return for free-movement , the new countries will be obliged to provide data to the schengen information system -lrb- sis -rrb- so police and customs officers can access information about people , vehicles and goods .
the nine signatories will also sign up to new measures which will allow extended police and judicial cooperation including cross-border surveillance and the " hot pursuit " of suspects across frontiers . internal freedom within the schengen zone will also lead to tightened security on its new eastern reaches , placing increased responsibilities on its latest members .
celebrations to mark the extension of the schengen agreement were planned along the newly opened borders .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso and justice commissioner franco frattini will be there as the barriers come down .
" we will live and circulate in an area of 24 countries without internal borders .
this is a unique and historic accomplishment , " barroso said on tuesday .
" the lifting of the european union 's internal borders brings opportunities for people living , circulating and doing business in europe , " he said .
a cause for celebration the festivities began early thursday on the slovakia-austria border , one of the many locations which marked the outer boundaries of europe 's east-west divide , when slovak premier robert fico and austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer sawed through a border post on their common frontier on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of the slovak-austrian border is symbolically marked the symbolic gesture took place at the crossing point between berg in austria and petrzalka in slovakia and was aided by slovak president ivan gasparovic .
concerts , fireworks and even a disco evening at the petrzalka-berg crossing on the slovak-austrian frontier will mark the occasion .
" we are standing here at the border between bratislava and vienna to take away the most important symbolic barrier , " said slovak premier fico .
" from midnight tonight , you can travel 4,000 kilometers -lrb- 2,485 miles -rrb- from tallinn in estonia to lisbon in portugal without any border controls . "
the austrian and slovak capitals are europe 's closest , just 40 kilometers apart .
austrian leader gusenbauer focused on the final days of the iron curtain 's legacy .
" it 's an historic occasion following the destruction by the first and second world wars and the division of our continent by the iron curtain . "
" free borders in a free europe : who would have dared to even dream of that in 1985 , " he added .
slovak president gasparovic , sipping champagne under a european flag bearing the slogan ' christmas without borders , ' said , " i propose a toast that this frontier never be closed again . "
a zone of security schengen " is not about criminality , it is not about insecurity or fear .
it is a bigger zone of peace , security and stability , " said gusenbauer .
the austrian chancellor was echoing the words of european parliament president hans-gert pöttering who focused on the security aspects of the expanded schengen zone at the summit for eu leaders in brussels last week .
" it is a visible sign that the former divisions in europe , the borders on the ground and in people 's minds , are being overcome , " he said .
" this will lead to greater freedom and security , not only for the citizens of the nine future schengen countries , but also for the european union as a whole . "
border residents fear crime wave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as one barrier is lifted , many more are erected however , not everyone is convinced .
polls in germany and austria show that many people are concerned that the schengen zone 's expansion east will spark a " made-in-eastern europe " crime wave .
one survey shows that around 59 percent of former east germans view schengen 's expansion negatively with local media reporting a boom in house alarms and reinforced doors .
in ebersbach , a small town of 8,500 in former east germany on the czech border , the concern is evident in the barbed wire stretched over house windows and the newly-formed residents ' border security association .
in austria , a poll by orf public television put the number of those opposed to the border deregulation at 75 percent .
one austrian town , deutschkreutz which lies a few kilometers from the hungarian border , is even planning to hire a private security firm to patrol the streets .
the concern is also felt on the other side of the border .
" it will allow more criminals to come , for example from austria , mostly from the turkish minority and from former yugoslavia , " ondrej kralik , a slovak policeman who has worked 11 years at various border crossing points told news agency afp . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
they show that only 23 percent of children of non-german origin embarked on an apprenticeship , compared to 57 percent of their native german counterparts .
böhmer said the situation had worsened in comparison to the mid-1990s , when the figure was around 34 percent .
she added that the continuation of the negative trend despite the recent economic upturn should be regarded as an " alarm signal . "

the integration minister said that rather than encouraging the migration of skilled workers into europe to ease labor shortages , germany must focus on improving integration and training for its existing migrant population .
" we can not afford to lose any talent , " she stressed .
according to the statistics , some 15 million people in germany have immigrated since 1950 or have at least one immigrant parent .
about 50 percent of them have german citizenship .
" we must significantly improve the educational situation of young migrants , " she said .
böhmer pointed to a series of measures included in the national integration plan , such as early language coaching in kindergartens and schools , ease of access to study grants for migrant teenagers and improved teacher training .
" we need more teachers from a migrant background , " she added .
the national integration plan was agreed in the summer at an integration summit attended by immigrant organizations , charities , business associations and representatives from various levels of government .

"
they show that only 23 percent of children of non-german origin embarked on an apprenticeship , compared to 57 percent of their native german counterparts .
böhmer said the situation had worsened in comparison to the mid-1990s , when the figure was around 34 percent .
she added that the continuation of the negative trend despite the recent economic upturn should be regarded as an " alarm signal . "
and , some 40 percent of migrants had no professional qualifications at all .
immigrants from italy , greece and turkey had the poorest records in this respect .
some 72 percent of turkish immigrants had no job training at all .

the risk of becoming unemployed is twice as high among migrants - a fact böhmer blamed chiefly on this lack of education and training .
the integration minister said that rather than encouraging the migration of skilled workers into europe to ease labor shortages , germany must focus on improving integration and training for its existing migrant population .
" we can not afford to lose any talent , " she stressed .
according to the statistics , some 15 million people in germany have immigrated since 1950 or have at least one immigrant parent .
about 50 percent of them have german citizenship .
" we must significantly improve the educational situation of young migrants , " she said .
böhmer pointed to a series of measures included in the national integration plan , such as early language coaching in kindergartens and schools , ease of access to study grants for migrant teenagers and improved teacher training .
" we need more teachers from a migrant background , " she added .
the national integration plan was agreed in the summer at an integration summit attended by immigrant organizations , charities , business associations and representatives from various levels of government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 20.12.2007 germany moves to mend gaps in child safety net großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctor 's visits wo n't be optional for young children horrified by recent cases of infanticide , germany wants mandatory doctor visits and is debating adding constitutional protections for children .
in children 's rights , germany has lagged behind other european countries . recent news stories of mothers arrested for killing their children have pointed out the holes in germany 's child welfare safety net . germany 's chancellor angela merkel called for taking a dual approach to protecting children .
parents need more support , she said .
yet there 's also a need for better monitoring to make sure children are not left in an abusive situation . doctor 's visits for young children should become mandatory across the country , politicians decided at an emergency meeting merkel called to discuss the topic on wednesday , dec .
19 . merkel , who heads the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , met with state and local officials responsible for child welfare under germany 's federal system . the doctor visits are envisioned as part of an early warning system to help detect possible abuse . " the risks for children must be detected early in order to establish a help net for at-risk children , " said family minister ursula von der leyen -lrb- cdu -rrb- . seeking constitutional protection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all children have loving parents for the moment , children 's rights wo n't be specifically enshrined in the constitution , as germany 's social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- had hoped . mentioning children specifically in the constitution would ensure that both the legislature and the courts weighed child welfare carefully when making every decision , said germany 's justice minister brigitte zypries of the spd . the cdu rejected the need for additional legal protections beyond the human rights already part of german law , saying they were unnecessary .
roland koch , the premier of hessen who is a member of the cdu , said discussion should focus on how to support local projects which offer practical help to families . children need extra support seventy german children 's rights groups have called for a constitutional change . " it 's very important for children themselves to have their own specific rights , " said mieke schuurman , the secretary general of the european children 's network .
" they are a specific group and they are more vulnerable than adult citizens . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty remains a risk factor for children the european children 's network successfully lobbied for a reference to children 's rights in the european union 's new reform treaty .
the united nations also specifically addresses the issue .
enshrining children 's rights into a constitution provides a legal basis for ensuring that their needs are addressed across the board , schuurman said . of course , words need to be backed up by effective programs and financial support . while there are many local and regional programs focused on helping at-risk mothers and their children , germany is not seen to be leading europe in child welfare issues .
a recent study by unicef 's innocenti research center in florence , italy , put germany solidly in the middle of the pack on dealing with issues such as childhood poverty , health , safety , education and risky behavior . scandinavian countries headed the list of the best countries in europe for children . the next study , due out in spring , will focus on early childhood issues .

the new signatories of the schengen treaty , named after the luxembourg border village where the no-frontiers pact was born in 1985 , will join the current 15 members in enjoying the benefits of deregulated cross-border movement .
it 's a bit like an early christmas present at a peak travel time - some 400 million europeans will be able to travel by road , rail and ship with increased ease .
after two years of preparation , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia , and slovenia will join the oldest eu states - britain and the republic of ireland excluded - plus iceland and norway in the extended zone pushing the area 's outmost borders hundreds of kilometers eastwards .
the expansion is expected to continue with cyprus and switzerland planning to sign on soon .
london and dublin prefer to remain outside and keep their own visa regimes , rather than the " one visa for all " policy that applies to the schengen countries .
as well as having border controls removed , the nine signatories will also see travel document checks abolished at their airports in march .
all border controls can be re-established temporarily in case of emergency , for security reasons or when people move en-masse , such as for sporting events .
new border , new responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officers will pass border duties to polish cops in return for free-movement , the new countries will be obliged to provide data to the schengen information system -lrb- sis -rrb- so police and customs officers can access information about people , vehicles and goods .
the nine signatories will also sign up to new measures which will allow extended police and judicial cooperation including cross-border surveillance and the " hot pursuit " of suspects across frontiers . internal freedom within the schengen zone will also lead to tightened security on its new eastern reaches , placing increased responsibilities on its latest members .
celebrations to mark the extension of the schengen agreement were planned along the newly opened borders .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso and justice commissioner franco frattini will be there as the barriers come down .
" we will live and circulate in an area of 24 countries without internal borders .
this is a unique and historic accomplishment , " barroso said on tuesday .
" the lifting of the european union 's internal borders brings opportunities for people living , circulating and doing business in europe , " he said .
a cause for celebration the festivities began early thursday on the slovakia-austria border , one of the many locations which marked the outer boundaries of europe 's east-west divide , when slovak premier robert fico and austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer sawed through a border post on their common frontier on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of the slovak-austrian border is symbolically marked the symbolic gesture took place at the crossing point between berg in austria and petrzalka in slovakia and was aided by slovak president ivan gasparovic .
concerts , fireworks and even a disco evening at the petrzalka-berg crossing on the slovak-austrian frontier will mark the occasion .
" we are standing here at the border between bratislava and vienna to take away the most important symbolic barrier , " said slovak premier fico .
" from midnight tonight , you can travel 4,000 kilometers -lrb- 2,485 miles -rrb- from tallinn in estonia to lisbon in portugal without any border controls . "
the austrian and slovak capitals are europe 's closest , just 40 kilometers apart .
austrian leader gusenbauer focused on the final days of the iron curtain 's legacy .
" it 's an historic occasion following the destruction by the first and second world wars and the division of our continent by the iron curtain . "
" free borders in a free europe : who would have dared to even dream of that in 1985 , " he added .
slovak president gasparovic , sipping champagne under a european flag bearing the slogan ' christmas without borders , ' said , " i propose a toast that this frontier never be closed again . "
a zone of security schengen " is not about criminality , it is not about insecurity or fear .
it is a bigger zone of peace , security and stability , " said gusenbauer .
the austrian chancellor was echoing the words of european parliament president hans-gert pöttering who focused on the security aspects of the expanded schengen zone at the summit for eu leaders in brussels last week .
" it is a visible sign that the former divisions in europe , the borders on the ground and in people 's minds , are being overcome , " he said .
" this will lead to greater freedom and security , not only for the citizens of the nine future schengen countries , but also for the european union as a whole . "
border residents fear crime wave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as one barrier is lifted , many more are erected however , not everyone is convinced .
polls in germany and austria show that many people are concerned that the schengen zone 's expansion east will spark a " made-in-eastern europe " crime wave .
one survey shows that around 59 percent of former east germans view schengen 's expansion negatively with local media reporting a boom in house alarms and reinforced doors .
in ebersbach , a small town of 8,500 in former east germany on the czech border , the concern is evident in the barbed wire stretched over house windows and the newly-formed residents ' border security association .
in austria , a poll by orf public television put the number of those opposed to the border deregulation at 75 percent .
one austrian town , deutschkreutz which lies a few kilometers from the hungarian border , is even planning to hire a private security firm to patrol the streets .
the concern is also felt on the other side of the border .
" it will allow more criminals to come , for example from austria , mostly from the turkish minority and from former yugoslavia , " ondrej kralik , a slovak policeman who has worked 11 years at various border crossing points told news agency afp . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new signatories of the schengen treaty , named after the luxembourg border village where the no-frontiers pact was born in 1985 , will join the current 15 members in enjoying the benefits of deregulated cross-border movement .
it 's a bit like an early christmas present at a peak travel time - some 400 million europeans will be able to travel by road , rail and ship with increased ease .
after two years of preparation , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia , and slovenia will join the oldest eu states - britain and the republic of ireland excluded - plus iceland and norway in the extended zone pushing the area 's outmost borders hundreds of kilometers eastwards .
the expansion is expected to continue with cyprus and switzerland planning to sign on soon .
london and dublin prefer to remain outside and keep their own visa regimes , rather than the " one visa for all " policy that applies to the schengen countries .
as well as having border controls removed , the nine signatories will also see travel document checks abolished at their airports in march .
all border controls can be re-established temporarily in case of emergency , for security reasons or when people move en-masse , such as for sporting events .
new border , new responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officers will pass border duties to polish cops in return for free-movement , the new countries will be obliged to provide data to the schengen information system -lrb- sis -rrb- so police and customs officers can access information about people , vehicles and goods .
the nine signatories will also sign up to new measures which will allow extended police and judicial cooperation including cross-border surveillance and the " hot pursuit " of suspects across frontiers . internal freedom within the schengen zone will also lead to tightened security on its new eastern reaches , placing increased responsibilities on its latest members .
celebrations to mark the extension of the schengen agreement were planned along the newly opened borders .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso and justice commissioner franco frattini will be there as the barriers come down .
" we will live and circulate in an area of 24 countries without internal borders .
this is a unique and historic accomplishment , " barroso said on tuesday .
" the lifting of the european union 's internal borders brings opportunities for people living , circulating and doing business in europe , " he said .
a cause for celebration the festivities began early thursday on the slovakia-austria border , one of the many locations which marked the outer boundaries of europe 's east-west divide , when slovak premier robert fico and austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer sawed through a border post on their common frontier on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of the slovak-austrian border is symbolically marked the symbolic gesture took place at the crossing point between berg in austria and petrzalka in slovakia and was aided by slovak president ivan gasparovic .
concerts , fireworks and even a disco evening at the petrzalka-berg crossing on the slovak-austrian frontier will mark the occasion .
" we are standing here at the border between bratislava and vienna to take away the most important symbolic barrier , " said slovak premier fico .
" from midnight tonight , you can travel 4,000 kilometers -lrb- 2,485 miles -rrb- from tallinn in estonia to lisbon in portugal without any border controls . "
the austrian and slovak capitals are europe 's closest , just 40 kilometers apart .
austrian leader gusenbauer focused on the final days of the iron curtain 's legacy .
" it 's an historic occasion following the destruction by the first and second world wars and the division of our continent by the iron curtain . "
" free borders in a free europe : who would have dared to even dream of that in 1985 , " he added .
slovak president gasparovic , sipping champagne under a european flag bearing the slogan ' christmas without borders , ' said , " i propose a toast that this frontier never be closed again . "
a zone of security schengen " is not about criminality , it is not about insecurity or fear .
it is a bigger zone of peace , security and stability , " said gusenbauer .
the austrian chancellor was echoing the words of european parliament president hans-gert pöttering who focused on the security aspects of the expanded schengen zone at the summit for eu leaders in brussels last week .
" it is a visible sign that the former divisions in europe , the borders on the ground and in people 's minds , are being overcome , " he said .
" this will lead to greater freedom and security , not only for the citizens of the nine future schengen countries , but also for the european union as a whole . "
border residents fear crime wave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as one barrier is lifted , many more are erected however , not everyone is convinced .
polls in germany and austria show that many people are concerned that the schengen zone 's expansion east will spark a " made-in-eastern europe " crime wave .
one survey shows that around 59 percent of former east germans view schengen 's expansion negatively with local media reporting a boom in house alarms and reinforced doors .
in ebersbach , a small town of 8,500 in former east germany on the czech border , the concern is evident in the barbed wire stretched over house windows and the newly-formed residents ' border security association .
in austria , a poll by orf public television put the number of those opposed to the border deregulation at 75 percent .
one austrian town , deutschkreutz which lies a few kilometers from the hungarian border , is even planning to hire a private security firm to patrol the streets .
the concern is also felt on the other side of the border .
" it will allow more criminals to come , for example from austria , mostly from the turkish minority and from former yugoslavia , " ondrej kralik , a slovak policeman who has worked 11 years at various border crossing points told news agency afp . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new signatories of the schengen treaty , named after the luxembourg border village where the no-frontiers pact was born in 1985 , will join the current 15 members in enjoying the benefits of deregulated cross-border movement .
it 's a bit like an early christmas present at a peak travel time - some 400 million europeans will be able to travel by road , rail and ship with increased ease .
after two years of preparation , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia , and slovenia will join the oldest eu states - britain and the republic of ireland excluded - plus iceland and norway in the extended zone pushing the area 's outmost borders hundreds of kilometers eastwards .
the expansion is expected to continue with cyprus and switzerland planning to sign on soon .
london and dublin prefer to remain outside and keep their own visa regimes , rather than the " one visa for all " policy that applies to the schengen countries .
as well as having border controls removed , the nine signatories will also see travel document checks abolished at their airports in march .
all border controls can be re-established temporarily in case of emergency , for security reasons or when people move en-masse , such as for sporting events .
new border , new responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officers will pass border duties to polish cops in return for free-movement , the new countries will be obliged to provide data to the schengen information system -lrb- sis -rrb- so police and customs officers can access information about people , vehicles and goods .
the nine signatories will also sign up to new measures which will allow extended police and judicial cooperation including cross-border surveillance and the " hot pursuit " of suspects across frontiers . internal freedom within the schengen zone will also lead to tightened security on its new eastern reaches , placing increased responsibilities on its latest members .
celebrations to mark the extension of the schengen agreement were planned along the newly opened borders .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso and justice commissioner franco frattini will be there as the barriers come down .
" we will live and circulate in an area of 24 countries without internal borders .
this is a unique and historic accomplishment , " barroso said on tuesday .
" the lifting of the european union 's internal borders brings opportunities for people living , circulating and doing business in europe , " he said .
a cause for celebration the festivities began early thursday on the slovakia-austria border , one of the many locations which marked the outer boundaries of europe 's east-west divide , when slovak premier robert fico and austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer sawed through a border post on their common frontier on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of the slovak-austrian border is symbolically marked the symbolic gesture took place at the crossing point between berg in austria and petrzalka in slovakia and was aided by slovak president ivan gasparovic .
concerts , fireworks and even a disco evening at the petrzalka-berg crossing on the slovak-austrian frontier will mark the occasion .
" we are standing here at the border between bratislava and vienna to take away the most important symbolic barrier , " said slovak premier fico .
" from midnight tonight , you can travel 4,000 kilometers -lrb- 2,485 miles -rrb- from tallinn in estonia to lisbon in portugal without any border controls . "
the austrian and slovak capitals are europe 's closest , just 40 kilometers apart .
austrian leader gusenbauer focused on the final days of the iron curtain 's legacy .
" it 's an historic occasion following the destruction by the first and second world wars and the division of our continent by the iron curtain . "
" free borders in a free europe : who would have dared to even dream of that in 1985 , " he added .
slovak president gasparovic , sipping champagne under a european flag bearing the slogan ' christmas without borders , ' said , " i propose a toast that this frontier never be closed again . "
a zone of security schengen " is not about criminality , it is not about insecurity or fear .
it is a bigger zone of peace , security and stability , " said gusenbauer .
the austrian chancellor was echoing the words of european parliament president hans-gert pöttering who focused on the security aspects of the expanded schengen zone at the summit for eu leaders in brussels last week .
" it is a visible sign that the former divisions in europe , the borders on the ground and in people 's minds , are being overcome , " he said .
" this will lead to greater freedom and security , not only for the citizens of the nine future schengen countries , but also for the european union as a whole . "
border residents fear crime wave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as one barrier is lifted , many more are erected however , not everyone is convinced .
polls in germany and austria show that many people are concerned that the schengen zone 's expansion east will spark a " made-in-eastern europe " crime wave .
one survey shows that around 59 percent of former east germans view schengen 's expansion negatively with local media reporting a boom in house alarms and reinforced doors .
in ebersbach , a small town of 8,500 in former east germany on the czech border , the concern is evident in the barbed wire stretched over house windows and the newly-formed residents ' border security association .
in austria , a poll by orf public television put the number of those opposed to the border deregulation at 75 percent .
one austrian town , deutschkreutz which lies a few kilometers from the hungarian border , is even planning to hire a private security firm to patrol the streets .
the concern is also felt on the other side of the border .
" it will allow more criminals to come , for example from austria , mostly from the turkish minority and from former yugoslavia , " ondrej kralik , a slovak policeman who has worked 11 years at various border crossing points told news agency afp . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german train drivers ' union says it will strike again in january , raising the stakes in a long-running dispute over pay with german rail carrier deutsche bahn . the german train drivers ' union , gdl , said on thursday , dec 20 , that it would strike again on passenger and freight routes next month after pay talks with national rail operator deutsche bahn broke down . making the announcement at a news conference in frankfurt , gdl boss manfred schell accused deutsche bahn of not moving " one jot " during negotiations . " we will begin strikes from january 7 and will end them only when we feel we are on the way to an acceptable wage deal , " said schell whose 34,000-member union has rejected outside mediation . bahn and union at impasse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdl chief manfred schell is standing firm talks broke down after the gdl demanded deutsche bahn recognize the union as the sole representative of the drivers .
in response , the railway company cancelled all the offers it had put on the table up until wednesday . the federally owned rail company has insisted on negotiating driver pay with two bigger unions in collective bargaining . " it was a big surprise when the talks were abruptly stopped by the gdl , there was no reason given , " said margaret suckale , a deutsche bahn board member in a news conference . " we want to do everything to avoid strikes and to prevent our customers from having to suffer , " added suckale . unmet demands the drivers ' union originally demanded a 31 percent pay hike but recently signalled that it would agree to a 10 percent increase . deutsche bahn has reported that it has offered pay raises of 8 percent to 13 percent .
the company 's 195,000 other workers have already agreed to a 4.5 percent pay rise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight service will also be affected " we have n't progressed one little bit during the nine months of negotiations , " said schell in a statement . gdl feels its drivers are underpaid in comparison to drivers in other countries . this strike will be the latest in a series of wallkouts to hit the german rail system .
in november , a 62-hour strike cost the german economy an estimated 75 million euros -lrb- $ 110 million . -rrb- . german industry and the government of angela merkel have complained that continued strikes will endanger the country 's economy . dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in children 's rights , germany has lagged behind other european countries . recent news stories of mothers arrested for killing their children have pointed out the holes in germany 's child welfare safety net . germany 's chancellor angela merkel called for taking a dual approach to protecting children .
parents need more support , she said .
yet there 's also a need for better monitoring to make sure children are not left in an abusive situation . doctor 's visits for young children should become mandatory across the country , politicians decided at an emergency meeting merkel called to discuss the topic on wednesday , dec .
19 . merkel , who heads the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , met with state and local officials responsible for child welfare under germany 's federal system . the doctor visits are envisioned as part of an early warning system to help detect possible abuse . " the risks for children must be detected early in order to establish a help net for at-risk children , " said family minister ursula von der leyen -lrb- cdu -rrb- . seeking constitutional protection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all children have loving parents for the moment , children 's rights wo n't be specifically enshrined in the constitution , as germany 's social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- had hoped . mentioning children specifically in the constitution would ensure that both the legislature and the courts weighed child welfare carefully when making every decision , said germany 's justice minister brigitte zypries of the spd . the cdu rejected the need for additional legal protections beyond the human rights already part of german law , saying they were unnecessary .
roland koch , the premier of hessen who is a member of the cdu , said discussion should focus on how to support local projects which offer practical help to families . children need extra support seventy german children 's rights groups have called for a constitutional change .

enshrining children 's rights into a constitution provides a legal basis for ensuring that their needs are addressed across the board , schuurman said . of course , words need to be backed up by effective programs and financial support . while there are many local and regional programs focused on helping at-risk mothers and their children , germany is not seen to be leading europe in child welfare issues .
a recent study by unicef 's innocenti research center in florence , italy , put germany solidly in the middle of the pack on dealing with issues such as childhood poverty , health , safety , education and risky behavior . scandinavian countries headed the list of the best countries in europe for children . the next study , due out in spring , will focus on early childhood issues .

" every child within a sovereign state has the same rights , " jespersen said . it 's up to the federal government to ensure that the rights of children are advanced uniformly and address inequalities , she said . recent cases spotlight problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goal is to prevent child abuse on wednesday , dec .

police said she told interrogators each of her three daughters " died suddenly " soon after birth in 2002 , 2004 and 2005 . between 80 and 100 children die in germany each year from neglect and abuse , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported .
and child abuse numbers are also rising , although it 's unclear whether actual incidents have increased or whether people are more likely to report suspected abuse than in the past . authorities removed about 170,000 children and teenagers from their parents ' homes in 2006 and placed them in state care . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
they show that only 23 percent of children of non-german origin embarked on an apprenticeship , compared to 57 percent of their native german counterparts .
böhmer said the situation had worsened in comparison to the mid-1990s , when the figure was around 34 percent .

the risk of becoming unemployed is twice as high among migrants - a fact böhmer blamed chiefly on this lack of education and training .

" we need more teachers from a migrant background , " she added .

" german language skills are not enough to safeguard against discrimination in the education system and against unemployment . "
in her speech presenting the report , böhmer also said that there had to be improved acceptance of qualifications gained abroad .
she said there were some half a million foreigners in germany with degrees , but who unable to work in their professions because their credentials were not recognized .
" we are squandering potential here , " she criticized .
the integration minister had some good news .
the number of immigrants setting up their own businesses has almost doubled since the 1990s .
currently , immigrants own some 582,000 firms and employ some two million staff . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new signatories of the schengen treaty , named after the luxembourg border village where the no-frontiers pact was born in 1985 , will join the current 15 members in enjoying the benefits of deregulated cross-border movement .
it 's a bit like an early christmas present at a peak travel time - some 400 million europeans will be able to travel by road , rail and ship with increased ease .
after two years of preparation , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia , and slovenia will join the oldest eu states - britain and the republic of ireland excluded - plus iceland and norway in the extended zone pushing the area 's outmost borders hundreds of kilometers eastwards .
the expansion is expected to continue with cyprus and switzerland planning to sign on soon .
london and dublin prefer to remain outside and keep their own visa regimes , rather than the " one visa for all " policy that applies to the schengen countries .
as well as having border controls removed , the nine signatories will also see travel document checks abolished at their airports in march .
all border controls can be re-established temporarily in case of emergency , for security reasons or when people move en-masse , such as for sporting events .

the nine signatories will also sign up to new measures which will allow extended police and judicial cooperation including cross-border surveillance and the " hot pursuit " of suspects across frontiers . internal freedom within the schengen zone will also lead to tightened security on its new eastern reaches , placing increased responsibilities on its latest members .
celebrations to mark the extension of the schengen agreement were planned along the newly opened borders .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso and justice commissioner franco frattini will be there as the barriers come down .
" we will live and circulate in an area of 24 countries without internal borders .
this is a unique and historic accomplishment , " barroso said on tuesday .
" the lifting of the european union 's internal borders brings opportunities for people living , circulating and doing business in europe , " he said .
a cause for celebration the festivities began early thursday on the slovakia-austria border , one of the many locations which marked the outer boundaries of europe 's east-west divide , when slovak premier robert fico and austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer sawed through a border post on their common frontier on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of the slovak-austrian border is symbolically marked the symbolic gesture took place at the crossing point between berg in austria and petrzalka in slovakia and was aided by slovak president ivan gasparovic .
concerts , fireworks and even a disco evening at the petrzalka-berg crossing on the slovak-austrian frontier will mark the occasion .
" we are standing here at the border between bratislava and vienna to take away the most important symbolic barrier , " said slovak premier fico .
" from midnight tonight , you can travel 4,000 kilometers -lrb- 2,485 miles -rrb- from tallinn in estonia to lisbon in portugal without any border controls . "
the austrian and slovak capitals are europe 's closest , just 40 kilometers apart .
austrian leader gusenbauer focused on the final days of the iron curtain 's legacy .
" it 's an historic occasion following the destruction by the first and second world wars and the division of our continent by the iron curtain . "
" free borders in a free europe : who would have dared to even dream of that in 1985 , " he added .
slovak president gasparovic , sipping champagne under a european flag bearing the slogan ' christmas without borders , ' said , " i propose a toast that this frontier never be closed again . "
a zone of security schengen " is not about criminality , it is not about insecurity or fear .
it is a bigger zone of peace , security and stability , " said gusenbauer .
the austrian chancellor was echoing the words of european parliament president hans-gert pöttering who focused on the security aspects of the expanded schengen zone at the summit for eu leaders in brussels last week .
" it is a visible sign that the former divisions in europe , the borders on the ground and in people 's minds , are being overcome , " he said .
" this will lead to greater freedom and security , not only for the citizens of the nine future schengen countries , but also for the european union as a whole . "
border residents fear crime wave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as one barrier is lifted , many more are erected however , not everyone is convinced .
polls in germany and austria show that many people are concerned that the schengen zone 's expansion east will spark a " made-in-eastern europe " crime wave .
one survey shows that around 59 percent of former east germans view schengen 's expansion negatively with local media reporting a boom in house alarms and reinforced doors .
in ebersbach , a small town of 8,500 in former east germany on the czech border , the concern is evident in the barbed wire stretched over house windows and the newly-formed residents ' border security association .
in austria , a poll by orf public television put the number of those opposed to the border deregulation at 75 percent .
one austrian town , deutschkreutz which lies a few kilometers from the hungarian border , is even planning to hire a private security firm to patrol the streets .
the concern is also felt on the other side of the border .
" it will allow more criminals to come , for example from austria , mostly from the turkish minority and from former yugoslavia , " ondrej kralik , a slovak policeman who has worked 11 years at various border crossing points told news agency afp . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the austrian chancellor was echoing the words of european parliament president hans-gert pöttering who focused on the security aspects of the expanded schengen zone at the summit for eu leaders in brussels last week .
" it is a visible sign that the former divisions in europe , the borders on the ground and in people 's minds , are being overcome , " he said .

polls in germany and austria show that many people are concerned that the schengen zone 's expansion east will spark a " made-in-eastern europe " crime wave .
one survey shows that around 59 percent of former east germans view schengen 's expansion negatively with local media reporting a boom in house alarms and reinforced doors .
in ebersbach , a small town of 8,500 in former east germany on the czech border , the concern is evident in the barbed wire stretched over house windows and the newly-formed residents ' border security association .
in austria , a poll by orf public television put the number of those opposed to the border deregulation at 75 percent .
one austrian town , deutschkreutz which lies a few kilometers from the hungarian border , is even planning to hire a private security firm to patrol the streets .
the concern is also felt on the other side of the border .

the new signatories of the schengen treaty , named after the luxembourg border village where the no-frontiers pact was born in 1985 , will join the current 15 members in enjoying the benefits of deregulated cross-border movement .
it 's a bit like an early christmas present at a peak travel time - some 400 million europeans will be able to travel by road , rail and ship with increased ease .
after two years of preparation , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia , and slovenia will join the oldest eu states - britain and the republic of ireland excluded - plus iceland and norway in the extended zone pushing the area 's outmost borders hundreds of kilometers eastwards .
the expansion is expected to continue with cyprus and switzerland planning to sign on soon .
london and dublin prefer to remain outside and keep their own visa regimes , rather than the " one visa for all " policy that applies to the schengen countries .
as well as having border controls removed , the nine signatories will also see travel document checks abolished at their airports in march .
all border controls can be re-established temporarily in case of emergency , for security reasons or when people move en-masse , such as for sporting events .
new border , new responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officers will pass border duties to polish cops in return for free-movement , the new countries will be obliged to provide data to the schengen information system -lrb- sis -rrb- so police and customs officers can access information about people , vehicles and goods .
the nine signatories will also sign up to new measures which will allow extended police and judicial cooperation including cross-border surveillance and the " hot pursuit " of suspects across frontiers . internal freedom within the schengen zone will also lead to tightened security on its new eastern reaches , placing increased responsibilities on its latest members .
celebrations to mark the extension of the schengen agreement were planned along the newly opened borders .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso and justice commissioner franco frattini will be there as the barriers come down .
" we will live and circulate in an area of 24 countries without internal borders .
this is a unique and historic accomplishment , " barroso said on tuesday .
" the lifting of the european union 's internal borders brings opportunities for people living , circulating and doing business in europe , " he said .
a cause for celebration the festivities began early thursday on the slovakia-austria border , one of the many locations which marked the outer boundaries of europe 's east-west divide , when slovak premier robert fico and austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer sawed through a border post on their common frontier on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of the slovak-austrian border is symbolically marked the symbolic gesture took place at the crossing point between berg in austria and petrzalka in slovakia and was aided by slovak president ivan gasparovic .
concerts , fireworks and even a disco evening at the petrzalka-berg crossing on the slovak-austrian frontier will mark the occasion .
" we are standing here at the border between bratislava and vienna to take away the most important symbolic barrier , " said slovak premier fico .
" from midnight tonight , you can travel 4,000 kilometers -lrb- 2,485 miles -rrb- from tallinn in estonia to lisbon in portugal without any border controls . "
the austrian and slovak capitals are europe 's closest , just 40 kilometers apart .
austrian leader gusenbauer focused on the final days of the iron curtain 's legacy .
" it 's an historic occasion following the destruction by the first and second world wars and the division of our continent by the iron curtain . "
" free borders in a free europe : who would have dared to even dream of that in 1985 , " he added .
slovak president gasparovic , sipping champagne under a european flag bearing the slogan ' christmas without borders , ' said , " i propose a toast that this frontier never be closed again . "
a zone of security schengen " is not about criminality , it is not about insecurity or fear .

the new signatories of the schengen treaty , named after the luxembourg border village where the no-frontiers pact was born in 1985 , will join the current 15 members in enjoying the benefits of deregulated cross-border movement .
it 's a bit like an early christmas present at a peak travel time - some 400 million europeans will be able to travel by road , rail and ship with increased ease .
after two years of preparation , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia , and slovenia will join the oldest eu states - britain and the republic of ireland excluded - plus iceland and norway in the extended zone pushing the area 's outmost borders hundreds of kilometers eastwards .
the expansion is expected to continue with cyprus and switzerland planning to sign on soon .
london and dublin prefer to remain outside and keep their own visa regimes , rather than the " one visa for all " policy that applies to the schengen countries .
as well as having border controls removed , the nine signatories will also see travel document checks abolished at their airports in march .
all border controls can be re-established temporarily in case of emergency , for security reasons or when people move en-masse , such as for sporting events .
new border , new responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officers will pass border duties to polish cops in return for free-movement , the new countries will be obliged to provide data to the schengen information system -lrb- sis -rrb- so police and customs officers can access information about people , vehicles and goods .
the nine signatories will also sign up to new measures which will allow extended police and judicial cooperation including cross-border surveillance and the " hot pursuit " of suspects across frontiers . internal freedom within the schengen zone will also lead to tightened security on its new eastern reaches , placing increased responsibilities on its latest members .
celebrations to mark the extension of the schengen agreement were planned along the newly opened borders .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso and justice commissioner franco frattini will be there as the barriers come down .
" we will live and circulate in an area of 24 countries without internal borders .
this is a unique and historic accomplishment , " barroso said on tuesday .
" the lifting of the european union 's internal borders brings opportunities for people living , circulating and doing business in europe , " he said .
a cause for celebration the festivities began early thursday on the slovakia-austria border , one of the many locations which marked the outer boundaries of europe 's east-west divide , when slovak premier robert fico and austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer sawed through a border post on their common frontier on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of the slovak-austrian border is symbolically marked the symbolic gesture took place at the crossing point between berg in austria and petrzalka in slovakia and was aided by slovak president ivan gasparovic .
concerts , fireworks and even a disco evening at the petrzalka-berg crossing on the slovak-austrian frontier will mark the occasion .
" we are standing here at the border between bratislava and vienna to take away the most important symbolic barrier , " said slovak premier fico .
" from midnight tonight , you can travel 4,000 kilometers -lrb- 2,485 miles -rrb- from tallinn in estonia to lisbon in portugal without any border controls . "
the austrian and slovak capitals are europe 's closest , just 40 kilometers apart .
austrian leader gusenbauer focused on the final days of the iron curtain 's legacy .
" it 's an historic occasion following the destruction by the first and second world wars and the division of our continent by the iron curtain . "
" free borders in a free europe : who would have dared to even dream of that in 1985 , " he added .
slovak president gasparovic , sipping champagne under a european flag bearing the slogan ' christmas without borders , ' said , " i propose a toast that this frontier never be closed again . "
a zone of security schengen " is not about criminality , it is not about insecurity or fear .
it is a bigger zone of peace , security and stability , " said gusenbauer .
the austrian chancellor was echoing the words of european parliament president hans-gert pöttering who focused on the security aspects of the expanded schengen zone at the summit for eu leaders in brussels last week .
" it is a visible sign that the former divisions in europe , the borders on the ground and in people 's minds , are being overcome , " he said .
" this will lead to greater freedom and security , not only for the citizens of the nine future schengen countries , but also for the european union as a whole . "
border residents fear crime wave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as one barrier is lifted , many more are erected however , not everyone is convinced .
polls in germany and austria show that many people are concerned that the schengen zone 's expansion east will spark a " made-in-eastern europe " crime wave .
one survey shows that around 59 percent of former east germans view schengen 's expansion negatively with local media reporting a boom in house alarms and reinforced doors .
in ebersbach , a small town of 8,500 in former east germany on the czech border , the concern is evident in the barbed wire stretched over house windows and the newly-formed residents ' border security association .
in austria , a poll by orf public television put the number of those opposed to the border deregulation at 75 percent .
one austrian town , deutschkreutz which lies a few kilometers from the hungarian border , is even planning to hire a private security firm to patrol the streets .
the concern is also felt on the other side of the border .
" it will allow more criminals to come , for example from austria , mostly from the turkish minority and from former yugoslavia , " ondrej kralik , a slovak policeman who has worked 11 years at various border crossing points told news agency afp . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
they show that only 23 percent of children of non-german origin embarked on an apprenticeship , compared to 57 percent of their native german counterparts .
böhmer said the situation had worsened in comparison to the mid-1990s , when the figure was around 34 percent .
she added that the continuation of the negative trend despite the recent economic upturn should be regarded as an " alarm signal . "
and , some 40 percent of migrants had no professional qualifications at all .
immigrants from italy , greece and turkey had the poorest records in this respect .
some 72 percent of turkish immigrants had no job training at all .
around one in five do not have any qualifications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , it 's difficult to get a job without having completed a traineeship the report also revealed that some 17.5 percent of children of non-german origin finish school without any educational qualifications .
the risk of becoming unemployed is twice as high among migrants - a fact böhmer blamed chiefly on this lack of education and training .
the integration minister said that rather than encouraging the migration of skilled workers into europe to ease labor shortages , germany must focus on improving integration and training for its existing migrant population .
" we can not afford to lose any talent , " she stressed .
according to the statistics , some 15 million people in germany have immigrated since 1950 or have at least one immigrant parent .
about 50 percent of them have german citizenship .
" we must significantly improve the educational situation of young migrants , " she said .
böhmer pointed to a series of measures included in the national integration plan , such as early language coaching in kindergartens and schools , ease of access to study grants for migrant teenagers and improved teacher training .
" we need more teachers from a migrant background , " she added .
the national integration plan was agreed in the summer at an integration summit attended by immigrant organizations , charities , business associations and representatives from various levels of government .

" german language skills are not enough to safeguard against discrimination in the education system and against unemployment . "
in her speech presenting the report , böhmer also said that there had to be improved acceptance of qualifications gained abroad .
she said there were some half a million foreigners in germany with degrees , but who unable to work in their professions because their credentials were not recognized .

19 . merkel , who heads the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , met with state and local officials responsible for child welfare under germany 's federal system . the doctor visits are envisioned as part of an early warning system to help detect possible abuse . " the risks for children must be detected early in order to establish a help net for at-risk children , " said family minister ursula von der leyen -lrb- cdu -rrb- . seeking constitutional protection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all children have loving parents for the moment , children 's rights wo n't be specifically enshrined in the constitution , as germany 's social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- had hoped . mentioning children specifically in the constitution would ensure that both the legislature and the courts weighed child welfare carefully when making every decision , said germany 's justice minister brigitte zypries of the spd . the cdu rejected the need for additional legal protections beyond the human rights already part of german law , saying they were unnecessary .
roland koch , the premier of hessen who is a member of the cdu , said discussion should focus on how to support local projects which offer practical help to families . children need extra support seventy german children 's rights groups have called for a constitutional change . " it 's very important for children themselves to have their own specific rights , " said mieke schuurman , the secretary general of the european children 's network .
" they are a specific group and they are more vulnerable than adult citizens . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty remains a risk factor for children the european children 's network successfully lobbied for a reference to children 's rights in the european union 's new reform treaty .
the united nations also specifically addresses the issue .
enshrining children 's rights into a constitution provides a legal basis for ensuring that their needs are addressed across the board , schuurman said . of course , words need to be backed up by effective programs and financial support . while there are many local and regional programs focused on helping at-risk mothers and their children , germany is not seen to be leading europe in child welfare issues .
a recent study by unicef 's innocenti research center in florence , italy , put germany solidly in the middle of the pack on dealing with issues such as childhood poverty , health , safety , education and risky behavior . scandinavian countries headed the list of the best countries in europe for children . the next study , due out in spring , will focus on early childhood issues .
in germany , there has been considerable interest at the federal level in early childhood services .
it 's seen as important to breaking the cycle of poverty and for integrating the children of immigrants , said eva jespersen , head of the economic and social policies unit at innocenti . particularly in germany 's decentralized system , it 's extremely important to have a national framework for child rights , jespersen said . " every child within a sovereign state has the same rights , " jespersen said . it 's up to the federal government to ensure that the rights of children are advanced uniformly and address inequalities , she said . recent cases spotlight problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goal is to prevent child abuse on wednesday , dec .
5 , five children aged three to nine were found suffocated in their home in darry , schleswig-holstein .
their mother , who had been undergoing psychiatric treatment , alerted doctors to what had happened . a few days earlier , a 28-year-old woman was arrested on serial murder charges after three newborns were found dead in a small town in saxony .
police said she told interrogators each of her three daughters " died suddenly " soon after birth in 2002 , 2004 and 2005 . between 80 and 100 children die in germany each year from neglect and abuse , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported .
and child abuse numbers are also rising , although it 's unclear whether actual incidents have increased or whether people are more likely to report suspected abuse than in the past . authorities removed about 170,000 children and teenagers from their parents ' homes in 2006 and placed them in state care . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new signatories of the schengen treaty , named after the luxembourg border village where the no-frontiers pact was born in 1985 , will join the current 15 members in enjoying the benefits of deregulated cross-border movement .
it 's a bit like an early christmas present at a peak travel time - some 400 million europeans will be able to travel by road , rail and ship with increased ease .
after two years of preparation , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia , and slovenia will join the oldest eu states - britain and the republic of ireland excluded - plus iceland and norway in the extended zone pushing the area 's outmost borders hundreds of kilometers eastwards .
the expansion is expected to continue with cyprus and switzerland planning to sign on soon .
london and dublin prefer to remain outside and keep their own visa regimes , rather than the " one visa for all " policy that applies to the schengen countries .

the nine signatories will also sign up to new measures which will allow extended police and judicial cooperation including cross-border surveillance and the " hot pursuit " of suspects across frontiers . internal freedom within the schengen zone will also lead to tightened security on its new eastern reaches , placing increased responsibilities on its latest members .

european commission chief jose manuel barroso and justice commissioner franco frattini will be there as the barriers come down .

a cause for celebration the festivities began early thursday on the slovakia-austria border , one of the many locations which marked the outer boundaries of europe 's east-west divide , when slovak premier robert fico and austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer sawed through a border post on their common frontier on thursday .

" from midnight tonight , you can travel 4,000 kilometers -lrb- 2,485 miles -rrb- from tallinn in estonia to lisbon in portugal without any border controls . "
the austrian and slovak capitals are europe 's closest , just 40 kilometers apart .
austrian leader gusenbauer focused on the final days of the iron curtain 's legacy .
" it 's an historic occasion following the destruction by the first and second world wars and the division of our continent by the iron curtain . "
" free borders in a free europe : who would have dared to even dream of that in 1985 , " he added .
slovak president gasparovic , sipping champagne under a european flag bearing the slogan ' christmas without borders , ' said , " i propose a toast that this frontier never be closed again . "
a zone of security schengen " is not about criminality , it is not about insecurity or fear .
it is a bigger zone of peace , security and stability , " said gusenbauer .

" it is a visible sign that the former divisions in europe , the borders on the ground and in people 's minds , are being overcome , " he said .

the new signatories of the schengen treaty , named after the luxembourg border village where the no-frontiers pact was born in 1985 , will join the current 15 members in enjoying the benefits of deregulated cross-border movement .
it 's a bit like an early christmas present at a peak travel time - some 400 million europeans will be able to travel by road , rail and ship with increased ease .
after two years of preparation , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia , and slovenia will join the oldest eu states - britain and the republic of ireland excluded - plus iceland and norway in the extended zone pushing the area 's outmost borders hundreds of kilometers eastwards .
the expansion is expected to continue with cyprus and switzerland planning to sign on soon .
london and dublin prefer to remain outside and keep their own visa regimes , rather than the " one visa for all " policy that applies to the schengen countries .
as well as having border controls removed , the nine signatories will also see travel document checks abolished at their airports in march .
all border controls can be re-established temporarily in case of emergency , for security reasons or when people move en-masse , such as for sporting events .
new border , new responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officers will pass border duties to polish cops in return for free-movement , the new countries will be obliged to provide data to the schengen information system -lrb- sis -rrb- so police and customs officers can access information about people , vehicles and goods .
the nine signatories will also sign up to new measures which will allow extended police and judicial cooperation including cross-border surveillance and the " hot pursuit " of suspects across frontiers . internal freedom within the schengen zone will also lead to tightened security on its new eastern reaches , placing increased responsibilities on its latest members .
celebrations to mark the extension of the schengen agreement were planned along the newly opened borders .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso and justice commissioner franco frattini will be there as the barriers come down .
" we will live and circulate in an area of 24 countries without internal borders .
this is a unique and historic accomplishment , " barroso said on tuesday .
" the lifting of the european union 's internal borders brings opportunities for people living , circulating and doing business in europe , " he said .
a cause for celebration the festivities began early thursday on the slovakia-austria border , one of the many locations which marked the outer boundaries of europe 's east-west divide , when slovak premier robert fico and austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer sawed through a border post on their common frontier on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of the slovak-austrian border is symbolically marked the symbolic gesture took place at the crossing point between berg in austria and petrzalka in slovakia and was aided by slovak president ivan gasparovic .
concerts , fireworks and even a disco evening at the petrzalka-berg crossing on the slovak-austrian frontier will mark the occasion .
" we are standing here at the border between bratislava and vienna to take away the most important symbolic barrier , " said slovak premier fico .
" from midnight tonight , you can travel 4,000 kilometers -lrb- 2,485 miles -rrb- from tallinn in estonia to lisbon in portugal without any border controls . "
the austrian and slovak capitals are europe 's closest , just 40 kilometers apart .
austrian leader gusenbauer focused on the final days of the iron curtain 's legacy .
" it 's an historic occasion following the destruction by the first and second world wars and the division of our continent by the iron curtain . "
" free borders in a free europe : who would have dared to even dream of that in 1985 , " he added .
slovak president gasparovic , sipping champagne under a european flag bearing the slogan ' christmas without borders , ' said , " i propose a toast that this frontier never be closed again . "
a zone of security schengen " is not about criminality , it is not about insecurity or fear .
it is a bigger zone of peace , security and stability , " said gusenbauer .
the austrian chancellor was echoing the words of european parliament president hans-gert pöttering who focused on the security aspects of the expanded schengen zone at the summit for eu leaders in brussels last week .
" it is a visible sign that the former divisions in europe , the borders on the ground and in people 's minds , are being overcome , " he said .
" this will lead to greater freedom and security , not only for the citizens of the nine future schengen countries , but also for the european union as a whole . "
border residents fear crime wave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as one barrier is lifted , many more are erected however , not everyone is convinced .
polls in germany and austria show that many people are concerned that the schengen zone 's expansion east will spark a " made-in-eastern europe " crime wave .
one survey shows that around 59 percent of former east germans view schengen 's expansion negatively with local media reporting a boom in house alarms and reinforced doors .
in ebersbach , a small town of 8,500 in former east germany on the czech border , the concern is evident in the barbed wire stretched over house windows and the newly-formed residents ' border security association .
in austria , a poll by orf public television put the number of those opposed to the border deregulation at 75 percent .
one austrian town , deutschkreutz which lies a few kilometers from the hungarian border , is even planning to hire a private security firm to patrol the streets .
the concern is also felt on the other side of the border .
" it will allow more criminals to come , for example from austria , mostly from the turkish minority and from former yugoslavia , " ondrej kralik , a slovak policeman who has worked 11 years at various border crossing points told news agency afp . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to the study , more than 44 percent of muslims also believe that they will be granted entry to paradise if they die defending their religion .
a total of 1,750 muslims were interviewed for the study about their attitudes towards democracy , aquiring language skills , education and readiness to resort to violence .
troubling findings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aftermath of a suicide bombing in baghdad the majority of those who took part in the survey , however , said they did not condone the use of violence in the name of religion .
at least 80 percent reject the idea of suicide bombings , with 8.7 percent claiming such attacks are cowardly and damaging for islam .
researchers also concluded that 14 percent of germany 's islamic inhabitants dispayed a problematic attitude towards democracy .
twelve percent were highly critical of western society while simultaneously approving corporal punishment and even the death penalty .
schäuble told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that the findings showed a " serious potential for islamic radicalisation . "
muslim marginalisation in an interview with the same newspaper , social anthropologist werner schiffauer said there was just as much anti-democracy sentiment among germany 's non-muslim population as its islamic one . schiffauer added that the social exclusion of muslims was a problem .
" third generation young muslims living in germany are considered foreigners .
they feel like germans , but they are still marginalized , " he said , adding that many consequently turn to islam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how integrated are muslims into german society ?
the hamburg researchers were concerned to learn that many young students consider themselves collective victims of global anti-islamic sentiment .
it said a quarter of muslim students were " latently at risk of being radicalized . "

"
they show that only 23 percent of children of non-german origin embarked on an apprenticeship , compared to 57 percent of their native german counterparts .
böhmer said the situation had worsened in comparison to the mid-1990s , when the figure was around 34 percent .
she added that the continuation of the negative trend despite the recent economic upturn should be regarded as an " alarm signal . "
and , some 40 percent of migrants had no professional qualifications at all .
immigrants from italy , greece and turkey had the poorest records in this respect .
some 72 percent of turkish immigrants had no job training at all .
around one in five do not have any qualifications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , it 's difficult to get a job without having completed a traineeship the report also revealed that some 17.5 percent of children of non-german origin finish school without any educational qualifications .
the risk of becoming unemployed is twice as high among migrants - a fact böhmer blamed chiefly on this lack of education and training .
the integration minister said that rather than encouraging the migration of skilled workers into europe to ease labor shortages , germany must focus on improving integration and training for its existing migrant population .
" we can not afford to lose any talent , " she stressed .
according to the statistics , some 15 million people in germany have immigrated since 1950 or have at least one immigrant parent .
about 50 percent of them have german citizenship .
" we must significantly improve the educational situation of young migrants , " she said .
böhmer pointed to a series of measures included in the national integration plan , such as early language coaching in kindergartens and schools , ease of access to study grants for migrant teenagers and improved teacher training .
" we need more teachers from a migrant background , " she added .
the national integration plan was agreed in the summer at an integration summit attended by immigrant organizations , charities , business associations and representatives from various levels of government .
is better education enough ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some schools are teaching turkish alongside german free democrat politician sibylle laurischk called the figures " shocking " and called for the introduction of national language tests for children starting kindergarden .
sevim dagdelen , a member of the left party , sounded a note of warning .
" german language skills are not enough to safeguard against discrimination in the education system and against unemployment . "
in her speech presenting the report , böhmer also said that there had to be improved acceptance of qualifications gained abroad .
she said there were some half a million foreigners in germany with degrees , but who unable to work in their professions because their credentials were not recognized .
" we are squandering potential here , " she criticized .
the integration minister had some good news .
the number of immigrants setting up their own businesses has almost doubled since the 1990s .
currently , immigrants own some 582,000 firms and employ some two million staff . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new signatories of the schengen treaty , named after the luxembourg border village where the no-frontiers pact was born in 1985 , will join the current 15 members in enjoying the benefits of deregulated cross-border movement .
it 's a bit like an early christmas present at a peak travel time - some 400 million europeans will be able to travel by road , rail and ship with increased ease .
after two years of preparation , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia , and slovenia will join the oldest eu states - britain and the republic of ireland excluded - plus iceland and norway in the extended zone pushing the area 's outmost borders hundreds of kilometers eastwards .
the expansion is expected to continue with cyprus and switzerland planning to sign on soon .
london and dublin prefer to remain outside and keep their own visa regimes , rather than the " one visa for all " policy that applies to the schengen countries .
as well as having border controls removed , the nine signatories will also see travel document checks abolished at their airports in march .
all border controls can be re-established temporarily in case of emergency , for security reasons or when people move en-masse , such as for sporting events .
new border , new responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officers will pass border duties to polish cops in return for free-movement , the new countries will be obliged to provide data to the schengen information system -lrb- sis -rrb- so police and customs officers can access information about people , vehicles and goods .
the nine signatories will also sign up to new measures which will allow extended police and judicial cooperation including cross-border surveillance and the " hot pursuit " of suspects across frontiers . internal freedom within the schengen zone will also lead to tightened security on its new eastern reaches , placing increased responsibilities on its latest members .
celebrations to mark the extension of the schengen agreement were planned along the newly opened borders .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso and justice commissioner franco frattini will be there as the barriers come down .
" we will live and circulate in an area of 24 countries without internal borders .
this is a unique and historic accomplishment , " barroso said on tuesday .
" the lifting of the european union 's internal borders brings opportunities for people living , circulating and doing business in europe , " he said .
a cause for celebration the festivities began early thursday on the slovakia-austria border , one of the many locations which marked the outer boundaries of europe 's east-west divide , when slovak premier robert fico and austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer sawed through a border post on their common frontier on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of the slovak-austrian border is symbolically marked the symbolic gesture took place at the crossing point between berg in austria and petrzalka in slovakia and was aided by slovak president ivan gasparovic .
concerts , fireworks and even a disco evening at the petrzalka-berg crossing on the slovak-austrian frontier will mark the occasion .
" we are standing here at the border between bratislava and vienna to take away the most important symbolic barrier , " said slovak premier fico .
" from midnight tonight , you can travel 4,000 kilometers -lrb- 2,485 miles -rrb- from tallinn in estonia to lisbon in portugal without any border controls . "
the austrian and slovak capitals are europe 's closest , just 40 kilometers apart .
austrian leader gusenbauer focused on the final days of the iron curtain 's legacy .
" it 's an historic occasion following the destruction by the first and second world wars and the division of our continent by the iron curtain . "
" free borders in a free europe : who would have dared to even dream of that in 1985 , " he added .
slovak president gasparovic , sipping champagne under a european flag bearing the slogan ' christmas without borders , ' said , " i propose a toast that this frontier never be closed again . "
a zone of security schengen " is not about criminality , it is not about insecurity or fear .
it is a bigger zone of peace , security and stability , " said gusenbauer .
the austrian chancellor was echoing the words of european parliament president hans-gert pöttering who focused on the security aspects of the expanded schengen zone at the summit for eu leaders in brussels last week .
" it is a visible sign that the former divisions in europe , the borders on the ground and in people 's minds , are being overcome , " he said .
" this will lead to greater freedom and security , not only for the citizens of the nine future schengen countries , but also for the european union as a whole . "
border residents fear crime wave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as one barrier is lifted , many more are erected however , not everyone is convinced .
polls in germany and austria show that many people are concerned that the schengen zone 's expansion east will spark a " made-in-eastern europe " crime wave .
one survey shows that around 59 percent of former east germans view schengen 's expansion negatively with local media reporting a boom in house alarms and reinforced doors .
in ebersbach , a small town of 8,500 in former east germany on the czech border , the concern is evident in the barbed wire stretched over house windows and the newly-formed residents ' border security association .
in austria , a poll by orf public television put the number of those opposed to the border deregulation at 75 percent .
one austrian town , deutschkreutz which lies a few kilometers from the hungarian border , is even planning to hire a private security firm to patrol the streets .
the concern is also felt on the other side of the border .
" it will allow more criminals to come , for example from austria , mostly from the turkish minority and from former yugoslavia , " ondrej kralik , a slovak policeman who has worked 11 years at various border crossing points told news agency afp . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : europe without borders eu opens internal borders to long-stay visa holders , sparking security fears checkpoint-free europe confounds germany 's skeptics 15 years of visa-free travel in europe europe 's unity with swiss in libya visa row tested by business links european union -pipe- 20.12.2007 schengen expansion ends iron curtain 's hold over europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bus travel between 24 countries got a lot easier on friday morning it would have been laughed at as an inconceivable idea 20 years ago but this week the last remnants of the iron curtain come down , increasing freedom of movement for around 400 million europeans . the last remnants of the iron curtain will be swept aside friday when the european union scraps the internal border restrictions for nine mostly eastern european eu members to create a vast free-movement zone embracing 24 countries from portugal to finland .
the new signatories of the schengen treaty , named after the luxembourg border village where the no-frontiers pact was born in 1985 , will join the current 15 members in enjoying the benefits of deregulated cross-border movement .
it 's a bit like an early christmas present at a peak travel time - some 400 million europeans will be able to travel by road , rail and ship with increased ease .
after two years of preparation , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia , and slovenia will join the oldest eu states - britain and the republic of ireland excluded - plus iceland and norway in the extended zone pushing the area 's outmost borders hundreds of kilometers eastwards .
the expansion is expected to continue with cyprus and switzerland planning to sign on soon .
london and dublin prefer to remain outside and keep their own visa regimes , rather than the " one visa for all " policy that applies to the schengen countries .
as well as having border controls removed , the nine signatories will also see travel document checks abolished at their airports in march .
all border controls can be re-established temporarily in case of emergency , for security reasons or when people move en-masse , such as for sporting events .
new border , new responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officers will pass border duties to polish cops in return for free-movement , the new countries will be obliged to provide data to the schengen information system -lrb- sis -rrb- so police and customs officers can access information about people , vehicles and goods .
the nine signatories will also sign up to new measures which will allow extended police and judicial cooperation including cross-border surveillance and the " hot pursuit " of suspects across frontiers . internal freedom within the schengen zone will also lead to tightened security on its new eastern reaches , placing increased responsibilities on its latest members .
celebrations to mark the extension of the schengen agreement were planned along the newly opened borders .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso and justice commissioner franco frattini will be there as the barriers come down .
" we will live and circulate in an area of 24 countries without internal borders .
this is a unique and historic accomplishment , " barroso said on tuesday .
" the lifting of the european union 's internal borders brings opportunities for people living , circulating and doing business in europe , " he said .
a cause for celebration the festivities began early thursday on the slovakia-austria border , one of the many locations which marked the outer boundaries of europe 's east-west divide , when slovak premier robert fico and austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer sawed through a border post on their common frontier on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of the slovak-austrian border is symbolically marked the symbolic gesture took place at the crossing point between berg in austria and petrzalka in slovakia and was aided by slovak president ivan gasparovic .
concerts , fireworks and even a disco evening at the petrzalka-berg crossing on the slovak-austrian frontier will mark the occasion .
" we are standing here at the border between bratislava and vienna to take away the most important symbolic barrier , " said slovak premier fico .
" from midnight tonight , you can travel 4,000 kilometers -lrb- 2,485 miles -rrb- from tallinn in estonia to lisbon in portugal without any border controls . "
the austrian and slovak capitals are europe 's closest , just 40 kilometers apart .
austrian leader gusenbauer focused on the final days of the iron curtain 's legacy .
" it 's an historic occasion following the destruction by the first and second world wars and the division of our continent by the iron curtain . "
" free borders in a free europe : who would have dared to even dream of that in 1985 , " he added .
slovak president gasparovic , sipping champagne under a european flag bearing the slogan ' christmas without borders , ' said , " i propose a toast that this frontier never be closed again . "
a zone of security schengen " is not about criminality , it is not about insecurity or fear .
it is a bigger zone of peace , security and stability , " said gusenbauer .
the austrian chancellor was echoing the words of european parliament president hans-gert pöttering who focused on the security aspects of the expanded schengen zone at the summit for eu leaders in brussels last week .
" it is a visible sign that the former divisions in europe , the borders on the ground and in people 's minds , are being overcome , " he said .
" this will lead to greater freedom and security , not only for the citizens of the nine future schengen countries , but also for the european union as a whole . "
border residents fear crime wave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as one barrier is lifted , many more are erected however , not everyone is convinced .
polls in germany and austria show that many people are concerned that the schengen zone 's expansion east will spark a " made-in-eastern europe " crime wave .
one survey shows that around 59 percent of former east germans view schengen 's expansion negatively with local media reporting a boom in house alarms and reinforced doors .
in ebersbach , a small town of 8,500 in former east germany on the czech border , the concern is evident in the barbed wire stretched over house windows and the newly-formed residents ' border security association .
in austria , a poll by orf public television put the number of those opposed to the border deregulation at 75 percent .
one austrian town , deutschkreutz which lies a few kilometers from the hungarian border , is even planning to hire a private security firm to patrol the streets .
the concern is also felt on the other side of the border .
" it will allow more criminals to come , for example from austria , mostly from the turkish minority and from former yugoslavia , " ondrej kralik , a slovak policeman who has worked 11 years at various border crossing points told news agency afp . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in children 's rights , germany has lagged behind other european countries . recent news stories of mothers arrested for killing their children have pointed out the holes in germany 's child welfare safety net . germany 's chancellor angela merkel called for taking a dual approach to protecting children .
parents need more support , she said .
yet there 's also a need for better monitoring to make sure children are not left in an abusive situation . doctor 's visits for young children should become mandatory across the country , politicians decided at an emergency meeting merkel called to discuss the topic on wednesday , dec .
19 . merkel , who heads the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , met with state and local officials responsible for child welfare under germany 's federal system . the doctor visits are envisioned as part of an early warning system to help detect possible abuse . " the risks for children must be detected early in order to establish a help net for at-risk children , " said family minister ursula von der leyen -lrb- cdu -rrb- . seeking constitutional protection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all children have loving parents for the moment , children 's rights wo n't be specifically enshrined in the constitution , as germany 's social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- had hoped . mentioning children specifically in the constitution would ensure that both the legislature and the courts weighed child welfare carefully when making every decision , said germany 's justice minister brigitte zypries of the spd . the cdu rejected the need for additional legal protections beyond the human rights already part of german law , saying they were unnecessary .
roland koch , the premier of hessen who is a member of the cdu , said discussion should focus on how to support local projects which offer practical help to families . children need extra support seventy german children 's rights groups have called for a constitutional change . " it 's very important for children themselves to have their own specific rights , " said mieke schuurman , the secretary general of the european children 's network .
" they are a specific group and they are more vulnerable than adult citizens . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty remains a risk factor for children the european children 's network successfully lobbied for a reference to children 's rights in the european union 's new reform treaty .
the united nations also specifically addresses the issue .
enshrining children 's rights into a constitution provides a legal basis for ensuring that their needs are addressed across the board , schuurman said . of course , words need to be backed up by effective programs and financial support . while there are many local and regional programs focused on helping at-risk mothers and their children , germany is not seen to be leading europe in child welfare issues .
a recent study by unicef 's innocenti research center in florence , italy , put germany solidly in the middle of the pack on dealing with issues such as childhood poverty , health , safety , education and risky behavior . scandinavian countries headed the list of the best countries in europe for children . the next study , due out in spring , will focus on early childhood issues .
in germany , there has been considerable interest at the federal level in early childhood services .
it 's seen as important to breaking the cycle of poverty and for integrating the children of immigrants , said eva jespersen , head of the economic and social policies unit at innocenti . particularly in germany 's decentralized system , it 's extremely important to have a national framework for child rights , jespersen said . " every child within a sovereign state has the same rights , " jespersen said . it 's up to the federal government to ensure that the rights of children are advanced uniformly and address inequalities , she said . recent cases spotlight problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goal is to prevent child abuse on wednesday , dec .
5 , five children aged three to nine were found suffocated in their home in darry , schleswig-holstein .
their mother , who had been undergoing psychiatric treatment , alerted doctors to what had happened . a few days earlier , a 28-year-old woman was arrested on serial murder charges after three newborns were found dead in a small town in saxony .
police said she told interrogators each of her three daughters " died suddenly " soon after birth in 2002 , 2004 and 2005 . between 80 and 100 children die in germany each year from neglect and abuse , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported .
and child abuse numbers are also rising , although it 's unclear whether actual incidents have increased or whether people are more likely to report suspected abuse than in the past . authorities removed about 170,000 children and teenagers from their parents ' homes in 2006 and placed them in state care . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
they show that only 23 percent of children of non-german origin embarked on an apprenticeship , compared to 57 percent of their native german counterparts .
böhmer said the situation had worsened in comparison to the mid-1990s , when the figure was around 34 percent .
she added that the continuation of the negative trend despite the recent economic upturn should be regarded as an " alarm signal . "

the new signatories of the schengen treaty , named after the luxembourg border village where the no-frontiers pact was born in 1985 , will join the current 15 members in enjoying the benefits of deregulated cross-border movement .
it 's a bit like an early christmas present at a peak travel time - some 400 million europeans will be able to travel by road , rail and ship with increased ease .
after two years of preparation , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia , and slovenia will join the oldest eu states - britain and the republic of ireland excluded - plus iceland and norway in the extended zone pushing the area 's outmost borders hundreds of kilometers eastwards .
the expansion is expected to continue with cyprus and switzerland planning to sign on soon .
london and dublin prefer to remain outside and keep their own visa regimes , rather than the " one visa for all " policy that applies to the schengen countries .
as well as having border controls removed , the nine signatories will also see travel document checks abolished at their airports in march .
all border controls can be re-established temporarily in case of emergency , for security reasons or when people move en-masse , such as for sporting events .
new border , new responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officers will pass border duties to polish cops in return for free-movement , the new countries will be obliged to provide data to the schengen information system -lrb- sis -rrb- so police and customs officers can access information about people , vehicles and goods .
the nine signatories will also sign up to new measures which will allow extended police and judicial cooperation including cross-border surveillance and the " hot pursuit " of suspects across frontiers . internal freedom within the schengen zone will also lead to tightened security on its new eastern reaches , placing increased responsibilities on its latest members .
celebrations to mark the extension of the schengen agreement were planned along the newly opened borders .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso and justice commissioner franco frattini will be there as the barriers come down .
" we will live and circulate in an area of 24 countries without internal borders .
this is a unique and historic accomplishment , " barroso said on tuesday .
" the lifting of the european union 's internal borders brings opportunities for people living , circulating and doing business in europe , " he said .
a cause for celebration the festivities began early thursday on the slovakia-austria border , one of the many locations which marked the outer boundaries of europe 's east-west divide , when slovak premier robert fico and austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer sawed through a border post on their common frontier on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of the slovak-austrian border is symbolically marked the symbolic gesture took place at the crossing point between berg in austria and petrzalka in slovakia and was aided by slovak president ivan gasparovic .
concerts , fireworks and even a disco evening at the petrzalka-berg crossing on the slovak-austrian frontier will mark the occasion .
" we are standing here at the border between bratislava and vienna to take away the most important symbolic barrier , " said slovak premier fico .
" from midnight tonight , you can travel 4,000 kilometers -lrb- 2,485 miles -rrb- from tallinn in estonia to lisbon in portugal without any border controls . "
the austrian and slovak capitals are europe 's closest , just 40 kilometers apart .
austrian leader gusenbauer focused on the final days of the iron curtain 's legacy .
" it 's an historic occasion following the destruction by the first and second world wars and the division of our continent by the iron curtain . "
" free borders in a free europe : who would have dared to even dream of that in 1985 , " he added .
slovak president gasparovic , sipping champagne under a european flag bearing the slogan ' christmas without borders , ' said , " i propose a toast that this frontier never be closed again . "
a zone of security schengen " is not about criminality , it is not about insecurity or fear .
it is a bigger zone of peace , security and stability , " said gusenbauer .
the austrian chancellor was echoing the words of european parliament president hans-gert pöttering who focused on the security aspects of the expanded schengen zone at the summit for eu leaders in brussels last week .
" it is a visible sign that the former divisions in europe , the borders on the ground and in people 's minds , are being overcome , " he said .
" this will lead to greater freedom and security , not only for the citizens of the nine future schengen countries , but also for the european union as a whole . "
border residents fear crime wave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as one barrier is lifted , many more are erected however , not everyone is convinced .
polls in germany and austria show that many people are concerned that the schengen zone 's expansion east will spark a " made-in-eastern europe " crime wave .
one survey shows that around 59 percent of former east germans view schengen 's expansion negatively with local media reporting a boom in house alarms and reinforced doors .
in ebersbach , a small town of 8,500 in former east germany on the czech border , the concern is evident in the barbed wire stretched over house windows and the newly-formed residents ' border security association .
in austria , a poll by orf public television put the number of those opposed to the border deregulation at 75 percent .
one austrian town , deutschkreutz which lies a few kilometers from the hungarian border , is even planning to hire a private security firm to patrol the streets .
the concern is also felt on the other side of the border .
" it will allow more criminals to come , for example from austria , mostly from the turkish minority and from former yugoslavia , " ondrej kralik , a slovak policeman who has worked 11 years at various border crossing points told news agency afp . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new signatories of the schengen treaty , named after the luxembourg border village where the no-frontiers pact was born in 1985 , will join the current 15 members in enjoying the benefits of deregulated cross-border movement .
it 's a bit like an early christmas present at a peak travel time - some 400 million europeans will be able to travel by road , rail and ship with increased ease .
after two years of preparation , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia , and slovenia will join the oldest eu states - britain and the republic of ireland excluded - plus iceland and norway in the extended zone pushing the area 's outmost borders hundreds of kilometers eastwards .
the expansion is expected to continue with cyprus and switzerland planning to sign on soon .
london and dublin prefer to remain outside and keep their own visa regimes , rather than the " one visa for all " policy that applies to the schengen countries .
as well as having border controls removed , the nine signatories will also see travel document checks abolished at their airports in march .
all border controls can be re-established temporarily in case of emergency , for security reasons or when people move en-masse , such as for sporting events .
new border , new responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officers will pass border duties to polish cops in return for free-movement , the new countries will be obliged to provide data to the schengen information system -lrb- sis -rrb- so police and customs officers can access information about people , vehicles and goods .
the nine signatories will also sign up to new measures which will allow extended police and judicial cooperation including cross-border surveillance and the " hot pursuit " of suspects across frontiers . internal freedom within the schengen zone will also lead to tightened security on its new eastern reaches , placing increased responsibilities on its latest members .
celebrations to mark the extension of the schengen agreement were planned along the newly opened borders .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso and justice commissioner franco frattini will be there as the barriers come down .
" we will live and circulate in an area of 24 countries without internal borders .
this is a unique and historic accomplishment , " barroso said on tuesday .
" the lifting of the european union 's internal borders brings opportunities for people living , circulating and doing business in europe , " he said .
a cause for celebration the festivities began early thursday on the slovakia-austria border , one of the many locations which marked the outer boundaries of europe 's east-west divide , when slovak premier robert fico and austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer sawed through a border post on their common frontier on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of the slovak-austrian border is symbolically marked the symbolic gesture took place at the crossing point between berg in austria and petrzalka in slovakia and was aided by slovak president ivan gasparovic .
concerts , fireworks and even a disco evening at the petrzalka-berg crossing on the slovak-austrian frontier will mark the occasion .
" we are standing here at the border between bratislava and vienna to take away the most important symbolic barrier , " said slovak premier fico .
" from midnight tonight , you can travel 4,000 kilometers -lrb- 2,485 miles -rrb- from tallinn in estonia to lisbon in portugal without any border controls . "
the austrian and slovak capitals are europe 's closest , just 40 kilometers apart .
austrian leader gusenbauer focused on the final days of the iron curtain 's legacy .
" it 's an historic occasion following the destruction by the first and second world wars and the division of our continent by the iron curtain . "
" free borders in a free europe : who would have dared to even dream of that in 1985 , " he added .
slovak president gasparovic , sipping champagne under a european flag bearing the slogan ' christmas without borders , ' said , " i propose a toast that this frontier never be closed again . "
a zone of security schengen " is not about criminality , it is not about insecurity or fear .
it is a bigger zone of peace , security and stability , " said gusenbauer .
the austrian chancellor was echoing the words of european parliament president hans-gert pöttering who focused on the security aspects of the expanded schengen zone at the summit for eu leaders in brussels last week .
" it is a visible sign that the former divisions in europe , the borders on the ground and in people 's minds , are being overcome , " he said .
" this will lead to greater freedom and security , not only for the citizens of the nine future schengen countries , but also for the european union as a whole . "
border residents fear crime wave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as one barrier is lifted , many more are erected however , not everyone is convinced .
polls in germany and austria show that many people are concerned that the schengen zone 's expansion east will spark a " made-in-eastern europe " crime wave .
one survey shows that around 59 percent of former east germans view schengen 's expansion negatively with local media reporting a boom in house alarms and reinforced doors .
in ebersbach , a small town of 8,500 in former east germany on the czech border , the concern is evident in the barbed wire stretched over house windows and the newly-formed residents ' border security association .
in austria , a poll by orf public television put the number of those opposed to the border deregulation at 75 percent .
one austrian town , deutschkreutz which lies a few kilometers from the hungarian border , is even planning to hire a private security firm to patrol the streets .
the concern is also felt on the other side of the border .
" it will allow more criminals to come , for example from austria , mostly from the turkish minority and from former yugoslavia , " ondrej kralik , a slovak policeman who has worked 11 years at various border crossing points told news agency afp . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new signatories of the schengen treaty , named after the luxembourg border village where the no-frontiers pact was born in 1985 , will join the current 15 members in enjoying the benefits of deregulated cross-border movement .
it 's a bit like an early christmas present at a peak travel time - some 400 million europeans will be able to travel by road , rail and ship with increased ease .
after two years of preparation , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia , and slovenia will join the oldest eu states - britain and the republic of ireland excluded - plus iceland and norway in the extended zone pushing the area 's outmost borders hundreds of kilometers eastwards .
the expansion is expected to continue with cyprus and switzerland planning to sign on soon .
london and dublin prefer to remain outside and keep their own visa regimes , rather than the " one visa for all " policy that applies to the schengen countries .
as well as having border controls removed , the nine signatories will also see travel document checks abolished at their airports in march .
all border controls can be re-established temporarily in case of emergency , for security reasons or when people move en-masse , such as for sporting events .
new border , new responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officers will pass border duties to polish cops in return for free-movement , the new countries will be obliged to provide data to the schengen information system -lrb- sis -rrb- so police and customs officers can access information about people , vehicles and goods .
the nine signatories will also sign up to new measures which will allow extended police and judicial cooperation including cross-border surveillance and the " hot pursuit " of suspects across frontiers . internal freedom within the schengen zone will also lead to tightened security on its new eastern reaches , placing increased responsibilities on its latest members .
celebrations to mark the extension of the schengen agreement were planned along the newly opened borders .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso and justice commissioner franco frattini will be there as the barriers come down .
" we will live and circulate in an area of 24 countries without internal borders .
this is a unique and historic accomplishment , " barroso said on tuesday .
" the lifting of the european union 's internal borders brings opportunities for people living , circulating and doing business in europe , " he said .
a cause for celebration the festivities began early thursday on the slovakia-austria border , one of the many locations which marked the outer boundaries of europe 's east-west divide , when slovak premier robert fico and austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer sawed through a border post on their common frontier on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of the slovak-austrian border is symbolically marked the symbolic gesture took place at the crossing point between berg in austria and petrzalka in slovakia and was aided by slovak president ivan gasparovic .
concerts , fireworks and even a disco evening at the petrzalka-berg crossing on the slovak-austrian frontier will mark the occasion .
" we are standing here at the border between bratislava and vienna to take away the most important symbolic barrier , " said slovak premier fico .
" from midnight tonight , you can travel 4,000 kilometers -lrb- 2,485 miles -rrb- from tallinn in estonia to lisbon in portugal without any border controls . "
the austrian and slovak capitals are europe 's closest , just 40 kilometers apart .
austrian leader gusenbauer focused on the final days of the iron curtain 's legacy .
" it 's an historic occasion following the destruction by the first and second world wars and the division of our continent by the iron curtain . "
" free borders in a free europe : who would have dared to even dream of that in 1985 , " he added .
slovak president gasparovic , sipping champagne under a european flag bearing the slogan ' christmas without borders , ' said , " i propose a toast that this frontier never be closed again . "
a zone of security schengen " is not about criminality , it is not about insecurity or fear .
it is a bigger zone of peace , security and stability , " said gusenbauer .
the austrian chancellor was echoing the words of european parliament president hans-gert pöttering who focused on the security aspects of the expanded schengen zone at the summit for eu leaders in brussels last week .
" it is a visible sign that the former divisions in europe , the borders on the ground and in people 's minds , are being overcome , " he said .
" this will lead to greater freedom and security , not only for the citizens of the nine future schengen countries , but also for the european union as a whole . "
border residents fear crime wave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as one barrier is lifted , many more are erected however , not everyone is convinced .
polls in germany and austria show that many people are concerned that the schengen zone 's expansion east will spark a " made-in-eastern europe " crime wave .
one survey shows that around 59 percent of former east germans view schengen 's expansion negatively with local media reporting a boom in house alarms and reinforced doors .
in ebersbach , a small town of 8,500 in former east germany on the czech border , the concern is evident in the barbed wire stretched over house windows and the newly-formed residents ' border security association .
in austria , a poll by orf public television put the number of those opposed to the border deregulation at 75 percent .
one austrian town , deutschkreutz which lies a few kilometers from the hungarian border , is even planning to hire a private security firm to patrol the streets .
the concern is also felt on the other side of the border .
" it will allow more criminals to come , for example from austria , mostly from the turkish minority and from former yugoslavia , " ondrej kralik , a slovak policeman who has worked 11 years at various border crossing points told news agency afp . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new signatories of the schengen treaty , named after the luxembourg border village where the no-frontiers pact was born in 1985 , will join the current 15 members in enjoying the benefits of deregulated cross-border movement .
it 's a bit like an early christmas present at a peak travel time - some 400 million europeans will be able to travel by road , rail and ship with increased ease .

the expansion is expected to continue with cyprus and switzerland planning to sign on soon .
london and dublin prefer to remain outside and keep their own visa regimes , rather than the " one visa for all " policy that applies to the schengen countries .

the nine signatories will also sign up to new measures which will allow extended police and judicial cooperation including cross-border surveillance and the " hot pursuit " of suspects across frontiers . internal freedom within the schengen zone will also lead to tightened security on its new eastern reaches , placing increased responsibilities on its latest members .

the austrian and slovak capitals are europe 's closest , just 40 kilometers apart .
austrian leader gusenbauer focused on the final days of the iron curtain 's legacy .
" it 's an historic occasion following the destruction by the first and second world wars and the division of our continent by the iron curtain . "
" free borders in a free europe : who would have dared to even dream of that in 1985 , " he added .
slovak president gasparovic , sipping champagne under a european flag bearing the slogan ' christmas without borders , ' said , " i propose a toast that this frontier never be closed again . "
a zone of security schengen " is not about criminality , it is not about insecurity or fear .
it is a bigger zone of peace , security and stability , " said gusenbauer .
the austrian chancellor was echoing the words of european parliament president hans-gert pöttering who focused on the security aspects of the expanded schengen zone at the summit for eu leaders in brussels last week .
" it is a visible sign that the former divisions in europe , the borders on the ground and in people 's minds , are being overcome , " he said .
" this will lead to greater freedom and security , not only for the citizens of the nine future schengen countries , but also for the european union as a whole . "
border residents fear crime wave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as one barrier is lifted , many more are erected however , not everyone is convinced .
polls in germany and austria show that many people are concerned that the schengen zone 's expansion east will spark a " made-in-eastern europe " crime wave .
one survey shows that around 59 percent of former east germans view schengen 's expansion negatively with local media reporting a boom in house alarms and reinforced doors .
in ebersbach , a small town of 8,500 in former east germany on the czech border , the concern is evident in the barbed wire stretched over house windows and the newly-formed residents ' border security association .
in austria , a poll by orf public television put the number of those opposed to the border deregulation at 75 percent .
one austrian town , deutschkreutz which lies a few kilometers from the hungarian border , is even planning to hire a private security firm to patrol the streets .
the concern is also felt on the other side of the border .
" it will allow more criminals to come , for example from austria , mostly from the turkish minority and from former yugoslavia , " ondrej kralik , a slovak policeman who has worked 11 years at various border crossing points told news agency afp . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one survey shows that around 59 percent of former east germans view schengen 's expansion negatively with local media reporting a boom in house alarms and reinforced doors .
in ebersbach , a small town of 8,500 in former east germany on the czech border , the concern is evident in the barbed wire stretched over house windows and the newly-formed residents ' border security association .
in austria , a poll by orf public television put the number of those opposed to the border deregulation at 75 percent .
one austrian town , deutschkreutz which lies a few kilometers from the hungarian border , is even planning to hire a private security firm to patrol the streets .
the concern is also felt on the other side of the border .

the new signatories of the schengen treaty , named after the luxembourg border village where the no-frontiers pact was born in 1985 , will join the current 15 members in enjoying the benefits of deregulated cross-border movement .
it 's a bit like an early christmas present at a peak travel time - some 400 million europeans will be able to travel by road , rail and ship with increased ease .
after two years of preparation , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia , and slovenia will join the oldest eu states - britain and the republic of ireland excluded - plus iceland and norway in the extended zone pushing the area 's outmost borders hundreds of kilometers eastwards .
the expansion is expected to continue with cyprus and switzerland planning to sign on soon .
london and dublin prefer to remain outside and keep their own visa regimes , rather than the " one visa for all " policy that applies to the schengen countries .
as well as having border controls removed , the nine signatories will also see travel document checks abolished at their airports in march .
all border controls can be re-established temporarily in case of emergency , for security reasons or when people move en-masse , such as for sporting events .
new border , new responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officers will pass border duties to polish cops in return for free-movement , the new countries will be obliged to provide data to the schengen information system -lrb- sis -rrb- so police and customs officers can access information about people , vehicles and goods .
the nine signatories will also sign up to new measures which will allow extended police and judicial cooperation including cross-border surveillance and the " hot pursuit " of suspects across frontiers . internal freedom within the schengen zone will also lead to tightened security on its new eastern reaches , placing increased responsibilities on its latest members .
celebrations to mark the extension of the schengen agreement were planned along the newly opened borders .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso and justice commissioner franco frattini will be there as the barriers come down .
" we will live and circulate in an area of 24 countries without internal borders .
this is a unique and historic accomplishment , " barroso said on tuesday .
" the lifting of the european union 's internal borders brings opportunities for people living , circulating and doing business in europe , " he said .
a cause for celebration the festivities began early thursday on the slovakia-austria border , one of the many locations which marked the outer boundaries of europe 's east-west divide , when slovak premier robert fico and austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer sawed through a border post on their common frontier on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of the slovak-austrian border is symbolically marked the symbolic gesture took place at the crossing point between berg in austria and petrzalka in slovakia and was aided by slovak president ivan gasparovic .
concerts , fireworks and even a disco evening at the petrzalka-berg crossing on the slovak-austrian frontier will mark the occasion .
" we are standing here at the border between bratislava and vienna to take away the most important symbolic barrier , " said slovak premier fico .
" from midnight tonight , you can travel 4,000 kilometers -lrb- 2,485 miles -rrb- from tallinn in estonia to lisbon in portugal without any border controls . "
the austrian and slovak capitals are europe 's closest , just 40 kilometers apart .
austrian leader gusenbauer focused on the final days of the iron curtain 's legacy .
" it 's an historic occasion following the destruction by the first and second world wars and the division of our continent by the iron curtain . "
" free borders in a free europe : who would have dared to even dream of that in 1985 , " he added .
slovak president gasparovic , sipping champagne under a european flag bearing the slogan ' christmas without borders , ' said , " i propose a toast that this frontier never be closed again . "
a zone of security schengen " is not about criminality , it is not about insecurity or fear .
it is a bigger zone of peace , security and stability , " said gusenbauer .
the austrian chancellor was echoing the words of european parliament president hans-gert pöttering who focused on the security aspects of the expanded schengen zone at the summit for eu leaders in brussels last week .
" it is a visible sign that the former divisions in europe , the borders on the ground and in people 's minds , are being overcome , " he said .
" this will lead to greater freedom and security , not only for the citizens of the nine future schengen countries , but also for the european union as a whole . "

in children 's rights , germany has lagged behind other european countries . recent news stories of mothers arrested for killing their children have pointed out the holes in germany 's child welfare safety net . germany 's chancellor angela merkel called for taking a dual approach to protecting children .
parents need more support , she said .
yet there 's also a need for better monitoring to make sure children are not left in an abusive situation . doctor 's visits for young children should become mandatory across the country , politicians decided at an emergency meeting merkel called to discuss the topic on wednesday , dec .
19 . merkel , who heads the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , met with state and local officials responsible for child welfare under germany 's federal system . the doctor visits are envisioned as part of an early warning system to help detect possible abuse . " the risks for children must be detected early in order to establish a help net for at-risk children , " said family minister ursula von der leyen -lrb- cdu -rrb- . seeking constitutional protection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all children have loving parents for the moment , children 's rights wo n't be specifically enshrined in the constitution , as germany 's social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- had hoped . mentioning children specifically in the constitution would ensure that both the legislature and the courts weighed child welfare carefully when making every decision , said germany 's justice minister brigitte zypries of the spd . the cdu rejected the need for additional legal protections beyond the human rights already part of german law , saying they were unnecessary .
roland koch , the premier of hessen who is a member of the cdu , said discussion should focus on how to support local projects which offer practical help to families . children need extra support seventy german children 's rights groups have called for a constitutional change . " it 's very important for children themselves to have their own specific rights , " said mieke schuurman , the secretary general of the european children 's network .
" they are a specific group and they are more vulnerable than adult citizens . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty remains a risk factor for children the european children 's network successfully lobbied for a reference to children 's rights in the european union 's new reform treaty .
the united nations also specifically addresses the issue .
enshrining children 's rights into a constitution provides a legal basis for ensuring that their needs are addressed across the board , schuurman said . of course , words need to be backed up by effective programs and financial support . while there are many local and regional programs focused on helping at-risk mothers and their children , germany is not seen to be leading europe in child welfare issues .
a recent study by unicef 's innocenti research center in florence , italy , put germany solidly in the middle of the pack on dealing with issues such as childhood poverty , health , safety , education and risky behavior . scandinavian countries headed the list of the best countries in europe for children . the next study , due out in spring , will focus on early childhood issues .
in germany , there has been considerable interest at the federal level in early childhood services .
it 's seen as important to breaking the cycle of poverty and for integrating the children of immigrants , said eva jespersen , head of the economic and social policies unit at innocenti . particularly in germany 's decentralized system , it 's extremely important to have a national framework for child rights , jespersen said . " every child within a sovereign state has the same rights , " jespersen said . it 's up to the federal government to ensure that the rights of children are advanced uniformly and address inequalities , she said . recent cases spotlight problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goal is to prevent child abuse on wednesday , dec .
5 , five children aged three to nine were found suffocated in their home in darry , schleswig-holstein .
their mother , who had been undergoing psychiatric treatment , alerted doctors to what had happened . a few days earlier , a 28-year-old woman was arrested on serial murder charges after three newborns were found dead in a small town in saxony .
police said she told interrogators each of her three daughters " died suddenly " soon after birth in 2002 , 2004 and 2005 . between 80 and 100 children die in germany each year from neglect and abuse , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported .
and child abuse numbers are also rising , although it 's unclear whether actual incidents have increased or whether people are more likely to report suspected abuse than in the past . authorities removed about 170,000 children and teenagers from their parents ' homes in 2006 and placed them in state care . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to the study , more than 44 percent of muslims also believe that they will be granted entry to paradise if they die defending their religion .
a total of 1,750 muslims were interviewed for the study about their attitudes towards democracy , aquiring language skills , education and readiness to resort to violence .
troubling findings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aftermath of a suicide bombing in baghdad the majority of those who took part in the survey , however , said they did not condone the use of violence in the name of religion .
at least 80 percent reject the idea of suicide bombings , with 8.7 percent claiming such attacks are cowardly and damaging for islam .
researchers also concluded that 14 percent of germany 's islamic inhabitants dispayed a problematic attitude towards democracy .
twelve percent were highly critical of western society while simultaneously approving corporal punishment and even the death penalty .
schäuble told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that the findings showed a " serious potential for islamic radicalisation . "

they feel like germans , but they are still marginalized , " he said , adding that many consequently turn to islam .

"
they show that only 23 percent of children of non-german origin embarked on an apprenticeship , compared to 57 percent of their native german counterparts .
böhmer said the situation had worsened in comparison to the mid-1990s , when the figure was around 34 percent .
she added that the continuation of the negative trend despite the recent economic upturn should be regarded as an " alarm signal . "
and , some 40 percent of migrants had no professional qualifications at all .
immigrants from italy , greece and turkey had the poorest records in this respect .
some 72 percent of turkish immigrants had no job training at all .
around one in five do not have any qualifications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , it 's difficult to get a job without having completed a traineeship the report also revealed that some 17.5 percent of children of non-german origin finish school without any educational qualifications .
the risk of becoming unemployed is twice as high among migrants - a fact böhmer blamed chiefly on this lack of education and training .
the integration minister said that rather than encouraging the migration of skilled workers into europe to ease labor shortages , germany must focus on improving integration and training for its existing migrant population .
" we can not afford to lose any talent , " she stressed .
according to the statistics , some 15 million people in germany have immigrated since 1950 or have at least one immigrant parent .
about 50 percent of them have german citizenship .
" we must significantly improve the educational situation of young migrants , " she said .
böhmer pointed to a series of measures included in the national integration plan , such as early language coaching in kindergartens and schools , ease of access to study grants for migrant teenagers and improved teacher training .
" we need more teachers from a migrant background , " she added .
the national integration plan was agreed in the summer at an integration summit attended by immigrant organizations , charities , business associations and representatives from various levels of government .

" german language skills are not enough to safeguard against discrimination in the education system and against unemployment . "
in her speech presenting the report , böhmer also said that there had to be improved acceptance of qualifications gained abroad .
she said there were some half a million foreigners in germany with degrees , but who unable to work in their professions because their credentials were not recognized .
" we are squandering potential here , " she criticized .

"
they show that only 23 percent of children of non-german origin embarked on an apprenticeship , compared to 57 percent of their native german counterparts .
böhmer said the situation had worsened in comparison to the mid-1990s , when the figure was around 34 percent .
she added that the continuation of the negative trend despite the recent economic upturn should be regarded as an " alarm signal . "
and , some 40 percent of migrants had no professional qualifications at all .
immigrants from italy , greece and turkey had the poorest records in this respect .
some 72 percent of turkish immigrants had no job training at all .
around one in five do not have any qualifications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , it 's difficult to get a job without having completed a traineeship the report also revealed that some 17.5 percent of children of non-german origin finish school without any educational qualifications .
the risk of becoming unemployed is twice as high among migrants - a fact böhmer blamed chiefly on this lack of education and training .
the integration minister said that rather than encouraging the migration of skilled workers into europe to ease labor shortages , germany must focus on improving integration and training for its existing migrant population .
" we can not afford to lose any talent , " she stressed .
according to the statistics , some 15 million people in germany have immigrated since 1950 or have at least one immigrant parent .
about 50 percent of them have german citizenship .
" we must significantly improve the educational situation of young migrants , " she said .
böhmer pointed to a series of measures included in the national integration plan , such as early language coaching in kindergartens and schools , ease of access to study grants for migrant teenagers and improved teacher training .
" we need more teachers from a migrant background , " she added .
the national integration plan was agreed in the summer at an integration summit attended by immigrant organizations , charities , business associations and representatives from various levels of government .

" german language skills are not enough to safeguard against discrimination in the education system and against unemployment . "
in her speech presenting the report , böhmer also said that there had to be improved acceptance of qualifications gained abroad .
she said there were some half a million foreigners in germany with degrees , but who unable to work in their professions because their credentials were not recognized .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 20.12.2007 germany moves to mend gaps in child safety net großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctor 's visits wo n't be optional for young children horrified by recent cases of infanticide , germany wants mandatory doctor visits and is debating adding constitutional protections for children .
in children 's rights , germany has lagged behind other european countries . recent news stories of mothers arrested for killing their children have pointed out the holes in germany 's child welfare safety net . germany 's chancellor angela merkel called for taking a dual approach to protecting children .
parents need more support , she said .
yet there 's also a need for better monitoring to make sure children are not left in an abusive situation . doctor 's visits for young children should become mandatory across the country , politicians decided at an emergency meeting merkel called to discuss the topic on wednesday , dec .
19 . merkel , who heads the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , met with state and local officials responsible for child welfare under germany 's federal system . the doctor visits are envisioned as part of an early warning system to help detect possible abuse . " the risks for children must be detected early in order to establish a help net for at-risk children , " said family minister ursula von der leyen -lrb- cdu -rrb- . seeking constitutional protection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all children have loving parents for the moment , children 's rights wo n't be specifically enshrined in the constitution , as germany 's social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- had hoped . mentioning children specifically in the constitution would ensure that both the legislature and the courts weighed child welfare carefully when making every decision , said germany 's justice minister brigitte zypries of the spd . the cdu rejected the need for additional legal protections beyond the human rights already part of german law , saying they were unnecessary .
roland koch , the premier of hessen who is a member of the cdu , said discussion should focus on how to support local projects which offer practical help to families . children need extra support seventy german children 's rights groups have called for a constitutional change . " it 's very important for children themselves to have their own specific rights , " said mieke schuurman , the secretary general of the european children 's network .
" they are a specific group and they are more vulnerable than adult citizens . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty remains a risk factor for children the european children 's network successfully lobbied for a reference to children 's rights in the european union 's new reform treaty .
the united nations also specifically addresses the issue .
enshrining children 's rights into a constitution provides a legal basis for ensuring that their needs are addressed across the board , schuurman said . of course , words need to be backed up by effective programs and financial support . while there are many local and regional programs focused on helping at-risk mothers and their children , germany is not seen to be leading europe in child welfare issues .
a recent study by unicef 's innocenti research center in florence , italy , put germany solidly in the middle of the pack on dealing with issues such as childhood poverty , health , safety , education and risky behavior . scandinavian countries headed the list of the best countries in europe for children . the next study , due out in spring , will focus on early childhood issues .
in germany , there has been considerable interest at the federal level in early childhood services .
it 's seen as important to breaking the cycle of poverty and for integrating the children of immigrants , said eva jespersen , head of the economic and social policies unit at innocenti . particularly in germany 's decentralized system , it 's extremely important to have a national framework for child rights , jespersen said . " every child within a sovereign state has the same rights , " jespersen said . it 's up to the federal government to ensure that the rights of children are advanced uniformly and address inequalities , she said . recent cases spotlight problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goal is to prevent child abuse on wednesday , dec .
5 , five children aged three to nine were found suffocated in their home in darry , schleswig-holstein .
their mother , who had been undergoing psychiatric treatment , alerted doctors to what had happened . a few days earlier , a 28-year-old woman was arrested on serial murder charges after three newborns were found dead in a small town in saxony .
police said she told interrogators each of her three daughters " died suddenly " soon after birth in 2002 , 2004 and 2005 . between 80 and 100 children die in germany each year from neglect and abuse , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported .
and child abuse numbers are also rising , although it 's unclear whether actual incidents have increased or whether people are more likely to report suspected abuse than in the past . authorities removed about 170,000 children and teenagers from their parents ' homes in 2006 and placed them in state care . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de time to stop ignoring social ills , says merkel one day after five boys were apparently murdered by their mother , the bodies of a young woman and her baby were found in a berlin apartment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 20.12.2007 germany moves to mend gaps in child safety net großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctor 's visits wo n't be optional for young children horrified by recent cases of infanticide , germany wants mandatory doctor visits and is debating adding constitutional protections for children .
in children 's rights , germany has lagged behind other european countries . recent news stories of mothers arrested for killing their children have pointed out the holes in germany 's child welfare safety net . germany 's chancellor angela merkel called for taking a dual approach to protecting children .
parents need more support , she said .
yet there 's also a need for better monitoring to make sure children are not left in an abusive situation . doctor 's visits for young children should become mandatory across the country , politicians decided at an emergency meeting merkel called to discuss the topic on wednesday , dec .
19 . merkel , who heads the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , met with state and local officials responsible for child welfare under germany 's federal system . the doctor visits are envisioned as part of an early warning system to help detect possible abuse . " the risks for children must be detected early in order to establish a help net for at-risk children , " said family minister ursula von der leyen -lrb- cdu -rrb- . seeking constitutional protection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all children have loving parents for the moment , children 's rights wo n't be specifically enshrined in the constitution , as germany 's social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- had hoped . mentioning children specifically in the constitution would ensure that both the legislature and the courts weighed child welfare carefully when making every decision , said germany 's justice minister brigitte zypries of the spd . the cdu rejected the need for additional legal protections beyond the human rights already part of german law , saying they were unnecessary .
roland koch , the premier of hessen who is a member of the cdu , said discussion should focus on how to support local projects which offer practical help to families . children need extra support seventy german children 's rights groups have called for a constitutional change . " it 's very important for children themselves to have their own specific rights , " said mieke schuurman , the secretary general of the european children 's network .
" they are a specific group and they are more vulnerable than adult citizens . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty remains a risk factor for children the european children 's network successfully lobbied for a reference to children 's rights in the european union 's new reform treaty .
the united nations also specifically addresses the issue .
enshrining children 's rights into a constitution provides a legal basis for ensuring that their needs are addressed across the board , schuurman said . of course , words need to be backed up by effective programs and financial support . while there are many local and regional programs focused on helping at-risk mothers and their children , germany is not seen to be leading europe in child welfare issues .
a recent study by unicef 's innocenti research center in florence , italy , put germany solidly in the middle of the pack on dealing with issues such as childhood poverty , health , safety , education and risky behavior . scandinavian countries headed the list of the best countries in europe for children . the next study , due out in spring , will focus on early childhood issues .
in germany , there has been considerable interest at the federal level in early childhood services .
it 's seen as important to breaking the cycle of poverty and for integrating the children of immigrants , said eva jespersen , head of the economic and social policies unit at innocenti . particularly in germany 's decentralized system , it 's extremely important to have a national framework for child rights , jespersen said . " every child within a sovereign state has the same rights , " jespersen said . it 's up to the federal government to ensure that the rights of children are advanced uniformly and address inequalities , she said . recent cases spotlight problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goal is to prevent child abuse on wednesday , dec .
5 , five children aged three to nine were found suffocated in their home in darry , schleswig-holstein .
their mother , who had been undergoing psychiatric treatment , alerted doctors to what had happened . a few days earlier , a 28-year-old woman was arrested on serial murder charges after three newborns were found dead in a small town in saxony .
police said she told interrogators each of her three daughters " died suddenly " soon after birth in 2002 , 2004 and 2005 . between 80 and 100 children die in germany each year from neglect and abuse , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported .
and child abuse numbers are also rising , although it 's unclear whether actual incidents have increased or whether people are more likely to report suspected abuse than in the past . authorities removed about 170,000 children and teenagers from their parents ' homes in 2006 and placed them in state care . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to the study , more than 44 percent of muslims also believe that they will be granted entry to paradise if they die defending their religion .
a total of 1,750 muslims were interviewed for the study about their attitudes towards democracy , aquiring language skills , education and readiness to resort to violence .
troubling findings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aftermath of a suicide bombing in baghdad the majority of those who took part in the survey , however , said they did not condone the use of violence in the name of religion .
at least 80 percent reject the idea of suicide bombings , with 8.7 percent claiming such attacks are cowardly and damaging for islam .
researchers also concluded that 14 percent of germany 's islamic inhabitants dispayed a problematic attitude towards democracy .
twelve percent were highly critical of western society while simultaneously approving corporal punishment and even the death penalty .
schäuble told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that the findings showed a " serious potential for islamic radicalisation . "

ministers from some southern european countries , including france , opposed the measure . the practice of adding sugar to wine is a century-old tradition used in northern climates that lack the sunshine to develop a sufficient amount of natural sugars that later ferment into alcohol . both the german government and german winemakers were positive about the outcome germany 's agriculture minister horst seehofer said the compromise " will ensure that the future of our quality wines lies in its variety . " a spokesperson from the german winemakers association was more reserved calling the compromise " more light than shadow . " europe still number one bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe remains the world 's largest wine producer europe produces more than 60 percent of the world 's wine but over the past decade imports have risen while exports have stagnated . part of the agreement will be the abolishment of eu subsidies , a policy that has led to overproduction and to so-called " wine lakes " - the term used to refer to europe 's vast supply unsold wine . instead , the eu will use the money to promote european wines in developing markets such as india and china as well as more traditional markets in the us and britain . " instead of spending much of our budget getting rid of unwanted surpluses , we can now concentrate on taking on our competitors and winning back market share , " said mariann fischer boel , commissioner for agriculture and rural development . dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new signatories of the schengen treaty , named after the luxembourg border village where the no-frontiers pact was born in 1985 , will join the current 15 members in enjoying the benefits of deregulated cross-border movement .
it 's a bit like an early christmas present at a peak travel time - some 400 million europeans will be able to travel by road , rail and ship with increased ease .
after two years of preparation , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia , and slovenia will join the oldest eu states - britain and the republic of ireland excluded - plus iceland and norway in the extended zone pushing the area 's outmost borders hundreds of kilometers eastwards .
the expansion is expected to continue with cyprus and switzerland planning to sign on soon .
london and dublin prefer to remain outside and keep their own visa regimes , rather than the " one visa for all " policy that applies to the schengen countries .
as well as having border controls removed , the nine signatories will also see travel document checks abolished at their airports in march .
all border controls can be re-established temporarily in case of emergency , for security reasons or when people move en-masse , such as for sporting events .
new border , new responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officers will pass border duties to polish cops in return for free-movement , the new countries will be obliged to provide data to the schengen information system -lrb- sis -rrb- so police and customs officers can access information about people , vehicles and goods .
the nine signatories will also sign up to new measures which will allow extended police and judicial cooperation including cross-border surveillance and the " hot pursuit " of suspects across frontiers . internal freedom within the schengen zone will also lead to tightened security on its new eastern reaches , placing increased responsibilities on its latest members .
celebrations to mark the extension of the schengen agreement were planned along the newly opened borders .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso and justice commissioner franco frattini will be there as the barriers come down .
" we will live and circulate in an area of 24 countries without internal borders .
this is a unique and historic accomplishment , " barroso said on tuesday .
" the lifting of the european union 's internal borders brings opportunities for people living , circulating and doing business in europe , " he said .
a cause for celebration the festivities began early thursday on the slovakia-austria border , one of the many locations which marked the outer boundaries of europe 's east-west divide , when slovak premier robert fico and austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer sawed through a border post on their common frontier on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of the slovak-austrian border is symbolically marked the symbolic gesture took place at the crossing point between berg in austria and petrzalka in slovakia and was aided by slovak president ivan gasparovic .
concerts , fireworks and even a disco evening at the petrzalka-berg crossing on the slovak-austrian frontier will mark the occasion .
" we are standing here at the border between bratislava and vienna to take away the most important symbolic barrier , " said slovak premier fico .
" from midnight tonight , you can travel 4,000 kilometers -lrb- 2,485 miles -rrb- from tallinn in estonia to lisbon in portugal without any border controls . "
the austrian and slovak capitals are europe 's closest , just 40 kilometers apart .
austrian leader gusenbauer focused on the final days of the iron curtain 's legacy .
" it 's an historic occasion following the destruction by the first and second world wars and the division of our continent by the iron curtain . "
" free borders in a free europe : who would have dared to even dream of that in 1985 , " he added .
slovak president gasparovic , sipping champagne under a european flag bearing the slogan ' christmas without borders , ' said , " i propose a toast that this frontier never be closed again . "
a zone of security schengen " is not about criminality , it is not about insecurity or fear .
it is a bigger zone of peace , security and stability , " said gusenbauer .
the austrian chancellor was echoing the words of european parliament president hans-gert pöttering who focused on the security aspects of the expanded schengen zone at the summit for eu leaders in brussels last week .
" it is a visible sign that the former divisions in europe , the borders on the ground and in people 's minds , are being overcome , " he said .
" this will lead to greater freedom and security , not only for the citizens of the nine future schengen countries , but also for the european union as a whole . "
border residents fear crime wave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as one barrier is lifted , many more are erected however , not everyone is convinced .
polls in germany and austria show that many people are concerned that the schengen zone 's expansion east will spark a " made-in-eastern europe " crime wave .
one survey shows that around 59 percent of former east germans view schengen 's expansion negatively with local media reporting a boom in house alarms and reinforced doors .
in ebersbach , a small town of 8,500 in former east germany on the czech border , the concern is evident in the barbed wire stretched over house windows and the newly-formed residents ' border security association .
in austria , a poll by orf public television put the number of those opposed to the border deregulation at 75 percent .
one austrian town , deutschkreutz which lies a few kilometers from the hungarian border , is even planning to hire a private security firm to patrol the streets .
the concern is also felt on the other side of the border .
" it will allow more criminals to come , for example from austria , mostly from the turkish minority and from former yugoslavia , " ondrej kralik , a slovak policeman who has worked 11 years at various border crossing points told news agency afp . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

polls in germany and austria show that many people are concerned that the schengen zone 's expansion east will spark a " made-in-eastern europe " crime wave .
one survey shows that around 59 percent of former east germans view schengen 's expansion negatively with local media reporting a boom in house alarms and reinforced doors .
in ebersbach , a small town of 8,500 in former east germany on the czech border , the concern is evident in the barbed wire stretched over house windows and the newly-formed residents ' border security association .
in austria , a poll by orf public television put the number of those opposed to the border deregulation at 75 percent .

the new signatories of the schengen treaty , named after the luxembourg border village where the no-frontiers pact was born in 1985 , will join the current 15 members in enjoying the benefits of deregulated cross-border movement .
it 's a bit like an early christmas present at a peak travel time - some 400 million europeans will be able to travel by road , rail and ship with increased ease .
after two years of preparation , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia , and slovenia will join the oldest eu states - britain and the republic of ireland excluded - plus iceland and norway in the extended zone pushing the area 's outmost borders hundreds of kilometers eastwards .
the expansion is expected to continue with cyprus and switzerland planning to sign on soon .
london and dublin prefer to remain outside and keep their own visa regimes , rather than the " one visa for all " policy that applies to the schengen countries .

the nine signatories will also sign up to new measures which will allow extended police and judicial cooperation including cross-border surveillance and the " hot pursuit " of suspects across frontiers . internal freedom within the schengen zone will also lead to tightened security on its new eastern reaches , placing increased responsibilities on its latest members .
celebrations to mark the extension of the schengen agreement were planned along the newly opened borders .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso and justice commissioner franco frattini will be there as the barriers come down .
" we will live and circulate in an area of 24 countries without internal borders .
this is a unique and historic accomplishment , " barroso said on tuesday .
" the lifting of the european union 's internal borders brings opportunities for people living , circulating and doing business in europe , " he said .
a cause for celebration the festivities began early thursday on the slovakia-austria border , one of the many locations which marked the outer boundaries of europe 's east-west divide , when slovak premier robert fico and austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer sawed through a border post on their common frontier on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening of the slovak-austrian border is symbolically marked the symbolic gesture took place at the crossing point between berg in austria and petrzalka in slovakia and was aided by slovak president ivan gasparovic .
concerts , fireworks and even a disco evening at the petrzalka-berg crossing on the slovak-austrian frontier will mark the occasion .
" we are standing here at the border between bratislava and vienna to take away the most important symbolic barrier , " said slovak premier fico .
" from midnight tonight , you can travel 4,000 kilometers -lrb- 2,485 miles -rrb- from tallinn in estonia to lisbon in portugal without any border controls . "
the austrian and slovak capitals are europe 's closest , just 40 kilometers apart .
austrian leader gusenbauer focused on the final days of the iron curtain 's legacy .
" it 's an historic occasion following the destruction by the first and second world wars and the division of our continent by the iron curtain . "
" free borders in a free europe : who would have dared to even dream of that in 1985 , " he added .
slovak president gasparovic , sipping champagne under a european flag bearing the slogan ' christmas without borders , ' said , " i propose a toast that this frontier never be closed again . "

"
they show that only 23 percent of children of non-german origin embarked on an apprenticeship , compared to 57 percent of their native german counterparts .
böhmer said the situation had worsened in comparison to the mid-1990s , when the figure was around 34 percent .
she added that the continuation of the negative trend despite the recent economic upturn should be regarded as an " alarm signal . "
and , some 40 percent of migrants had no professional qualifications at all .
immigrants from italy , greece and turkey had the poorest records in this respect .
some 72 percent of turkish immigrants had no job training at all .
around one in five do not have any qualifications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , it 's difficult to get a job without having completed a traineeship the report also revealed that some 17.5 percent of children of non-german origin finish school without any educational qualifications .
the risk of becoming unemployed is twice as high among migrants - a fact böhmer blamed chiefly on this lack of education and training .
the integration minister said that rather than encouraging the migration of skilled workers into europe to ease labor shortages , germany must focus on improving integration and training for its existing migrant population .
" we can not afford to lose any talent , " she stressed .
according to the statistics , some 15 million people in germany have immigrated since 1950 or have at least one immigrant parent .
about 50 percent of them have german citizenship .
" we must significantly improve the educational situation of young migrants , " she said .
böhmer pointed to a series of measures included in the national integration plan , such as early language coaching in kindergartens and schools , ease of access to study grants for migrant teenagers and improved teacher training .
" we need more teachers from a migrant background , " she added .
the national integration plan was agreed in the summer at an integration summit attended by immigrant organizations , charities , business associations and representatives from various levels of government .

" german language skills are not enough to safeguard against discrimination in the education system and against unemployment . "
in her speech presenting the report , böhmer also said that there had to be improved acceptance of qualifications gained abroad .
she said there were some half a million foreigners in germany with degrees , but who unable to work in their professions because their credentials were not recognized .
" we are squandering potential here , " she criticized .

"
they show that only 23 percent of children of non-german origin embarked on an apprenticeship , compared to 57 percent of their native german counterparts .
böhmer said the situation had worsened in comparison to the mid-1990s , when the figure was around 34 percent .
she added that the continuation of the negative trend despite the recent economic upturn should be regarded as an " alarm signal . "
and , some 40 percent of migrants had no professional qualifications at all .
immigrants from italy , greece and turkey had the poorest records in this respect .
some 72 percent of turkish immigrants had no job training at all .
around one in five do not have any qualifications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , it 's difficult to get a job without having completed a traineeship the report also revealed that some 17.5 percent of children of non-german origin finish school without any educational qualifications .
the risk of becoming unemployed is twice as high among migrants - a fact böhmer blamed chiefly on this lack of education and training .
the integration minister said that rather than encouraging the migration of skilled workers into europe to ease labor shortages , germany must focus on improving integration and training for its existing migrant population .
" we can not afford to lose any talent , " she stressed .
according to the statistics , some 15 million people in germany have immigrated since 1950 or have at least one immigrant parent .
about 50 percent of them have german citizenship .
" we must significantly improve the educational situation of young migrants , " she said .
böhmer pointed to a series of measures included in the national integration plan , such as early language coaching in kindergartens and schools , ease of access to study grants for migrant teenagers and improved teacher training .
" we need more teachers from a migrant background , " she added .
the national integration plan was agreed in the summer at an integration summit attended by immigrant organizations , charities , business associations and representatives from various levels of government .

" german language skills are not enough to safeguard against discrimination in the education system and against unemployment . "
in her speech presenting the report , böhmer also said that there had to be improved acceptance of qualifications gained abroad .
she said there were some half a million foreigners in germany with degrees , but who unable to work in their professions because their credentials were not recognized .

in children 's rights , germany has lagged behind other european countries . recent news stories of mothers arrested for killing their children have pointed out the holes in germany 's child welfare safety net . germany 's chancellor angela merkel called for taking a dual approach to protecting children .
parents need more support , she said .
yet there 's also a need for better monitoring to make sure children are not left in an abusive situation . doctor 's visits for young children should become mandatory across the country , politicians decided at an emergency meeting merkel called to discuss the topic on wednesday , dec .
19 . merkel , who heads the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , met with state and local officials responsible for child welfare under germany 's federal system . the doctor visits are envisioned as part of an early warning system to help detect possible abuse . " the risks for children must be detected early in order to establish a help net for at-risk children , " said family minister ursula von der leyen -lrb- cdu -rrb- . seeking constitutional protection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all children have loving parents for the moment , children 's rights wo n't be specifically enshrined in the constitution , as germany 's social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- had hoped . mentioning children specifically in the constitution would ensure that both the legislature and the courts weighed child welfare carefully when making every decision , said germany 's justice minister brigitte zypries of the spd . the cdu rejected the need for additional legal protections beyond the human rights already part of german law , saying they were unnecessary .
roland koch , the premier of hessen who is a member of the cdu , said discussion should focus on how to support local projects which offer practical help to families . children need extra support seventy german children 's rights groups have called for a constitutional change . " it 's very important for children themselves to have their own specific rights , " said mieke schuurman , the secretary general of the european children 's network .
" they are a specific group and they are more vulnerable than adult citizens . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty remains a risk factor for children the european children 's network successfully lobbied for a reference to children 's rights in the european union 's new reform treaty .
the united nations also specifically addresses the issue .
enshrining children 's rights into a constitution provides a legal basis for ensuring that their needs are addressed across the board , schuurman said . of course , words need to be backed up by effective programs and financial support . while there are many local and regional programs focused on helping at-risk mothers and their children , germany is not seen to be leading europe in child welfare issues .
a recent study by unicef 's innocenti research center in florence , italy , put germany solidly in the middle of the pack on dealing with issues such as childhood poverty , health , safety , education and risky behavior . scandinavian countries headed the list of the best countries in europe for children . the next study , due out in spring , will focus on early childhood issues .
in germany , there has been considerable interest at the federal level in early childhood services .
it 's seen as important to breaking the cycle of poverty and for integrating the children of immigrants , said eva jespersen , head of the economic and social policies unit at innocenti . particularly in germany 's decentralized system , it 's extremely important to have a national framework for child rights , jespersen said . " every child within a sovereign state has the same rights , " jespersen said . it 's up to the federal government to ensure that the rights of children are advanced uniformly and address inequalities , she said . recent cases spotlight problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goal is to prevent child abuse on wednesday , dec .
5 , five children aged three to nine were found suffocated in their home in darry , schleswig-holstein .
their mother , who had been undergoing psychiatric treatment , alerted doctors to what had happened . a few days earlier , a 28-year-old woman was arrested on serial murder charges after three newborns were found dead in a small town in saxony .
police said she told interrogators each of her three daughters " died suddenly " soon after birth in 2002 , 2004 and 2005 . between 80 and 100 children die in germany each year from neglect and abuse , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported .
and child abuse numbers are also rising , although it 's unclear whether actual incidents have increased or whether people are more likely to report suspected abuse than in the past . authorities removed about 170,000 children and teenagers from their parents ' homes in 2006 and placed them in state care . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she added that the continuation of the negative trend despite the recent economic upturn should be regarded as an " alarm signal . "

the integration minister said that rather than encouraging the migration of skilled workers into europe to ease labor shortages , germany must focus on improving integration and training for its existing migrant population .

böhmer pointed to a series of measures included in the national integration plan , such as early language coaching in kindergartens and schools , ease of access to study grants for migrant teenagers and improved teacher training .

in children 's rights , germany has lagged behind other european countries . recent news stories of mothers arrested for killing their children have pointed out the holes in germany 's child welfare safety net . germany 's chancellor angela merkel called for taking a dual approach to protecting children .
parents need more support , she said .
yet there 's also a need for better monitoring to make sure children are not left in an abusive situation . doctor 's visits for young children should become mandatory across the country , politicians decided at an emergency meeting merkel called to discuss the topic on wednesday , dec .
19 . merkel , who heads the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , met with state and local officials responsible for child welfare under germany 's federal system . the doctor visits are envisioned as part of an early warning system to help detect possible abuse . " the risks for children must be detected early in order to establish a help net for at-risk children , " said family minister ursula von der leyen -lrb- cdu -rrb- . seeking constitutional protection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all children have loving parents for the moment , children 's rights wo n't be specifically enshrined in the constitution , as germany 's social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- had hoped . mentioning children specifically in the constitution would ensure that both the legislature and the courts weighed child welfare carefully when making every decision , said germany 's justice minister brigitte zypries of the spd . the cdu rejected the need for additional legal protections beyond the human rights already part of german law , saying they were unnecessary .
roland koch , the premier of hessen who is a member of the cdu , said discussion should focus on how to support local projects which offer practical help to families . children need extra support seventy german children 's rights groups have called for a constitutional change .

the united nations also specifically addresses the issue .
enshrining children 's rights into a constitution provides a legal basis for ensuring that their needs are addressed across the board , schuurman said . of course , words need to be backed up by effective programs and financial support . while there are many local and regional programs focused on helping at-risk mothers and their children , germany is not seen to be leading europe in child welfare issues .
a recent study by unicef 's innocenti research center in florence , italy , put germany solidly in the middle of the pack on dealing with issues such as childhood poverty , health , safety , education and risky behavior . scandinavian countries headed the list of the best countries in europe for children . the next study , due out in spring , will focus on early childhood issues .
in germany , there has been considerable interest at the federal level in early childhood services .
it 's seen as important to breaking the cycle of poverty and for integrating the children of immigrants , said eva jespersen , head of the economic and social policies unit at innocenti . particularly in germany 's decentralized system , it 's extremely important to have a national framework for child rights , jespersen said . " every child within a sovereign state has the same rights , " jespersen said . it 's up to the federal government to ensure that the rights of children are advanced uniformly and address inequalities , she said . recent cases spotlight problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the goal is to prevent child abuse on wednesday , dec .
5 , five children aged three to nine were found suffocated in their home in darry , schleswig-holstein .
their mother , who had been undergoing psychiatric treatment , alerted doctors to what had happened . a few days earlier , a 28-year-old woman was arrested on serial murder charges after three newborns were found dead in a small town in saxony .
police said she told interrogators each of her three daughters " died suddenly " soon after birth in 2002 , 2004 and 2005 . between 80 and 100 children die in germany each year from neglect and abuse , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported .
and child abuse numbers are also rising , although it 's unclear whether actual incidents have increased or whether people are more likely to report suspected abuse than in the past . authorities removed about 170,000 children and teenagers from their parents ' homes in 2006 and placed them in state care . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the exercise is taking place between 20 and 28 december in china 's south-western province of yunnan .
it involves a company - just over 100 officers and men - from each side .
india and china fought a brief but bloody border war in 1962 and observers say the largely symbolic exercise is to boost historically frosty relations .
the bbc 's sanjoy majumder in delhi says after years of mistrust both sides are beginning to benefit from increased trade and their governments are coming under increasing pressure from business leaders to improve ties .
' three evil forces ' " the joint training is aimed at enhancing understanding and mutual trust between chinese and indian armies and strengthening their exchanges in the anti-terror areas , " a statement issued by the foreign office of the chinese ministry of national defence said .
indian troops have a long-standing border dispute with china " it is also aimed at deterring the ' three evil forces ' - separatists , extremists and terrorists - and promoting the strategic partnership for peace and prosperity between china and india . "
indian troops taking part have been picked from forces fighting insurgencies in restive north-eastern india and indian-administered kashmir , reports said .
indian forces are carrying their personal weapons , light machine guns and mortars .
the armoury - tanks , helicopter gunships and unmanned aerial vehicles - are being provided by the chinese army .
analysts say the exercise will bolster ties between the two countries .
" it will definitely help strengthen the mutual trust between the two countries , and the militaries in particular , given that they have an episode of unpleasant history , " sun shihai , a research fellow at the chinese academy of social sciences told the bbc .
swaran singh , associate professor at the school of international studies at delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university , said : " this reflects the growing mutual trust and understanding between the two sides , including between their military establishments . "
' intrusions ' ties between the two countries remained tense after the brief war in 1962 .
during an indian high altitude military exercise called operation chequerboard in 1987 , the two armies nearly went to war again .
in between , both sides patrolled the desolate frontier aggressively and skirmishes were not infrequent .
the situation eased after the two countries signed a treaty for peace and tranquillity in 1993 , agreeing to reduce troop levels on the borders .
india and china signed an agreement on defence cooperation in may 2006 during the visit of former indian defence minister pranab mukherjee to china .
since then the two countries have been sending officers to each other 's military institutions for training , and military delegations have been visiting each other on a regular basis .
last year , china agreed to reopen the strategic nathu la pass to border trade , thereby accepting sikkim as a part of india .
around 100 indian soldiers are taking part but in the last year china appeared to be uncomfortable with india 's growing strategic ties with the us , cemented through a series of joint exercises , including the huge five-nation naval exercise in the bay of bengal , this year .
in recent months , indian forces reported more and more chinese " intrusions " across the disputed border even as beijing stepped up its rhetoric over the disputed frontier , reiterating its claims to the north-east indian state of arunachal pradesh .
analysts say the visit of india 's governing congress party chief sonia gandhi to china last month has helped put bilateral relations back on the right track .
for its part , china , a long-term ally of pakistan , appears no longer to object to india 's civilian nuclear deal with the us .
but other sources of suspicion remain , among them china 's influence in india 's neighbour burma and india 's hosting of the exiled tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama .

the exercise is taking place between 20 and 28 december in china 's south-western province of yunnan .
it involves a company - just over 100 officers and men - from each side .
india and china fought a brief but bloody border war in 1962 and observers say the largely symbolic exercise is to boost historically frosty relations .
the bbc 's sanjoy majumder in delhi says after years of mistrust both sides are beginning to benefit from increased trade and their governments are coming under increasing pressure from business leaders to improve ties .
' three evil forces ' " the joint training is aimed at enhancing understanding and mutual trust between chinese and indian armies and strengthening their exchanges in the anti-terror areas , " a statement issued by the foreign office of the chinese ministry of national defence said .
indian troops have a long-standing border dispute with china " it is also aimed at deterring the ' three evil forces ' - separatists , extremists and terrorists - and promoting the strategic partnership for peace and prosperity between china and india . "
indian troops taking part have been picked from forces fighting insurgencies in restive north-eastern india and indian-administered kashmir , reports said .
indian forces are carrying their personal weapons , light machine guns and mortars .
the armoury - tanks , helicopter gunships and unmanned aerial vehicles - are being provided by the chinese army .
analysts say the exercise will bolster ties between the two countries .
" it will definitely help strengthen the mutual trust between the two countries , and the militaries in particular , given that they have an episode of unpleasant history , " sun shihai , a research fellow at the chinese academy of social sciences told the bbc .
swaran singh , associate professor at the school of international studies at delhi 's jawaharlal nehru university , said : " this reflects the growing mutual trust and understanding between the two sides , including between their military establishments . "
' intrusions ' ties between the two countries remained tense after the brief war in 1962 .
during an indian high altitude military exercise called operation chequerboard in 1987 , the two armies nearly went to war again .
in between , both sides patrolled the desolate frontier aggressively and skirmishes were not infrequent .
the situation eased after the two countries signed a treaty for peace and tranquillity in 1993 , agreeing to reduce troop levels on the borders .
india and china signed an agreement on defence cooperation in may 2006 during the visit of former indian defence minister pranab mukherjee to china .
since then the two countries have been sending officers to each other 's military institutions for training , and military delegations have been visiting each other on a regular basis .
last year , china agreed to reopen the strategic nathu la pass to border trade , thereby accepting sikkim as a part of india .
around 100 indian soldiers are taking part but in the last year china appeared to be uncomfortable with india 's growing strategic ties with the us , cemented through a series of joint exercises , including the huge five-nation naval exercise in the bay of bengal , this year .
in recent months , indian forces reported more and more chinese " intrusions " across the disputed border even as beijing stepped up its rhetoric over the disputed frontier , reiterating its claims to the north-east indian state of arunachal pradesh .
analysts say the visit of india 's governing congress party chief sonia gandhi to china last month has helped put bilateral relations back on the right track .
for its part , china , a long-term ally of pakistan , appears no longer to object to india 's civilian nuclear deal with the us .
but other sources of suspicion remain , among them china 's influence in india 's neighbour burma and india 's hosting of the exiled tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama .

they are not british citizens but all lived in the uk before being held .
who are they and how did they come to be in us detention ?
jamil el-banna jamil el-banna , a mechanic , is a jordanian with refugee status in the uk .
he was detained in cuba in early 2003 following capture in gambia in november 2002 .
the father-of-five has never seen his youngest daughter who was born in april 2003 .
human rights group amnesty argued that the uk was obliged under international refugee law to make representations on his behalf .
mr el-banna 's case was taken up by the brent east mp , sarah teather .
he was also questioned about his links to imprisoned radical muslim cleric abu qatada , but insisted he only met him once in the uk .
it was feared he would face torture if returned to jordan .
he claims he is an " innocent man , " reportedly telling his lawyer in may 2007 : " i 've been here for years and i have never seen a judge .
put me on trial .
just give me a chance . "
he returned to the uk in december and was arrested under a spanish warrant .
omar deghayes libyan-born omar deghayes was granted refugee status with his family in the 1980s .
he grew up in brighton , was privately educated and studied law at british universities .
amnesty international said he wanted to be a human rights lawyer .
but he dropped out of university and travelled to afghanistan , where he married and fathered a son .
he had applied for british citizenship but missed an interview because he was abroad .
mr deghayes was arrested in pakistan shortly after the fall of the taleban and was transferred to cuba .
he was accused of committing terrorist acts against the united states , but his lawyer clive stafford smith says it is a case of mistaken identity .
a chechen terrorist training video purports to show him but mr stafford smith said the man in question was actually abu walid , a saudi who is now dead .
his lawyers claim he has been rendered virtually blind by the use of pepper spray and the gouging of his eye during his detention .
supporters of mr deghayes fought a high profile campaign for his release .
in march 2007 they created a sculpture on brighton beach of nearly 1,740 stones , symbolising each day of his imprisonment .
he returned to the uk in december , where he was arrested under the terrorism act .
it is thought he might be extradited to spain .
abdenour sameur abdenour sameur is an algerian army deserter who came to britain in 1999 .
he was granted refugee status in 2000 .
he lived in south harrow , london .
he was given leave to remain in the uk but travelled to afghanistan because he found it hard to live as a good muslim in britain .
he was arrested in the mountains between pakistan and afghanistan while in the company of a group of arabs .
he was shot in the leg .
mr sameur admitted having prior knowledge of the september 11 attacks although he later said this confession was forced out of him by his us captors who said they would not treat his leg wound .
he said he feared that if he did not confess his leg would have to be amputated .
his lawyers were refused permission to see him .
he returned to the uk in december and was also arrested under the terrorism act on arrival in the country .
shaker abdur-raheem aamer shaker abdur-raheem aamer , originally from saudi arabia , had been living in the uk since 1996 .
he is reported to have travelled to afghanistan in august 2001 to carry out voluntary charity work .
according to amnesty , his wife heard from newspaper reporters in january 2002 that he had been captured .
his first letter from guantanamo bay was dated 16 february 2002 .
he had been applying for citizenship and had indefinite leave to stay in the uk when he was captured .
he lived in london with his wife and three children , all british citizens , and worked as an interpreter for a firm of solicitors .
a fourth child has been born since his capture .
he has never seen her .
he is expected to return to saudi arabia .
binyam mohammed al habashi binyam mohammed al habashi was born in ethiopia but sought asylum in the uk in 1994 and was given leave to remain .
after seven years in the uk he converted to islam .
he travelled to pakistan and afghanistan and allegedly got firearms and explosives training alongside shoe bomber richard reid .
the us authorities claimed he planned to travel to the us , rent several flats in an apartment block and then blow it up with a timing device .
he was arrested by pakistani immigration officials at karachi airport in april 2002 when intending to return to the uk .
he was taken to morocco and says he was tortured for 18 months .
he claimed he was beaten and scalded and had his penis slashed with a scalpel .
he was then sent to guantanamo .
he was among guantanamo detainees to go on hunger strike to protest against the conditions and their lack of access to a judicial review .
he will remain at guantanamo bay .

meet the griffiths family back in 2007 .
life has changed considerably in the griffiths home since they returned from the coal house .
today , shopping bills are lower and you are more likely to hear the sound of the children playing cards or singing than the television .
only sibling rows over the computer have resumed .
the impact of experiencing 1927 life had on the family was evident from the day they travelled home and called to see debra 's mother .
debra said : " we had a chat and our first supper : sausage , mash and peas .
but i was not really hungry .
i 'd adapted to a limited food intake .
" there was this plateful of food in front of you and i thought ' oh my gosh , i 'm not going to eat all of this ' . "
" i really miss looking out of my little window on stack square , watching the sun and the children playing with the animals . "
debra griffiths after four weeks of living on what food they could afford from the grocer and butcher carts , the welsh-speaking griffiths family from ceredigion have reduced their weekly shop to avoid throwing away uneaten food .
like fellow coal house family the cartwrights , another effect has been the flood of people approaching the family wanting to talk about the series .
' chance in a lifetime ' cerdin , 46 , who lost a stone -lrb- 6.4kg -rrb- during his time in the coal house , is stopped daily , including while at work as a fuel lorry driver .
" i do n't mind it , i like it .
we had one chance in a lifetime to do the programme , we might as well make the most of it , " he said .
some viewers , including his own sister , were convinced the families had not had it as tough as it appeared .
he said : " she thought we were going to a b & b every night : a lot of people thought that .
they thought they were giving us food and we had electricity once the cameras stopped rolling . "
once he explains this was not the case , he usually gets a stunned reaction .
missing the cottages three days after leaving stack square in blaenavon , cerdin returned to work and while delivering fuel got a reminder of how popular the programme had been .
he recalled : " i was knocking on a woman 's door and she came out .
it was like she was screaming .
" there i was in yellow coat pouring with rain , covered in oil and she took my photo .
she phoned her husband in work and i had to talk to him . "
although cerdin misses the friendly chat of the daily walk to the mine , as a claustrophobe , he is glad to be working outdoors instead of underground .
by contrast , housewife debra , 40 , is very much missing life as it was 80 years ago .
she said : " i miss my house , i do miss it .
i 've got a lump in my throat talking about it .
i miss it every day .
the peacefulness and calmness .
" i really miss looking out of my little window on stack square , watching the sun and the children playing with the animals .
it was peaceful and safe . "
not that debra has not got plenty to keep her busy , with several engagements thanks to her new-found fame .
she has been invited to events such as christmas fayres , and three speeches are penned in for march at a charity and for the women 's institute .
the couple 's children , steffan , 13 , angharad , 12 and eight-year-old gethin say they have really missed the other children from coal house , but the families have kept in touch .

meet the griffiths family back in 2007 .
life has changed considerably in the griffiths home since they returned from the coal house .
today , shopping bills are lower and you are more likely to hear the sound of the children playing cards or singing than the television .
only sibling rows over the computer have resumed .
the impact of experiencing 1927 life had on the family was evident from the day they travelled home and called to see debra 's mother .
debra said : " we had a chat and our first supper : sausage , mash and peas .
but i was not really hungry .
i 'd adapted to a limited food intake .
" there was this plateful of food in front of you and i thought ' oh my gosh , i 'm not going to eat all of this ' . "
i really miss looking out of my little window on stack square , watching the sun and the children playing with the animals .
debra griffiths after four weeks of living on what food they could afford from the grocer and butcher carts , the welsh-speaking griffiths family from ceredigion have reduced their weekly shop to avoid throwing away uneaten food .
like fellow coal house family the cartwrights , another effect has been the flood of people approaching the family wanting to talk about the series .
' chance in a lifetime ' cerdin , 46 , who lost a stone -lrb- 6.4kg -rrb- during his time in the coal house , is stopped daily , including while at work as a fuel lorry driver .
" i do n't mind it , i like it .
we had one chance in a lifetime to do the programme , we might as well make the most of it , " he said .
some viewers , including his own sister , were convinced the families had not had it as tough as it appeared .
he said : " she thought we were going to a b & b every night : a lot of people thought that .
they thought they were giving us food and we had electricity once the cameras stopped rolling . "
once he explains this was not the case , he usually gets a stunned reaction .
missing the cottages three days after leaving stack square in blaenavon , cerdin returned to work and while delivering fuel got a reminder of how popular the programme had been .
he recalled : " i was knocking on a woman 's door and she came out .
it was like she was screaming .
making a cup of tea in 2007 is a much quicker process for debra " there i was in yellow coat pouring with rain , covered in oil and she took my photo .

although cerdin misses the friendly chat of the daily walk to the mine , as a claustrophobe , he is glad to be working outdoors instead of underground .

remains found in the kashmir region of india suggest the fox-sized mammal is the long-sought land-based ancestor of whales , dolphins and porpoises .
research in nature indicates the animal lived mainly on land but dived into water to escape predators .
whales are known to be descended from land-dwellers but the " missing link " has been a mystery until now .
although indohyus , as it is known , looks nothing like the whales of today , it shares certain anatomical features . "
we 've found the closest extinct relative to whales and it is closer than any living relative " professor hans thewissen the structures of its skull and ear are similar to those of early whales , and like other animals that spend a lot of time in water , it had thickened bones that provided ballast to keep its feet anchored in shallow water .
" we 've found the closest extinct relative to whales and it is closer than any living relative , " said study leader professor hans thewissen of the department of anatomy at northeastern ohio universities college of medicine in ohio , us .
hippo link indohyus belongs to an ancient order of mammals that had two or four toes on each foot .
modern day representatives of the group include camels , pigs , and hippopotamuses .
dna studies show that hippos are in fact closely related to modern whales .
they do not appear in the fossil record , however , until about 15 million years ago , some 35 million years after the cetaceans originated in south asia .
this led professor thewissen and his team to search for an older land-based ancestor that would fill in some of the gaps in our knowledge of the whale 's dramatic evolutionary journey from land to sea .
after seeing loose teeth and fragments of jaw bones found by the late indian geologist a ranga rao some 25 years ago , professor thewissen obtained rock samples from rao 's private collection .
they harboured a treasure trove of complete indohyus fossils , including skulls and leg bones .
dietary clues the stable-oxygen-isotope composition of its teeth suggests the animal spent much of its time in water .
some have assumed that the ancestor of whales first took to the water to feed on fish but the latest evidence suggests otherwise .
" the new model is that initially they were small deer-like animals that took to the water to avoid predators , " professor thewissen told bbc news .
" then they started living in water , and then they switched their diet to become carnivores . "
although the behaviour and habits of indohyus appear somewhat strange , there is a modern day parallel in the african mousedeer -lrb- chevrotain -rrb- .
the mousedeer lives on land , but is known to leap into the water to avoid predators such as eagles .

" we 've found the closest extinct relative to whales and it is closer than any living relative , " said study leader professor hans thewissen of the department of anatomy at northeastern ohio universities college of medicine in ohio , us .
hippo link indohyus belongs to an ancient order of mammals that had two or four toes on each foot .
modern day representatives of the group include camels , pigs , and hippopotamuses .
hans thewissen holding the skull of indohyus dna studies show that hippos are in fact closely related to modern whales .
they do not appear in the fossil record , however , until about 15 million years ago , some 35 million years after the cetaceans originated in south asia .
this led professor thewissen and his team to search for an older land-based ancestor that would fill in some of the gaps in our knowledge of the whale 's dramatic evolutionary journey from land to sea .
after seeing loose teeth and fragments of jaw bones found by the late indian geologist a ranga rao some 25 years ago , professor thewissen obtained rock samples from rao 's private collection .
they harboured a treasure trove of complete indohyus fossils , including skulls and leg bones .
dietary clues the stable-oxygen-isotope composition of its teeth suggests the animal spent much of its time in water .
some have assumed that the ancestor of whales first took to the water to feed on fish but the latest evidence suggests otherwise .
" the new model is that initially they were small deer-like animals that took to the water to avoid predators , " professor thewissen told bbc news .
" then they started living in water , and then they switched their diet to become carnivores . "
although the behaviour and habits of indohyus appear somewhat strange , there is a modern day parallel in the african mousedeer -lrb- chevrotain -rrb- .
the mousedeer lives on land , but is known to leap into the water to avoid predators such as eagles .

torrentspy was taken to court by the motion picture association of america .
a judge made a default ruling in favour of the mpaa after she said the site 's operators had tampered with evidence .
the site had ignored an order to retain server logs and the unique online addresses of computers which traded files using the bittorrent program .
the ruling could have personal privacy implications because the information torrentspy had been told to retain was held in random access memory of computers .
defendants justin bunnell , forrest parker , wes parker and valence media originally had argued that its servers were located in the netherlands and so were protected by dutch law from having to turn over server logs .
' obstreperous ' conduct the judge then asked for information from the ram in their computers but the defendants failed in their attempt to argue the data was temporary and therefore could not be retained .
the defendants ' conduct was " obstreperous , " judge florence-marie cooper wrote in her decision .
" they have engaged in widespread and systematic efforts to destroy evidence and have provided false testimony under oath in a effort to hide evidence of such destruction .
" a substantial number of items of evidence have been destroyed , " she wrote .
" defendants were on notice that this information would be of importance in this case . "
torrentspy 's lawyer ira rothken said his clients had concerns about protecting users ' privacy .
torrentspy is expected to appeal judge cooper 's decision .
a ruling on damages will happen at a later date .
the mpaa , which filed the case against torrentspy in february 2006 , welcomed the ruling .

torrentspy 's lawyer ira rothken said his clients had concerns about protecting users ' privacy .
torrentspy is expected to appeal judge cooper 's decision .

the mpaa , which filed the case against torrentspy in february 2006 , welcomed the ruling .

such an amount would be " part of the ordinary cost of doing business " and not punitive enough , they argued .
the texas city refinery blast killed 15 people and injured 180 others in 2003 .
a report by the us chemical safety board -lrb- csb -rrb- and us justice department blamed management and said that safety procedures were deficient at the plant .
' substantial penalty ' the $ 50m fine was brokered by prosecutors in a plea agreement with bp .
as well as paying the money , bp also agreed to admit a crime in relation to the explosion and be placed on probation for three years .
" the government was unduly and unnecessarily generous in these negotiations , " said the lawyers acting for the victims ' families .
we have apologised for the harm caused by our mistakes bp in a statement to a us court , the lawyers added that " only a very substantial penalty well in excess of $ 50 million would send the message to bp ... that laws of the us are designed to take the profit out of crime " .
as well as asking for the fine level to be rejected , the lawyers also called on bp to be forced to create an ethics and compliance program to monitor the refinery 's operations .
a us district judge is set to make a decision on whether the plea deal is valid in february .
the $ 50m fine was part of a larger agreement for bp to pay $ 373m to settle a number of both criminal and civil charges - including a price manipulation scandal and a pipeline leak in alaska 's prudhoe bay .
bp said that was investing $ 1bn to refurbish the texas city plant , and had paid out more than $ 1.6bn in compensation to victims of the blast and their families .
" we have apologised for the harm caused by our mistakes , " the firm said .
