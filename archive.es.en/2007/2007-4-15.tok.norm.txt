a boycott , wildung said , " would n't bring any significant change , " adding that the last time germany had borrowed a piece from egypt was in 1985 . on sunday , egyptian antiquities supremo zahi hawass told the country 's parliament " -lrb- egypt -rrb- will never again organize antiquities exhibitions in germany if it refuses a request , to be issued next week , to allow the bust of nefertiti to be displayed in egypt for three months . " his comments came after german culture minister bernd neumann refused to allow the bust of nefertiti - renowned as one of history 's great beauties - to be exhibited in egypt because it was too delicate to be transported . " experts have reservations about taking nefertiti on a long trip , which we have to take seriously , " neumann said in reaction to a campaign launched in germany under the title " nefertiti travels " to loan the bust to egypt for a limited period . long history of disagreements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nefertiti 's gaze has fascinated berlin visitors for almost a century cairo and berlin have frequently crossed swords over the limestone bust , which was unearthed by german archaeologists in an artist 's studio on the banks of the nile and taken to germany under a 1913 agreement . it was described by adolf hitler as " a true treasure .

experts are investigating how to set up an early warning system in the mediterranean , but there are still many issues . the giant waves that hit many asian countries in 2004 killed more than 300,000 people , making them one of the worst disasters in recorded history .
since then , there has been a flurry of activity to develop tsunami early warning systems . germany 's national research center for geosciences -lrb- gfz -rrb- is currently installing such a system in indonesia - but it could save lives in other regions as well . ten percent of all tsunamis world-wide occur in the mediterranean .
in 2003 , a two meter -lrb- 6.6 feet -rrb- high tsunami hit the coast of algeria and spain 's balearic islands causing significant damage , but no loss of life .
and back in 1908 , some 75,000 people died when giant waves swept along the sicilian coast . warning system in five or 10 years nearly all tsunamis are caused by underground earthquakes , which typically occur at boundaries between earth 's tectonic plates .
large waves then begin to move through the ocean , away from the earthquake 's epicenter .
tsunamis can be up to 30 meters high and reach speeds of to 1,000 kilometer per hour -lrb- 621 mph -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece and italy are the areas most at risk from a tsunami in the med earthquakes in the mediterranean are mainly caused by the african plate drifting northwards underneath the eurasian plate . " tsunamis could happen at any time , and could be catastrophic " , said jochen zschau , the head of gfz 's earthquake risk department . with 140 million people living along the mediterranean coast , the potential for a disaster is high .
but according to zschau , with so many countries surrounding the mediterranean , coordination of an early warning system is difficult .
he estimates that installing such a system in the region would take five to 10 years . real-time transmission the 45-million-euro -lrb- $ 60.8 million -rrb- gfz project to install early warning buoys in the indian ocean off indonesia is due for completion in 2008 .
the system uses sensors on the ocean floor to detect changes in pressure .
this is sent to a series of buoys on the ocean surface , which , in turn , beam the data by satellite to an observation station .
by using real-time data transmission , tsunamis can be detected more quickly , which gives people more time to flee the oncoming waves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first indonesian tsunami-detecting buoys were installed in november 2005 germany 's federal ministry of education and research , which commissioned the indonesian project , set the condition that the system would also be usable for the atlantic and the mediterranean oceans . " a large part of the early warning system in the indian ocean can be transferred to the mediterranean , " zschau said .
" but of course not all factors are the same , so the system needs to be adjusted for the particular region . " because the mediterranean is a smaller ocean , it takes a tsunami less time to travel from the earthquake 's epicenter to the coast .

beilmann said take-off had gone without a hitch .
the mission took off hours after a rocket-propelled grenade attack near another german base at feisabad .
two grenades had been fired shortly before midnight saturday , a spokesman speaking from the base said .
there were no casualties , although shrapnel fragments had been found on the base .
it was not immediately clear what the target had been .
shooting nothing but pictures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tornados are looking for taliban fighters the tornados , which arrived in afghanistan on april 5 , each carry two high-tech optical cameras along with an infra-red sensor in a pod slung below the fuselage .
their mission is to spy out taliban positions in the southern provinces of helmand , kandahar and uruzgan , where british , canadian and dutch troops are deployed .
under the terms of their six-month mission , they will not fly low- level sorties and will not be used to strike at taliban positions .
some 200 air force personnel are stationed at camp marmal where half the 3,000-strong german military contingent in afghanistan is based .

there are also fears that german forces could increasingly become drawn into combat operations .
most of the german troops in afghanistan are engaged in infrastructure projects with mixed military and civilian provincial reconstruction teams in the relatively peaceful north of the country .

german industry is now looking for new ways to combat product piracy . what 's fake and what 's real ?
looking at the two ipods in customs officer andreas urbaniak 's hand , it 's hard to tell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real or fake ?
but one of the mp3-players is a phoney , said urbaniak .
he and his colleagues at frankfurt airport have seized 20,000 such counterfeit gadgets since last year .
they found most of them in airmail parcels coming in from china . " we estimate that it only costs around two or three euros to produce these gadgets .
when you buy the original , you have to pay a hundred times more , " said the customs officer . piracy up 70 per cent some 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- worth of counterfeit goods have been confiscated at frankfurt airport since january , according to urbaniak , which represents a 70 percent increase over last year . the counterfeit industry hits germany especially hard , said anton börner , president of the german federation of wholesale and foreign trade . " first of all we are a high-wage country and , secondly , we are world champion in exports , " said börner .
" of course the big ones are hit first . " german companies lose 25 billion euros per year as a result of counterfeiting , börner estimates .
but now the industry wants to strike back . tighter controls in place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many pirated goods enter germany via frankfurt airport in a newly launched initiative , german business associations are urging import companies and wholesalers to double-check every product they buy .
his association will provide support , börner says , and help separate the fakes from the originals . the initiative is also backed by the german government , according to bernd pfaffenbach , state secretary in the ministry of economics . " we take these issues very seriously , securing property rights , " pfaffenbach said .
" and we will also take this issue up at the g8 summit in heiligendamm in early june .
we are hopeful that a cooperative approach with china and others involved in these issues might be very fruitful . " neither börner nor pfaffenbach expects product piracy to decrease considerably any time soon .
their goal is to try and curb it until international agreements can be put in place .
until then , customs officers like andreas urbaniak will never be short of work . peter hille -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de intelligence official : chinese snoop on german companies germany 's domestic intelligence service has warned the country 's companies that china is increasingly using electronic espionage to get trade secrets .

experts are investigating how to set up an early warning system in the mediterranean , but there are still many issues . the giant waves that hit many asian countries in 2004 killed more than 300,000 people , making them one of the worst disasters in recorded history .
since then , there has been a flurry of activity to develop tsunami early warning systems . germany 's national research center for geosciences -lrb- gfz -rrb- is currently installing such a system in indonesia - but it could save lives in other regions as well . ten percent of all tsunamis world-wide occur in the mediterranean .
in 2003 , a two meter -lrb- 6.6 feet -rrb- high tsunami hit the coast of algeria and spain 's balearic islands causing significant damage , but no loss of life .
and back in 1908 , some 75,000 people died when giant waves swept along the sicilian coast . warning system in five or 10 years nearly all tsunamis are caused by underground earthquakes , which typically occur at boundaries between earth 's tectonic plates .
large waves then begin to move through the ocean , away from the earthquake 's epicenter .
tsunamis can be up to 30 meters high and reach speeds of to 1,000 kilometer per hour -lrb- 621 mph -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece and italy are the areas most at risk from a tsunami in the med earthquakes in the mediterranean are mainly caused by the african plate drifting northwards underneath the eurasian plate . " tsunamis could happen at any time , and could be catastrophic " , said jochen zschau , the head of gfz 's earthquake risk department . with 140 million people living along the mediterranean coast , the potential for a disaster is high .
but according to zschau , with so many countries surrounding the mediterranean , coordination of an early warning system is difficult .
he estimates that installing such a system in the region would take five to 10 years . real-time transmission the 45-million-euro -lrb- $ 60.8 million -rrb- gfz project to install early warning buoys in the indian ocean off indonesia is due for completion in 2008 .
the system uses sensors on the ocean floor to detect changes in pressure .
this is sent to a series of buoys on the ocean surface , which , in turn , beam the data by satellite to an observation station .
by using real-time data transmission , tsunamis can be detected more quickly , which gives people more time to flee the oncoming waves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first indonesian tsunami-detecting buoys were installed in november 2005 germany 's federal ministry of education and research , which commissioned the indonesian project , set the condition that the system would also be usable for the atlantic and the mediterranean oceans . " a large part of the early warning system in the indian ocean can be transferred to the mediterranean , " zschau said .
" but of course not all factors are the same , so the system needs to be adjusted for the particular region . " because the mediterranean is a smaller ocean , it takes a tsunami less time to travel from the earthquake 's epicenter to the coast .

experts are investigating how to set up an early warning system in the mediterranean , but there are still many issues . the giant waves that hit many asian countries in 2004 killed more than 300,000 people , making them one of the worst disasters in recorded history .
since then , there has been a flurry of activity to develop tsunami early warning systems . germany 's national research center for geosciences -lrb- gfz -rrb- is currently installing such a system in indonesia - but it could save lives in other regions as well . ten percent of all tsunamis world-wide occur in the mediterranean .
in 2003 , a two meter -lrb- 6.6 feet -rrb- high tsunami hit the coast of algeria and spain 's balearic islands causing significant damage , but no loss of life .

" a large part of the early warning system in the indian ocean can be transferred to the mediterranean , " zschau said .
" but of course not all factors are the same , so the system needs to be adjusted for the particular region . " because the mediterranean is a smaller ocean , it takes a tsunami less time to travel from the earthquake 's epicenter to the coast .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.04.2007 communist screening law divides polish society großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public sector workers are obligated to expose their communist pasts poland 's new lustration law has split the country .
it requires more than 700,000 poles to confess as to whether they were communist spies .
it 's high time , the law 's backers say .
critics have dubbed it a political tool . purging the public sector of communists and establishing a " new , morally irreproachable fourth republic " is a central issue for prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski and his law and justice party , the pis .
he fulfilled a campaign promise by pushing the lustration law - as well as garnering the support of the many poles who felt wronged . " lustration " comes from latin and means purification through ceremony or sacrifice .
the term is used in poland and other central and eastern european countries to describe the process of vetting people for collaborating with their countries ' intelligence services under communist rule . over 700,000 polish public and state sector workers - including politicians , civil servants , judges , lawyers , reporters , professors and the heads of state-owned companies - have until may 15 to declare in writing whether they collaborated with the state security apparatus anytime between july 1944 and july 1990 in communist poland .
those who fail to do so , or are proven to have lied in their declarations , could be banned from practicing their profession for up to 10 years , according to the law .
righting wrongs since the communist regime was dissolved in 1989 , numerous high political officials have been exposed as former communist functionaries .
ex-spies who have used insider knowledge to make money repeatedly show up on lists of the richest poles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wielgus resigned when his past became public nor has the clergy been exempt , as exemplified by the resignation and confession of the archbishop-designate of warsaw , stanislaw wielgus , in january .
communist state security files showed he had been a secret agent . poland has been lethargic when it comes to lustration .
before leaving power , the oppositional solidarity trade union agreed with the communists to forget the pre-1989 past .
still , in the 1990s there were attempts to use the courts to track down so-called system opportunists , but they were only limited to a small circle of leading politicians and civil servants .
by now expanding lustration to the entire polish elite , lawmakers are going further than all their post-communist neighbors .
but there are problems . doctored files " the law comes much too late and divides polish society , " said dieter bingen , director of the german polish institute . bingen said it was an honorable concern , since the poles had n't dealt with the problems in the 1990s .
but the approach this time employed the " lawnmower principle , " suggesting cultivation of a culture of suspicion .
also , examining hundreds of thousands of declarations would take years , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the kaczynskis are using the law to target the left that will be the task of the institute of national remembrance -lrb- ipn -rrb- , which has the communist secret service 's files .
but can it trust the papers ? " the materials and documents about secret service activities were often doctored in retrospect , besides being incomplete , " bingen said .
even prime minister kaczynski described his own file as a crudely made fake , he added .
political aims ?
conservative journalists below 40 , in particular , the so-called " young wolves , " have backed radical lustration of society .
others , however , see the law as an instrument to morally discredit anyone who is left of the party of kaczynski and his twin brother , bingen said . the fight between the two sides is especially fierce among poland 's newspapers , whose journalists are also obligated to pen declarations about their pasts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adam michnik 's paper has been fighting the law under its editor-in-chief , former anti-communist dissident adam michnik , the liberal daily gazeta wyborcza has been a leader in the protest against the law .
conservative daily rzeczpospolita is on kaczynski 's side , arguing that as the fourth estate , journalists must also be willing to reveal their pasts . poland 's highest court could overthrow the law in may .
but if it does not , lustration might just have some unpleasant consequences for the right 's ideals of a moral poland .
the law would mainly have an impact on people who were part of the anti-communist opposition , bingen said .
in reality , the opposition was repeatedly forced to deal with secret service agents in one way or another . the possibility " that the reputation of the ' system opposition ' as a whole could suffer damage ca n't be the kaczynski brothers ' intention , " bingen said . andreas leixnering -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland cracks down on liberal media a group of polish journalists are refusing to be screened by the government .

it requires more than 700,000 poles to confess as to whether they were communist spies .
it 's high time , the law 's backers say .
critics have dubbed it a political tool . purging the public sector of communists and establishing a " new , morally irreproachable fourth republic " is a central issue for prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski and his law and justice party , the pis .
he fulfilled a campaign promise by pushing the lustration law - as well as garnering the support of the many poles who felt wronged . " lustration " comes from latin and means purification through ceremony or sacrifice .
the term is used in poland and other central and eastern european countries to describe the process of vetting people for collaborating with their countries ' intelligence services under communist rule . over 700,000 polish public and state sector workers - including politicians , civil servants , judges , lawyers , reporters , professors and the heads of state-owned companies - have until may 15 to declare in writing whether they collaborated with the state security apparatus anytime between july 1944 and july 1990 in communist poland .
those who fail to do so , or are proven to have lied in their declarations , could be banned from practicing their profession for up to 10 years , according to the law .
righting wrongs since the communist regime was dissolved in 1989 , numerous high political officials have been exposed as former communist functionaries .
ex-spies who have used insider knowledge to make money repeatedly show up on lists of the richest poles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wielgus resigned when his past became public nor has the clergy been exempt , as exemplified by the resignation and confession of the archbishop-designate of warsaw , stanislaw wielgus , in january .
communist state security files showed he had been a secret agent . poland has been lethargic when it comes to lustration .
before leaving power , the oppositional solidarity trade union agreed with the communists to forget the pre-1989 past .
still , in the 1990s there were attempts to use the courts to track down so-called system opportunists , but they were only limited to a small circle of leading politicians and civil servants .
by now expanding lustration to the entire polish elite , lawmakers are going further than all their post-communist neighbors .
but there are problems . doctored files " the law comes much too late and divides polish society , " said dieter bingen , director of the german polish institute . bingen said it was an honorable concern , since the poles had n't dealt with the problems in the 1990s .
but the approach this time employed the " lawnmower principle , " suggesting cultivation of a culture of suspicion .
also , examining hundreds of thousands of declarations would take years , he added .

but can it trust the papers ? " the materials and documents about secret service activities were often doctored in retrospect , besides being incomplete , " bingen said .
even prime minister kaczynski described his own file as a crudely made fake , he added .
political aims ?
conservative journalists below 40 , in particular , the so-called " young wolves , " have backed radical lustration of society .
others , however , see the law as an instrument to morally discredit anyone who is left of the party of kaczynski and his twin brother , bingen said . the fight between the two sides is especially fierce among poland 's newspapers , whose journalists are also obligated to pen declarations about their pasts .

conservative daily rzeczpospolita is on kaczynski 's side , arguing that as the fourth estate , journalists must also be willing to reveal their pasts . poland 's highest court could overthrow the law in may .
but if it does not , lustration might just have some unpleasant consequences for the right 's ideals of a moral poland .
the law would mainly have an impact on people who were part of the anti-communist opposition , bingen said .

now counterfeiters are copying more and more hi-tech products , such as microphones , stereo systems and mp3-players .
german industry is looking for new ways to fight back . around two thirds of the fake goods come from asia , harming established brands all over the world .
german industry is now looking for new ways to combat product piracy . what 's fake and what 's real ?
looking at the two ipods in customs officer andreas urbaniak 's hand , it 's hard to tell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real or fake ?
but one of the mp3-players is a phoney , said urbaniak .
he and his colleagues at frankfurt airport have seized 20,000 such counterfeit gadgets since last year .
they found most of them in airmail parcels coming in from china . " we estimate that it only costs around two or three euros to produce these gadgets .
when you buy the original , you have to pay a hundred times more , " said the customs officer . piracy up 70 per cent some 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- worth of counterfeit goods have been confiscated at frankfurt airport since january , according to urbaniak , which represents a 70 percent increase over last year . the counterfeit industry hits germany especially hard , said anton börner , president of the german federation of wholesale and foreign trade . " first of all we are a high-wage country and , secondly , we are world champion in exports , " said börner .
" of course the big ones are hit first . " german companies lose 25 billion euros per year as a result of counterfeiting , börner estimates .
but now the industry wants to strike back . tighter controls in place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many pirated goods enter germany via frankfurt airport in a newly launched initiative , german business associations are urging import companies and wholesalers to double-check every product they buy .
his association will provide support , börner says , and help separate the fakes from the originals . the initiative is also backed by the german government , according to bernd pfaffenbach , state secretary in the ministry of economics . " we take these issues very seriously , securing property rights , " pfaffenbach said .
" and we will also take this issue up at the g8 summit in heiligendamm in early june .
we are hopeful that a cooperative approach with china and others involved in these issues might be very fruitful . " neither börner nor pfaffenbach expects product piracy to decrease considerably any time soon .
their goal is to try and curb it until international agreements can be put in place .
until then , customs officers like andreas urbaniak will never be short of work . peter hille -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de intelligence official : chinese snoop on german companies germany 's domestic intelligence service has warned the country 's companies that china is increasingly using electronic espionage to get trade secrets .

it requires more than 700,000 poles to confess as to whether they were communist spies .
it 's high time , the law 's backers say .
critics have dubbed it a political tool . purging the public sector of communists and establishing a " new , morally irreproachable fourth republic " is a central issue for prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski and his law and justice party , the pis .
he fulfilled a campaign promise by pushing the lustration law - as well as garnering the support of the many poles who felt wronged . " lustration " comes from latin and means purification through ceremony or sacrifice .
the term is used in poland and other central and eastern european countries to describe the process of vetting people for collaborating with their countries ' intelligence services under communist rule . over 700,000 polish public and state sector workers - including politicians , civil servants , judges , lawyers , reporters , professors and the heads of state-owned companies - have until may 15 to declare in writing whether they collaborated with the state security apparatus anytime between july 1944 and july 1990 in communist poland .
those who fail to do so , or are proven to have lied in their declarations , could be banned from practicing their profession for up to 10 years , according to the law .
righting wrongs since the communist regime was dissolved in 1989 , numerous high political officials have been exposed as former communist functionaries .
ex-spies who have used insider knowledge to make money repeatedly show up on lists of the richest poles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wielgus resigned when his past became public nor has the clergy been exempt , as exemplified by the resignation and confession of the archbishop-designate of warsaw , stanislaw wielgus , in january .
communist state security files showed he had been a secret agent . poland has been lethargic when it comes to lustration .
before leaving power , the oppositional solidarity trade union agreed with the communists to forget the pre-1989 past .
still , in the 1990s there were attempts to use the courts to track down so-called system opportunists , but they were only limited to a small circle of leading politicians and civil servants .
by now expanding lustration to the entire polish elite , lawmakers are going further than all their post-communist neighbors .
but there are problems . doctored files " the law comes much too late and divides polish society , " said dieter bingen , director of the german polish institute . bingen said it was an honorable concern , since the poles had n't dealt with the problems in the 1990s .
but the approach this time employed the " lawnmower principle , " suggesting cultivation of a culture of suspicion .
also , examining hundreds of thousands of declarations would take years , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the kaczynskis are using the law to target the left that will be the task of the institute of national remembrance -lrb- ipn -rrb- , which has the communist secret service 's files .
but can it trust the papers ? " the materials and documents about secret service activities were often doctored in retrospect , besides being incomplete , " bingen said .
even prime minister kaczynski described his own file as a crudely made fake , he added .
political aims ?
conservative journalists below 40 , in particular , the so-called " young wolves , " have backed radical lustration of society .
others , however , see the law as an instrument to morally discredit anyone who is left of the party of kaczynski and his twin brother , bingen said . the fight between the two sides is especially fierce among poland 's newspapers , whose journalists are also obligated to pen declarations about their pasts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adam michnik 's paper has been fighting the law under its editor-in-chief , former anti-communist dissident adam michnik , the liberal daily gazeta wyborcza has been a leader in the protest against the law .
conservative daily rzeczpospolita is on kaczynski 's side , arguing that as the fourth estate , journalists must also be willing to reveal their pasts . poland 's highest court could overthrow the law in may .
but if it does not , lustration might just have some unpleasant consequences for the right 's ideals of a moral poland .
the law would mainly have an impact on people who were part of the anti-communist opposition , bingen said .
in reality , the opposition was repeatedly forced to deal with secret service agents in one way or another . the possibility " that the reputation of the ' system opposition ' as a whole could suffer damage ca n't be the kaczynski brothers ' intention , " bingen said . andreas leixnering -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland cracks down on liberal media a group of polish journalists are refusing to be screened by the government .

german industry is now looking for new ways to combat product piracy . what 's fake and what 's real ?
looking at the two ipods in customs officer andreas urbaniak 's hand , it 's hard to tell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real or fake ?
but one of the mp3-players is a phoney , said urbaniak .
he and his colleagues at frankfurt airport have seized 20,000 such counterfeit gadgets since last year .
they found most of them in airmail parcels coming in from china . " we estimate that it only costs around two or three euros to produce these gadgets .
when you buy the original , you have to pay a hundred times more , " said the customs officer . piracy up 70 per cent some 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- worth of counterfeit goods have been confiscated at frankfurt airport since january , according to urbaniak , which represents a 70 percent increase over last year . the counterfeit industry hits germany especially hard , said anton börner , president of the german federation of wholesale and foreign trade . " first of all we are a high-wage country and , secondly , we are world champion in exports , " said börner .
" of course the big ones are hit first . " german companies lose 25 billion euros per year as a result of counterfeiting , börner estimates .
but now the industry wants to strike back . tighter controls in place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many pirated goods enter germany via frankfurt airport in a newly launched initiative , german business associations are urging import companies and wholesalers to double-check every product they buy .
his association will provide support , börner says , and help separate the fakes from the originals . the initiative is also backed by the german government , according to bernd pfaffenbach , state secretary in the ministry of economics . " we take these issues very seriously , securing property rights , " pfaffenbach said .
" and we will also take this issue up at the g8 summit in heiligendamm in early june .
we are hopeful that a cooperative approach with china and others involved in these issues might be very fruitful . " neither börner nor pfaffenbach expects product piracy to decrease considerably any time soon .
their goal is to try and curb it until international agreements can be put in place .
until then , customs officers like andreas urbaniak will never be short of work . peter hille -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de intelligence official : chinese snoop on german companies germany 's domestic intelligence service has warned the country 's companies that china is increasingly using electronic espionage to get trade secrets .

a boycott , wildung said , " would n't bring any significant change , " adding that the last time germany had borrowed a piece from egypt was in 1985 . on sunday , egyptian antiquities supremo zahi hawass told the country 's parliament " -lrb- egypt -rrb- will never again organize antiquities exhibitions in germany if it refuses a request , to be issued next week , to allow the bust of nefertiti to be displayed in egypt for three months . " his comments came after german culture minister bernd neumann refused to allow the bust of nefertiti - renowned as one of history 's great beauties - to be exhibited in egypt because it was too delicate to be transported . " experts have reservations about taking nefertiti on a long trip , which we have to take seriously , " neumann said in reaction to a campaign launched in germany under the title " nefertiti travels " to loan the bust to egypt for a limited period . long history of disagreements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nefertiti 's gaze has fascinated berlin visitors for almost a century cairo and berlin have frequently crossed swords over the limestone bust , which was unearthed by german archaeologists in an artist 's studio on the banks of the nile and taken to germany under a 1913 agreement . it was described by adolf hitler as " a true treasure .

now counterfeiters are copying more and more hi-tech products , such as microphones , stereo systems and mp3-players .

german industry is now looking for new ways to combat product piracy . what 's fake and what 's real ?
looking at the two ipods in customs officer andreas urbaniak 's hand , it 's hard to tell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real or fake ?
but one of the mp3-players is a phoney , said urbaniak .
he and his colleagues at frankfurt airport have seized 20,000 such counterfeit gadgets since last year .
they found most of them in airmail parcels coming in from china . " we estimate that it only costs around two or three euros to produce these gadgets .
when you buy the original , you have to pay a hundred times more , " said the customs officer . piracy up 70 per cent some 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- worth of counterfeit goods have been confiscated at frankfurt airport since january , according to urbaniak , which represents a 70 percent increase over last year . the counterfeit industry hits germany especially hard , said anton börner , president of the german federation of wholesale and foreign trade . " first of all we are a high-wage country and , secondly , we are world champion in exports , " said börner .
" of course the big ones are hit first . " german companies lose 25 billion euros per year as a result of counterfeiting , börner estimates .
but now the industry wants to strike back . tighter controls in place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many pirated goods enter germany via frankfurt airport in a newly launched initiative , german business associations are urging import companies and wholesalers to double-check every product they buy .
his association will provide support , börner says , and help separate the fakes from the originals . the initiative is also backed by the german government , according to bernd pfaffenbach , state secretary in the ministry of economics . " we take these issues very seriously , securing property rights , " pfaffenbach said .
" and we will also take this issue up at the g8 summit in heiligendamm in early june .
we are hopeful that a cooperative approach with china and others involved in these issues might be very fruitful . " neither börner nor pfaffenbach expects product piracy to decrease considerably any time soon .
their goal is to try and curb it until international agreements can be put in place .

he is the man who can beat the frontrunner nicolas sarkozy , according to the polls . when france votes in the first round of the presidential election on april 22 , there will be 12 names on the ballot .
assuming no candidate gets 50 percent of the vote , the top two will then contest a run-off vote on may 6 .
it 's generally assumed that one of those two will be nicolas sarkozy , the former interior minister who has consistently led the opinion polls .
in second place is segolene royal , the socialist mother of four , who has struggled to close the gap with sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just sarko vs sego anymore - bayrou has grabbed the center snapping at royal 's heels is francois bayrou , the centrist leader of the small union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , who emerged , seemingly from nowhere , in mid february , rising to 20 percent in the opinion polls and snatching votes from right and left . most significantly , polling indicates that if he were to edge out royal and make it into the second round , bayrou would beat sarkozy in the run-off . there is only one poll that really counts but in french politics , it does n't do to rely too heavily on the polls .
the world was shocked when the far-right jean-marie le pen edged out his socialist rival to qualify for the run-off in 2002 , a show of support the pollsters had n't predicted .
2007 is widely seen as a " change " election , after 12 years of conservative rule under jacques chirac . according to nicolas sauger , senior researcher at the center for political science research in paris -lrb- cevipof -rrb- , " the 2007 election is characterized by a strange mix of disillusionment , hence the success of francois bayrou who 's an ' anti-system ' candidate , and utopia - with the belief that politics has to reclaim its capacity to change life . " enter bayrou - a 55 year old teacher , academic and politicians who captured the attention of jaded voters with his plans for a unity government , along the lines of germany 's grand coalition , and his aim for a " peaceful revolution " in french politics . it is , says sauger , " a kind of ' populist ' appeal targeting the french middle class . " man of the people , not paris bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 12 years of chirac , france is entering a new era bayrou still lives in his childhood home in the south-western bearn region of france , where his family has farmed for generations .
he continues to breed horses and is keen to stress his humble roots , recently insisting that documentary maker photograph him on the back of a tractor . a devoutly catholic father of six , who married at age 20 and trained as a teacher , he is keen to cultivate his " man of the people " persona in his appeal to voters .
unlike sarkozy and royal , he is not rich and does not pay the " wealth tax , " declaring assets of just 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 811,000 -rrb- . bayrou 's policy platform is based on the slogan of the " six es " - employment , ecology , education , economy , exclusion and europe .
he also champions moderation of spending in a country that has suffered years of high unemployment -lrb- currently 8.6 percent -rrb- and a huge deficit -lrb- equivalent to 64.6 percent of gdp -rrb- that is leaving many french citizens anxious about the future of their welfare state . " what france needs is for these two parties in power for 25 years to be thrown out of power , out of the comfort of power and the comfort of the opposition , " said bayrou at a packed rally held in a paris concert hall .
the rally attracted over 6,000 people , an impressive turnout for a politician not well known in the capital . an alternative to the status quo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too close to call - unexpected success for le pen in 2002 drove thousands onto the streets in protest his message is attractive to jaded voters sick of the major parties . " he can unite us , " said high school teacher frederic monier , 29 , at the rally . " i want a change and i say why not bayrou ? " said 30-year-old sebastian marque , who works in a film studio .
others , like antonia arias , a 35 year old municipal employee , are undecided but said bayrou appealed to her more than the frontrunners . he has also capitalized on a resentment of so-called " paris political elites , " and a section of the polity who feel alienated from their leaders , by pledging to abolish the calling for the abolition of the elite civil service college , the national administration school -lrb- ena -rrb- , which has produced many of the nations top politicians and public servants , including president jacques chirac and former president valery giscard-d 'estaing ; prime minister dominique de villepin and his predecessors lionel jospin , and socialist presidential candidate segolene royal . ironically , it 's a policy that the far right jean-marie le pen says bayrou had appropriated from him . " we 've been calling for the abolition of ena for years , " le pen told reporters .
" by producing identikit civil servants in a single school , you end up with a kind of aristocracy - which is just how they see themselves . " he 's got the ex per ience bayrou may be keen to stress his modest origins but does n't want anyone to forget his cabinet experience either - he was education minister twice under the right-wing governments of edouard balladur and alain juppe .

preaching harmony appeals to a section of the electorate , but it leaves other confused about what he really stands for . sarkozy has attacked bayrou as a political opportunist .
" you think he is on the right , and he has moved to the left .
you think he is on the left and he has moved to the right , " sarkozy said while campaigning outside paris .

2007 is widely seen as a " change " election , after 12 years of conservative rule under jacques chirac . according to nicolas sauger , senior researcher at the center for political science research in paris -lrb- cevipof -rrb- , " the 2007 election is characterized by a strange mix of disillusionment , hence the success of francois bayrou who 's an ' anti-system ' candidate , and utopia - with the belief that politics has to reclaim its capacity to change life .

unlike sarkozy and royal , he is not rich and does not pay the " wealth tax , " declaring assets of just 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 811,000 -rrb- . bayrou 's policy platform is based on the slogan of the " six es " - employment , ecology , education , economy , exclusion and europe .
he also champions moderation of spending in a country that has suffered years of high unemployment -lrb- currently 8.6 percent -rrb- and a huge deficit -lrb- equivalent to 64.6 percent of gdp -rrb- that is leaving many french citizens anxious about the future of their welfare state . " what france needs is for these two parties in power for 25 years to be thrown out of power , out of the comfort of power and the comfort of the opposition , " said bayrou at a packed rally held in a paris concert hall .

others , like antonia arias , a 35 year old municipal employee , are undecided but said bayrou appealed to her more than the frontrunners . he has also capitalized on a resentment of so-called " paris political elites , " and a section of the polity who feel alienated from their leaders , by pledging to abolish the calling for the abolition of the elite civil service college , the national administration school -lrb- ena -rrb- , which has produced many of the nations top politicians and public servants , including president jacques chirac and former president valery giscard-d 'estaing ; prime minister dominique de villepin and his predecessors lionel jospin , and socialist presidential candidate segolene royal . ironically , it 's a policy that the far right jean-marie le pen says bayrou had appropriated from him .

2007 is widely seen as a " change " election , after 12 years of conservative rule under jacques chirac . according to nicolas sauger , senior researcher at the center for political science research in paris -lrb- cevipof -rrb- , " the 2007 election is characterized by a strange mix of disillusionment , hence the success of francois bayrou who 's an ' anti-system ' candidate , and utopia - with the belief that politics has to reclaim its capacity to change life .

unlike sarkozy and royal , he is not rich and does not pay the " wealth tax , " declaring assets of just 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 811,000 -rrb- . bayrou 's policy platform is based on the slogan of the " six es " - employment , ecology , education , economy , exclusion and europe .

" what france needs is for these two parties in power for 25 years to be thrown out of power , out of the comfort of power and the comfort of the opposition , " said bayrou at a packed rally held in a paris concert hall .

2007 is widely seen as a " change " election , after 12 years of conservative rule under jacques chirac . according to nicolas sauger , senior researcher at the center for political science research in paris -lrb- cevipof -rrb- , " the 2007 election is characterized by a strange mix of disillusionment , hence the success of francois bayrou who 's an ' anti-system ' candidate , and utopia - with the belief that politics has to reclaim its capacity to change life .

unlike sarkozy and royal , he is not rich and does not pay the " wealth tax , " declaring assets of just 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 811,000 -rrb- . bayrou 's policy platform is based on the slogan of the " six es " - employment , ecology , education , economy , exclusion and europe .

in second place is segolene royal , the socialist mother of four , who has struggled to close the gap with sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just sarko vs sego anymore - bayrou has grabbed the center snapping at royal 's heels is francois bayrou , the centrist leader of the small union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , who emerged , seemingly from nowhere , in mid february , rising to 20 percent in the opinion polls and snatching votes from right and left . most significantly , polling indicates that if he were to edge out royal and make it into the second round , bayrou would beat sarkozy in the run-off . there is only one poll that really counts but in french politics , it does n't do to rely too heavily on the polls .
the world was shocked when the far-right jean-marie le pen edged out his socialist rival to qualify for the run-off in 2002 , a show of support the pollsters had n't predicted .
2007 is widely seen as a " change " election , after 12 years of conservative rule under jacques chirac . according to nicolas sauger , senior researcher at the center for political science research in paris -lrb- cevipof -rrb- , " the 2007 election is characterized by a strange mix of disillusionment , hence the success of francois bayrou who 's an ' anti-system ' candidate , and utopia - with the belief that politics has to reclaim its capacity to change life . " enter bayrou - a 55 year old teacher , academic and politicians who captured the attention of jaded voters with his plans for a unity government , along the lines of germany 's grand coalition , and his aim for a " peaceful revolution " in french politics . it is , says sauger , " a kind of ' populist ' appeal targeting the french middle class . " man of the people , not paris bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 12 years of chirac , france is entering a new era bayrou still lives in his childhood home in the south-western bearn region of france , where his family has farmed for generations .
he continues to breed horses and is keen to stress his humble roots , recently insisting that documentary maker photograph him on the back of a tractor . a devoutly catholic father of six , who married at age 20 and trained as a teacher , he is keen to cultivate his " man of the people " persona in his appeal to voters .
unlike sarkozy and royal , he is not rich and does not pay the " wealth tax , " declaring assets of just 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 811,000 -rrb- . bayrou 's policy platform is based on the slogan of the " six es " - employment , ecology , education , economy , exclusion and europe .
he also champions moderation of spending in a country that has suffered years of high unemployment -lrb- currently 8.6 percent -rrb- and a huge deficit -lrb- equivalent to 64.6 percent of gdp -rrb- that is leaving many french citizens anxious about the future of their welfare state . " what france needs is for these two parties in power for 25 years to be thrown out of power , out of the comfort of power and the comfort of the opposition , " said bayrou at a packed rally held in a paris concert hall .
the rally attracted over 6,000 people , an impressive turnout for a politician not well known in the capital . an alternative to the status quo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too close to call - unexpected success for le pen in 2002 drove thousands onto the streets in protest his message is attractive to jaded voters sick of the major parties . " he can unite us , " said high school teacher frederic monier , 29 , at the rally . " i want a change and i say why not bayrou ? " said 30-year-old sebastian marque , who works in a film studio .
others , like antonia arias , a 35 year old municipal employee , are undecided but said bayrou appealed to her more than the frontrunners . he has also capitalized on a resentment of so-called " paris political elites , " and a section of the polity who feel alienated from their leaders , by pledging to abolish the calling for the abolition of the elite civil service college , the national administration school -lrb- ena -rrb- , which has produced many of the nations top politicians and public servants , including president jacques chirac and former president valery giscard-d 'estaing ; prime minister dominique de villepin and his predecessors lionel jospin , and socialist presidential candidate segolene royal . ironically , it 's a policy that the far right jean-marie le pen says bayrou had appropriated from him . " we 've been calling for the abolition of ena for years , " le pen told reporters .
" by producing identikit civil servants in a single school , you end up with a kind of aristocracy - which is just how they see themselves . " he 's got the ex per ience bayrou may be keen to stress his modest origins but does n't want anyone to forget his cabinet experience either - he was education minister twice under the right-wing governments of edouard balladur and alain juppe .
in addition , he is an academic author of a dozen books on history and politics , including a biography of king henry iv of france .
his latest , project of hope , has become a bestseller and outlines his vision for france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayrou want to build a unity government from the national assembly however his unity proposal , whilst being one of bayrou 's key selling points , has also proved a weakness .
preaching harmony appeals to a section of the electorate , but it leaves other confused about what he really stands for . sarkozy has attacked bayrou as a political opportunist .
" you think he is on the right , and he has moved to the left .
you think he is on the left and he has moved to the right , " sarkozy said while campaigning outside paris .
" that 's not how you lead the world 's fifth most powerful country . " the socialists accused him of being disingenuous , a right-winger misrepresenting himself as a man of the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left , right or through the center with bayrou ?
bayrou hit back , saying the only way his opponents can work together is " when it comes to shooting down my candidacy , " and says it shows they are nervous . " do you really think that they would be shooting at me like they are if i were an illusion ? " he asked .
" i am the only element of renewal and transformation in the political landscape .

experts are investigating how to set up an early warning system in the mediterranean , but there are still many issues . the giant waves that hit many asian countries in 2004 killed more than 300,000 people , making them one of the worst disasters in recorded history .
since then , there has been a flurry of activity to develop tsunami early warning systems . germany 's national research center for geosciences -lrb- gfz -rrb- is currently installing such a system in indonesia - but it could save lives in other regions as well . ten percent of all tsunamis world-wide occur in the mediterranean .
in 2003 , a two meter -lrb- 6.6 feet -rrb- high tsunami hit the coast of algeria and spain 's balearic islands causing significant damage , but no loss of life .
and back in 1908 , some 75,000 people died when giant waves swept along the sicilian coast . warning system in five or 10 years nearly all tsunamis are caused by underground earthquakes , which typically occur at boundaries between earth 's tectonic plates .
large waves then begin to move through the ocean , away from the earthquake 's epicenter .
tsunamis can be up to 30 meters high and reach speeds of to 1,000 kilometer per hour -lrb- 621 mph -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece and italy are the areas most at risk from a tsunami in the med earthquakes in the mediterranean are mainly caused by the african plate drifting northwards underneath the eurasian plate . " tsunamis could happen at any time , and could be catastrophic " , said jochen zschau , the head of gfz 's earthquake risk department . with 140 million people living along the mediterranean coast , the potential for a disaster is high .
but according to zschau , with so many countries surrounding the mediterranean , coordination of an early warning system is difficult .
he estimates that installing such a system in the region would take five to 10 years . real-time transmission the 45-million-euro -lrb- $ 60.8 million -rrb- gfz project to install early warning buoys in the indian ocean off indonesia is due for completion in 2008 .

it requires more than 700,000 poles to confess as to whether they were communist spies .
it 's high time , the law 's backers say .
critics have dubbed it a political tool . purging the public sector of communists and establishing a " new , morally irreproachable fourth republic " is a central issue for prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski and his law and justice party , the pis .
he fulfilled a campaign promise by pushing the lustration law - as well as garnering the support of the many poles who felt wronged . " lustration " comes from latin and means purification through ceremony or sacrifice .
the term is used in poland and other central and eastern european countries to describe the process of vetting people for collaborating with their countries ' intelligence services under communist rule . over 700,000 polish public and state sector workers - including politicians , civil servants , judges , lawyers , reporters , professors and the heads of state-owned companies - have until may 15 to declare in writing whether they collaborated with the state security apparatus anytime between july 1944 and july 1990 in communist poland .
those who fail to do so , or are proven to have lied in their declarations , could be banned from practicing their profession for up to 10 years , according to the law .
righting wrongs since the communist regime was dissolved in 1989 , numerous high political officials have been exposed as former communist functionaries .
ex-spies who have used insider knowledge to make money repeatedly show up on lists of the richest poles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wielgus resigned when his past became public nor has the clergy been exempt , as exemplified by the resignation and confession of the archbishop-designate of warsaw , stanislaw wielgus , in january .
communist state security files showed he had been a secret agent . poland has been lethargic when it comes to lustration .
before leaving power , the oppositional solidarity trade union agreed with the communists to forget the pre-1989 past .
still , in the 1990s there were attempts to use the courts to track down so-called system opportunists , but they were only limited to a small circle of leading politicians and civil servants .
by now expanding lustration to the entire polish elite , lawmakers are going further than all their post-communist neighbors .
but there are problems . doctored files " the law comes much too late and divides polish society , " said dieter bingen , director of the german polish institute . bingen said it was an honorable concern , since the poles had n't dealt with the problems in the 1990s .
but the approach this time employed the " lawnmower principle , " suggesting cultivation of a culture of suspicion .
also , examining hundreds of thousands of declarations would take years , he added .

but can it trust the papers ? " the materials and documents about secret service activities were often doctored in retrospect , besides being incomplete , " bingen said .
even prime minister kaczynski described his own file as a crudely made fake , he added .
political aims ?
conservative journalists below 40 , in particular , the so-called " young wolves , " have backed radical lustration of society .
others , however , see the law as an instrument to morally discredit anyone who is left of the party of kaczynski and his twin brother , bingen said . the fight between the two sides is especially fierce among poland 's newspapers , whose journalists are also obligated to pen declarations about their pasts .

conservative daily rzeczpospolita is on kaczynski 's side , arguing that as the fourth estate , journalists must also be willing to reveal their pasts . poland 's highest court could overthrow the law in may .
but if it does not , lustration might just have some unpleasant consequences for the right 's ideals of a moral poland .
the law would mainly have an impact on people who were part of the anti-communist opposition , bingen said .

it requires more than 700,000 poles to confess as to whether they were communist spies .
it 's high time , the law 's backers say .
critics have dubbed it a political tool . purging the public sector of communists and establishing a " new , morally irreproachable fourth republic " is a central issue for prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski and his law and justice party , the pis .
he fulfilled a campaign promise by pushing the lustration law - as well as garnering the support of the many poles who felt wronged . " lustration " comes from latin and means purification through ceremony or sacrifice .
the term is used in poland and other central and eastern european countries to describe the process of vetting people for collaborating with their countries ' intelligence services under communist rule . over 700,000 polish public and state sector workers - including politicians , civil servants , judges , lawyers , reporters , professors and the heads of state-owned companies - have until may 15 to declare in writing whether they collaborated with the state security apparatus anytime between july 1944 and july 1990 in communist poland .
those who fail to do so , or are proven to have lied in their declarations , could be banned from practicing their profession for up to 10 years , according to the law .
righting wrongs since the communist regime was dissolved in 1989 , numerous high political officials have been exposed as former communist functionaries .
ex-spies who have used insider knowledge to make money repeatedly show up on lists of the richest poles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wielgus resigned when his past became public nor has the clergy been exempt , as exemplified by the resignation and confession of the archbishop-designate of warsaw , stanislaw wielgus , in january .
communist state security files showed he had been a secret agent . poland has been lethargic when it comes to lustration .
before leaving power , the oppositional solidarity trade union agreed with the communists to forget the pre-1989 past .
still , in the 1990s there were attempts to use the courts to track down so-called system opportunists , but they were only limited to a small circle of leading politicians and civil servants .
by now expanding lustration to the entire polish elite , lawmakers are going further than all their post-communist neighbors .
but there are problems . doctored files " the law comes much too late and divides polish society , " said dieter bingen , director of the german polish institute . bingen said it was an honorable concern , since the poles had n't dealt with the problems in the 1990s .
but the approach this time employed the " lawnmower principle , " suggesting cultivation of a culture of suspicion .
also , examining hundreds of thousands of declarations would take years , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the kaczynskis are using the law to target the left that will be the task of the institute of national remembrance -lrb- ipn -rrb- , which has the communist secret service 's files .
but can it trust the papers ? " the materials and documents about secret service activities were often doctored in retrospect , besides being incomplete , " bingen said .
even prime minister kaczynski described his own file as a crudely made fake , he added .
political aims ?
conservative journalists below 40 , in particular , the so-called " young wolves , " have backed radical lustration of society .
others , however , see the law as an instrument to morally discredit anyone who is left of the party of kaczynski and his twin brother , bingen said . the fight between the two sides is especially fierce among poland 's newspapers , whose journalists are also obligated to pen declarations about their pasts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adam michnik 's paper has been fighting the law under its editor-in-chief , former anti-communist dissident adam michnik , the liberal daily gazeta wyborcza has been a leader in the protest against the law .
conservative daily rzeczpospolita is on kaczynski 's side , arguing that as the fourth estate , journalists must also be willing to reveal their pasts . poland 's highest court could overthrow the law in may .
but if it does not , lustration might just have some unpleasant consequences for the right 's ideals of a moral poland .
the law would mainly have an impact on people who were part of the anti-communist opposition , bingen said .
in reality , the opposition was repeatedly forced to deal with secret service agents in one way or another . the possibility " that the reputation of the ' system opposition ' as a whole could suffer damage ca n't be the kaczynski brothers ' intention , " bingen said . andreas leixnering -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland cracks down on liberal media a group of polish journalists are refusing to be screened by the government .

beilmann said take-off had gone without a hitch .
the mission took off hours after a rocket-propelled grenade attack near another german base at feisabad .
two grenades had been fired shortly before midnight saturday , a spokesman speaking from the base said .
there were no casualties , although shrapnel fragments had been found on the base .

their mission is to spy out taliban positions in the southern provinces of helmand , kandahar and uruzgan , where british , canadian and dutch troops are deployed .
under the terms of their six-month mission , they will not fly low- level sorties and will not be used to strike at taliban positions .

a recent survey showed 74 per cent feared it could trigger terrorist attacks in germany .
there are also fears that german forces could increasingly become drawn into combat operations .
most of the german troops in afghanistan are engaged in infrastructure projects with mixed military and civilian provincial reconstruction teams in the relatively peaceful north of the country .
nato-led forces are engaged in an offensive against the taliban , which claims to have thousands of suicide bombers across afghanistan . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german interior minister : " the danger level is high " german interior minister wolfgang schäuble has expressed concern that the danger of terrorist attacks against germany could have risen as a result of the country 's involvement in afghanistan .

a boycott , wildung said , " would n't bring any significant change , " adding that the last time germany had borrowed a piece from egypt was in 1985 . on sunday , egyptian antiquities supremo zahi hawass told the country 's parliament " -lrb- egypt -rrb- will never again organize antiquities exhibitions in germany if it refuses a request , to be issued next week , to allow the bust of nefertiti to be displayed in egypt for three months . " his comments came after german culture minister bernd neumann refused to allow the bust of nefertiti - renowned as one of history 's great beauties - to be exhibited in egypt because it was too delicate to be transported .

it requires more than 700,000 poles to confess as to whether they were communist spies .
it 's high time , the law 's backers say .
critics have dubbed it a political tool . purging the public sector of communists and establishing a " new , morally irreproachable fourth republic " is a central issue for prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski and his law and justice party , the pis .
he fulfilled a campaign promise by pushing the lustration law - as well as garnering the support of the many poles who felt wronged . " lustration " comes from latin and means purification through ceremony or sacrifice .
the term is used in poland and other central and eastern european countries to describe the process of vetting people for collaborating with their countries ' intelligence services under communist rule . over 700,000 polish public and state sector workers - including politicians , civil servants , judges , lawyers , reporters , professors and the heads of state-owned companies - have until may 15 to declare in writing whether they collaborated with the state security apparatus anytime between july 1944 and july 1990 in communist poland .
those who fail to do so , or are proven to have lied in their declarations , could be banned from practicing their profession for up to 10 years , according to the law .

communist state security files showed he had been a secret agent . poland has been lethargic when it comes to lustration .
before leaving power , the oppositional solidarity trade union agreed with the communists to forget the pre-1989 past .
still , in the 1990s there were attempts to use the courts to track down so-called system opportunists , but they were only limited to a small circle of leading politicians and civil servants .
by now expanding lustration to the entire polish elite , lawmakers are going further than all their post-communist neighbors .
but there are problems . doctored files " the law comes much too late and divides polish society , " said dieter bingen , director of the german polish institute . bingen said it was an honorable concern , since the poles had n't dealt with the problems in the 1990s .

even prime minister kaczynski described his own file as a crudely made fake , he added .
political aims ?
conservative journalists below 40 , in particular , the so-called " young wolves , " have backed radical lustration of society .
others , however , see the law as an instrument to morally discredit anyone who is left of the party of kaczynski and his twin brother , bingen said . the fight between the two sides is especially fierce among poland 's newspapers , whose journalists are also obligated to pen declarations about their pasts .

the term is used in poland and other central and eastern european countries to describe the process of vetting people for collaborating with their countries ' intelligence services under communist rule . over 700,000 polish public and state sector workers - including politicians , civil servants , judges , lawyers , reporters , professors and the heads of state-owned companies - have until may 15 to declare in writing whether they collaborated with the state security apparatus anytime between july 1944 and july 1990 in communist poland .
those who fail to do so , or are proven to have lied in their declarations , could be banned from practicing their profession for up to 10 years , according to the law .

communist state security files showed he had been a secret agent . poland has been lethargic when it comes to lustration .
before leaving power , the oppositional solidarity trade union agreed with the communists to forget the pre-1989 past .
still , in the 1990s there were attempts to use the courts to track down so-called system opportunists , but they were only limited to a small circle of leading politicians and civil servants .
by now expanding lustration to the entire polish elite , lawmakers are going further than all their post-communist neighbors .
but there are problems . doctored files " the law comes much too late and divides polish society , " said dieter bingen , director of the german polish institute . bingen said it was an honorable concern , since the poles had n't dealt with the problems in the 1990s .

now counterfeiters are copying more and more hi-tech products , such as microphones , stereo systems and mp3-players .
german industry is looking for new ways to fight back . around two thirds of the fake goods come from asia , harming established brands all over the world .
german industry is now looking for new ways to combat product piracy . what 's fake and what 's real ?
looking at the two ipods in customs officer andreas urbaniak 's hand , it 's hard to tell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real or fake ?
but one of the mp3-players is a phoney , said urbaniak .
he and his colleagues at frankfurt airport have seized 20,000 such counterfeit gadgets since last year .
they found most of them in airmail parcels coming in from china . " we estimate that it only costs around two or three euros to produce these gadgets .
when you buy the original , you have to pay a hundred times more , " said the customs officer . piracy up 70 per cent some 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- worth of counterfeit goods have been confiscated at frankfurt airport since january , according to urbaniak , which represents a 70 percent increase over last year . the counterfeit industry hits germany especially hard , said anton börner , president of the german federation of wholesale and foreign trade . " first of all we are a high-wage country and , secondly , we are world champion in exports , " said börner .
" of course the big ones are hit first . " german companies lose 25 billion euros per year as a result of counterfeiting , börner estimates .
but now the industry wants to strike back . tighter controls in place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many pirated goods enter germany via frankfurt airport in a newly launched initiative , german business associations are urging import companies and wholesalers to double-check every product they buy .
his association will provide support , börner says , and help separate the fakes from the originals . the initiative is also backed by the german government , according to bernd pfaffenbach , state secretary in the ministry of economics . " we take these issues very seriously , securing property rights , " pfaffenbach said .
" and we will also take this issue up at the g8 summit in heiligendamm in early june .
we are hopeful that a cooperative approach with china and others involved in these issues might be very fruitful . " neither börner nor pfaffenbach expects product piracy to decrease considerably any time soon .
their goal is to try and curb it until international agreements can be put in place .
until then , customs officers like andreas urbaniak will never be short of work . peter hille -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de intelligence official : chinese snoop on german companies germany 's domestic intelligence service has warned the country 's companies that china is increasingly using electronic espionage to get trade secrets .

now , if you happen to straddle that sacrosanct path and cause an incident -lrb- like a bicycle bumping into you -rrb- , it 's your fault and not the cyclist 's .
while going for your pre-breakfast or after-dinner walk , keep your indian third eye open for the yellow lines . - prof. dr. jyotirmoy banerjee , india bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coffee and cake is a tradition in german i visited the cafe in the rilke haus on a school trip to bremen with my boss and a colleague .
we took a beautiful walk out of fischerhude along a country lane for 10 minutes before arriving at this beautiful house with its cozy cafe .
it 's surrounded by a beautifully kept garden and creek running past the rear .
the coffee and cake are great too . - micha el atkinson , australia munich is one of our favorite cities .
it is clean , seems safe and there is not a lot of graffiti , as in some european cities .
we also like the great german beer and beautiful traditional clothes worn in bavaria . - brigitte huff , us i am from the midwest in the us and travel to germany at least once a year .

i love the food , the wine , the beer , the little towns where i always stay in bed and breakfast houses , and i especially love all the people i 've met who made my visits so memorable .
i do try to speak the language , and even though i 'm not very good at it , i know my efforts are appreciated .
i ca n't wait to get back there ! - karen i vacationed in germany last august for a week after being gone for 16 years .
i was in the army stationed in wertheim and bamberg back in the late 1980s .
it was the best two and a half years of my life .
there are so many great places to go that it would take nearly all summer to see them .
heidelberg , cologne and stuttgart are just a few of the truly great cities in germany .

experts are investigating how to set up an early warning system in the mediterranean , but there are still many issues . the giant waves that hit many asian countries in 2004 killed more than 300,000 people , making them one of the worst disasters in recorded history .
since then , there has been a flurry of activity to develop tsunami early warning systems . germany 's national research center for geosciences -lrb- gfz -rrb- is currently installing such a system in indonesia - but it could save lives in other regions as well . ten percent of all tsunamis world-wide occur in the mediterranean .
in 2003 , a two meter -lrb- 6.6 feet -rrb- high tsunami hit the coast of algeria and spain 's balearic islands causing significant damage , but no loss of life .
and back in 1908 , some 75,000 people died when giant waves swept along the sicilian coast . warning system in five or 10 years nearly all tsunamis are caused by underground earthquakes , which typically occur at boundaries between earth 's tectonic plates .
large waves then begin to move through the ocean , away from the earthquake 's epicenter .
tsunamis can be up to 30 meters high and reach speeds of to 1,000 kilometer per hour -lrb- 621 mph -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece and italy are the areas most at risk from a tsunami in the med earthquakes in the mediterranean are mainly caused by the african plate drifting northwards underneath the eurasian plate . " tsunamis could happen at any time , and could be catastrophic " , said jochen zschau , the head of gfz 's earthquake risk department . with 140 million people living along the mediterranean coast , the potential for a disaster is high .
but according to zschau , with so many countries surrounding the mediterranean , coordination of an early warning system is difficult .
he estimates that installing such a system in the region would take five to 10 years . real-time transmission the 45-million-euro -lrb- $ 60.8 million -rrb- gfz project to install early warning buoys in the indian ocean off indonesia is due for completion in 2008 .
the system uses sensors on the ocean floor to detect changes in pressure .
this is sent to a series of buoys on the ocean surface , which , in turn , beam the data by satellite to an observation station .
by using real-time data transmission , tsunamis can be detected more quickly , which gives people more time to flee the oncoming waves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first indonesian tsunami-detecting buoys were installed in november 2005 germany 's federal ministry of education and research , which commissioned the indonesian project , set the condition that the system would also be usable for the atlantic and the mediterranean oceans . " a large part of the early warning system in the indian ocean can be transferred to the mediterranean , " zschau said .
" but of course not all factors are the same , so the system needs to be adjusted for the particular region . " because the mediterranean is a smaller ocean , it takes a tsunami less time to travel from the earthquake 's epicenter to the coast .
this means the early-warning window is less than for other regions . christine elsaesser -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de asia marks tsunami anniversary , still struggles to rebuild aid from the west , including germany , is helping asian countries come back from the deadly tsunami of 2004 .

he estimates that installing such a system in the region would take five to 10 years . real-time transmission the 45-million-euro -lrb- $ 60.8 million -rrb- gfz project to install early warning buoys in the indian ocean off indonesia is due for completion in 2008 .
the system uses sensors on the ocean floor to detect changes in pressure .
this is sent to a series of buoys on the ocean surface , which , in turn , beam the data by satellite to an observation station .
by using real-time data transmission , tsunamis can be detected more quickly , which gives people more time to flee the oncoming waves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first indonesian tsunami-detecting buoys were installed in november 2005 germany 's federal ministry of education and research , which commissioned the indonesian project , set the condition that the system would also be usable for the atlantic and the mediterranean oceans . " a large part of the early warning system in the indian ocean can be transferred to the mediterranean , " zschau said .
" but of course not all factors are the same , so the system needs to be adjusted for the particular region . " because the mediterranean is a smaller ocean , it takes a tsunami less time to travel from the earthquake 's epicenter to the coast .

it requires more than 700,000 poles to confess as to whether they were communist spies .
it 's high time , the law 's backers say .
critics have dubbed it a political tool . purging the public sector of communists and establishing a " new , morally irreproachable fourth republic " is a central issue for prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski and his law and justice party , the pis .
he fulfilled a campaign promise by pushing the lustration law - as well as garnering the support of the many poles who felt wronged . " lustration " comes from latin and means purification through ceremony or sacrifice .
the term is used in poland and other central and eastern european countries to describe the process of vetting people for collaborating with their countries ' intelligence services under communist rule . over 700,000 polish public and state sector workers - including politicians , civil servants , judges , lawyers , reporters , professors and the heads of state-owned companies - have until may 15 to declare in writing whether they collaborated with the state security apparatus anytime between july 1944 and july 1990 in communist poland .
those who fail to do so , or are proven to have lied in their declarations , could be banned from practicing their profession for up to 10 years , according to the law .
righting wrongs since the communist regime was dissolved in 1989 , numerous high political officials have been exposed as former communist functionaries .
ex-spies who have used insider knowledge to make money repeatedly show up on lists of the richest poles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wielgus resigned when his past became public nor has the clergy been exempt , as exemplified by the resignation and confession of the archbishop-designate of warsaw , stanislaw wielgus , in january .
communist state security files showed he had been a secret agent . poland has been lethargic when it comes to lustration .
before leaving power , the oppositional solidarity trade union agreed with the communists to forget the pre-1989 past .
still , in the 1990s there were attempts to use the courts to track down so-called system opportunists , but they were only limited to a small circle of leading politicians and civil servants .
by now expanding lustration to the entire polish elite , lawmakers are going further than all their post-communist neighbors .
but there are problems . doctored files " the law comes much too late and divides polish society , " said dieter bingen , director of the german polish institute . bingen said it was an honorable concern , since the poles had n't dealt with the problems in the 1990s .
but the approach this time employed the " lawnmower principle , " suggesting cultivation of a culture of suspicion .
also , examining hundreds of thousands of declarations would take years , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the kaczynskis are using the law to target the left that will be the task of the institute of national remembrance -lrb- ipn -rrb- , which has the communist secret service 's files .
but can it trust the papers ? " the materials and documents about secret service activities were often doctored in retrospect , besides being incomplete , " bingen said .
even prime minister kaczynski described his own file as a crudely made fake , he added .
political aims ?
conservative journalists below 40 , in particular , the so-called " young wolves , " have backed radical lustration of society .
others , however , see the law as an instrument to morally discredit anyone who is left of the party of kaczynski and his twin brother , bingen said . the fight between the two sides is especially fierce among poland 's newspapers , whose journalists are also obligated to pen declarations about their pasts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adam michnik 's paper has been fighting the law under its editor-in-chief , former anti-communist dissident adam michnik , the liberal daily gazeta wyborcza has been a leader in the protest against the law .
conservative daily rzeczpospolita is on kaczynski 's side , arguing that as the fourth estate , journalists must also be willing to reveal their pasts . poland 's highest court could overthrow the law in may .
but if it does not , lustration might just have some unpleasant consequences for the right 's ideals of a moral poland .
the law would mainly have an impact on people who were part of the anti-communist opposition , bingen said .
in reality , the opposition was repeatedly forced to deal with secret service agents in one way or another . the possibility " that the reputation of the ' system opposition ' as a whole could suffer damage ca n't be the kaczynski brothers ' intention , " bingen said . andreas leixnering -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland cracks down on liberal media a group of polish journalists are refusing to be screened by the government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.04.2007 mediterranean tsunami warning system could save lives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of people live , work and holiday on the mediterranean underwater earthquakes can trigger tsunamis all over the world - - including the mediterranean .
experts are investigating how to set up an early warning system in the mediterranean , but there are still many issues . the giant waves that hit many asian countries in 2004 killed more than 300,000 people , making them one of the worst disasters in recorded history .
since then , there has been a flurry of activity to develop tsunami early warning systems . germany 's national research center for geosciences -lrb- gfz -rrb- is currently installing such a system in indonesia - but it could save lives in other regions as well . ten percent of all tsunamis world-wide occur in the mediterranean .
in 2003 , a two meter -lrb- 6.6 feet -rrb- high tsunami hit the coast of algeria and spain 's balearic islands causing significant damage , but no loss of life .
and back in 1908 , some 75,000 people died when giant waves swept along the sicilian coast . warning system in five or 10 years nearly all tsunamis are caused by underground earthquakes , which typically occur at boundaries between earth 's tectonic plates .
large waves then begin to move through the ocean , away from the earthquake 's epicenter .
tsunamis can be up to 30 meters high and reach speeds of to 1,000 kilometer per hour -lrb- 621 mph -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece and italy are the areas most at risk from a tsunami in the med earthquakes in the mediterranean are mainly caused by the african plate drifting northwards underneath the eurasian plate . " tsunamis could happen at any time , and could be catastrophic " , said jochen zschau , the head of gfz 's earthquake risk department . with 140 million people living along the mediterranean coast , the potential for a disaster is high .
but according to zschau , with so many countries surrounding the mediterranean , coordination of an early warning system is difficult .
he estimates that installing such a system in the region would take five to 10 years . real-time transmission the 45-million-euro -lrb- $ 60.8 million -rrb- gfz project to install early warning buoys in the indian ocean off indonesia is due for completion in 2008 .
the system uses sensors on the ocean floor to detect changes in pressure .
this is sent to a series of buoys on the ocean surface , which , in turn , beam the data by satellite to an observation station .
by using real-time data transmission , tsunamis can be detected more quickly , which gives people more time to flee the oncoming waves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first indonesian tsunami-detecting buoys were installed in november 2005 germany 's federal ministry of education and research , which commissioned the indonesian project , set the condition that the system would also be usable for the atlantic and the mediterranean oceans . " a large part of the early warning system in the indian ocean can be transferred to the mediterranean , " zschau said .
" but of course not all factors are the same , so the system needs to be adjusted for the particular region . " because the mediterranean is a smaller ocean , it takes a tsunami less time to travel from the earthquake 's epicenter to the coast .
this means the early-warning window is less than for other regions . christine elsaesser -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de asia marks tsunami anniversary , still struggles to rebuild aid from the west , including germany , is helping asian countries come back from the deadly tsunami of 2004 .

a boycott , wildung said , " would n't bring any significant change , " adding that the last time germany had borrowed a piece from egypt was in 1985 . on sunday , egyptian antiquities supremo zahi hawass told the country 's parliament " -lrb- egypt -rrb- will never again organize antiquities exhibitions in germany if it refuses a request , to be issued next week , to allow the bust of nefertiti to be displayed in egypt for three months . " his comments came after german culture minister bernd neumann refused to allow the bust of nefertiti - renowned as one of history 's great beauties - to be exhibited in egypt because it was too delicate to be transported . " experts have reservations about taking nefertiti on a long trip , which we have to take seriously , " neumann said in reaction to a campaign launched in germany under the title " nefertiti travels " to loan the bust to egypt for a limited period . long history of disagreements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nefertiti 's gaze has fascinated berlin visitors for almost a century cairo and berlin have frequently crossed swords over the limestone bust , which was unearthed by german archaeologists in an artist 's studio on the banks of the nile and taken to germany under a 1913 agreement . it was described by adolf hitler as " a true treasure .

experts are investigating how to set up an early warning system in the mediterranean , but there are still many issues . the giant waves that hit many asian countries in 2004 killed more than 300,000 people , making them one of the worst disasters in recorded history .
since then , there has been a flurry of activity to develop tsunami early warning systems . germany 's national research center for geosciences -lrb- gfz -rrb- is currently installing such a system in indonesia - but it could save lives in other regions as well . ten percent of all tsunamis world-wide occur in the mediterranean .
in 2003 , a two meter -lrb- 6.6 feet -rrb- high tsunami hit the coast of algeria and spain 's balearic islands causing significant damage , but no loss of life .
and back in 1908 , some 75,000 people died when giant waves swept along the sicilian coast . warning system in five or 10 years nearly all tsunamis are caused by underground earthquakes , which typically occur at boundaries between earth 's tectonic plates .
large waves then begin to move through the ocean , away from the earthquake 's epicenter .
tsunamis can be up to 30 meters high and reach speeds of to 1,000 kilometer per hour -lrb- 621 mph -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece and italy are the areas most at risk from a tsunami in the med earthquakes in the mediterranean are mainly caused by the african plate drifting northwards underneath the eurasian plate . " tsunamis could happen at any time , and could be catastrophic " , said jochen zschau , the head of gfz 's earthquake risk department . with 140 million people living along the mediterranean coast , the potential for a disaster is high .
but according to zschau , with so many countries surrounding the mediterranean , coordination of an early warning system is difficult .
he estimates that installing such a system in the region would take five to 10 years . real-time transmission the 45-million-euro -lrb- $ 60.8 million -rrb- gfz project to install early warning buoys in the indian ocean off indonesia is due for completion in 2008 .
the system uses sensors on the ocean floor to detect changes in pressure .
this is sent to a series of buoys on the ocean surface , which , in turn , beam the data by satellite to an observation station .
by using real-time data transmission , tsunamis can be detected more quickly , which gives people more time to flee the oncoming waves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first indonesian tsunami-detecting buoys were installed in november 2005 germany 's federal ministry of education and research , which commissioned the indonesian project , set the condition that the system would also be usable for the atlantic and the mediterranean oceans . " a large part of the early warning system in the indian ocean can be transferred to the mediterranean , " zschau said .
" but of course not all factors are the same , so the system needs to be adjusted for the particular region . " because the mediterranean is a smaller ocean , it takes a tsunami less time to travel from the earthquake 's epicenter to the coast .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.04.2007 communist screening law divides polish society großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public sector workers are obligated to expose their communist pasts poland 's new lustration law has split the country .
it requires more than 700,000 poles to confess as to whether they were communist spies .
it 's high time , the law 's backers say .
critics have dubbed it a political tool . purging the public sector of communists and establishing a " new , morally irreproachable fourth republic " is a central issue for prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski and his law and justice party , the pis .
he fulfilled a campaign promise by pushing the lustration law - as well as garnering the support of the many poles who felt wronged . " lustration " comes from latin and means purification through ceremony or sacrifice .
the term is used in poland and other central and eastern european countries to describe the process of vetting people for collaborating with their countries ' intelligence services under communist rule . over 700,000 polish public and state sector workers - including politicians , civil servants , judges , lawyers , reporters , professors and the heads of state-owned companies - have until may 15 to declare in writing whether they collaborated with the state security apparatus anytime between july 1944 and july 1990 in communist poland .
those who fail to do so , or are proven to have lied in their declarations , could be banned from practicing their profession for up to 10 years , according to the law .
righting wrongs since the communist regime was dissolved in 1989 , numerous high political officials have been exposed as former communist functionaries .
ex-spies who have used insider knowledge to make money repeatedly show up on lists of the richest poles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wielgus resigned when his past became public nor has the clergy been exempt , as exemplified by the resignation and confession of the archbishop-designate of warsaw , stanislaw wielgus , in january .
communist state security files showed he had been a secret agent . poland has been lethargic when it comes to lustration .
before leaving power , the oppositional solidarity trade union agreed with the communists to forget the pre-1989 past .
still , in the 1990s there were attempts to use the courts to track down so-called system opportunists , but they were only limited to a small circle of leading politicians and civil servants .
by now expanding lustration to the entire polish elite , lawmakers are going further than all their post-communist neighbors .
but there are problems . doctored files " the law comes much too late and divides polish society , " said dieter bingen , director of the german polish institute . bingen said it was an honorable concern , since the poles had n't dealt with the problems in the 1990s .
but the approach this time employed the " lawnmower principle , " suggesting cultivation of a culture of suspicion .
also , examining hundreds of thousands of declarations would take years , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the kaczynskis are using the law to target the left that will be the task of the institute of national remembrance -lrb- ipn -rrb- , which has the communist secret service 's files .
but can it trust the papers ? " the materials and documents about secret service activities were often doctored in retrospect , besides being incomplete , " bingen said .
even prime minister kaczynski described his own file as a crudely made fake , he added .
political aims ?
conservative journalists below 40 , in particular , the so-called " young wolves , " have backed radical lustration of society .
others , however , see the law as an instrument to morally discredit anyone who is left of the party of kaczynski and his twin brother , bingen said . the fight between the two sides is especially fierce among poland 's newspapers , whose journalists are also obligated to pen declarations about their pasts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adam michnik 's paper has been fighting the law under its editor-in-chief , former anti-communist dissident adam michnik , the liberal daily gazeta wyborcza has been a leader in the protest against the law .
conservative daily rzeczpospolita is on kaczynski 's side , arguing that as the fourth estate , journalists must also be willing to reveal their pasts . poland 's highest court could overthrow the law in may .
but if it does not , lustration might just have some unpleasant consequences for the right 's ideals of a moral poland .
the law would mainly have an impact on people who were part of the anti-communist opposition , bingen said .
in reality , the opposition was repeatedly forced to deal with secret service agents in one way or another . the possibility " that the reputation of the ' system opposition ' as a whole could suffer damage ca n't be the kaczynski brothers ' intention , " bingen said . andreas leixnering -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland cracks down on liberal media a group of polish journalists are refusing to be screened by the government .

some cheer the historical exposé while others say a witchhunt is taking place .

it requires more than 700,000 poles to confess as to whether they were communist spies .
it 's high time , the law 's backers say .
critics have dubbed it a political tool . purging the public sector of communists and establishing a " new , morally irreproachable fourth republic " is a central issue for prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski and his law and justice party , the pis .
he fulfilled a campaign promise by pushing the lustration law - as well as garnering the support of the many poles who felt wronged . " lustration " comes from latin and means purification through ceremony or sacrifice .
the term is used in poland and other central and eastern european countries to describe the process of vetting people for collaborating with their countries ' intelligence services under communist rule . over 700,000 polish public and state sector workers - including politicians , civil servants , judges , lawyers , reporters , professors and the heads of state-owned companies - have until may 15 to declare in writing whether they collaborated with the state security apparatus anytime between july 1944 and july 1990 in communist poland .
those who fail to do so , or are proven to have lied in their declarations , could be banned from practicing their profession for up to 10 years , according to the law .
righting wrongs since the communist regime was dissolved in 1989 , numerous high political officials have been exposed as former communist functionaries .
ex-spies who have used insider knowledge to make money repeatedly show up on lists of the richest poles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wielgus resigned when his past became public nor has the clergy been exempt , as exemplified by the resignation and confession of the archbishop-designate of warsaw , stanislaw wielgus , in january .
communist state security files showed he had been a secret agent . poland has been lethargic when it comes to lustration .
before leaving power , the oppositional solidarity trade union agreed with the communists to forget the pre-1989 past .
still , in the 1990s there were attempts to use the courts to track down so-called system opportunists , but they were only limited to a small circle of leading politicians and civil servants .
by now expanding lustration to the entire polish elite , lawmakers are going further than all their post-communist neighbors .
but there are problems . doctored files " the law comes much too late and divides polish society , " said dieter bingen , director of the german polish institute . bingen said it was an honorable concern , since the poles had n't dealt with the problems in the 1990s .
but the approach this time employed the " lawnmower principle , " suggesting cultivation of a culture of suspicion .
also , examining hundreds of thousands of declarations would take years , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the kaczynskis are using the law to target the left that will be the task of the institute of national remembrance -lrb- ipn -rrb- , which has the communist secret service 's files .
but can it trust the papers ? " the materials and documents about secret service activities were often doctored in retrospect , besides being incomplete , " bingen said .
even prime minister kaczynski described his own file as a crudely made fake , he added .
political aims ?
conservative journalists below 40 , in particular , the so-called " young wolves , " have backed radical lustration of society .
others , however , see the law as an instrument to morally discredit anyone who is left of the party of kaczynski and his twin brother , bingen said . the fight between the two sides is especially fierce among poland 's newspapers , whose journalists are also obligated to pen declarations about their pasts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adam michnik 's paper has been fighting the law under its editor-in-chief , former anti-communist dissident adam michnik , the liberal daily gazeta wyborcza has been a leader in the protest against the law .
conservative daily rzeczpospolita is on kaczynski 's side , arguing that as the fourth estate , journalists must also be willing to reveal their pasts . poland 's highest court could overthrow the law in may .
but if it does not , lustration might just have some unpleasant consequences for the right 's ideals of a moral poland .
the law would mainly have an impact on people who were part of the anti-communist opposition , bingen said .
in reality , the opposition was repeatedly forced to deal with secret service agents in one way or another . the possibility " that the reputation of the ' system opposition ' as a whole could suffer damage ca n't be the kaczynski brothers ' intention , " bingen said . andreas leixnering -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland cracks down on liberal media a group of polish journalists are refusing to be screened by the government .
they say authorities are using a recently passed vetting law to hit back against the liberal opposition and conduct a witch hunt in the media .
-lrb- 23.03.2007 -rrb- claims that clergy spied for communists upset polish readers a controversial book exploring the link between poland ’ s clergy and the secret police under communism has hit polish book stores .
some cheer the historical exposé while others say a witchhunt is taking place .

he is the man who can beat the frontrunner nicolas sarkozy , according to the polls . when france votes in the first round of the presidential election on april 22 , there will be 12 names on the ballot .
assuming no candidate gets 50 percent of the vote , the top two will then contest a run-off vote on may 6 .
it 's generally assumed that one of those two will be nicolas sarkozy , the former interior minister who has consistently led the opinion polls .
in second place is segolene royal , the socialist mother of four , who has struggled to close the gap with sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just sarko vs sego anymore - bayrou has grabbed the center snapping at royal 's heels is francois bayrou , the centrist leader of the small union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , who emerged , seemingly from nowhere , in mid february , rising to 20 percent in the opinion polls and snatching votes from right and left . most significantly , polling indicates that if he were to edge out royal and make it into the second round , bayrou would beat sarkozy in the run-off . there is only one poll that really counts but in french politics , it does n't do to rely too heavily on the polls .
the world was shocked when the far-right jean-marie le pen edged out his socialist rival to qualify for the run-off in 2002 , a show of support the pollsters had n't predicted .
2007 is widely seen as a " change " election , after 12 years of conservative rule under jacques chirac . according to nicolas sauger , senior researcher at the center for political science research in paris -lrb- cevipof -rrb- , " the 2007 election is characterized by a strange mix of disillusionment , hence the success of francois bayrou who 's an ' anti-system ' candidate , and utopia - with the belief that politics has to reclaim its capacity to change life . " enter bayrou - a 55 year old teacher , academic and politicians who captured the attention of jaded voters with his plans for a unity government , along the lines of germany 's grand coalition , and his aim for a " peaceful revolution " in french politics . it is , says sauger , " a kind of ' populist ' appeal targeting the french middle class . " man of the people , not paris bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 12 years of chirac , france is entering a new era bayrou still lives in his childhood home in the south-western bearn region of france , where his family has farmed for generations .
he continues to breed horses and is keen to stress his humble roots , recently insisting that documentary maker photograph him on the back of a tractor . a devoutly catholic father of six , who married at age 20 and trained as a teacher , he is keen to cultivate his " man of the people " persona in his appeal to voters .
unlike sarkozy and royal , he is not rich and does not pay the " wealth tax , " declaring assets of just 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 811,000 -rrb- . bayrou 's policy platform is based on the slogan of the " six es " - employment , ecology , education , economy , exclusion and europe .
he also champions moderation of spending in a country that has suffered years of high unemployment -lrb- currently 8.6 percent -rrb- and a huge deficit -lrb- equivalent to 64.6 percent of gdp -rrb- that is leaving many french citizens anxious about the future of their welfare state . " what france needs is for these two parties in power for 25 years to be thrown out of power , out of the comfort of power and the comfort of the opposition , " said bayrou at a packed rally held in a paris concert hall .
the rally attracted over 6,000 people , an impressive turnout for a politician not well known in the capital . an alternative to the status quo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too close to call - unexpected success for le pen in 2002 drove thousands onto the streets in protest his message is attractive to jaded voters sick of the major parties . " he can unite us , " said high school teacher frederic monier , 29 , at the rally . " i want a change and i say why not bayrou ? " said 30-year-old sebastian marque , who works in a film studio .
others , like antonia arias , a 35 year old municipal employee , are undecided but said bayrou appealed to her more than the frontrunners . he has also capitalized on a resentment of so-called " paris political elites , " and a section of the polity who feel alienated from their leaders , by pledging to abolish the calling for the abolition of the elite civil service college , the national administration school -lrb- ena -rrb- , which has produced many of the nations top politicians and public servants , including president jacques chirac and former president valery giscard-d 'estaing ; prime minister dominique de villepin and his predecessors lionel jospin , and socialist presidential candidate segolene royal . ironically , it 's a policy that the far right jean-marie le pen says bayrou had appropriated from him . " we 've been calling for the abolition of ena for years , " le pen told reporters .
" by producing identikit civil servants in a single school , you end up with a kind of aristocracy - which is just how they see themselves . " he 's got the ex per ience bayrou may be keen to stress his modest origins but does n't want anyone to forget his cabinet experience either - he was education minister twice under the right-wing governments of edouard balladur and alain juppe .
in addition , he is an academic author of a dozen books on history and politics , including a biography of king henry iv of france .
his latest , project of hope , has become a bestseller and outlines his vision for france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayrou want to build a unity government from the national assembly however his unity proposal , whilst being one of bayrou 's key selling points , has also proved a weakness .
preaching harmony appeals to a section of the electorate , but it leaves other confused about what he really stands for . sarkozy has attacked bayrou as a political opportunist .
" you think he is on the right , and he has moved to the left .
you think he is on the left and he has moved to the right , " sarkozy said while campaigning outside paris .
" that 's not how you lead the world 's fifth most powerful country . " the socialists accused him of being disingenuous , a right-winger misrepresenting himself as a man of the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left , right or through the center with bayrou ?
bayrou hit back , saying the only way his opponents can work together is " when it comes to shooting down my candidacy , " and says it shows they are nervous . " do you really think that they would be shooting at me like they are if i were an illusion ? " he asked .

it 's generally assumed that one of those two will be nicolas sarkozy , the former interior minister who has consistently led the opinion polls .
in second place is segolene royal , the socialist mother of four , who has struggled to close the gap with sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just sarko vs sego anymore - bayrou has grabbed the center snapping at royal 's heels is francois bayrou , the centrist leader of the small union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , who emerged , seemingly from nowhere , in mid february , rising to 20 percent in the opinion polls and snatching votes from right and left . most significantly , polling indicates that if he were to edge out royal and make it into the second round , bayrou would beat sarkozy in the run-off . there is only one poll that really counts but in french politics , it does n't do to rely too heavily on the polls .
the world was shocked when the far-right jean-marie le pen edged out his socialist rival to qualify for the run-off in 2002 , a show of support the pollsters had n't predicted .
2007 is widely seen as a " change " election , after 12 years of conservative rule under jacques chirac . according to nicolas sauger , senior researcher at the center for political science research in paris -lrb- cevipof -rrb- , " the 2007 election is characterized by a strange mix of disillusionment , hence the success of francois bayrou who 's an ' anti-system ' candidate , and utopia - with the belief that politics has to reclaim its capacity to change life . " enter bayrou - a 55 year old teacher , academic and politicians who captured the attention of jaded voters with his plans for a unity government , along the lines of germany 's grand coalition , and his aim for a " peaceful revolution " in french politics . it is , says sauger , " a kind of ' populist ' appeal targeting the french middle class .

unlike sarkozy and royal , he is not rich and does not pay the " wealth tax , " declaring assets of just 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 811,000 -rrb- . bayrou 's policy platform is based on the slogan of the " six es " - employment , ecology , education , economy , exclusion and europe .
he also champions moderation of spending in a country that has suffered years of high unemployment -lrb- currently 8.6 percent -rrb- and a huge deficit -lrb- equivalent to 64.6 percent of gdp -rrb- that is leaving many french citizens anxious about the future of their welfare state . " what france needs is for these two parties in power for 25 years to be thrown out of power , out of the comfort of power and the comfort of the opposition , " said bayrou at a packed rally held in a paris concert hall .

others , like antonia arias , a 35 year old municipal employee , are undecided but said bayrou appealed to her more than the frontrunners . he has also capitalized on a resentment of so-called " paris political elites , " and a section of the polity who feel alienated from their leaders , by pledging to abolish the calling for the abolition of the elite civil service college , the national administration school -lrb- ena -rrb- , which has produced many of the nations top politicians and public servants , including president jacques chirac and former president valery giscard-d 'estaing ; prime minister dominique de villepin and his predecessors lionel jospin , and socialist presidential candidate segolene royal . ironically , it 's a policy that the far right jean-marie le pen says bayrou had appropriated from him .

in second place is segolene royal , the socialist mother of four , who has struggled to close the gap with sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just sarko vs sego anymore - bayrou has grabbed the center snapping at royal 's heels is francois bayrou , the centrist leader of the small union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , who emerged , seemingly from nowhere , in mid february , rising to 20 percent in the opinion polls and snatching votes from right and left . most significantly , polling indicates that if he were to edge out royal and make it into the second round , bayrou would beat sarkozy in the run-off . there is only one poll that really counts but in french politics , it does n't do to rely too heavily on the polls .
the world was shocked when the far-right jean-marie le pen edged out his socialist rival to qualify for the run-off in 2002 , a show of support the pollsters had n't predicted .
2007 is widely seen as a " change " election , after 12 years of conservative rule under jacques chirac . according to nicolas sauger , senior researcher at the center for political science research in paris -lrb- cevipof -rrb- , " the 2007 election is characterized by a strange mix of disillusionment , hence the success of francois bayrou who 's an ' anti-system ' candidate , and utopia - with the belief that politics has to reclaim its capacity to change life . " enter bayrou - a 55 year old teacher , academic and politicians who captured the attention of jaded voters with his plans for a unity government , along the lines of germany 's grand coalition , and his aim for a " peaceful revolution " in french politics . it is , says sauger , " a kind of ' populist ' appeal targeting the french middle class .

unlike sarkozy and royal , he is not rich and does not pay the " wealth tax , " declaring assets of just 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 811,000 -rrb- . bayrou 's policy platform is based on the slogan of the " six es " - employment , ecology , education , economy , exclusion and europe .
he also champions moderation of spending in a country that has suffered years of high unemployment -lrb- currently 8.6 percent -rrb- and a huge deficit -lrb- equivalent to 64.6 percent of gdp -rrb- that is leaving many french citizens anxious about the future of their welfare state . " what france needs is for these two parties in power for 25 years to be thrown out of power , out of the comfort of power and the comfort of the opposition , " said bayrou at a packed rally held in a paris concert hall .

others , like antonia arias , a 35 year old municipal employee , are undecided but said bayrou appealed to her more than the frontrunners . he has also capitalized on a resentment of so-called " paris political elites , " and a section of the polity who feel alienated from their leaders , by pledging to abolish the calling for the abolition of the elite civil service college , the national administration school -lrb- ena -rrb- , which has produced many of the nations top politicians and public servants , including president jacques chirac and former president valery giscard-d 'estaing ; prime minister dominique de villepin and his predecessors lionel jospin , and socialist presidential candidate segolene royal . ironically , it 's a policy that the far right jean-marie le pen says bayrou had appropriated from him .

it requires more than 700,000 poles to confess as to whether they were communist spies .
it 's high time , the law 's backers say .
critics have dubbed it a political tool . purging the public sector of communists and establishing a " new , morally irreproachable fourth republic " is a central issue for prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski and his law and justice party , the pis .
he fulfilled a campaign promise by pushing the lustration law - as well as garnering the support of the many poles who felt wronged . " lustration " comes from latin and means purification through ceremony or sacrifice .
the term is used in poland and other central and eastern european countries to describe the process of vetting people for collaborating with their countries ' intelligence services under communist rule . over 700,000 polish public and state sector workers - including politicians , civil servants , judges , lawyers , reporters , professors and the heads of state-owned companies - have until may 15 to declare in writing whether they collaborated with the state security apparatus anytime between july 1944 and july 1990 in communist poland .
those who fail to do so , or are proven to have lied in their declarations , could be banned from practicing their profession for up to 10 years , according to the law .
righting wrongs since the communist regime was dissolved in 1989 , numerous high political officials have been exposed as former communist functionaries .
ex-spies who have used insider knowledge to make money repeatedly show up on lists of the richest poles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wielgus resigned when his past became public nor has the clergy been exempt , as exemplified by the resignation and confession of the archbishop-designate of warsaw , stanislaw wielgus , in january .
communist state security files showed he had been a secret agent . poland has been lethargic when it comes to lustration .
before leaving power , the oppositional solidarity trade union agreed with the communists to forget the pre-1989 past .
still , in the 1990s there were attempts to use the courts to track down so-called system opportunists , but they were only limited to a small circle of leading politicians and civil servants .
by now expanding lustration to the entire polish elite , lawmakers are going further than all their post-communist neighbors .
but there are problems . doctored files " the law comes much too late and divides polish society , " said dieter bingen , director of the german polish institute . bingen said it was an honorable concern , since the poles had n't dealt with the problems in the 1990s .
but the approach this time employed the " lawnmower principle , " suggesting cultivation of a culture of suspicion .
also , examining hundreds of thousands of declarations would take years , he added .

but can it trust the papers ? " the materials and documents about secret service activities were often doctored in retrospect , besides being incomplete , " bingen said .
even prime minister kaczynski described his own file as a crudely made fake , he added .
political aims ?
conservative journalists below 40 , in particular , the so-called " young wolves , " have backed radical lustration of society .
others , however , see the law as an instrument to morally discredit anyone who is left of the party of kaczynski and his twin brother , bingen said . the fight between the two sides is especially fierce among poland 's newspapers , whose journalists are also obligated to pen declarations about their pasts .

conservative daily rzeczpospolita is on kaczynski 's side , arguing that as the fourth estate , journalists must also be willing to reveal their pasts . poland 's highest court could overthrow the law in may .
but if it does not , lustration might just have some unpleasant consequences for the right 's ideals of a moral poland .
the law would mainly have an impact on people who were part of the anti-communist opposition , bingen said .
in reality , the opposition was repeatedly forced to deal with secret service agents in one way or another . the possibility " that the reputation of the ' system opposition ' as a whole could suffer damage ca n't be the kaczynski brothers ' intention , " bingen said . andreas leixnering -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland cracks down on liberal media a group of polish journalists are refusing to be screened by the government .

experts are investigating how to set up an early warning system in the mediterranean , but there are still many issues . the giant waves that hit many asian countries in 2004 killed more than 300,000 people , making them one of the worst disasters in recorded history .
since then , there has been a flurry of activity to develop tsunami early warning systems . germany 's national research center for geosciences -lrb- gfz -rrb- is currently installing such a system in indonesia - but it could save lives in other regions as well . ten percent of all tsunamis world-wide occur in the mediterranean .
in 2003 , a two meter -lrb- 6.6 feet -rrb- high tsunami hit the coast of algeria and spain 's balearic islands causing significant damage , but no loss of life .
and back in 1908 , some 75,000 people died when giant waves swept along the sicilian coast . warning system in five or 10 years nearly all tsunamis are caused by underground earthquakes , which typically occur at boundaries between earth 's tectonic plates .
large waves then begin to move through the ocean , away from the earthquake 's epicenter .
tsunamis can be up to 30 meters high and reach speeds of to 1,000 kilometer per hour -lrb- 621 mph -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece and italy are the areas most at risk from a tsunami in the med earthquakes in the mediterranean are mainly caused by the african plate drifting northwards underneath the eurasian plate . " tsunamis could happen at any time , and could be catastrophic " , said jochen zschau , the head of gfz 's earthquake risk department . with 140 million people living along the mediterranean coast , the potential for a disaster is high .
but according to zschau , with so many countries surrounding the mediterranean , coordination of an early warning system is difficult .
he estimates that installing such a system in the region would take five to 10 years . real-time transmission the 45-million-euro -lrb- $ 60.8 million -rrb- gfz project to install early warning buoys in the indian ocean off indonesia is due for completion in 2008 .
the system uses sensors on the ocean floor to detect changes in pressure .
this is sent to a series of buoys on the ocean surface , which , in turn , beam the data by satellite to an observation station .
by using real-time data transmission , tsunamis can be detected more quickly , which gives people more time to flee the oncoming waves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first indonesian tsunami-detecting buoys were installed in november 2005 germany 's federal ministry of education and research , which commissioned the indonesian project , set the condition that the system would also be usable for the atlantic and the mediterranean oceans . " a large part of the early warning system in the indian ocean can be transferred to the mediterranean , " zschau said .
" but of course not all factors are the same , so the system needs to be adjusted for the particular region . " because the mediterranean is a smaller ocean , it takes a tsunami less time to travel from the earthquake 's epicenter to the coast .

he is the man who can beat the frontrunner nicolas sarkozy , according to the polls . when france votes in the first round of the presidential election on april 22 , there will be 12 names on the ballot .
assuming no candidate gets 50 percent of the vote , the top two will then contest a run-off vote on may 6 .
it 's generally assumed that one of those two will be nicolas sarkozy , the former interior minister who has consistently led the opinion polls .
in second place is segolene royal , the socialist mother of four , who has struggled to close the gap with sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just sarko vs sego anymore - bayrou has grabbed the center snapping at royal 's heels is francois bayrou , the centrist leader of the small union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , who emerged , seemingly from nowhere , in mid february , rising to 20 percent in the opinion polls and snatching votes from right and left . most significantly , polling indicates that if he were to edge out royal and make it into the second round , bayrou would beat sarkozy in the run-off . there is only one poll that really counts but in french politics , it does n't do to rely too heavily on the polls .
the world was shocked when the far-right jean-marie le pen edged out his socialist rival to qualify for the run-off in 2002 , a show of support the pollsters had n't predicted .
2007 is widely seen as a " change " election , after 12 years of conservative rule under jacques chirac . according to nicolas sauger , senior researcher at the center for political science research in paris -lrb- cevipof -rrb- , " the 2007 election is characterized by a strange mix of disillusionment , hence the success of francois bayrou who 's an ' anti-system ' candidate , and utopia - with the belief that politics has to reclaim its capacity to change life . " enter bayrou - a 55 year old teacher , academic and politicians who captured the attention of jaded voters with his plans for a unity government , along the lines of germany 's grand coalition , and his aim for a " peaceful revolution " in french politics . it is , says sauger , " a kind of ' populist ' appeal targeting the french middle class . " man of the people , not paris bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after 12 years of chirac , france is entering a new era bayrou still lives in his childhood home in the south-western bearn region of france , where his family has farmed for generations .
he continues to breed horses and is keen to stress his humble roots , recently insisting that documentary maker photograph him on the back of a tractor . a devoutly catholic father of six , who married at age 20 and trained as a teacher , he is keen to cultivate his " man of the people " persona in his appeal to voters .
unlike sarkozy and royal , he is not rich and does not pay the " wealth tax , " declaring assets of just 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 811,000 -rrb- . bayrou 's policy platform is based on the slogan of the " six es " - employment , ecology , education , economy , exclusion and europe .
he also champions moderation of spending in a country that has suffered years of high unemployment -lrb- currently 8.6 percent -rrb- and a huge deficit -lrb- equivalent to 64.6 percent of gdp -rrb- that is leaving many french citizens anxious about the future of their welfare state . " what france needs is for these two parties in power for 25 years to be thrown out of power , out of the comfort of power and the comfort of the opposition , " said bayrou at a packed rally held in a paris concert hall .

he is the man who can beat the frontrunner nicolas sarkozy , according to the polls . when france votes in the first round of the presidential election on april 22 , there will be 12 names on the ballot .
assuming no candidate gets 50 percent of the vote , the top two will then contest a run-off vote on may 6 .
it 's generally assumed that one of those two will be nicolas sarkozy , the former interior minister who has consistently led the opinion polls .
in second place is segolene royal , the socialist mother of four , who has struggled to close the gap with sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just sarko vs sego anymore - bayrou has grabbed the center snapping at royal 's heels is francois bayrou , the centrist leader of the small union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , who emerged , seemingly from nowhere , in mid february , rising to 20 percent in the opinion polls and snatching votes from right and left . most significantly , polling indicates that if he were to edge out royal and make it into the second round , bayrou would beat sarkozy in the run-off . there is only one poll that really counts but in french politics , it does n't do to rely too heavily on the polls .
the world was shocked when the far-right jean-marie le pen edged out his socialist rival to qualify for the run-off in 2002 , a show of support the pollsters had n't predicted .
2007 is widely seen as a " change " election , after 12 years of conservative rule under jacques chirac . according to nicolas sauger , senior researcher at the center for political science research in paris -lrb- cevipof -rrb- , " the 2007 election is characterized by a strange mix of disillusionment , hence the success of francois bayrou who 's an ' anti-system ' candidate , and utopia - with the belief that politics has to reclaim its capacity to change life . " enter bayrou - a 55 year old teacher , academic and politicians who captured the attention of jaded voters with his plans for a unity government , along the lines of germany 's grand coalition , and his aim for a " peaceful revolution " in french politics . it is , says sauger , " a kind of ' populist ' appeal targeting the french middle class .

he continues to breed horses and is keen to stress his humble roots , recently insisting that documentary maker photograph him on the back of a tractor . a devoutly catholic father of six , who married at age 20 and trained as a teacher , he is keen to cultivate his " man of the people " persona in his appeal to voters .
unlike sarkozy and royal , he is not rich and does not pay the " wealth tax , " declaring assets of just 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 811,000 -rrb- . bayrou 's policy platform is based on the slogan of the " six es " - employment , ecology , education , economy , exclusion and europe .
he also champions moderation of spending in a country that has suffered years of high unemployment -lrb- currently 8.6 percent -rrb- and a huge deficit -lrb- equivalent to 64.6 percent of gdp -rrb- that is leaving many french citizens anxious about the future of their welfare state . " what france needs is for these two parties in power for 25 years to be thrown out of power , out of the comfort of power and the comfort of the opposition , " said bayrou at a packed rally held in a paris concert hall .

others , like antonia arias , a 35 year old municipal employee , are undecided but said bayrou appealed to her more than the frontrunners . he has also capitalized on a resentment of so-called " paris political elites , " and a section of the polity who feel alienated from their leaders , by pledging to abolish the calling for the abolition of the elite civil service college , the national administration school -lrb- ena -rrb- , which has produced many of the nations top politicians and public servants , including president jacques chirac and former president valery giscard-d 'estaing ; prime minister dominique de villepin and his predecessors lionel jospin , and socialist presidential candidate segolene royal . ironically , it 's a policy that the far right jean-marie le pen says bayrou had appropriated from him . " we 've been calling for the abolition of ena for years , " le pen told reporters .
" by producing identikit civil servants in a single school , you end up with a kind of aristocracy - which is just how they see themselves . " he 's got the ex per ience bayrou may be keen to stress his modest origins but does n't want anyone to forget his cabinet experience either - he was education minister twice under the right-wing governments of edouard balladur and alain juppe .
in addition , he is an academic author of a dozen books on history and politics , including a biography of king henry iv of france .
his latest , project of hope , has become a bestseller and outlines his vision for france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayrou want to build a unity government from the national assembly however his unity proposal , whilst being one of bayrou 's key selling points , has also proved a weakness .
preaching harmony appeals to a section of the electorate , but it leaves other confused about what he really stands for . sarkozy has attacked bayrou as a political opportunist .
" you think he is on the right , and he has moved to the left .
you think he is on the left and he has moved to the right , " sarkozy said while campaigning outside paris .
" that 's not how you lead the world 's fifth most powerful country . " the socialists accused him of being disingenuous , a right-winger misrepresenting himself as a man of the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left , right or through the center with bayrou ?
bayrou hit back , saying the only way his opponents can work together is " when it comes to shooting down my candidacy , " and says it shows they are nervous . " do you really think that they would be shooting at me like they are if i were an illusion ? " he asked .
" i am the only element of renewal and transformation in the political landscape .

it requires more than 700,000 poles to confess as to whether they were communist spies .
it 's high time , the law 's backers say .
critics have dubbed it a political tool . purging the public sector of communists and establishing a " new , morally irreproachable fourth republic " is a central issue for prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski and his law and justice party , the pis .
he fulfilled a campaign promise by pushing the lustration law - as well as garnering the support of the many poles who felt wronged . " lustration " comes from latin and means purification through ceremony or sacrifice .
the term is used in poland and other central and eastern european countries to describe the process of vetting people for collaborating with their countries ' intelligence services under communist rule . over 700,000 polish public and state sector workers - including politicians , civil servants , judges , lawyers , reporters , professors and the heads of state-owned companies - have until may 15 to declare in writing whether they collaborated with the state security apparatus anytime between july 1944 and july 1990 in communist poland .

but there are problems . doctored files " the law comes much too late and divides polish society , " said dieter bingen , director of the german polish institute . bingen said it was an honorable concern , since the poles had n't dealt with the problems in the 1990s .

conservative journalists below 40 , in particular , the so-called " young wolves , " have backed radical lustration of society .

critics have dubbed it a political tool . purging the public sector of communists and establishing a " new , morally irreproachable fourth republic " is a central issue for prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski and his law and justice party , the pis .
he fulfilled a campaign promise by pushing the lustration law - as well as garnering the support of the many poles who felt wronged . " lustration " comes from latin and means purification through ceremony or sacrifice .
the term is used in poland and other central and eastern european countries to describe the process of vetting people for collaborating with their countries ' intelligence services under communist rule . over 700,000 polish public and state sector workers - including politicians , civil servants , judges , lawyers , reporters , professors and the heads of state-owned companies - have until may 15 to declare in writing whether they collaborated with the state security apparatus anytime between july 1944 and july 1990 in communist poland .
those who fail to do so , or are proven to have lied in their declarations , could be banned from practicing their profession for up to 10 years , according to the law .

beilmann said take-off had gone without a hitch .
the mission took off hours after a rocket-propelled grenade attack near another german base at feisabad .
two grenades had been fired shortly before midnight saturday , a spokesman speaking from the base said .
there were no casualties , although shrapnel fragments had been found on the base .
it was not immediately clear what the target had been .
shooting nothing but pictures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tornados are looking for taliban fighters the tornados , which arrived in afghanistan on april 5 , each carry two high-tech optical cameras along with an infra-red sensor in a pod slung below the fuselage .
their mission is to spy out taliban positions in the southern provinces of helmand , kandahar and uruzgan , where british , canadian and dutch troops are deployed .
under the terms of their six-month mission , they will not fly low- level sorties and will not be used to strike at taliban positions .
some 200 air force personnel are stationed at camp marmal where half the 3,000-strong german military contingent in afghanistan is based .
germans fearful bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear that german involvement in afghanistan could lead to terror attacks at home the mission is controversial in germany .
the opposition left party is still trying to stop it by taking the issue to germany 's constitutional court .
a recent survey showed 74 per cent feared it could trigger terrorist attacks in germany .
there are also fears that german forces could increasingly become drawn into combat operations .
most of the german troops in afghanistan are engaged in infrastructure projects with mixed military and civilian provincial reconstruction teams in the relatively peaceful north of the country .

experts are investigating how to set up an early warning system in the mediterranean , but there are still many issues . the giant waves that hit many asian countries in 2004 killed more than 300,000 people , making them one of the worst disasters in recorded history .
since then , there has been a flurry of activity to develop tsunami early warning systems . germany 's national research center for geosciences -lrb- gfz -rrb- is currently installing such a system in indonesia - but it could save lives in other regions as well . ten percent of all tsunamis world-wide occur in the mediterranean .
in 2003 , a two meter -lrb- 6.6 feet -rrb- high tsunami hit the coast of algeria and spain 's balearic islands causing significant damage , but no loss of life .
and back in 1908 , some 75,000 people died when giant waves swept along the sicilian coast . warning system in five or 10 years nearly all tsunamis are caused by underground earthquakes , which typically occur at boundaries between earth 's tectonic plates .
large waves then begin to move through the ocean , away from the earthquake 's epicenter .
tsunamis can be up to 30 meters high and reach speeds of to 1,000 kilometer per hour -lrb- 621 mph -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece and italy are the areas most at risk from a tsunami in the med earthquakes in the mediterranean are mainly caused by the african plate drifting northwards underneath the eurasian plate . " tsunamis could happen at any time , and could be catastrophic " , said jochen zschau , the head of gfz 's earthquake risk department . with 140 million people living along the mediterranean coast , the potential for a disaster is high .
but according to zschau , with so many countries surrounding the mediterranean , coordination of an early warning system is difficult .
he estimates that installing such a system in the region would take five to 10 years . real-time transmission the 45-million-euro -lrb- $ 60.8 million -rrb- gfz project to install early warning buoys in the indian ocean off indonesia is due for completion in 2008 .
the system uses sensors on the ocean floor to detect changes in pressure .
this is sent to a series of buoys on the ocean surface , which , in turn , beam the data by satellite to an observation station .
by using real-time data transmission , tsunamis can be detected more quickly , which gives people more time to flee the oncoming waves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first indonesian tsunami-detecting buoys were installed in november 2005 germany 's federal ministry of education and research , which commissioned the indonesian project , set the condition that the system would also be usable for the atlantic and the mediterranean oceans . " a large part of the early warning system in the indian ocean can be transferred to the mediterranean , " zschau said .
" but of course not all factors are the same , so the system needs to be adjusted for the particular region . " because the mediterranean is a smaller ocean , it takes a tsunami less time to travel from the earthquake 's epicenter to the coast .
this means the early-warning window is less than for other regions . christine elsaesser -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de asia marks tsunami anniversary , still struggles to rebuild aid from the west , including germany , is helping asian countries come back from the deadly tsunami of 2004 .

but one of the mp3-players is a phoney , said urbaniak .
he and his colleagues at frankfurt airport have seized 20,000 such counterfeit gadgets since last year .
they found most of them in airmail parcels coming in from china . " we estimate that it only costs around two or three euros to produce these gadgets .
when you buy the original , you have to pay a hundred times more , " said the customs officer . piracy up 70 per cent some 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- worth of counterfeit goods have been confiscated at frankfurt airport since january , according to urbaniak , which represents a 70 percent increase over last year . the counterfeit industry hits germany especially hard , said anton börner , president of the german federation of wholesale and foreign trade . " first of all we are a high-wage country and , secondly , we are world champion in exports , " said börner .
" of course the big ones are hit first . " german companies lose 25 billion euros per year as a result of counterfeiting , börner estimates .
but now the industry wants to strike back . tighter controls in place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many pirated goods enter germany via frankfurt airport in a newly launched initiative , german business associations are urging import companies and wholesalers to double-check every product they buy .
his association will provide support , börner says , and help separate the fakes from the originals . the initiative is also backed by the german government , according to bernd pfaffenbach , state secretary in the ministry of economics . " we take these issues very seriously , securing property rights , " pfaffenbach said .
" and we will also take this issue up at the g8 summit in heiligendamm in early june .
we are hopeful that a cooperative approach with china and others involved in these issues might be very fruitful . " neither börner nor pfaffenbach expects product piracy to decrease considerably any time soon .
their goal is to try and curb it until international agreements can be put in place .

beilmann said take-off had gone without a hitch .
the mission took off hours after a rocket-propelled grenade attack near another german base at feisabad .
two grenades had been fired shortly before midnight saturday , a spokesman speaking from the base said .
there were no casualties , although shrapnel fragments had been found on the base .

their mission is to spy out taliban positions in the southern provinces of helmand , kandahar and uruzgan , where british , canadian and dutch troops are deployed .
under the terms of their six-month mission , they will not fly low- level sorties and will not be used to strike at taliban positions .
some 200 air force personnel are stationed at camp marmal where half the 3,000-strong german military contingent in afghanistan is based .

there are also fears that german forces could increasingly become drawn into combat operations .
most of the german troops in afghanistan are engaged in infrastructure projects with mixed military and civilian provincial reconstruction teams in the relatively peaceful north of the country .

experts are investigating how to set up an early warning system in the mediterranean , but there are still many issues . the giant waves that hit many asian countries in 2004 killed more than 300,000 people , making them one of the worst disasters in recorded history .
since then , there has been a flurry of activity to develop tsunami early warning systems . germany 's national research center for geosciences -lrb- gfz -rrb- is currently installing such a system in indonesia - but it could save lives in other regions as well . ten percent of all tsunamis world-wide occur in the mediterranean .
in 2003 , a two meter -lrb- 6.6 feet -rrb- high tsunami hit the coast of algeria and spain 's balearic islands causing significant damage , but no loss of life .
and back in 1908 , some 75,000 people died when giant waves swept along the sicilian coast . warning system in five or 10 years nearly all tsunamis are caused by underground earthquakes , which typically occur at boundaries between earth 's tectonic plates .
large waves then begin to move through the ocean , away from the earthquake 's epicenter .
tsunamis can be up to 30 meters high and reach speeds of to 1,000 kilometer per hour -lrb- 621 mph -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece and italy are the areas most at risk from a tsunami in the med earthquakes in the mediterranean are mainly caused by the african plate drifting northwards underneath the eurasian plate . " tsunamis could happen at any time , and could be catastrophic " , said jochen zschau , the head of gfz 's earthquake risk department . with 140 million people living along the mediterranean coast , the potential for a disaster is high .
but according to zschau , with so many countries surrounding the mediterranean , coordination of an early warning system is difficult .
he estimates that installing such a system in the region would take five to 10 years . real-time transmission the 45-million-euro -lrb- $ 60.8 million -rrb- gfz project to install early warning buoys in the indian ocean off indonesia is due for completion in 2008 .
the system uses sensors on the ocean floor to detect changes in pressure .
this is sent to a series of buoys on the ocean surface , which , in turn , beam the data by satellite to an observation station .
by using real-time data transmission , tsunamis can be detected more quickly , which gives people more time to flee the oncoming waves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first indonesian tsunami-detecting buoys were installed in november 2005 germany 's federal ministry of education and research , which commissioned the indonesian project , set the condition that the system would also be usable for the atlantic and the mediterranean oceans . " a large part of the early warning system in the indian ocean can be transferred to the mediterranean , " zschau said .
" but of course not all factors are the same , so the system needs to be adjusted for the particular region . " because the mediterranean is a smaller ocean , it takes a tsunami less time to travel from the earthquake 's epicenter to the coast .
this means the early-warning window is less than for other regions . christine elsaesser -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de asia marks tsunami anniversary , still struggles to rebuild aid from the west , including germany , is helping asian countries come back from the deadly tsunami of 2004 .

experts are investigating how to set up an early warning system in the mediterranean , but there are still many issues . the giant waves that hit many asian countries in 2004 killed more than 300,000 people , making them one of the worst disasters in recorded history .
since then , there has been a flurry of activity to develop tsunami early warning systems . germany 's national research center for geosciences -lrb- gfz -rrb- is currently installing such a system in indonesia - but it could save lives in other regions as well . ten percent of all tsunamis world-wide occur in the mediterranean .
in 2003 , a two meter -lrb- 6.6 feet -rrb- high tsunami hit the coast of algeria and spain 's balearic islands causing significant damage , but no loss of life .
and back in 1908 , some 75,000 people died when giant waves swept along the sicilian coast . warning system in five or 10 years nearly all tsunamis are caused by underground earthquakes , which typically occur at boundaries between earth 's tectonic plates .
large waves then begin to move through the ocean , away from the earthquake 's epicenter .
tsunamis can be up to 30 meters high and reach speeds of to 1,000 kilometer per hour -lrb- 621 mph -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece and italy are the areas most at risk from a tsunami in the med earthquakes in the mediterranean are mainly caused by the african plate drifting northwards underneath the eurasian plate . " tsunamis could happen at any time , and could be catastrophic " , said jochen zschau , the head of gfz 's earthquake risk department . with 140 million people living along the mediterranean coast , the potential for a disaster is high .
but according to zschau , with so many countries surrounding the mediterranean , coordination of an early warning system is difficult .
he estimates that installing such a system in the region would take five to 10 years . real-time transmission the 45-million-euro -lrb- $ 60.8 million -rrb- gfz project to install early warning buoys in the indian ocean off indonesia is due for completion in 2008 .
the system uses sensors on the ocean floor to detect changes in pressure .
this is sent to a series of buoys on the ocean surface , which , in turn , beam the data by satellite to an observation station .
by using real-time data transmission , tsunamis can be detected more quickly , which gives people more time to flee the oncoming waves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first indonesian tsunami-detecting buoys were installed in november 2005 germany 's federal ministry of education and research , which commissioned the indonesian project , set the condition that the system would also be usable for the atlantic and the mediterranean oceans . " a large part of the early warning system in the indian ocean can be transferred to the mediterranean , " zschau said .
" but of course not all factors are the same , so the system needs to be adjusted for the particular region . " because the mediterranean is a smaller ocean , it takes a tsunami less time to travel from the earthquake 's epicenter to the coast .
this means the early-warning window is less than for other regions . christine elsaesser -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de asia marks tsunami anniversary , still struggles to rebuild aid from the west , including germany , is helping asian countries come back from the deadly tsunami of 2004 .

" his comments came after german culture minister bernd neumann refused to allow the bust of nefertiti - renowned as one of history 's great beauties - to be exhibited in egypt because it was too delicate to be transported . " experts have reservations about taking nefertiti on a long trip , which we have to take seriously , " neumann said in reaction to a campaign launched in germany under the title " nefertiti travels " to loan the bust to egypt for a limited period . long history of disagreements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nefertiti 's gaze has fascinated berlin visitors for almost a century cairo and berlin have frequently crossed swords over the limestone bust , which was unearthed by german archaeologists in an artist 's studio on the banks of the nile and taken to germany under a 1913 agreement . it was described by adolf hitler as " a true treasure .

beilmann said take-off had gone without a hitch .
the mission took off hours after a rocket-propelled grenade attack near another german base at feisabad .
two grenades had been fired shortly before midnight saturday , a spokesman speaking from the base said .
there were no casualties , although shrapnel fragments had been found on the base .
it was not immediately clear what the target had been .

their mission is to spy out taliban positions in the southern provinces of helmand , kandahar and uruzgan , where british , canadian and dutch troops are deployed .
under the terms of their six-month mission , they will not fly low- level sorties and will not be used to strike at taliban positions .
some 200 air force personnel are stationed at camp marmal where half the 3,000-strong german military contingent in afghanistan is based .

the opposition left party is still trying to stop it by taking the issue to germany 's constitutional court .
a recent survey showed 74 per cent feared it could trigger terrorist attacks in germany .
there are also fears that german forces could increasingly become drawn into combat operations .
most of the german troops in afghanistan are engaged in infrastructure projects with mixed military and civilian provincial reconstruction teams in the relatively peaceful north of the country .

experts are investigating how to set up an early warning system in the mediterranean , but there are still many issues . the giant waves that hit many asian countries in 2004 killed more than 300,000 people , making them one of the worst disasters in recorded history .
since then , there has been a flurry of activity to develop tsunami early warning systems . germany 's national research center for geosciences -lrb- gfz -rrb- is currently installing such a system in indonesia - but it could save lives in other regions as well . ten percent of all tsunamis world-wide occur in the mediterranean .

" a large part of the early warning system in the indian ocean can be transferred to the mediterranean , " zschau said .
" but of course not all factors are the same , so the system needs to be adjusted for the particular region . " because the mediterranean is a smaller ocean , it takes a tsunami less time to travel from the earthquake 's epicenter to the coast .

it requires more than 700,000 poles to confess as to whether they were communist spies .
it 's high time , the law 's backers say .
critics have dubbed it a political tool . purging the public sector of communists and establishing a " new , morally irreproachable fourth republic " is a central issue for prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski and his law and justice party , the pis .
he fulfilled a campaign promise by pushing the lustration law - as well as garnering the support of the many poles who felt wronged . " lustration " comes from latin and means purification through ceremony or sacrifice .
the term is used in poland and other central and eastern european countries to describe the process of vetting people for collaborating with their countries ' intelligence services under communist rule . over 700,000 polish public and state sector workers - including politicians , civil servants , judges , lawyers , reporters , professors and the heads of state-owned companies - have until may 15 to declare in writing whether they collaborated with the state security apparatus anytime between july 1944 and july 1990 in communist poland .
those who fail to do so , or are proven to have lied in their declarations , could be banned from practicing their profession for up to 10 years , according to the law .
righting wrongs since the communist regime was dissolved in 1989 , numerous high political officials have been exposed as former communist functionaries .
ex-spies who have used insider knowledge to make money repeatedly show up on lists of the richest poles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wielgus resigned when his past became public nor has the clergy been exempt , as exemplified by the resignation and confession of the archbishop-designate of warsaw , stanislaw wielgus , in january .
communist state security files showed he had been a secret agent . poland has been lethargic when it comes to lustration .
before leaving power , the oppositional solidarity trade union agreed with the communists to forget the pre-1989 past .
still , in the 1990s there were attempts to use the courts to track down so-called system opportunists , but they were only limited to a small circle of leading politicians and civil servants .
by now expanding lustration to the entire polish elite , lawmakers are going further than all their post-communist neighbors .
but there are problems . doctored files " the law comes much too late and divides polish society , " said dieter bingen , director of the german polish institute . bingen said it was an honorable concern , since the poles had n't dealt with the problems in the 1990s .
but the approach this time employed the " lawnmower principle , " suggesting cultivation of a culture of suspicion .
also , examining hundreds of thousands of declarations would take years , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the kaczynskis are using the law to target the left that will be the task of the institute of national remembrance -lrb- ipn -rrb- , which has the communist secret service 's files .
but can it trust the papers ? " the materials and documents about secret service activities were often doctored in retrospect , besides being incomplete , " bingen said .
even prime minister kaczynski described his own file as a crudely made fake , he added .
political aims ?
conservative journalists below 40 , in particular , the so-called " young wolves , " have backed radical lustration of society .
others , however , see the law as an instrument to morally discredit anyone who is left of the party of kaczynski and his twin brother , bingen said . the fight between the two sides is especially fierce among poland 's newspapers , whose journalists are also obligated to pen declarations about their pasts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adam michnik 's paper has been fighting the law under its editor-in-chief , former anti-communist dissident adam michnik , the liberal daily gazeta wyborcza has been a leader in the protest against the law .
conservative daily rzeczpospolita is on kaczynski 's side , arguing that as the fourth estate , journalists must also be willing to reveal their pasts . poland 's highest court could overthrow the law in may .
but if it does not , lustration might just have some unpleasant consequences for the right 's ideals of a moral poland .
the law would mainly have an impact on people who were part of the anti-communist opposition , bingen said .
in reality , the opposition was repeatedly forced to deal with secret service agents in one way or another . the possibility " that the reputation of the ' system opposition ' as a whole could suffer damage ca n't be the kaczynski brothers ' intention , " bingen said . andreas leixnering -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland cracks down on liberal media a group of polish journalists are refusing to be screened by the government .

now counterfeiters are copying more and more hi-tech products , such as microphones , stereo systems and mp3-players .
german industry is looking for new ways to fight back . around two thirds of the fake goods come from asia , harming established brands all over the world .
german industry is now looking for new ways to combat product piracy . what 's fake and what 's real ?
looking at the two ipods in customs officer andreas urbaniak 's hand , it 's hard to tell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real or fake ?
but one of the mp3-players is a phoney , said urbaniak .
he and his colleagues at frankfurt airport have seized 20,000 such counterfeit gadgets since last year .
they found most of them in airmail parcels coming in from china . " we estimate that it only costs around two or three euros to produce these gadgets .
when you buy the original , you have to pay a hundred times more , " said the customs officer . piracy up 70 per cent some 50 million euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- worth of counterfeit goods have been confiscated at frankfurt airport since january , according to urbaniak , which represents a 70 percent increase over last year . the counterfeit industry hits germany especially hard , said anton börner , president of the german federation of wholesale and foreign trade . " first of all we are a high-wage country and , secondly , we are world champion in exports , " said börner .
" of course the big ones are hit first . " german companies lose 25 billion euros per year as a result of counterfeiting , börner estimates .

a boycott , wildung said , " would n't bring any significant change , " adding that the last time germany had borrowed a piece from egypt was in 1985 . on sunday , egyptian antiquities supremo zahi hawass told the country 's parliament " -lrb- egypt -rrb- will never again organize antiquities exhibitions in germany if it refuses a request , to be issued next week , to allow the bust of nefertiti to be displayed in egypt for three months . " his comments came after german culture minister bernd neumann refused to allow the bust of nefertiti - renowned as one of history 's great beauties - to be exhibited in egypt because it was too delicate to be transported . " experts have reservations about taking nefertiti on a long trip , which we have to take seriously , " neumann said in reaction to a campaign launched in germany under the title " nefertiti travels " to loan the bust to egypt for a limited period . long history of disagreements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nefertiti 's gaze has fascinated berlin visitors for almost a century cairo and berlin have frequently crossed swords over the limestone bust , which was unearthed by german archaeologists in an artist 's studio on the banks of the nile and taken to germany under a 1913 agreement . it was described by adolf hitler as " a true treasure . " a row broke out in 2003 when the berlin museum allowed artists to temporarily attach the bust to a bronze statue of a naked woman . too old to travel ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bust is expected to stay on berlin 's museum island , which is currently undergoing a major renovation nefertiti was the wife of pharaoh akhenaton , remembered for having switched his kingdom to monotheism with the worship of one sun god , aton . hawass has made it his mission to retrieve egypt 's widely scattered antiquities that can be found in museums around the world . but the prussian cultural heritage foundation , which is responsible for berlin 's art treasures , also ruled out a return to egypt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 15.04.2007 communist screening law divides polish society großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public sector workers are obligated to expose their communist pasts poland 's new lustration law has split the country .
it requires more than 700,000 poles to confess as to whether they were communist spies .
it 's high time , the law 's backers say .
critics have dubbed it a political tool . purging the public sector of communists and establishing a " new , morally irreproachable fourth republic " is a central issue for prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski and his law and justice party , the pis .
he fulfilled a campaign promise by pushing the lustration law - as well as garnering the support of the many poles who felt wronged . " lustration " comes from latin and means purification through ceremony or sacrifice .
the term is used in poland and other central and eastern european countries to describe the process of vetting people for collaborating with their countries ' intelligence services under communist rule . over 700,000 polish public and state sector workers - including politicians , civil servants , judges , lawyers , reporters , professors and the heads of state-owned companies - have until may 15 to declare in writing whether they collaborated with the state security apparatus anytime between july 1944 and july 1990 in communist poland .
those who fail to do so , or are proven to have lied in their declarations , could be banned from practicing their profession for up to 10 years , according to the law .
righting wrongs since the communist regime was dissolved in 1989 , numerous high political officials have been exposed as former communist functionaries .
ex-spies who have used insider knowledge to make money repeatedly show up on lists of the richest poles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wielgus resigned when his past became public nor has the clergy been exempt , as exemplified by the resignation and confession of the archbishop-designate of warsaw , stanislaw wielgus , in january .
communist state security files showed he had been a secret agent . poland has been lethargic when it comes to lustration .
before leaving power , the oppositional solidarity trade union agreed with the communists to forget the pre-1989 past .
still , in the 1990s there were attempts to use the courts to track down so-called system opportunists , but they were only limited to a small circle of leading politicians and civil servants .
by now expanding lustration to the entire polish elite , lawmakers are going further than all their post-communist neighbors .
but there are problems . doctored files " the law comes much too late and divides polish society , " said dieter bingen , director of the german polish institute . bingen said it was an honorable concern , since the poles had n't dealt with the problems in the 1990s .
but the approach this time employed the " lawnmower principle , " suggesting cultivation of a culture of suspicion .
also , examining hundreds of thousands of declarations would take years , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the kaczynskis are using the law to target the left that will be the task of the institute of national remembrance -lrb- ipn -rrb- , which has the communist secret service 's files .
but can it trust the papers ? " the materials and documents about secret service activities were often doctored in retrospect , besides being incomplete , " bingen said .
even prime minister kaczynski described his own file as a crudely made fake , he added .
political aims ?
conservative journalists below 40 , in particular , the so-called " young wolves , " have backed radical lustration of society .
others , however , see the law as an instrument to morally discredit anyone who is left of the party of kaczynski and his twin brother , bingen said . the fight between the two sides is especially fierce among poland 's newspapers , whose journalists are also obligated to pen declarations about their pasts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adam michnik 's paper has been fighting the law under its editor-in-chief , former anti-communist dissident adam michnik , the liberal daily gazeta wyborcza has been a leader in the protest against the law .
conservative daily rzeczpospolita is on kaczynski 's side , arguing that as the fourth estate , journalists must also be willing to reveal their pasts . poland 's highest court could overthrow the law in may .
but if it does not , lustration might just have some unpleasant consequences for the right 's ideals of a moral poland .
the law would mainly have an impact on people who were part of the anti-communist opposition , bingen said .
in reality , the opposition was repeatedly forced to deal with secret service agents in one way or another . the possibility " that the reputation of the ' system opposition ' as a whole could suffer damage ca n't be the kaczynski brothers ' intention , " bingen said . andreas leixnering -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland cracks down on liberal media a group of polish journalists are refusing to be screened by the government .

it requires more than 700,000 poles to confess as to whether they were communist spies .
it 's high time , the law 's backers say .
critics have dubbed it a political tool . purging the public sector of communists and establishing a " new , morally irreproachable fourth republic " is a central issue for prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski and his law and justice party , the pis .
he fulfilled a campaign promise by pushing the lustration law - as well as garnering the support of the many poles who felt wronged . " lustration " comes from latin and means purification through ceremony or sacrifice .
the term is used in poland and other central and eastern european countries to describe the process of vetting people for collaborating with their countries ' intelligence services under communist rule . over 700,000 polish public and state sector workers - including politicians , civil servants , judges , lawyers , reporters , professors and the heads of state-owned companies - have until may 15 to declare in writing whether they collaborated with the state security apparatus anytime between july 1944 and july 1990 in communist poland .
those who fail to do so , or are proven to have lied in their declarations , could be banned from practicing their profession for up to 10 years , according to the law .
righting wrongs since the communist regime was dissolved in 1989 , numerous high political officials have been exposed as former communist functionaries .
ex-spies who have used insider knowledge to make money repeatedly show up on lists of the richest poles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wielgus resigned when his past became public nor has the clergy been exempt , as exemplified by the resignation and confession of the archbishop-designate of warsaw , stanislaw wielgus , in january .
communist state security files showed he had been a secret agent . poland has been lethargic when it comes to lustration .
before leaving power , the oppositional solidarity trade union agreed with the communists to forget the pre-1989 past .
still , in the 1990s there were attempts to use the courts to track down so-called system opportunists , but they were only limited to a small circle of leading politicians and civil servants .
by now expanding lustration to the entire polish elite , lawmakers are going further than all their post-communist neighbors .
but there are problems . doctored files " the law comes much too late and divides polish society , " said dieter bingen , director of the german polish institute . bingen said it was an honorable concern , since the poles had n't dealt with the problems in the 1990s .
but the approach this time employed the " lawnmower principle , " suggesting cultivation of a culture of suspicion .
also , examining hundreds of thousands of declarations would take years , he added .

but can it trust the papers ? " the materials and documents about secret service activities were often doctored in retrospect , besides being incomplete , " bingen said .
even prime minister kaczynski described his own file as a crudely made fake , he added .
political aims ?
conservative journalists below 40 , in particular , the so-called " young wolves , " have backed radical lustration of society .
others , however , see the law as an instrument to morally discredit anyone who is left of the party of kaczynski and his twin brother , bingen said . the fight between the two sides is especially fierce among poland 's newspapers , whose journalists are also obligated to pen declarations about their pasts .

conservative daily rzeczpospolita is on kaczynski 's side , arguing that as the fourth estate , journalists must also be willing to reveal their pasts . poland 's highest court could overthrow the law in may .
but if it does not , lustration might just have some unpleasant consequences for the right 's ideals of a moral poland .
the law would mainly have an impact on people who were part of the anti-communist opposition , bingen said .
in reality , the opposition was repeatedly forced to deal with secret service agents in one way or another . the possibility " that the reputation of the ' system opposition ' as a whole could suffer damage ca n't be the kaczynski brothers ' intention , " bingen said . andreas leixnering -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland cracks down on liberal media a group of polish journalists are refusing to be screened by the government .

a boycott , wildung said , " would n't bring any significant change , " adding that the last time germany had borrowed a piece from egypt was in 1985 . on sunday , egyptian antiquities supremo zahi hawass told the country 's parliament " -lrb- egypt -rrb- will never again organize antiquities exhibitions in germany if it refuses a request , to be issued next week , to allow the bust of nefertiti to be displayed in egypt for three months . " his comments came after german culture minister bernd neumann refused to allow the bust of nefertiti - renowned as one of history 's great beauties - to be exhibited in egypt because it was too delicate to be transported . " experts have reservations about taking nefertiti on a long trip , which we have to take seriously , " neumann said in reaction to a campaign launched in germany under the title " nefertiti travels " to loan the bust to egypt for a limited period . long history of disagreements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nefertiti 's gaze has fascinated berlin visitors for almost a century cairo and berlin have frequently crossed swords over the limestone bust , which was unearthed by german archaeologists in an artist 's studio on the banks of the nile and taken to germany under a 1913 agreement . it was described by adolf hitler as " a true treasure .

he is the man who can beat the frontrunner nicolas sarkozy , according to the polls . when france votes in the first round of the presidential election on april 22 , there will be 12 names on the ballot .
assuming no candidate gets 50 percent of the vote , the top two will then contest a run-off vote on may 6 .
it 's generally assumed that one of those two will be nicolas sarkozy , the former interior minister who has consistently led the opinion polls .
in second place is segolene royal , the socialist mother of four , who has struggled to close the gap with sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just sarko vs sego anymore - bayrou has grabbed the center snapping at royal 's heels is francois bayrou , the centrist leader of the small union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , who emerged , seemingly from nowhere , in mid february , rising to 20 percent in the opinion polls and snatching votes from right and left . most significantly , polling indicates that if he were to edge out royal and make it into the second round , bayrou would beat sarkozy in the run-off . there is only one poll that really counts but in french politics , it does n't do to rely too heavily on the polls .
the world was shocked when the far-right jean-marie le pen edged out his socialist rival to qualify for the run-off in 2002 , a show of support the pollsters had n't predicted .
2007 is widely seen as a " change " election , after 12 years of conservative rule under jacques chirac . according to nicolas sauger , senior researcher at the center for political science research in paris -lrb- cevipof -rrb- , " the 2007 election is characterized by a strange mix of disillusionment , hence the success of francois bayrou who 's an ' anti-system ' candidate , and utopia - with the belief that politics has to reclaim its capacity to change life . " enter bayrou - a 55 year old teacher , academic and politicians who captured the attention of jaded voters with his plans for a unity government , along the lines of germany 's grand coalition , and his aim for a " peaceful revolution " in french politics . it is , says sauger , " a kind of ' populist ' appeal targeting the french middle class .

he continues to breed horses and is keen to stress his humble roots , recently insisting that documentary maker photograph him on the back of a tractor . a devoutly catholic father of six , who married at age 20 and trained as a teacher , he is keen to cultivate his " man of the people " persona in his appeal to voters .
unlike sarkozy and royal , he is not rich and does not pay the " wealth tax , " declaring assets of just 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 811,000 -rrb- . bayrou 's policy platform is based on the slogan of the " six es " - employment , ecology , education , economy , exclusion and europe .
he also champions moderation of spending in a country that has suffered years of high unemployment -lrb- currently 8.6 percent -rrb- and a huge deficit -lrb- equivalent to 64.6 percent of gdp -rrb- that is leaving many french citizens anxious about the future of their welfare state . " what france needs is for these two parties in power for 25 years to be thrown out of power , out of the comfort of power and the comfort of the opposition , " said bayrou at a packed rally held in a paris concert hall .
the rally attracted over 6,000 people , an impressive turnout for a politician not well known in the capital . an alternative to the status quo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too close to call - unexpected success for le pen in 2002 drove thousands onto the streets in protest his message is attractive to jaded voters sick of the major parties . " he can unite us , " said high school teacher frederic monier , 29 , at the rally . " i want a change and i say why not bayrou ? " said 30-year-old sebastian marque , who works in a film studio .
others , like antonia arias , a 35 year old municipal employee , are undecided but said bayrou appealed to her more than the frontrunners . he has also capitalized on a resentment of so-called " paris political elites , " and a section of the polity who feel alienated from their leaders , by pledging to abolish the calling for the abolition of the elite civil service college , the national administration school -lrb- ena -rrb- , which has produced many of the nations top politicians and public servants , including president jacques chirac and former president valery giscard-d 'estaing ; prime minister dominique de villepin and his predecessors lionel jospin , and socialist presidential candidate segolene royal . ironically , it 's a policy that the far right jean-marie le pen says bayrou had appropriated from him . " we 've been calling for the abolition of ena for years , " le pen told reporters .
" by producing identikit civil servants in a single school , you end up with a kind of aristocracy - which is just how they see themselves . " he 's got the ex per ience bayrou may be keen to stress his modest origins but does n't want anyone to forget his cabinet experience either - he was education minister twice under the right-wing governments of edouard balladur and alain juppe .

preaching harmony appeals to a section of the electorate , but it leaves other confused about what he really stands for . sarkozy has attacked bayrou as a political opportunist .
" you think he is on the right , and he has moved to the left .

he is the man who can beat the frontrunner nicolas sarkozy , according to the polls . when france votes in the first round of the presidential election on april 22 , there will be 12 names on the ballot .
assuming no candidate gets 50 percent of the vote , the top two will then contest a run-off vote on may 6 .
it 's generally assumed that one of those two will be nicolas sarkozy , the former interior minister who has consistently led the opinion polls .
in second place is segolene royal , the socialist mother of four , who has struggled to close the gap with sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just sarko vs sego anymore - bayrou has grabbed the center snapping at royal 's heels is francois bayrou , the centrist leader of the small union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , who emerged , seemingly from nowhere , in mid february , rising to 20 percent in the opinion polls and snatching votes from right and left . most significantly , polling indicates that if he were to edge out royal and make it into the second round , bayrou would beat sarkozy in the run-off . there is only one poll that really counts but in french politics , it does n't do to rely too heavily on the polls .
the world was shocked when the far-right jean-marie le pen edged out his socialist rival to qualify for the run-off in 2002 , a show of support the pollsters had n't predicted .
2007 is widely seen as a " change " election , after 12 years of conservative rule under jacques chirac . according to nicolas sauger , senior researcher at the center for political science research in paris -lrb- cevipof -rrb- , " the 2007 election is characterized by a strange mix of disillusionment , hence the success of francois bayrou who 's an ' anti-system ' candidate , and utopia - with the belief that politics has to reclaim its capacity to change life . " enter bayrou - a 55 year old teacher , academic and politicians who captured the attention of jaded voters with his plans for a unity government , along the lines of germany 's grand coalition , and his aim for a " peaceful revolution " in french politics . it is , says sauger , " a kind of ' populist ' appeal targeting the french middle class .

he continues to breed horses and is keen to stress his humble roots , recently insisting that documentary maker photograph him on the back of a tractor . a devoutly catholic father of six , who married at age 20 and trained as a teacher , he is keen to cultivate his " man of the people " persona in his appeal to voters .
unlike sarkozy and royal , he is not rich and does not pay the " wealth tax , " declaring assets of just 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 811,000 -rrb- . bayrou 's policy platform is based on the slogan of the " six es " - employment , ecology , education , economy , exclusion and europe .
he also champions moderation of spending in a country that has suffered years of high unemployment -lrb- currently 8.6 percent -rrb- and a huge deficit -lrb- equivalent to 64.6 percent of gdp -rrb- that is leaving many french citizens anxious about the future of their welfare state . " what france needs is for these two parties in power for 25 years to be thrown out of power , out of the comfort of power and the comfort of the opposition , " said bayrou at a packed rally held in a paris concert hall .
the rally attracted over 6,000 people , an impressive turnout for a politician not well known in the capital . an alternative to the status quo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too close to call - unexpected success for le pen in 2002 drove thousands onto the streets in protest his message is attractive to jaded voters sick of the major parties . " he can unite us , " said high school teacher frederic monier , 29 , at the rally . " i want a change and i say why not bayrou ? " said 30-year-old sebastian marque , who works in a film studio .
others , like antonia arias , a 35 year old municipal employee , are undecided but said bayrou appealed to her more than the frontrunners . he has also capitalized on a resentment of so-called " paris political elites , " and a section of the polity who feel alienated from their leaders , by pledging to abolish the calling for the abolition of the elite civil service college , the national administration school -lrb- ena -rrb- , which has produced many of the nations top politicians and public servants , including president jacques chirac and former president valery giscard-d 'estaing ; prime minister dominique de villepin and his predecessors lionel jospin , and socialist presidential candidate segolene royal . ironically , it 's a policy that the far right jean-marie le pen says bayrou had appropriated from him . " we 've been calling for the abolition of ena for years , " le pen told reporters .
" by producing identikit civil servants in a single school , you end up with a kind of aristocracy - which is just how they see themselves . " he 's got the ex per ience bayrou may be keen to stress his modest origins but does n't want anyone to forget his cabinet experience either - he was education minister twice under the right-wing governments of edouard balladur and alain juppe .
in addition , he is an academic author of a dozen books on history and politics , including a biography of king henry iv of france .
his latest , project of hope , has become a bestseller and outlines his vision for france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayrou want to build a unity government from the national assembly however his unity proposal , whilst being one of bayrou 's key selling points , has also proved a weakness .
preaching harmony appeals to a section of the electorate , but it leaves other confused about what he really stands for . sarkozy has attacked bayrou as a political opportunist .
" you think he is on the right , and he has moved to the left .

he is the man who can beat the frontrunner nicolas sarkozy , according to the polls . when france votes in the first round of the presidential election on april 22 , there will be 12 names on the ballot .
assuming no candidate gets 50 percent of the vote , the top two will then contest a run-off vote on may 6 .
it 's generally assumed that one of those two will be nicolas sarkozy , the former interior minister who has consistently led the opinion polls .
in second place is segolene royal , the socialist mother of four , who has struggled to close the gap with sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just sarko vs sego anymore - bayrou has grabbed the center snapping at royal 's heels is francois bayrou , the centrist leader of the small union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , who emerged , seemingly from nowhere , in mid february , rising to 20 percent in the opinion polls and snatching votes from right and left . most significantly , polling indicates that if he were to edge out royal and make it into the second round , bayrou would beat sarkozy in the run-off . there is only one poll that really counts but in french politics , it does n't do to rely too heavily on the polls .
the world was shocked when the far-right jean-marie le pen edged out his socialist rival to qualify for the run-off in 2002 , a show of support the pollsters had n't predicted .
2007 is widely seen as a " change " election , after 12 years of conservative rule under jacques chirac . according to nicolas sauger , senior researcher at the center for political science research in paris -lrb- cevipof -rrb- , " the 2007 election is characterized by a strange mix of disillusionment , hence the success of francois bayrou who 's an ' anti-system ' candidate , and utopia - with the belief that politics has to reclaim its capacity to change life . " enter bayrou - a 55 year old teacher , academic and politicians who captured the attention of jaded voters with his plans for a unity government , along the lines of germany 's grand coalition , and his aim for a " peaceful revolution " in french politics . it is , says sauger , " a kind of ' populist ' appeal targeting the french middle class .

he continues to breed horses and is keen to stress his humble roots , recently insisting that documentary maker photograph him on the back of a tractor . a devoutly catholic father of six , who married at age 20 and trained as a teacher , he is keen to cultivate his " man of the people " persona in his appeal to voters .
unlike sarkozy and royal , he is not rich and does not pay the " wealth tax , " declaring assets of just 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 811,000 -rrb- . bayrou 's policy platform is based on the slogan of the " six es " - employment , ecology , education , economy , exclusion and europe .
he also champions moderation of spending in a country that has suffered years of high unemployment -lrb- currently 8.6 percent -rrb- and a huge deficit -lrb- equivalent to 64.6 percent of gdp -rrb- that is leaving many french citizens anxious about the future of their welfare state . " what france needs is for these two parties in power for 25 years to be thrown out of power , out of the comfort of power and the comfort of the opposition , " said bayrou at a packed rally held in a paris concert hall .
the rally attracted over 6,000 people , an impressive turnout for a politician not well known in the capital . an alternative to the status quo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too close to call - unexpected success for le pen in 2002 drove thousands onto the streets in protest his message is attractive to jaded voters sick of the major parties .

others , like antonia arias , a 35 year old municipal employee , are undecided but said bayrou appealed to her more than the frontrunners . he has also capitalized on a resentment of so-called " paris political elites , " and a section of the polity who feel alienated from their leaders , by pledging to abolish the calling for the abolition of the elite civil service college , the national administration school -lrb- ena -rrb- , which has produced many of the nations top politicians and public servants , including president jacques chirac and former president valery giscard-d 'estaing ; prime minister dominique de villepin and his predecessors lionel jospin , and socialist presidential candidate segolene royal . ironically , it 's a policy that the far right jean-marie le pen says bayrou had appropriated from him . " we 've been calling for the abolition of ena for years , " le pen told reporters .
" by producing identikit civil servants in a single school , you end up with a kind of aristocracy - which is just how they see themselves . " he 's got the ex per ience bayrou may be keen to stress his modest origins but does n't want anyone to forget his cabinet experience either - he was education minister twice under the right-wing governments of edouard balladur and alain juppe .

he is the man who can beat the frontrunner nicolas sarkozy , according to the polls . when france votes in the first round of the presidential election on april 22 , there will be 12 names on the ballot .
assuming no candidate gets 50 percent of the vote , the top two will then contest a run-off vote on may 6 .
it 's generally assumed that one of those two will be nicolas sarkozy , the former interior minister who has consistently led the opinion polls .
in second place is segolene royal , the socialist mother of four , who has struggled to close the gap with sarkozy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just sarko vs sego anymore - bayrou has grabbed the center snapping at royal 's heels is francois bayrou , the centrist leader of the small union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , who emerged , seemingly from nowhere , in mid february , rising to 20 percent in the opinion polls and snatching votes from right and left . most significantly , polling indicates that if he were to edge out royal and make it into the second round , bayrou would beat sarkozy in the run-off . there is only one poll that really counts but in french politics , it does n't do to rely too heavily on the polls .
the world was shocked when the far-right jean-marie le pen edged out his socialist rival to qualify for the run-off in 2002 , a show of support the pollsters had n't predicted .
2007 is widely seen as a " change " election , after 12 years of conservative rule under jacques chirac . according to nicolas sauger , senior researcher at the center for political science research in paris -lrb- cevipof -rrb- , " the 2007 election is characterized by a strange mix of disillusionment , hence the success of francois bayrou who 's an ' anti-system ' candidate , and utopia - with the belief that politics has to reclaim its capacity to change life . " enter bayrou - a 55 year old teacher , academic and politicians who captured the attention of jaded voters with his plans for a unity government , along the lines of germany 's grand coalition , and his aim for a " peaceful revolution " in french politics . it is , says sauger , " a kind of ' populist ' appeal targeting the french middle class .

unlike sarkozy and royal , he is not rich and does not pay the " wealth tax , " declaring assets of just 600,000 euros -lrb- $ 811,000 -rrb- . bayrou 's policy platform is based on the slogan of the " six es " - employment , ecology , education , economy , exclusion and europe .
he also champions moderation of spending in a country that has suffered years of high unemployment -lrb- currently 8.6 percent -rrb- and a huge deficit -lrb- equivalent to 64.6 percent of gdp -rrb- that is leaving many french citizens anxious about the future of their welfare state . " what france needs is for these two parties in power for 25 years to be thrown out of power , out of the comfort of power and the comfort of the opposition , " said bayrou at a packed rally held in a paris concert hall .
the rally attracted over 6,000 people , an impressive turnout for a politician not well known in the capital . an alternative to the status quo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too close to call - unexpected success for le pen in 2002 drove thousands onto the streets in protest his message is attractive to jaded voters sick of the major parties .

others , like antonia arias , a 35 year old municipal employee , are undecided but said bayrou appealed to her more than the frontrunners . he has also capitalized on a resentment of so-called " paris political elites , " and a section of the polity who feel alienated from their leaders , by pledging to abolish the calling for the abolition of the elite civil service college , the national administration school -lrb- ena -rrb- , which has produced many of the nations top politicians and public servants , including president jacques chirac and former president valery giscard-d 'estaing ; prime minister dominique de villepin and his predecessors lionel jospin , and socialist presidential candidate segolene royal . ironically , it 's a policy that the far right jean-marie le pen says bayrou had appropriated from him .

at the welsh language pressure group cymuned 's conference , richard brunstrom said the 1993 act was outdated and said he was doing his duty by raising it .
plaid cymru and the lib dems defended mr brunstrom 's comments while the tories said they would revise the act .
labour favoured " partnership " rather than compulsion as the way forward .
in the speech , made at cymuned 's conference in penrhyndeudaraeth on saturday , mr brunstrom urged the next assembly to consider using its new powers to reform the welsh language act .
he said politicians should pass measures to protect the right of welsh speakers to use the language with public and private organisations .
make recommendations while accepting that the 1993 welsh language act had secured a future for the welsh language , mr brunstrom argued it had outlived its usefulness .
defending the comments , mr brunstrom said that he had a duty as a senior police officer to make recommendations and suggestions to elected politicians about policies which would lead to more cohesion and less tension within communities .
earlier in the week , mr brunstrom was criticised by one north wales labour mp for making a political statement .
he denied that he had crossed the line which prevented public officials from making political statements or causing political controversy .
he was he said , doing his duty .
plaid cymru 's alun ffred jones hit back at the criticism and said the police chief was entitled to express his views .
urgent update " richard brunstrom has already shown his commitment to a fully bilingual police service and is entitled to express his opinions on the inadequacies of the current legislation , " he said .
liberal democrat welsh language spokesperson eleanor burnham said mr brunstrom was right to attack the welsh language act which needed " to be updated urgently " .
" that is why we are proposing to use the assembly 's new powers to do just that . "
in a statement , labour said its manifesto made it clear that working in partnership was the way to increase use and participation in the welsh language rather than through compulsion .
welsh conservatives welsh language spokesperson lisa francis said they would review and revise the act to build on legislation introduced when they were last in government .

at the welsh language pressure group cymuned 's conference , richard brunstrom said the 1993 act was outdated and said he was doing his duty by raising it .
plaid cymru and the lib dems defended mr brunstrom 's comments while the tories said they would revise the act .
labour favoured " partnership " rather than compulsion as the way forward .
in the speech , made at cymuned 's conference in penrhyndeudaraeth on saturday , mr brunstrom urged the next assembly to consider using its new powers to reform the welsh language act .
he said politicians should pass measures to protect the right of welsh speakers to use the language with public and private organisations .

" that is why we are proposing to use the assembly 's new powers to do just that . "
in a statement , labour said its manifesto made it clear that working in partnership was the way to increase use and participation in the welsh language rather than through compulsion .

the road in south wales poses " the biggest single threat to wildlife " , the gwent wildlife trust has claimed .
if it goes ahead , it said damage will be caused to the gwent levels sites of special scientific interest -lrb- sssis -rrb- .
the planned 15-mile three-lane motorway was announced in 2004 and is expected to cost at least £ 350m to build .
it has been designed to combat one of the most congested stretches of the m4 .
the welsh assembly government said it was part of its transport strategy for the area .
the proposed route crosses the gwent levels including several sssis and it is this that wildlife campaigners fear will be damaged .
julian branscombe from the gwent wildlife trust , which held an open day on friday to highlight the issue to around 150 visitors to the magor marsh site , said : " the proposed road will not provide relief , it will encourage more car use .
" it wo n't relive congestion , more cars will use the road and this all contributes to global warming .
environmentalists fear the road will have a negative effect on the area " there are alternatives to be had .
we have got a wetland wonderland at the moment and the impact on the environment will be severe if the road goes ahead . "
the gwent levels comprises an ancient farming landscape of grazing marshes and drainage ditches and is home to a variety of species of rare creatures .
steven rogers , also from the gwent wildlife trust added : " surely our politicians owe us more .
" as modern , well-educated people , they should have the wit to find more sensible , sustainable solutions to our transport problems . "
according to the welsh assembly government website : " great care will be taken to minimise the effects on the sssis by using previous industrial land where feasible " .
studies are being carried out about the proposed road .
peter fox , the conservative candidate for the area in the forthcoming assembly elections , described the issue as " a balancing act " .
" i 'm extremely concerned about what the proposed road could do to the local environment but i 'm also aware of the need to do something about the road system too , " he said .
concerns a labour spokeswoman said : " labour is committed to both improving transport links in wales and protecting our environment and local wildlife .
" data gathering for a full environmental impact assessment of the proposed relief road has been under way since may 2006 .
this assessment will identify measures to prevent , reduce and where possible offset any adverse effects on the local environment . "
plaid cymru 's candidate trefor puw said : " we have serious environmental concerns about the m4 relief road and its effect on the gwent levels .
" plaid believes that the money could be better spent improving public transport and the gwent transport infrastructure . "
ed townsend , standing for the liberal democrats , said : " when you start looking at the need for building roads , there are balances to be struck .
" we have to balance the needs of the natural environment and the people who live in the urban environment .
" on balance , i come down on the side of the road .
the place is grinding to a halt .
" in an ideal world better public transport is a far more attractive option but until that time , we have to do something about the motorway . "

elected mp for kilmarnock and loudoun in 1997 , this key ally of chancellor gordon brown is described at westminster as a " safe pair of hands " .
so it is surprising to many that the 55-year-old former solicitor finds himself in his current predicament .
tory leader david cameron has said mr browne may have to resign if his explanation for allowing the crew to sell their stories to newspapers and tv is not adequate .
prime minister tony blair has said it was wrong " in hindsight " .
mr browne has accepted full responsibility for the decision but said the sailors and marines held captive had to be able to speak out " to counteract the propaganda the iranians had put out using them " .
wars he is due to give a full report to parliament on monday , with the tories waiting to see whether to launch a stronger attack on his conduct .
it is the first time mr browne 's competency as defence secretary has come under such intense scrutiny .
since he took on the job last year , the wars in iraq and afghanistan - and the question of whether to withdraw or send more troops - has dominated the agenda .
mr browne has also been a staunch defender of the government 's decision to replace the uk 's trident nuclear weapons system .
he is politically close to his near-namesake gordon brown and is thought likely to maintain high-profile role if the chancellor becomes prime minister later this year .
part of the 1997 general election intake , mr browne was close to the late donald dewar serving as his parliamentary private secretary during his final year as scottish secretary .
after the 2001 election , he was appointed a parliamentary secretary to the northern ireland office .
' careful ' in 2003 he was made work and pensions minister and less than a year later became immigration minister .
mr browne entered the cabinet in 2005 , at the chancellor 's side as chief secretary to the treasury , before moving to the defence brief during the reshuffle last may .
bbc scotland 's political correspondent , glenn campbell has described mr browne as " serious , thorough and careful " , adding that he could be summed up as " mr middle of the road " .
" if that makes him sound like a typical scottish solicitor , then that 's because he probably is . "
mr browne was born in ayrshire in 1952 , where he attended st michael 's academy in kilwinning .
he later attended glasgow university .
in his previous career he specialised in child and family law and was involved in handling the high-profile orkney child sex abuse case .
fellow lawyer gordon jackson qc , who has known him since the 1970s , said he had a " natural inclination to be a power behind the throne " .
mr browne supports celtic football club , where he attends matches with his wife and two sons .
his early contributions in the commons were largely on social security reform and the child support agency .
he also made use of his expertise on human rights law to support the incorporation of the european convention on human rights into uk law .

elected mp for kilmarnock and loudoun in 1997 , this key ally of chancellor gordon brown is described at westminster as a " safe pair of hands " .
so it is surprising to many that the 55-year-old former solicitor finds himself in his current predicament .
tory leader david cameron has said mr browne may have to resign if his explanation for allowing the crew to sell their stories to newspapers and tv is not adequate .
prime minister tony blair has said it was wrong " in hindsight " .
mr browne has accepted full responsibility for the decision but said the sailors and marines held captive had to be able to speak out " to counteract the propaganda the iranians had put out using them " .
wars he is due to give a full report to parliament on monday , with the tories waiting to see whether to launch a stronger attack on his conduct .
it is the first time mr browne 's competency as defence secretary has come under such intense scrutiny .
since he took on the job last year , the wars in iraq and afghanistan - and the question of whether to withdraw or send more troops - has dominated the agenda .
mr browne has also been a staunch defender of the government 's decision to replace the uk 's trident nuclear weapons system .
he is politically close to his near-namesake gordon brown and is thought likely to maintain high-profile role if the chancellor becomes prime minister later this year .
part of the 1997 general election intake , mr browne was close to the late donald dewar serving as his parliamentary private secretary during his final year as scottish secretary .
after the 2001 election , he was appointed a parliamentary secretary to the northern ireland office .
' careful ' in 2003 he was made work and pensions minister and less than a year later became immigration minister .
mr browne entered the cabinet in 2005 , at the chancellor 's side as chief secretary to the treasury , before moving to the defence brief during the reshuffle last may .
bbc scotland 's political correspondent , glenn campbell has described mr browne as " serious , thorough and careful " , adding that he could be summed up as " mr middle of the road " .
" if that makes him sound like a typical scottish solicitor , then that 's because he probably is . "
mr browne was born in ayrshire in 1952 , where he attended st michael 's academy in kilwinning .
he later attended glasgow university .
in his previous career he specialised in child and family law and was involved in handling the high-profile orkney child sex abuse case .
fellow lawyer gordon jackson qc , who has known him since the 1970s , said he had a " natural inclination to be a power behind the throne " .
mr browne supports celtic football club , where he attends matches with his wife and two sons .
his early contributions in the commons were largely on social security reform and the child support agency .
he also made use of his expertise on human rights law to support the incorporation of the european convention on human rights into uk law .

possible causes , according to the sunday papers , include the prince 's army career , his party lifestyle and interference from the royal family .
the bbc 's nicholas witchell believes the prince would have faced pressure to decide if he wanted to get married .
clarence house has not yet commented on the split .
the break-up is examined in great detail in the sunday newspapers , although there is little agreement on the reasons for the split of the couple who met at st andrews university , fife , in 2001 .
miss middleton 's career and the views of her family have also been cited as causes . "
they should be left alone now without reams of stuff being written " tony blair a royal romance flounders are media to blame for split ?
it has been suggested that the prince 's move to an army camp in dorset , and miss middleton continuing her life in london , may have put a strain on the relationship .
while liberal democrat president simon hughes blamed the intense media pressure on miss middleton as a factor in the split .
prime minister tony blair said he thought both of them should be " allowed to get on with their lives " .
he told bbc1 's politics show : " they should be left alone now without reams of stuff being written that i can assure you , from my experience of royal stories - most of which will be complete nonsense . "
our correspondent said his family may well have told the 24-year-old prince to " make his intentions clear " over the relationship .
he said after an awful lot of soul-searching , the couple had decided to go their separate ways in a split that is being described as amicable .
glare of publicity peter hunt , another bbc royal correspondent , added that the prince may well have sought advice from the queen .
he said : " prince william is a very cautious individual ... he wants to remain in control .
" but i can well imagine that if he had come , in his mind , to a decision that maybe it was n't working out with kate , he will have discussed it with his grandparents .
" prince phillip and the queen may well have said to him you need to act because their concern is kate middleton left hanging out to dry if there was no prospect , ultimately , of marriage . "
from students to sweethearts dickie arbiter , a former royal press secretary , said miss middleton could have " troubled times ahead " .
" it is going to be difficult for her , difficult in forming a new relationship without the glare of the cameras on her , " he said .
" and the cameras are going to be on her for a while to see what she does and how she copes with it . "
publicist max clifford said newspaper editors had already made it clear they would pay handsomely if miss middleton , or one of her close friends , was to sell their story .
mr arbiter said william , meanwhile , would be looked after in the " security and the comfort of the bosom of the army " .
the prince is an officer in the household cavalry 's blues and royals .
miss middleton , who works as an accessories buyer for a fashion company , attended the prince 's graduation from sandhurst military academy in december .
it was the first time she had attended such a high-profile event , at which the queen and other senior royals were present .

the participants gathered at a square in the city centre , but were encircled by a similar number of riot police and prevented from marching .
smaller groups clashed with police after the main rally finished .
several opposition leaders were arrested .
ex-chess champion garry kasparov was among 170 held in the moscow march .
mr kasparov was freed several hours later after being fined $ 40 -lrb- £ 20 -rrb- for public order offences .
the protesters , allied under the other russia coalition , say president vladimir putin is stifling democracy .
march banned reports say eduard limonov , leader of the radical national bolshevik party , and several other organisers were arrested .

a reporter for the private moscow echo radio station said before the rally that he saw interior ministry troops and a water cannon in the city , adding that people could be forgiven for thinking a military operation was about to start .
demonstrators were seen holding flags of various groups including that of the liberal yabloko party and the hammer and sickle banner of the national bolsheviks .
mr kasparov was swiftly brought before a court but correspondents say the turnout was not as good as the organisers might have hoped .
organisers contemplated whether to try to march down the city 's main street , but were blocked by police and began to disperse after two hours .
one group of demonstrators who avoided the encirclement tried to march but were stopped at a nearby railway station , where scuffles broke out with police , local media said .
reports say several people were beaten by police , including an elderly man .
russian authorities sanctioned the rally but banned any marching .
president vladimir putin denies the opposition charge that he is trampling on democracy , accusing the opposition of destabilising russia .
in moscow on saturday , a huge security operation , including more than 9,000 police , was launched to prevent protesters from gathering at pushkin square .
mr kasparov 's swift arrest followed warnings by the prosecution office on the eve of the march , stating that anyone participating risked being detained .

a spokesman for germany 's biggest airline said iberia was " of strategic interest to lufthansa in principle " .
however , he reiterated comments made by lufthansa 's boss that the spanish firm was currently " too expensive " .
iberia revealed last month that private equity firm texas pacific group was targeting the airline with a 3.4bn-euro -lrb- £ 2.3bn ; $ 4.5bn -rrb- takeover approach .
takeover rumours surrounding the airline have seen iberia 's shares soar by almost 80 % in the last six months .
an " open skies " deal between the us and europe is set to drive consolidation in the airline industry , analysts say .
" deal possible " german business magazine wirtschaftswoche reported that lufthansa boss wolfgang mayrhuber had put together a team of managers and outside experts to analyse a possible counter bid for iberia .
a combined lufthansa-iberia would create a european giant carrying about 70 million passengers a year , rivalling current european market leader air france-klm .
" a deal in april is possible , " wirtschaftswoche reported .
" if someone else now goes and buys iberia , it 'll either be off the market or it 'll be on offer at an even higher price in two years time . "
texas pacific 's 3.4bn-euro approach values iberia at 3.6 euros per share , although shares in the carrier closed up at 3.99 euros on the madrid stock exchange on friday , suggesting investors believe a higher bid is likely .
british airways has previously been linked to a possible bid approach for iberia .
the uk carrier owns 10 % of the spanish airline , and has first refusal to buy another 32 % .

a spokesman for germany 's biggest airline said iberia was " of strategic interest to lufthansa in principle " .
however , he reiterated comments made by lufthansa 's boss that the spanish firm was currently " too expensive " .
iberia revealed last month that private equity firm texas pacific group was targeting the airline with a 3.4bn-euro -lrb- £ 2.3bn ; $ 4.5bn -rrb- takeover approach .
takeover rumours surrounding the airline have seen iberia 's shares soar by almost 80 % in the last six months .
an " open skies " deal between the us and europe is set to drive consolidation in the airline industry , analysts say .
" deal possible " german business magazine wirtschaftswoche reported that lufthansa boss wolfgang mayrhuber had put together a team of managers and outside experts to analyse a possible counter bid for iberia .
a combined lufthansa-iberia would create a european giant carrying about 70 million passengers a year , rivalling current european market leader air france-klm .
" a deal in april is possible , " wirtschaftswoche reported .
" if someone else now goes and buys iberia , it 'll either be off the market or it 'll be on offer at an even higher price in two years time . "
texas pacific 's 3.4bn-euro approach values iberia at 3.6 euros per share , although shares in the carrier closed up at 3.99 euros on the madrid stock exchange on friday , suggesting investors believe a higher bid is likely .
british airways has previously been linked to a possible bid approach for iberia .

the prime minister told bbc one 's politics show that most of the media coverage about the couple 's split would turn out to be " complete nonsense " .
speculation has been mounting about why the prince and miss middleton recently ended their four-year relationship .
the break-up was examined in great detail in the sunday newspapers .
i think , now it has been announced , they should be allowed to get on with their lives tony blair a royal romance flounders are media to blame for split ?
mr blair said the announcement about the ending of the couple 's relationship should now end the issue .
" they should be left alone now without reams of stuff being written that i can assure you , from my experience of royal stories , most of which will be complete nonsense , " he said .
" i think , now it has been announced , they should be allowed to get on with their lives . "
' public glare ' he said much of what was bad about being in the public eye was media reporting that was either unfair or untrue .
" my experience of it actually is that what concerns people is not so much the invasion of their privacy as such , because i think most people in public life accept that you are bound to be a public issue and item in that sense , " he said .
" i think it is more that usually whatever is discussed about you publicly is surrounded by a whole lot of other stuff that is either unfair or sometimes completely untrue and that is the thing that really gets people down . "
the break-up was examined in great detail in the sunday newspapers , although there was little agreement on the reasons for the split of the couple who met at st andrews university , fife , in 2001 .

miss middleton 's career and the views of her family have also been cited as causes .
from students to sweethearts it has been suggested that the 24-year-old prince 's move to an army camp in dorset , and miss middleton , 25 , continuing her life in london , may have put a strain on the relationship .
while liberal democrat president simon hughes blamed the intense media pressure on miss middleton as a factor in the split .

the prime minister told bbc one 's politics show that most of the media coverage about the couple 's split would turn out to be " complete nonsense " .

library service membership figures show that women make up 66 % of users , according to the research carried out by cumbria county council .
just 10 % of library-users are aged between 15 and 29 , despite making up about 20 % of the population .
the county council will use the figures to try to come up with ways to encourage more people to use its library services .
researchers also found that the black and minority ethnic community make good use of services .
older people also make up the vast majority of mobile library users .
councillor roger bingham , cabinet member responsible for the county 's library service , said : " this information is already being used to shape and develop policies which will hopefully attract more people to use the county 's services .
" in particular , we are focusing on younger library users through family reading days and book groups for youngsters of all ages which will hopefully encourage a life-long habit of library use . "
