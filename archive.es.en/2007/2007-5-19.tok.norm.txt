" i heard of this underhanded attack with great shock , " merkel said in a statement released in berlin .
" this perfidious murder fills all of us with disgust . "
she said the bombing was aimed at preventing the process of reconstruction in afghanistan from becoming a success , " but added that the international community was resolved to continue helping afghans create a better future for themselves .

six afghan shopkeepers and civilian passers-by were killed and another 14 were wounded , omar said .
" we received intelligence information a couple of days ago that four would-be suicide bombers entered the city and would use motorcycles to carry out their attacks , " omar said , adding that the police started searching motorbikes on thursday .
he said that the security forces would intensify their search to track down the remaining bombers .
general noor mohammad omarkhail , provincial security chief of the kunduz police , described the condition of seven of the wounded afghans as critical .

the attack was expected to lead to renewed debate in germany about whether german soldiers should be posted to afghanistan .

east germany 's darling car turns 50 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other car in the world is such a powerful symbol of a bygone era looking like a cross between a golf cart and an amusement park bumper car , the trabant - a sluggish two-cylinder vehicle from east germany - was arguably the most venerated object of desire behind the iron curtain . the trabants , or trabis for short , were in production in the german democratic republic without any significant change for more than three decades .
and although the last new trabi hit the roads in 1991 , the vehicle - which turns 50 this year - has gained cult status in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis evoke memories of living in the gdr " i love my car , it 's like a child to me , " said christian marotz , board member of the trabant club berlin , a group that devotes a good deal of time and personal finance investment into all things trabant .
" it symbolizes a simpler life from earlier , in the east … oh , and insurance is cheap too , because they are n't stolen very often ! "
accidentally , a car the first trabi rolled off the factory floor in 1957 .
it was actually never really intended to be a car , but was planned as a three-wheeled motorcycle .
and even though the designers only expected production to last about 10 years , it ended up lasting 34 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last trabant left the assembly line on april 30 , 1991 the name trabant means " fellow traveler , " or satellite , and was inspired by the russian satellite sputnik , which went into space the year went on sale .
television ads by the trabant 's maker , the sachsenring automobile works in east germany , praised the trabi for offering " a lot of room for your luggage " and for being " agile , " " fast , " " long-lasting " and " robust , " but in reality the car left much to be desired .
at the time the trabi was launched , western countries already used cars with cleaner and more efficient engines .
the trabi 's own motor was a two-stroke affair with just two cylinders .
it delivered all of 25 horsepower , and took a full 21 seconds to get from 0 to 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- per hour .
its top speed was all of 112 kilometers per hour .
an entirely different perspective the trabi 's a little thing .
just under 360 cm -lrb- 140 inches -rrb- long , about 150 cm wide and 146 cm tall .
in today 's world of hummers and other suvs , it 's a real shrimp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's a real beauty !
while it had a steel frame , the body was made of something called duroplast - a form of hardened plastic made of cotton waste from russia and resins from the east german dye industry .
" it was the average car people would have in east germany , " said johannes drexler , who is a tour guide for trabi safari , a company in berlin that allows people to see berlin 's sites from the vantage point of this micro car .
" everyone tried to afford a trabant during the east german times .
you had to have yourself put on a list and you had to wait for the car between 11 and 15 years , " drexler said .
the 11 or 15 years was for those lucky enough to be living in berlin , which enjoyed some advantages over other parts of east germany .
those in other places could wait up to 18 years to get their car .
pure luxury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis were never this colorful before the fall of the berlin wall the trabi was probably one of the only cars that was more expensive to buy used than it was new .
a new trabi would set you back between 8,500 and 12,500 east german marks .
for a used car , which you could get much faster , you could pay as much as 4,000 more .
" to have a car in east germany was considered to be pure luxury , " drexler said .
the trabi plant in the city of zwickau churned out around 3.7 million of the cars in 34 years .
some were exported to other communist countries .
today , there are still about 58,000 trabis in use in germany , about 85 percent of them in the former east .
when the berlin wall fell in 1989 , the trabi was still produced for two more years .
but many easterners wanted flashier western cars at the time , so the market dried up .
numerous trabi jokes , however , have survived to this day .
how do you double the value of a trabant ?
fill up its gas tank .
why does the trabi have a heated rear window ?
it keeps your hands warm while you push it .
environmental concerns what finally might spell the end of the trabi - at least on the roads - is not ridicule , or even a lack of replacement parts .
it could be growing concerns about the environment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabi exhaust fumes can even be bought in cans as trabi fragrance trabis are not the " greenest " cars going .
they were n't built with pollution-reducing catalytic converters .
one study found that they spew about nine times as many hydrocarbons and five times as much carbon monoxide as most other cars in western europe .
in several cities in germany , restrictions are being put in place that will prohibit cars from entering city centers if they do n't meet certain environmental standards .
and those standards are getting tougher .
at the moment , the german government makes an exception for trabants to be on the road , because they are n't being made anymore .
but that could end , especially if eu rules begin to supercede german ones .
in the next few months , many vintage car fans will be holding protests to champion their cars as cultural artifacts which should be given a dispensation to stay on the streets and not just be relegated to garages or museums .
" well , you have to stay optimistic in order to get your point across , but in reality , it does n't look so good for us . "

east germany 's darling car turns 50 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other car in the world is such a powerful symbol of a bygone era looking like a cross between a golf cart and an amusement park bumper car , the trabant - a sluggish two-cylinder vehicle from east germany - was arguably the most venerated object of desire behind the iron curtain . the trabants , or trabis for short , were in production in the german democratic republic without any significant change for more than three decades .
and although the last new trabi hit the roads in 1991 , the vehicle - which turns 50 this year - has gained cult status in germany .

they were n't built with pollution-reducing catalytic converters .
one study found that they spew about nine times as many hydrocarbons and five times as much carbon monoxide as most other cars in western europe .
in several cities in germany , restrictions are being put in place that will prohibit cars from entering city centers if they do n't meet certain environmental standards .
and those standards are getting tougher .
at the moment , the german government makes an exception for trabants to be on the road , because they are n't being made anymore .
but that could end , especially if eu rules begin to supercede german ones .
in the next few months , many vintage car fans will be holding protests to champion their cars as cultural artifacts which should be given a dispensation to stay on the streets and not just be relegated to garages or museums .

the german soldiers were hit while shopping in a market in the town of kunduz , the provincial governor told afp .
" three of our german friends were killed and two were wounded .
one afghan interpreter was also wounded , " kunduz governor mohammad omar said .
six afghans were killed and 12 others wounded , six of them critically , he said .
all that was left of the bomber was two legs , omar said .
worst attack in years for germans the attack was the most deadly against the german troops since 2003 , when four were killed in a suicide car bombing in kabul .
nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- media office in the capital kabul confirmed there had been an explosion but said it had no details .
the german military based in the main northern city of mazar-i-sharif said it could not yet release any information .
germany has around 3,000 troops in afghanistan , operating largely in the north of the country .
twenty-one german soldiers have lost their lives in afghanistan since 2002 , including the ones killed on saturday .
around 60 foreign soldiers involved in the international mission to afghanistan have died this year , most of them in attacks or combat inside the country .
coalition claims to have killed dozens in another attack on saturday , a district police chief and one of his bodyguards were killed in a remote controlled bomb explosion in the eastern province of nangarhar , a district chief said .
an afghan general reported saturday meanwhile that soldiers from the army and the coalition led by the united states had killed 67 taliban in an ambush in the eastern province of paktia , near the border with pakistan .
" their bodies were lying on the ground , " general sami-ul haq badar told afp .
the soldiers had been tipped off that there were taliban in the area , he said .
the coalition announced separately that an estimated " several dozen enemy fighters " were killed in battles around midnight friday about 60 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- from kabul in kapisa province .
the death tolls issued by the military are impossible to verify independently .
the taliban , a movement rooted in an ultraconservative interpretation of islam , was removed from government nearly six years ago by the coalition .
thousands of foreign troops arrived soon afterwards to help stabilize the fragile and fractured country but they have been unable to tame the insurgents , who are supported by the al-qaeda movement .
taliban threatened revenge in the biggest success against the taliban , the group 's famously brutal top military commander mullah dadullah was killed a week ago in the southern province of helmand after being tracked from the border with pakistan .
the group threatened this week a wave of violence , including suicide bombings , roadside blasts and attacks to avenge his killing .
they said a suicide car bomb aimed at the governor of the southern province of kandahar on thursday was part of this campaign .
the governor was not in the targeted motorcade but the information and culture minister abdul karim khoram was wounded . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany criticizes us over afghan civilian deaths german defense minister franz josef jung has called for a rethink of us military tactics in afghanistan after us coalition operations caused a spate of civilian casualties .

the german soldiers were hit while shopping in a market in the town of kunduz , the provincial governor told afp .
" three of our german friends were killed and two were wounded .
one afghan interpreter was also wounded , " kunduz governor mohammad omar said .
six afghans were killed and 12 others wounded , six of them critically , he said .
all that was left of the bomber was two legs , omar said .
worst attack in years for germans the attack was the most deadly against the german troops since 2003 , when four were killed in a suicide car bombing in kabul .
nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- media office in the capital kabul confirmed there had been an explosion but said it had no details .
the german military based in the main northern city of mazar-i-sharif said it could not yet release any information .
germany has around 3,000 troops in afghanistan , operating largely in the north of the country .
twenty-one german soldiers have lost their lives in afghanistan since 2002 , including the ones killed on saturday .
around 60 foreign soldiers involved in the international mission to afghanistan have died this year , most of them in attacks or combat inside the country .
coalition claims to have killed dozens in another attack on saturday , a district police chief and one of his bodyguards were killed in a remote controlled bomb explosion in the eastern province of nangarhar , a district chief said .
an afghan general reported saturday meanwhile that soldiers from the army and the coalition led by the united states had killed 67 taliban in an ambush in the eastern province of paktia , near the border with pakistan .
" their bodies were lying on the ground , " general sami-ul haq badar told afp .
the soldiers had been tipped off that there were taliban in the area , he said .
the coalition announced separately that an estimated " several dozen enemy fighters " were killed in battles around midnight friday about 60 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- from kabul in kapisa province .
the death tolls issued by the military are impossible to verify independently .
the taliban , a movement rooted in an ultraconservative interpretation of islam , was removed from government nearly six years ago by the coalition .
thousands of foreign troops arrived soon afterwards to help stabilize the fragile and fractured country but they have been unable to tame the insurgents , who are supported by the al-qaeda movement .
taliban threatened revenge in the biggest success against the taliban , the group 's famously brutal top military commander mullah dadullah was killed a week ago in the southern province of helmand after being tracked from the border with pakistan .
the group threatened this week a wave of violence , including suicide bombings , roadside blasts and attacks to avenge his killing .
they said a suicide car bomb aimed at the governor of the southern province of kandahar on thursday was part of this campaign .
the governor was not in the targeted motorcade but the information and culture minister abdul karim khoram was wounded . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany criticizes us over afghan civilian deaths german defense minister franz josef jung has called for a rethink of us military tactics in afghanistan after us coalition operations caused a spate of civilian casualties .

east germany 's darling car turns 50 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other car in the world is such a powerful symbol of a bygone era looking like a cross between a golf cart and an amusement park bumper car , the trabant - a sluggish two-cylinder vehicle from east germany - was arguably the most venerated object of desire behind the iron curtain . the trabants , or trabis for short , were in production in the german democratic republic without any significant change for more than three decades .
and although the last new trabi hit the roads in 1991 , the vehicle - which turns 50 this year - has gained cult status in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis evoke memories of living in the gdr " i love my car , it 's like a child to me , " said christian marotz , board member of the trabant club berlin , a group that devotes a good deal of time and personal finance investment into all things trabant .
" it symbolizes a simpler life from earlier , in the east … oh , and insurance is cheap too , because they are n't stolen very often ! "
accidentally , a car the first trabi rolled off the factory floor in 1957 .
it was actually never really intended to be a car , but was planned as a three-wheeled motorcycle .
and even though the designers only expected production to last about 10 years , it ended up lasting 34 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last trabant left the assembly line on april 30 , 1991 the name trabant means " fellow traveler , " or satellite , and was inspired by the russian satellite sputnik , which went into space the year went on sale .
television ads by the trabant 's maker , the sachsenring automobile works in east germany , praised the trabi for offering " a lot of room for your luggage " and for being " agile , " " fast , " " long-lasting " and " robust , " but in reality the car left much to be desired .
at the time the trabi was launched , western countries already used cars with cleaner and more efficient engines .
the trabi 's own motor was a two-stroke affair with just two cylinders .
it delivered all of 25 horsepower , and took a full 21 seconds to get from 0 to 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- per hour .
its top speed was all of 112 kilometers per hour .

while it had a steel frame , the body was made of something called duroplast - a form of hardened plastic made of cotton waste from russia and resins from the east german dye industry .
" it was the average car people would have in east germany , " said johannes drexler , who is a tour guide for trabi safari , a company in berlin that allows people to see berlin 's sites from the vantage point of this micro car .
" everyone tried to afford a trabant during the east german times .
you had to have yourself put on a list and you had to wait for the car between 11 and 15 years , " drexler said .
the 11 or 15 years was for those lucky enough to be living in berlin , which enjoyed some advantages over other parts of east germany .
those in other places could wait up to 18 years to get their car .
pure luxury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis were never this colorful before the fall of the berlin wall the trabi was probably one of the only cars that was more expensive to buy used than it was new .
a new trabi would set you back between 8,500 and 12,500 east german marks .
for a used car , which you could get much faster , you could pay as much as 4,000 more .
" to have a car in east germany was considered to be pure luxury , " drexler said .
the trabi plant in the city of zwickau churned out around 3.7 million of the cars in 34 years .
some were exported to other communist countries .
today , there are still about 58,000 trabis in use in germany , about 85 percent of them in the former east .
when the berlin wall fell in 1989 , the trabi was still produced for two more years .
but many easterners wanted flashier western cars at the time , so the market dried up .
numerous trabi jokes , however , have survived to this day .
how do you double the value of a trabant ?
fill up its gas tank .
why does the trabi have a heated rear window ?
it keeps your hands warm while you push it .
environmental concerns what finally might spell the end of the trabi - at least on the roads - is not ridicule , or even a lack of replacement parts .
it could be growing concerns about the environment .

they were n't built with pollution-reducing catalytic converters .
one study found that they spew about nine times as many hydrocarbons and five times as much carbon monoxide as most other cars in western europe .
in several cities in germany , restrictions are being put in place that will prohibit cars from entering city centers if they do n't meet certain environmental standards .
and those standards are getting tougher .
at the moment , the german government makes an exception for trabants to be on the road , because they are n't being made anymore .
but that could end , especially if eu rules begin to supercede german ones .
in the next few months , many vintage car fans will be holding protests to champion their cars as cultural artifacts which should be given a dispensation to stay on the streets and not just be relegated to garages or museums .

the german soldiers were hit while shopping in a market in the town of kunduz , the provincial governor told afp .
" three of our german friends were killed and two were wounded .
one afghan interpreter was also wounded , " kunduz governor mohammad omar said .
six afghans were killed and 12 others wounded , six of them critically , he said .
all that was left of the bomber was two legs , omar said .
worst attack in years for germans the attack was the most deadly against the german troops since 2003 , when four were killed in a suicide car bombing in kabul .
nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- media office in the capital kabul confirmed there had been an explosion but said it had no details .
the german military based in the main northern city of mazar-i-sharif said it could not yet release any information .
germany has around 3,000 troops in afghanistan , operating largely in the north of the country .
twenty-one german soldiers have lost their lives in afghanistan since 2002 , including the ones killed on saturday .
around 60 foreign soldiers involved in the international mission to afghanistan have died this year , most of them in attacks or combat inside the country .
coalition claims to have killed dozens in another attack on saturday , a district police chief and one of his bodyguards were killed in a remote controlled bomb explosion in the eastern province of nangarhar , a district chief said .
an afghan general reported saturday meanwhile that soldiers from the army and the coalition led by the united states had killed 67 taliban in an ambush in the eastern province of paktia , near the border with pakistan .
" their bodies were lying on the ground , " general sami-ul haq badar told afp .
the soldiers had been tipped off that there were taliban in the area , he said .
the coalition announced separately that an estimated " several dozen enemy fighters " were killed in battles around midnight friday about 60 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- from kabul in kapisa province .
the death tolls issued by the military are impossible to verify independently .
the taliban , a movement rooted in an ultraconservative interpretation of islam , was removed from government nearly six years ago by the coalition .
thousands of foreign troops arrived soon afterwards to help stabilize the fragile and fractured country but they have been unable to tame the insurgents , who are supported by the al-qaeda movement .
taliban threatened revenge in the biggest success against the taliban , the group 's famously brutal top military commander mullah dadullah was killed a week ago in the southern province of helmand after being tracked from the border with pakistan .
the group threatened this week a wave of violence , including suicide bombings , roadside blasts and attacks to avenge his killing .
they said a suicide car bomb aimed at the governor of the southern province of kandahar on thursday was part of this campaign .
the governor was not in the targeted motorcade but the information and culture minister abdul karim khoram was wounded . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany criticizes us over afghan civilian deaths german defense minister franz josef jung has called for a rethink of us military tactics in afghanistan after us coalition operations caused a spate of civilian casualties .

east germany 's darling car turns 50 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other car in the world is such a powerful symbol of a bygone era looking like a cross between a golf cart and an amusement park bumper car , the trabant - a sluggish two-cylinder vehicle from east germany - was arguably the most venerated object of desire behind the iron curtain . the trabants , or trabis for short , were in production in the german democratic republic without any significant change for more than three decades .
and although the last new trabi hit the roads in 1991 , the vehicle - which turns 50 this year - has gained cult status in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis evoke memories of living in the gdr " i love my car , it 's like a child to me , " said christian marotz , board member of the trabant club berlin , a group that devotes a good deal of time and personal finance investment into all things trabant .
" it symbolizes a simpler life from earlier , in the east … oh , and insurance is cheap too , because they are n't stolen very often ! "
accidentally , a car the first trabi rolled off the factory floor in 1957 .
it was actually never really intended to be a car , but was planned as a three-wheeled motorcycle .
and even though the designers only expected production to last about 10 years , it ended up lasting 34 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last trabant left the assembly line on april 30 , 1991 the name trabant means " fellow traveler , " or satellite , and was inspired by the russian satellite sputnik , which went into space the year went on sale .
television ads by the trabant 's maker , the sachsenring automobile works in east germany , praised the trabi for offering " a lot of room for your luggage " and for being " agile , " " fast , " " long-lasting " and " robust , " but in reality the car left much to be desired .
at the time the trabi was launched , western countries already used cars with cleaner and more efficient engines .
the trabi 's own motor was a two-stroke affair with just two cylinders .
it delivered all of 25 horsepower , and took a full 21 seconds to get from 0 to 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- per hour .
its top speed was all of 112 kilometers per hour .
an entirely different perspective the trabi 's a little thing .
just under 360 cm -lrb- 140 inches -rrb- long , about 150 cm wide and 146 cm tall .
in today 's world of hummers and other suvs , it 's a real shrimp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's a real beauty !
while it had a steel frame , the body was made of something called duroplast - a form of hardened plastic made of cotton waste from russia and resins from the east german dye industry .
" it was the average car people would have in east germany , " said johannes drexler , who is a tour guide for trabi safari , a company in berlin that allows people to see berlin 's sites from the vantage point of this micro car .
" everyone tried to afford a trabant during the east german times .
you had to have yourself put on a list and you had to wait for the car between 11 and 15 years , " drexler said .
the 11 or 15 years was for those lucky enough to be living in berlin , which enjoyed some advantages over other parts of east germany .
those in other places could wait up to 18 years to get their car .
pure luxury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis were never this colorful before the fall of the berlin wall the trabi was probably one of the only cars that was more expensive to buy used than it was new .
a new trabi would set you back between 8,500 and 12,500 east german marks .
for a used car , which you could get much faster , you could pay as much as 4,000 more .
" to have a car in east germany was considered to be pure luxury , " drexler said .
the trabi plant in the city of zwickau churned out around 3.7 million of the cars in 34 years .
some were exported to other communist countries .
today , there are still about 58,000 trabis in use in germany , about 85 percent of them in the former east .
when the berlin wall fell in 1989 , the trabi was still produced for two more years .
but many easterners wanted flashier western cars at the time , so the market dried up .
numerous trabi jokes , however , have survived to this day .
how do you double the value of a trabant ?
fill up its gas tank .
why does the trabi have a heated rear window ?
it keeps your hands warm while you push it .

" i heard of this underhanded attack with great shock , " merkel said in a statement released in berlin .
" this perfidious murder fills all of us with disgust . "
she said the bombing was aimed at preventing the process of reconstruction in afghanistan from becoming a success , " but added that the international community was resolved to continue helping afghans create a better future for themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the bombing would n't deter the international community three german soldiers were killed and three wounded while six afghan civilians were killed and 14 others wounded when a suicide attacker detonated his explosive-laden vest in northern afghanistan , officials said .
provincial governor mohammad omar told german news agency dpa that three german soldiers were killed and two soldiers and an interpreter were wounded when the bomber struck in chaiferoshi market in kunduz on saturday morning .
six afghan shopkeepers and civilian passers-by were killed and another 14 were wounded , omar said .
" we received intelligence information a couple of days ago that four would-be suicide bombers entered the city and would use motorcycles to carry out their attacks , " omar said , adding that the police started searching motorbikes on thursday .
he said that the security forces would intensify their search to track down the remaining bombers .
general noor mohammad omarkhail , provincial security chief of the kunduz police , described the condition of seven of the wounded afghans as critical .
taliban claims responsibility a spokesperson for the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul confirmed the incident in a statement , but said that three isaf soldiers and five afghans were killed and 10 , including two isaf soldiers , were wounded .

taliban militants took responsibility for the attack and said 11 german soldiers were killed in the suicide blast that destroyed the windows of the shops as far as one kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- .
" today at 11:00 a.m. a mujahedeen hero , jawad , who is a resident of kunduz province , attacked the german soldiers who were patrolling in the area , " zabeeullah mujahed , a taliban spokesman said in a statement posted at their web site .
at the german defense ministry in berlin , officials declined to confirm any death toll , speaking only of " several " soldiers being killed , which was taken as a hint that the german wounded were in critical condition .
debate expected in parliament voicing shock at the attack , german defense minister franz josef jung broke off a private weekend trip and flew back to berlin to respond to the crisis .
the attack was expected to lead to renewed debate in germany about whether german soldiers should be posted to afghanistan .
germany 's green party , which has supported the afghan peace mission , appeared to be foreshadowing that debate saturday , calling for a massive rise in spending on training the afghan military .
the green parliamentary co-leaders said the attack was " intended to stop the establishment of democratic structures . "
german television reported that the soldiers got out of their patrol vehicle to do some shopping .

ten of them were killed by hostile acts while eight died in non-combat incidents .
there are around 3,000 german troops under the banner of the nato- led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in the country , the bulk of them stationed in the northern provinces .

" i heard of this underhanded attack with great shock , " merkel said in a statement released in berlin .
" this perfidious murder fills all of us with disgust . "
she said the bombing was aimed at preventing the process of reconstruction in afghanistan from becoming a success , " but added that the international community was resolved to continue helping afghans create a better future for themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the bombing would n't deter the international community three german soldiers were killed and three wounded while six afghan civilians were killed and 14 others wounded when a suicide attacker detonated his explosive-laden vest in northern afghanistan , officials said .
provincial governor mohammad omar told german news agency dpa that three german soldiers were killed and two soldiers and an interpreter were wounded when the bomber struck in chaiferoshi market in kunduz on saturday morning .
six afghan shopkeepers and civilian passers-by were killed and another 14 were wounded , omar said .
" we received intelligence information a couple of days ago that four would-be suicide bombers entered the city and would use motorcycles to carry out their attacks , " omar said , adding that the police started searching motorbikes on thursday .
he said that the security forces would intensify their search to track down the remaining bombers .
general noor mohammad omarkhail , provincial security chief of the kunduz police , described the condition of seven of the wounded afghans as critical .
taliban claims responsibility a spokesperson for the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul confirmed the incident in a statement , but said that three isaf soldiers and five afghans were killed and 10 , including two isaf soldiers , were wounded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 3,000 german troops are stationed in afghanistan " this senseless act of violence shows the barbarity of extremists and criminals targeting civilians and isaf troops who are working to rebuild afghanistan , " lieutenant colonel angela billings , an isaf spokeswoman was quoted in the statement as saying .
taliban militants took responsibility for the attack and said 11 german soldiers were killed in the suicide blast that destroyed the windows of the shops as far as one kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- .
" today at 11:00 a.m. a mujahedeen hero , jawad , who is a resident of kunduz province , attacked the german soldiers who were patrolling in the area , " zabeeullah mujahed , a taliban spokesman said in a statement posted at their web site .
at the german defense ministry in berlin , officials declined to confirm any death toll , speaking only of " several " soldiers being killed , which was taken as a hint that the german wounded were in critical condition .
debate expected in parliament voicing shock at the attack , german defense minister franz josef jung broke off a private weekend trip and flew back to berlin to respond to the crisis .
the attack was expected to lead to renewed debate in germany about whether german soldiers should be posted to afghanistan .
germany 's green party , which has supported the afghan peace mission , appeared to be foreshadowing that debate saturday , calling for a massive rise in spending on training the afghan military .
the green parliamentary co-leaders said the attack was " intended to stop the establishment of democratic structures . "
german television reported that the soldiers got out of their patrol vehicle to do some shopping .
21 german dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not the first bundeswehr funerals in afghanistan it was the biggest suicide attack against german troops in afghanistan since june 2003 when four german soldiers were killed and 29 wounded .
apart from saturday 's incident , 18 german soldiers have been killed in afghanistan since the ouster of the taliban regime in late 2001 .
ten of them were killed by hostile acts while eight died in non-combat incidents .
there are around 3,000 german troops under the banner of the nato- led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in the country , the bulk of them stationed in the northern provinces .
northern provinces of the country are relatively calm .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 19.05.2007 european organizations hard-pressed to represent all muslims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are part of europe but are n't necessarily represented as such several european states have islamic associations that intend to represent all muslims in that country .
but opinions are widely divergent as to what representation really means .
dw-world.de offers a brief overview . spain : contract with the state in spain , 2.5 percent of the population is muslim , with the majority coming from north africa .
the spanish government granted islam official legal status back in 1992 in a cooperation agreement between the state and the spanish islamic commission -lrb- cie -rrb- . an estimated 30 percent of spanish muslim communities currently belong to the cie , which is made up of two federations , and as such as has two general secretaries instead of a president .
decisions can only be made when both federations agree .
because secularism is one of the spanish state 's fundamental principles , there is no real legal basis for an agreement of this kind with specific faiths .
the state has , however , also signed a similar agreement with organizations representing both christian confessions and with the jewish community .
islam has , therefore , been placed on an equal legal footing with the other major religions .
austria : criticism from within the ranks islam 's position in austria is very clear cut - islam has been recognized as a religion since 1912 and the islamic faith community in austria -lrb- iggiö -rrb- has enjoyed the status of a public corporation since its foundation in 1979 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconciling the different muslim denominatons under one group is difficult because of this , the austrian model is often held up as an example , but - and this is a large " but " - although the iggiö seeks to represent all muslims , many shiite and alevi muslims living in austria do not feel represented by the iggiö . in 2006 , the alevi submitted an application to the austrian ministry for religious affairs to have alevism recognized as an official religion . criticism has also been voiced by the sunnis , who claim that the iggiö does not represent their interests and allege that its structures are undemocratic .
the iggiö has been widely criticized for the lack of transparency in its membership practices .
only those who pay the annual membership fee are entitled to vote , but the organization does not release information about votes or lists of members . there have also been allegations of fees being returned without reason , and the rejection of membership applications , such as happened to günther ahmed rusznak , secretary general of the islamic information and documentation center and a harsh critic of the iggiö .
moreover , although almost 70 percent of austrian muslims are of turkish extraction , the iggiö leadership is almost exclusively made up of arab muslims .
this means that the iggiö 's status as a state-recognized body is at risk .
french islam by state decree ?
although the french council for the muslim faith -lrb- cfcm -rrb- was founded in 2003 at the instigation of the then interior minister nicolas sarkozy , it is only informally recognized as a representative by the state .
the council 's legal status corresponds to that of a registered charitable association .
some 88 percent of the 4,032 delegates from french mosques voted in council 's first elections .
the number of delegates is based on the size of each mosque ; there are also 25 representatives at regional level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has the biggest muslim population in the european union despite this high level of representation , the cfcm has been continually criticized for failing in its responsibility to represent muslims , particularly given that the french government influences the selection of candidates for all important posts within the organization . after all , sarkozy succeeded in installing his preferred candidate , the imam of paris ' central mosque , dalil boubakeur , as the head of the cfcm .
the french state is patently looking for a proponent of " liberal " islam as their muslim representative - someone who , for instance , would assist with the enforcement of the law banning religious symbols in schools .
this is exactly what upsets french muslims , who do not consider such policies to be in line with their interests .
other critics , however , consider the council to be too radical , as one of its member federations is said to have close links to the egyptian muslim brotherhood .
uk : disagreement on the political angle the muslim council of britain -lrb- mcb -rrb- was founded in the united kingdom in 1997 with the support of the labour government .
it fulfils its responsibility of representing all muslims in so far as it brings together some 3000 organizations from across the spectrum of british islam , and represents an estimated 70 percent of british muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated two million muslims live in great britain the mcb used to have a good relationship with the labour government ; however , since the london bombings , many muslims feel badly treated and misunderstood .
the mcb has to meet the difficult twin objectives of lobbying to enable stricter forms of islam to be practiced on the one hand , and of meeting the british public 's expectation of a firm rejection of terrorism and islamist acts of violence on the other .
the substantial group of sufist barelwi muslims in britain does not believe that the mcb can really represent all muslims because it is dominated by the deobandi , who practice a stricter form of islam and are more politically organized .
the barelwi are represented by the british muslim forum , which does not belong to the muslim council of britain .
although there has been no agreement with the government on muslim affairs in the uk , the construction of muslim primary and secondary schools is funded by the state .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 19.05.2007 european organizations hard-pressed to represent all muslims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are part of europe but are n't necessarily represented as such several european states have islamic associations that intend to represent all muslims in that country .
but opinions are widely divergent as to what representation really means .
dw-world.de offers a brief overview . spain : contract with the state in spain , 2.5 percent of the population is muslim , with the majority coming from north africa .
the spanish government granted islam official legal status back in 1992 in a cooperation agreement between the state and the spanish islamic commission -lrb- cie -rrb- . an estimated 30 percent of spanish muslim communities currently belong to the cie , which is made up of two federations , and as such as has two general secretaries instead of a president .
decisions can only be made when both federations agree .
because secularism is one of the spanish state 's fundamental principles , there is no real legal basis for an agreement of this kind with specific faiths .
the state has , however , also signed a similar agreement with organizations representing both christian confessions and with the jewish community .
islam has , therefore , been placed on an equal legal footing with the other major religions .
austria : criticism from within the ranks islam 's position in austria is very clear cut - islam has been recognized as a religion since 1912 and the islamic faith community in austria -lrb- iggiö -rrb- has enjoyed the status of a public corporation since its foundation in 1979 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconciling the different muslim denominatons under one group is difficult because of this , the austrian model is often held up as an example , but - and this is a large " but " - although the iggiö seeks to represent all muslims , many shiite and alevi muslims living in austria do not feel represented by the iggiö . in 2006 , the alevi submitted an application to the austrian ministry for religious affairs to have alevism recognized as an official religion . criticism has also been voiced by the sunnis , who claim that the iggiö does not represent their interests and allege that its structures are undemocratic .
the iggiö has been widely criticized for the lack of transparency in its membership practices .
only those who pay the annual membership fee are entitled to vote , but the organization does not release information about votes or lists of members . there have also been allegations of fees being returned without reason , and the rejection of membership applications , such as happened to günther ahmed rusznak , secretary general of the islamic information and documentation center and a harsh critic of the iggiö .
moreover , although almost 70 percent of austrian muslims are of turkish extraction , the iggiö leadership is almost exclusively made up of arab muslims .
this means that the iggiö 's status as a state-recognized body is at risk .
french islam by state decree ?
although the french council for the muslim faith -lrb- cfcm -rrb- was founded in 2003 at the instigation of the then interior minister nicolas sarkozy , it is only informally recognized as a representative by the state .
the council 's legal status corresponds to that of a registered charitable association .
some 88 percent of the 4,032 delegates from french mosques voted in council 's first elections .
the number of delegates is based on the size of each mosque ; there are also 25 representatives at regional level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has the biggest muslim population in the european union despite this high level of representation , the cfcm has been continually criticized for failing in its responsibility to represent muslims , particularly given that the french government influences the selection of candidates for all important posts within the organization . after all , sarkozy succeeded in installing his preferred candidate , the imam of paris ' central mosque , dalil boubakeur , as the head of the cfcm .
the french state is patently looking for a proponent of " liberal " islam as their muslim representative - someone who , for instance , would assist with the enforcement of the law banning religious symbols in schools .
this is exactly what upsets french muslims , who do not consider such policies to be in line with their interests .
other critics , however , consider the council to be too radical , as one of its member federations is said to have close links to the egyptian muslim brotherhood .
uk : disagreement on the political angle the muslim council of britain -lrb- mcb -rrb- was founded in the united kingdom in 1997 with the support of the labour government .
it fulfils its responsibility of representing all muslims in so far as it brings together some 3000 organizations from across the spectrum of british islam , and represents an estimated 70 percent of british muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated two million muslims live in great britain the mcb used to have a good relationship with the labour government ; however , since the london bombings , many muslims feel badly treated and misunderstood .
the mcb has to meet the difficult twin objectives of lobbying to enable stricter forms of islam to be practiced on the one hand , and of meeting the british public 's expectation of a firm rejection of terrorism and islamist acts of violence on the other .
the substantial group of sufist barelwi muslims in britain does not believe that the mcb can really represent all muslims because it is dominated by the deobandi , who practice a stricter form of islam and are more politically organized .
the barelwi are represented by the british muslim forum , which does not belong to the muslim council of britain .
although there has been no agreement with the government on muslim affairs in the uk , the construction of muslim primary and secondary schools is funded by the state .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hildebrand missed the ball to give cottbus a 1-0 lead with schalke 04 winning 2-0 at that moment , the defeat would have sent the title to gelsenkirchen , but stuttgart settled and germany international thomas hitzlsperger equalized on 27 minutes to swing the title back their way . but it was midfielder khedira whose 63rd minute goal had stuttgart 's fans celebrating the win which gave them a two-point margin at the top of the league .
dreams of a double the win keeps alive their dream of doing a league and cup double for the first time when they contest the german cup final at berlin 's olympic stadium next weekend against nuremberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khedira 's shot gave stuttgart 2-1 stuttgart 's win made second-placed schalke 's 2-1 victory over arminia bielefeld irrelevant , even though they had a dream start to go 2-0 up after just 19 minutes and they finished runners-up . brazilian midfielder lincoln smashed his shot past diving bielefeld goalkeeper mathias hain on 11 minutes before turkish striker halil altintop added a second eight minutes later , but it was not enough to threaten stuttgart as bielefeld grabbed a late consolation goal . they may be out of the champions league next season , but fourth-placed bayern munich hammered relegated mainz 05 5-2 at the allianz arena .
werder bremen finished third after their 2-0 win at vfl wolfsburg , who finished just one point off the relegation zone . leverkusen gets uefa cup spot bayer leverkusen claimed the final uefa cup place thanks to their 2-1 win over borussia dortmund which leaves them fifth in the table .
bildunterschrift : nuremberg enjoyed a 3-0 win over hanover , but still finished sixth , outside the european places for next season . at the other end of the table , mainz 05 were relegated following their bayern munich defeat and they were joined by alemannia aachen who went down 4-0 at hamburg after two first-half goals from croatian striker ivica olic , while argentinian juan pablo sorin netted twice after the break . and the bundesliga 's bottom-side borussia moenchengladach , who have been resigned to relegation for several weeks , finished their life in german 's top-tier with a 2-0 defeat at home to vfl bochum . in the day 's other results , eintracht frankfurt were beaten 2-1 at home to hertha berlin . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de confident stuttgart ready to surprise bundesliga considered an outside contender for the league title when the season began , stuttgart kept out the bundesliga limelight until the final weeks and may end up adding the german league and cup titles to their trophy case .

on may 26 , they meet nuremberg in the german cup final in what could result in the first double in club history . confronted with expensive players who performed below par , cash-strapped stuttgart took the daring move last summer of making a total overhaul instead of getting only new players for certain positions . jon dahl tomasson , jesper gronkjaer , christian tiffert , andreas hinkel , zvonimir soldo , danijel ljuboja were retired or had to leave as new sports director horst heldt and coach armin -lrb- following matthias sammer and giovanni trapattoni -rrb- made sweeping changes . " the former team put together without love was made up of sammer-players who trapattoni did n't want and of trapattoni-players who veh did n't want , " the daily süddeutsche zeitung wrote before going on to call the changes the biggest in league history . an overhaul " without mercy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart needed to wipe away the remains of too many coaches but the changes were necessary for the team to have any success , according to heldt . " you could n't continue with the old squad , " he said .
" we had to risk the overhaul because the former team was driving the people out of the stadium .
we did the overhaul without mercy . " the result was stunning . an old guard of fernando meira , ludovic magnin , brazilian forward cacau , goalkeeper timo hildebrand and midfielder thomas hitzlsperger was joined by newcomers like mario gomez , serdar tasci , roberto hilbert and antonio da silva , who all made a big impact . heldt said stuttgart carefully chose the new players but admitted that " you could n't expect that it would work so well . " reliable weekly performances bildunterschrift : though not the showiest bundesliga side , stuttgart played consistently well all season stuttgart , who only claimed the bundesliga 's top spot once before the season 's final two weeks , were long vying for third place , but more became possible because they did n't have a slump like the title rivals schalke or werder bremen . it did n't even matter that gomez was sidelined for two months after scoring 14 goals until then .
he only returned saturday to score the important 2-2 equalizer in bochum . " we showed all season that we are a team , " said saturday 's match-winner cacau said . stuttgart became invincible on the home stretch , winning the last seven games after an unlucky 1-0 defeat at schalke in mid-march . many experts predicted over the past two weeks that stuttgart were the team to look out for in the title race because they had nothing to lose . who " deserves " to win ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saves from goalkeeper timo hildebrand kept stuttgart in several matches " stuttgart played a sensational season , " said bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld in admiration of the team where he formerly played . former germany player paul breitner said on sunday in the bild am sonntag newspaper that " stuttgart deserves the title . " bremen were unable to maintain their autumn form and schalke lost the last two away games , cracking under pressure just like in 2001 .
that year they lost the title on the last play of the season to bayern munich , but a 1-0 defeat in stuttgart the week before was the crucial setback . as a result , many said that schalke , who once again appear not to be able to shake their reputation as perennial runners-up , now deserved the first national title since 1958 , including german soccer supremo theo zwanziger who said " the time was ripe " for them to succeed . that remark led to the only major outburst of anger from stuttgart this season . " i was very upset when i read the statements from zwanziger that it would be only just if schalke won the title , " veh said .
" what is supposed to be just about that ? " now veh - and his players - will likely take even more pride when they are expected to receive the trophy for their fifth german title overall and first since 1992 on saturday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stuttgart steal pole position as schalke lose stuttgart climbed to the top of the bundesliga on saturday , with just one week left to the season , as their dramatic 3-2 win at vfl bochum knocked schalke 04 off first place .

but opinions are widely divergent as to what representation really means .
dw-world.de offers a brief overview . spain : contract with the state in spain , 2.5 percent of the population is muslim , with the majority coming from north africa .
the spanish government granted islam official legal status back in 1992 in a cooperation agreement between the state and the spanish islamic commission -lrb- cie -rrb- . an estimated 30 percent of spanish muslim communities currently belong to the cie , which is made up of two federations , and as such as has two general secretaries instead of a president .
decisions can only be made when both federations agree .
because secularism is one of the spanish state 's fundamental principles , there is no real legal basis for an agreement of this kind with specific faiths .
the state has , however , also signed a similar agreement with organizations representing both christian confessions and with the jewish community .
islam has , therefore , been placed on an equal legal footing with the other major religions .
austria : criticism from within the ranks islam 's position in austria is very clear cut - islam has been recognized as a religion since 1912 and the islamic faith community in austria -lrb- iggiö -rrb- has enjoyed the status of a public corporation since its foundation in 1979 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconciling the different muslim denominatons under one group is difficult because of this , the austrian model is often held up as an example , but - and this is a large " but " - although the iggiö seeks to represent all muslims , many shiite and alevi muslims living in austria do not feel represented by the iggiö . in 2006 , the alevi submitted an application to the austrian ministry for religious affairs to have alevism recognized as an official religion . criticism has also been voiced by the sunnis , who claim that the iggiö does not represent their interests and allege that its structures are undemocratic .
the iggiö has been widely criticized for the lack of transparency in its membership practices .
only those who pay the annual membership fee are entitled to vote , but the organization does not release information about votes or lists of members . there have also been allegations of fees being returned without reason , and the rejection of membership applications , such as happened to günther ahmed rusznak , secretary general of the islamic information and documentation center and a harsh critic of the iggiö .
moreover , although almost 70 percent of austrian muslims are of turkish extraction , the iggiö leadership is almost exclusively made up of arab muslims .
this means that the iggiö 's status as a state-recognized body is at risk .
french islam by state decree ?
although the french council for the muslim faith -lrb- cfcm -rrb- was founded in 2003 at the instigation of the then interior minister nicolas sarkozy , it is only informally recognized as a representative by the state .
the council 's legal status corresponds to that of a registered charitable association .
some 88 percent of the 4,032 delegates from french mosques voted in council 's first elections .
the number of delegates is based on the size of each mosque ; there are also 25 representatives at regional level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has the biggest muslim population in the european union despite this high level of representation , the cfcm has been continually criticized for failing in its responsibility to represent muslims , particularly given that the french government influences the selection of candidates for all important posts within the organization . after all , sarkozy succeeded in installing his preferred candidate , the imam of paris ' central mosque , dalil boubakeur , as the head of the cfcm .
the french state is patently looking for a proponent of " liberal " islam as their muslim representative - someone who , for instance , would assist with the enforcement of the law banning religious symbols in schools .
this is exactly what upsets french muslims , who do not consider such policies to be in line with their interests .
other critics , however , consider the council to be too radical , as one of its member federations is said to have close links to the egyptian muslim brotherhood .
uk : disagreement on the political angle the muslim council of britain -lrb- mcb -rrb- was founded in the united kingdom in 1997 with the support of the labour government .
it fulfils its responsibility of representing all muslims in so far as it brings together some 3000 organizations from across the spectrum of british islam , and represents an estimated 70 percent of british muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated two million muslims live in great britain the mcb used to have a good relationship with the labour government ; however , since the london bombings , many muslims feel badly treated and misunderstood .
the mcb has to meet the difficult twin objectives of lobbying to enable stricter forms of islam to be practiced on the one hand , and of meeting the british public 's expectation of a firm rejection of terrorism and islamist acts of violence on the other .
the substantial group of sufist barelwi muslims in britain does not believe that the mcb can really represent all muslims because it is dominated by the deobandi , who practice a stricter form of islam and are more politically organized .
the barelwi are represented by the british muslim forum , which does not belong to the muslim council of britain .
although there has been no agreement with the government on muslim affairs in the uk , the construction of muslim primary and secondary schools is funded by the state .

but opinions are widely divergent as to what representation really means .
dw-world.de offers a brief overview . spain : contract with the state in spain , 2.5 percent of the population is muslim , with the majority coming from north africa .
the spanish government granted islam official legal status back in 1992 in a cooperation agreement between the state and the spanish islamic commission -lrb- cie -rrb- . an estimated 30 percent of spanish muslim communities currently belong to the cie , which is made up of two federations , and as such as has two general secretaries instead of a president .
decisions can only be made when both federations agree .
because secularism is one of the spanish state 's fundamental principles , there is no real legal basis for an agreement of this kind with specific faiths .
the state has , however , also signed a similar agreement with organizations representing both christian confessions and with the jewish community .
islam has , therefore , been placed on an equal legal footing with the other major religions .
austria : criticism from within the ranks islam 's position in austria is very clear cut - islam has been recognized as a religion since 1912 and the islamic faith community in austria -lrb- iggiö -rrb- has enjoyed the status of a public corporation since its foundation in 1979 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconciling the different muslim denominatons under one group is difficult because of this , the austrian model is often held up as an example , but - and this is a large " but " - although the iggiö seeks to represent all muslims , many shiite and alevi muslims living in austria do not feel represented by the iggiö . in 2006 , the alevi submitted an application to the austrian ministry for religious affairs to have alevism recognized as an official religion . criticism has also been voiced by the sunnis , who claim that the iggiö does not represent their interests and allege that its structures are undemocratic .
the iggiö has been widely criticized for the lack of transparency in its membership practices .
only those who pay the annual membership fee are entitled to vote , but the organization does not release information about votes or lists of members . there have also been allegations of fees being returned without reason , and the rejection of membership applications , such as happened to günther ahmed rusznak , secretary general of the islamic information and documentation center and a harsh critic of the iggiö .
moreover , although almost 70 percent of austrian muslims are of turkish extraction , the iggiö leadership is almost exclusively made up of arab muslims .
this means that the iggiö 's status as a state-recognized body is at risk .
french islam by state decree ?
although the french council for the muslim faith -lrb- cfcm -rrb- was founded in 2003 at the instigation of the then interior minister nicolas sarkozy , it is only informally recognized as a representative by the state .
the council 's legal status corresponds to that of a registered charitable association .
some 88 percent of the 4,032 delegates from french mosques voted in council 's first elections .
the number of delegates is based on the size of each mosque ; there are also 25 representatives at regional level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has the biggest muslim population in the european union despite this high level of representation , the cfcm has been continually criticized for failing in its responsibility to represent muslims , particularly given that the french government influences the selection of candidates for all important posts within the organization . after all , sarkozy succeeded in installing his preferred candidate , the imam of paris ' central mosque , dalil boubakeur , as the head of the cfcm .
the french state is patently looking for a proponent of " liberal " islam as their muslim representative - someone who , for instance , would assist with the enforcement of the law banning religious symbols in schools .
this is exactly what upsets french muslims , who do not consider such policies to be in line with their interests .
other critics , however , consider the council to be too radical , as one of its member federations is said to have close links to the egyptian muslim brotherhood .
uk : disagreement on the political angle the muslim council of britain -lrb- mcb -rrb- was founded in the united kingdom in 1997 with the support of the labour government .
it fulfils its responsibility of representing all muslims in so far as it brings together some 3000 organizations from across the spectrum of british islam , and represents an estimated 70 percent of british muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated two million muslims live in great britain the mcb used to have a good relationship with the labour government ; however , since the london bombings , many muslims feel badly treated and misunderstood .
the mcb has to meet the difficult twin objectives of lobbying to enable stricter forms of islam to be practiced on the one hand , and of meeting the british public 's expectation of a firm rejection of terrorism and islamist acts of violence on the other .
the substantial group of sufist barelwi muslims in britain does not believe that the mcb can really represent all muslims because it is dominated by the deobandi , who practice a stricter form of islam and are more politically organized .
the barelwi are represented by the british muslim forum , which does not belong to the muslim council of britain .
although there has been no agreement with the government on muslim affairs in the uk , the construction of muslim primary and secondary schools is funded by the state .

the spanish government granted islam official legal status back in 1992 in a cooperation agreement between the state and the spanish islamic commission -lrb- cie -rrb- . an estimated 30 percent of spanish muslim communities currently belong to the cie , which is made up of two federations , and as such as has two general secretaries instead of a president .
decisions can only be made when both federations agree .
because secularism is one of the spanish state 's fundamental principles , there is no real legal basis for an agreement of this kind with specific faiths .
the state has , however , also signed a similar agreement with organizations representing both christian confessions and with the jewish community .
islam has , therefore , been placed on an equal legal footing with the other major religions .
austria : criticism from within the ranks islam 's position in austria is very clear cut - islam has been recognized as a religion since 1912 and the islamic faith community in austria -lrb- iggiö -rrb- has enjoyed the status of a public corporation since its foundation in 1979 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconciling the different muslim denominatons under one group is difficult because of this , the austrian model is often held up as an example , but - and this is a large " but " - although the iggiö seeks to represent all muslims , many shiite and alevi muslims living in austria do not feel represented by the iggiö . in 2006 , the alevi submitted an application to the austrian ministry for religious affairs to have alevism recognized as an official religion . criticism has also been voiced by the sunnis , who claim that the iggiö does not represent their interests and allege that its structures are undemocratic .
the iggiö has been widely criticized for the lack of transparency in its membership practices .
only those who pay the annual membership fee are entitled to vote , but the organization does not release information about votes or lists of members . there have also been allegations of fees being returned without reason , and the rejection of membership applications , such as happened to günther ahmed rusznak , secretary general of the islamic information and documentation center and a harsh critic of the iggiö .
moreover , although almost 70 percent of austrian muslims are of turkish extraction , the iggiö leadership is almost exclusively made up of arab muslims .
this means that the iggiö 's status as a state-recognized body is at risk .
french islam by state decree ?
although the french council for the muslim faith -lrb- cfcm -rrb- was founded in 2003 at the instigation of the then interior minister nicolas sarkozy , it is only informally recognized as a representative by the state .
the council 's legal status corresponds to that of a registered charitable association .
some 88 percent of the 4,032 delegates from french mosques voted in council 's first elections .
the number of delegates is based on the size of each mosque ; there are also 25 representatives at regional level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has the biggest muslim population in the european union despite this high level of representation , the cfcm has been continually criticized for failing in its responsibility to represent muslims , particularly given that the french government influences the selection of candidates for all important posts within the organization . after all , sarkozy succeeded in installing his preferred candidate , the imam of paris ' central mosque , dalil boubakeur , as the head of the cfcm .
the french state is patently looking for a proponent of " liberal " islam as their muslim representative - someone who , for instance , would assist with the enforcement of the law banning religious symbols in schools .
this is exactly what upsets french muslims , who do not consider such policies to be in line with their interests .
other critics , however , consider the council to be too radical , as one of its member federations is said to have close links to the egyptian muslim brotherhood .
uk : disagreement on the political angle the muslim council of britain -lrb- mcb -rrb- was founded in the united kingdom in 1997 with the support of the labour government .
it fulfils its responsibility of representing all muslims in so far as it brings together some 3000 organizations from across the spectrum of british islam , and represents an estimated 70 percent of british muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated two million muslims live in great britain the mcb used to have a good relationship with the labour government ; however , since the london bombings , many muslims feel badly treated and misunderstood .
the mcb has to meet the difficult twin objectives of lobbying to enable stricter forms of islam to be practiced on the one hand , and of meeting the british public 's expectation of a firm rejection of terrorism and islamist acts of violence on the other .
the substantial group of sufist barelwi muslims in britain does not believe that the mcb can really represent all muslims because it is dominated by the deobandi , who practice a stricter form of islam and are more politically organized .
the barelwi are represented by the british muslim forum , which does not belong to the muslim council of britain .
although there has been no agreement with the government on muslim affairs in the uk , the construction of muslim primary and secondary schools is funded by the state .

but opinions are widely divergent as to what representation really means .
dw-world.de offers a brief overview . spain : contract with the state in spain , 2.5 percent of the population is muslim , with the majority coming from north africa .
the spanish government granted islam official legal status back in 1992 in a cooperation agreement between the state and the spanish islamic commission -lrb- cie -rrb- . an estimated 30 percent of spanish muslim communities currently belong to the cie , which is made up of two federations , and as such as has two general secretaries instead of a president .
decisions can only be made when both federations agree .
because secularism is one of the spanish state 's fundamental principles , there is no real legal basis for an agreement of this kind with specific faiths .
the state has , however , also signed a similar agreement with organizations representing both christian confessions and with the jewish community .
islam has , therefore , been placed on an equal legal footing with the other major religions .
austria : criticism from within the ranks islam 's position in austria is very clear cut - islam has been recognized as a religion since 1912 and the islamic faith community in austria -lrb- iggiö -rrb- has enjoyed the status of a public corporation since its foundation in 1979 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconciling the different muslim denominatons under one group is difficult because of this , the austrian model is often held up as an example , but - and this is a large " but " - although the iggiö seeks to represent all muslims , many shiite and alevi muslims living in austria do not feel represented by the iggiö . in 2006 , the alevi submitted an application to the austrian ministry for religious affairs to have alevism recognized as an official religion . criticism has also been voiced by the sunnis , who claim that the iggiö does not represent their interests and allege that its structures are undemocratic .
the iggiö has been widely criticized for the lack of transparency in its membership practices .
only those who pay the annual membership fee are entitled to vote , but the organization does not release information about votes or lists of members . there have also been allegations of fees being returned without reason , and the rejection of membership applications , such as happened to günther ahmed rusznak , secretary general of the islamic information and documentation center and a harsh critic of the iggiö .
moreover , although almost 70 percent of austrian muslims are of turkish extraction , the iggiö leadership is almost exclusively made up of arab muslims .
this means that the iggiö 's status as a state-recognized body is at risk .
french islam by state decree ?
although the french council for the muslim faith -lrb- cfcm -rrb- was founded in 2003 at the instigation of the then interior minister nicolas sarkozy , it is only informally recognized as a representative by the state .
the council 's legal status corresponds to that of a registered charitable association .
some 88 percent of the 4,032 delegates from french mosques voted in council 's first elections .
the number of delegates is based on the size of each mosque ; there are also 25 representatives at regional level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has the biggest muslim population in the european union despite this high level of representation , the cfcm has been continually criticized for failing in its responsibility to represent muslims , particularly given that the french government influences the selection of candidates for all important posts within the organization . after all , sarkozy succeeded in installing his preferred candidate , the imam of paris ' central mosque , dalil boubakeur , as the head of the cfcm .
the french state is patently looking for a proponent of " liberal " islam as their muslim representative - someone who , for instance , would assist with the enforcement of the law banning religious symbols in schools .
this is exactly what upsets french muslims , who do not consider such policies to be in line with their interests .
other critics , however , consider the council to be too radical , as one of its member federations is said to have close links to the egyptian muslim brotherhood .
uk : disagreement on the political angle the muslim council of britain -lrb- mcb -rrb- was founded in the united kingdom in 1997 with the support of the labour government .
it fulfils its responsibility of representing all muslims in so far as it brings together some 3000 organizations from across the spectrum of british islam , and represents an estimated 70 percent of british muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated two million muslims live in great britain the mcb used to have a good relationship with the labour government ; however , since the london bombings , many muslims feel badly treated and misunderstood .
the mcb has to meet the difficult twin objectives of lobbying to enable stricter forms of islam to be practiced on the one hand , and of meeting the british public 's expectation of a firm rejection of terrorism and islamist acts of violence on the other .
the substantial group of sufist barelwi muslims in britain does not believe that the mcb can really represent all muslims because it is dominated by the deobandi , who practice a stricter form of islam and are more politically organized .
the barelwi are represented by the british muslim forum , which does not belong to the muslim council of britain .
although there has been no agreement with the government on muslim affairs in the uk , the construction of muslim primary and secondary schools is funded by the state .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has the biggest muslim population in the european union despite this high level of representation , the cfcm has been continually criticized for failing in its responsibility to represent muslims , particularly given that the french government influences the selection of candidates for all important posts within the organization . after all , sarkozy succeeded in installing his preferred candidate , the imam of paris ' central mosque , dalil boubakeur , as the head of the cfcm .
the french state is patently looking for a proponent of " liberal " islam as their muslim representative - someone who , for instance , would assist with the enforcement of the law banning religious symbols in schools .
this is exactly what upsets french muslims , who do not consider such policies to be in line with their interests .
other critics , however , consider the council to be too radical , as one of its member federations is said to have close links to the egyptian muslim brotherhood .
uk : disagreement on the political angle the muslim council of britain -lrb- mcb -rrb- was founded in the united kingdom in 1997 with the support of the labour government .
it fulfils its responsibility of representing all muslims in so far as it brings together some 3000 organizations from across the spectrum of british islam , and represents an estimated 70 percent of british muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated two million muslims live in great britain the mcb used to have a good relationship with the labour government ; however , since the london bombings , many muslims feel badly treated and misunderstood .
the mcb has to meet the difficult twin objectives of lobbying to enable stricter forms of islam to be practiced on the one hand , and of meeting the british public 's expectation of a firm rejection of terrorism and islamist acts of violence on the other .
the substantial group of sufist barelwi muslims in britain does not believe that the mcb can really represent all muslims because it is dominated by the deobandi , who practice a stricter form of islam and are more politically organized .
the barelwi are represented by the british muslim forum , which does not belong to the muslim council of britain .
although there has been no agreement with the government on muslim affairs in the uk , the construction of muslim primary and secondary schools is funded by the state .

but opinions are widely divergent as to what representation really means .
dw-world.de offers a brief overview . spain : contract with the state in spain , 2.5 percent of the population is muslim , with the majority coming from north africa .
the spanish government granted islam official legal status back in 1992 in a cooperation agreement between the state and the spanish islamic commission -lrb- cie -rrb- . an estimated 30 percent of spanish muslim communities currently belong to the cie , which is made up of two federations , and as such as has two general secretaries instead of a president .
decisions can only be made when both federations agree .
because secularism is one of the spanish state 's fundamental principles , there is no real legal basis for an agreement of this kind with specific faiths .
the state has , however , also signed a similar agreement with organizations representing both christian confessions and with the jewish community .
islam has , therefore , been placed on an equal legal footing with the other major religions .
austria : criticism from within the ranks islam 's position in austria is very clear cut - islam has been recognized as a religion since 1912 and the islamic faith community in austria -lrb- iggiö -rrb- has enjoyed the status of a public corporation since its foundation in 1979 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconciling the different muslim denominatons under one group is difficult because of this , the austrian model is often held up as an example , but - and this is a large " but " - although the iggiö seeks to represent all muslims , many shiite and alevi muslims living in austria do not feel represented by the iggiö . in 2006 , the alevi submitted an application to the austrian ministry for religious affairs to have alevism recognized as an official religion . criticism has also been voiced by the sunnis , who claim that the iggiö does not represent their interests and allege that its structures are undemocratic .
the iggiö has been widely criticized for the lack of transparency in its membership practices .
only those who pay the annual membership fee are entitled to vote , but the organization does not release information about votes or lists of members . there have also been allegations of fees being returned without reason , and the rejection of membership applications , such as happened to günther ahmed rusznak , secretary general of the islamic information and documentation center and a harsh critic of the iggiö .
moreover , although almost 70 percent of austrian muslims are of turkish extraction , the iggiö leadership is almost exclusively made up of arab muslims .
this means that the iggiö 's status as a state-recognized body is at risk .
french islam by state decree ?
although the french council for the muslim faith -lrb- cfcm -rrb- was founded in 2003 at the instigation of the then interior minister nicolas sarkozy , it is only informally recognized as a representative by the state .
the council 's legal status corresponds to that of a registered charitable association .
some 88 percent of the 4,032 delegates from french mosques voted in council 's first elections .
the number of delegates is based on the size of each mosque ; there are also 25 representatives at regional level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has the biggest muslim population in the european union despite this high level of representation , the cfcm has been continually criticized for failing in its responsibility to represent muslims , particularly given that the french government influences the selection of candidates for all important posts within the organization . after all , sarkozy succeeded in installing his preferred candidate , the imam of paris ' central mosque , dalil boubakeur , as the head of the cfcm .

on may 26 , they meet nuremberg in the german cup final in what could result in the first double in club history . confronted with expensive players who performed below par , cash-strapped stuttgart took the daring move last summer of making a total overhaul instead of getting only new players for certain positions . jon dahl tomasson , jesper gronkjaer , christian tiffert , andreas hinkel , zvonimir soldo , danijel ljuboja were retired or had to leave as new sports director horst heldt and coach armin -lrb- following matthias sammer and giovanni trapattoni -rrb- made sweeping changes . " the former team put together without love was made up of sammer-players who trapattoni did n't want and of trapattoni-players who veh did n't want , " the daily süddeutsche zeitung wrote before going on to call the changes the biggest in league history . an overhaul " without mercy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart needed to wipe away the remains of too many coaches but the changes were necessary for the team to have any success , according to heldt . " you could n't continue with the old squad , " he said .
" we had to risk the overhaul because the former team was driving the people out of the stadium .
we did the overhaul without mercy . " the result was stunning . an old guard of fernando meira , ludovic magnin , brazilian forward cacau , goalkeeper timo hildebrand and midfielder thomas hitzlsperger was joined by newcomers like mario gomez , serdar tasci , roberto hilbert and antonio da silva , who all made a big impact . heldt said stuttgart carefully chose the new players but admitted that " you could n't expect that it would work so well . " reliable weekly performances bildunterschrift : though not the showiest bundesliga side , stuttgart played consistently well all season stuttgart , who only claimed the bundesliga 's top spot once before the season 's final two weeks , were long vying for third place , but more became possible because they did n't have a slump like the title rivals schalke or werder bremen . it did n't even matter that gomez was sidelined for two months after scoring 14 goals until then .
he only returned saturday to score the important 2-2 equalizer in bochum . " we showed all season that we are a team , " said saturday 's match-winner cacau said . stuttgart became invincible on the home stretch , winning the last seven games after an unlucky 1-0 defeat at schalke in mid-march . many experts predicted over the past two weeks that stuttgart were the team to look out for in the title race because they had nothing to lose . who " deserves " to win ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saves from goalkeeper timo hildebrand kept stuttgart in several matches " stuttgart played a sensational season , " said bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld in admiration of the team where he formerly played . former germany player paul breitner said on sunday in the bild am sonntag newspaper that " stuttgart deserves the title . " bremen were unable to maintain their autumn form and schalke lost the last two away games , cracking under pressure just like in 2001 .
that year they lost the title on the last play of the season to bayern munich , but a 1-0 defeat in stuttgart the week before was the crucial setback . as a result , many said that schalke , who once again appear not to be able to shake their reputation as perennial runners-up , now deserved the first national title since 1958 , including german soccer supremo theo zwanziger who said " the time was ripe " for them to succeed . that remark led to the only major outburst of anger from stuttgart this season . " i was very upset when i read the statements from zwanziger that it would be only just if schalke won the title , " veh said .
" what is supposed to be just about that ? " now veh - and his players - will likely take even more pride when they are expected to receive the trophy for their fifth german title overall and first since 1992 on saturday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stuttgart steal pole position as schalke lose stuttgart climbed to the top of the bundesliga on saturday , with just one week left to the season , as their dramatic 3-2 win at vfl bochum knocked schalke 04 off first place .

east germany 's darling car turns 50 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other car in the world is such a powerful symbol of a bygone era looking like a cross between a golf cart and an amusement park bumper car , the trabant - a sluggish two-cylinder vehicle from east germany - was arguably the most venerated object of desire behind the iron curtain . the trabants , or trabis for short , were in production in the german democratic republic without any significant change for more than three decades .
and although the last new trabi hit the roads in 1991 , the vehicle - which turns 50 this year - has gained cult status in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis evoke memories of living in the gdr " i love my car , it 's like a child to me , " said christian marotz , board member of the trabant club berlin , a group that devotes a good deal of time and personal finance investment into all things trabant .
" it symbolizes a simpler life from earlier , in the east … oh , and insurance is cheap too , because they are n't stolen very often ! "
accidentally , a car the first trabi rolled off the factory floor in 1957 .
it was actually never really intended to be a car , but was planned as a three-wheeled motorcycle .
and even though the designers only expected production to last about 10 years , it ended up lasting 34 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last trabant left the assembly line on april 30 , 1991 the name trabant means " fellow traveler , " or satellite , and was inspired by the russian satellite sputnik , which went into space the year went on sale .
television ads by the trabant 's maker , the sachsenring automobile works in east germany , praised the trabi for offering " a lot of room for your luggage " and for being " agile , " " fast , " " long-lasting " and " robust , " but in reality the car left much to be desired .
at the time the trabi was launched , western countries already used cars with cleaner and more efficient engines .
the trabi 's own motor was a two-stroke affair with just two cylinders .
it delivered all of 25 horsepower , and took a full 21 seconds to get from 0 to 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- per hour .
its top speed was all of 112 kilometers per hour .
an entirely different perspective the trabi 's a little thing .
just under 360 cm -lrb- 140 inches -rrb- long , about 150 cm wide and 146 cm tall .
in today 's world of hummers and other suvs , it 's a real shrimp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's a real beauty !
while it had a steel frame , the body was made of something called duroplast - a form of hardened plastic made of cotton waste from russia and resins from the east german dye industry .
" it was the average car people would have in east germany , " said johannes drexler , who is a tour guide for trabi safari , a company in berlin that allows people to see berlin 's sites from the vantage point of this micro car .
" everyone tried to afford a trabant during the east german times .
you had to have yourself put on a list and you had to wait for the car between 11 and 15 years , " drexler said .
the 11 or 15 years was for those lucky enough to be living in berlin , which enjoyed some advantages over other parts of east germany .
those in other places could wait up to 18 years to get their car .
pure luxury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis were never this colorful before the fall of the berlin wall the trabi was probably one of the only cars that was more expensive to buy used than it was new .
a new trabi would set you back between 8,500 and 12,500 east german marks .
for a used car , which you could get much faster , you could pay as much as 4,000 more .
" to have a car in east germany was considered to be pure luxury , " drexler said .
the trabi plant in the city of zwickau churned out around 3.7 million of the cars in 34 years .
some were exported to other communist countries .
today , there are still about 58,000 trabis in use in germany , about 85 percent of them in the former east .
when the berlin wall fell in 1989 , the trabi was still produced for two more years .
but many easterners wanted flashier western cars at the time , so the market dried up .
numerous trabi jokes , however , have survived to this day .
how do you double the value of a trabant ?
fill up its gas tank .
why does the trabi have a heated rear window ?
it keeps your hands warm while you push it .
environmental concerns what finally might spell the end of the trabi - at least on the roads - is not ridicule , or even a lack of replacement parts .
it could be growing concerns about the environment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabi exhaust fumes can even be bought in cans as trabi fragrance trabis are not the " greenest " cars going .
they were n't built with pollution-reducing catalytic converters .
one study found that they spew about nine times as many hydrocarbons and five times as much carbon monoxide as most other cars in western europe .
in several cities in germany , restrictions are being put in place that will prohibit cars from entering city centers if they do n't meet certain environmental standards .
and those standards are getting tougher .
at the moment , the german government makes an exception for trabants to be on the road , because they are n't being made anymore .
but that could end , especially if eu rules begin to supercede german ones .
in the next few months , many vintage car fans will be holding protests to champion their cars as cultural artifacts which should be given a dispensation to stay on the streets and not just be relegated to garages or museums .
" well , you have to stay optimistic in order to get your point across , but in reality , it does n't look so good for us . "

in several cities in germany , restrictions are being put in place that will prohibit cars from entering city centers if they do n't meet certain environmental standards .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 19.05.2007 go , trabi , go !
east germany 's darling car turns 50 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other car in the world is such a powerful symbol of a bygone era looking like a cross between a golf cart and an amusement park bumper car , the trabant - a sluggish two-cylinder vehicle from east germany - was arguably the most venerated object of desire behind the iron curtain . the trabants , or trabis for short , were in production in the german democratic republic without any significant change for more than three decades .
and although the last new trabi hit the roads in 1991 , the vehicle - which turns 50 this year - has gained cult status in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis evoke memories of living in the gdr " i love my car , it 's like a child to me , " said christian marotz , board member of the trabant club berlin , a group that devotes a good deal of time and personal finance investment into all things trabant .
" it symbolizes a simpler life from earlier , in the east … oh , and insurance is cheap too , because they are n't stolen very often ! "
accidentally , a car the first trabi rolled off the factory floor in 1957 .
it was actually never really intended to be a car , but was planned as a three-wheeled motorcycle .
and even though the designers only expected production to last about 10 years , it ended up lasting 34 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last trabant left the assembly line on april 30 , 1991 the name trabant means " fellow traveler , " or satellite , and was inspired by the russian satellite sputnik , which went into space the year went on sale .
television ads by the trabant 's maker , the sachsenring automobile works in east germany , praised the trabi for offering " a lot of room for your luggage " and for being " agile , " " fast , " " long-lasting " and " robust , " but in reality the car left much to be desired .
at the time the trabi was launched , western countries already used cars with cleaner and more efficient engines .
the trabi 's own motor was a two-stroke affair with just two cylinders .
it delivered all of 25 horsepower , and took a full 21 seconds to get from 0 to 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- per hour .
its top speed was all of 112 kilometers per hour .
an entirely different perspective the trabi 's a little thing .
just under 360 cm -lrb- 140 inches -rrb- long , about 150 cm wide and 146 cm tall .
in today 's world of hummers and other suvs , it 's a real shrimp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's a real beauty !
while it had a steel frame , the body was made of something called duroplast - a form of hardened plastic made of cotton waste from russia and resins from the east german dye industry .
" it was the average car people would have in east germany , " said johannes drexler , who is a tour guide for trabi safari , a company in berlin that allows people to see berlin 's sites from the vantage point of this micro car .
" everyone tried to afford a trabant during the east german times .
you had to have yourself put on a list and you had to wait for the car between 11 and 15 years , " drexler said .
the 11 or 15 years was for those lucky enough to be living in berlin , which enjoyed some advantages over other parts of east germany .
those in other places could wait up to 18 years to get their car .
pure luxury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis were never this colorful before the fall of the berlin wall the trabi was probably one of the only cars that was more expensive to buy used than it was new .
a new trabi would set you back between 8,500 and 12,500 east german marks .
for a used car , which you could get much faster , you could pay as much as 4,000 more .
" to have a car in east germany was considered to be pure luxury , " drexler said .
the trabi plant in the city of zwickau churned out around 3.7 million of the cars in 34 years .
some were exported to other communist countries .
today , there are still about 58,000 trabis in use in germany , about 85 percent of them in the former east .
when the berlin wall fell in 1989 , the trabi was still produced for two more years .
but many easterners wanted flashier western cars at the time , so the market dried up .
numerous trabi jokes , however , have survived to this day .
how do you double the value of a trabant ?
fill up its gas tank .
why does the trabi have a heated rear window ?
it keeps your hands warm while you push it .
environmental concerns what finally might spell the end of the trabi - at least on the roads - is not ridicule , or even a lack of replacement parts .
it could be growing concerns about the environment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabi exhaust fumes can even be bought in cans as trabi fragrance trabis are not the " greenest " cars going .
they were n't built with pollution-reducing catalytic converters .
one study found that they spew about nine times as many hydrocarbons and five times as much carbon monoxide as most other cars in western europe .
in several cities in germany , restrictions are being put in place that will prohibit cars from entering city centers if they do n't meet certain environmental standards .
and those standards are getting tougher .
at the moment , the german government makes an exception for trabants to be on the road , because they are n't being made anymore .
but that could end , especially if eu rules begin to supercede german ones .
in the next few months , many vintage car fans will be holding protests to champion their cars as cultural artifacts which should be given a dispensation to stay on the streets and not just be relegated to garages or museums .
" well , you have to stay optimistic in order to get your point across , but in reality , it does n't look so good for us . "

the german soldiers were hit while shopping in a market in the town of kunduz , the provincial governor told afp .
" three of our german friends were killed and two were wounded .
one afghan interpreter was also wounded , " kunduz governor mohammad omar said .
six afghans were killed and 12 others wounded , six of them critically , he said .
all that was left of the bomber was two legs , omar said .
worst attack in years for germans the attack was the most deadly against the german troops since 2003 , when four were killed in a suicide car bombing in kabul .
nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- media office in the capital kabul confirmed there had been an explosion but said it had no details .
the german military based in the main northern city of mazar-i-sharif said it could not yet release any information .
germany has around 3,000 troops in afghanistan , operating largely in the north of the country .
twenty-one german soldiers have lost their lives in afghanistan since 2002 , including the ones killed on saturday .
around 60 foreign soldiers involved in the international mission to afghanistan have died this year , most of them in attacks or combat inside the country .
coalition claims to have killed dozens in another attack on saturday , a district police chief and one of his bodyguards were killed in a remote controlled bomb explosion in the eastern province of nangarhar , a district chief said .
an afghan general reported saturday meanwhile that soldiers from the army and the coalition led by the united states had killed 67 taliban in an ambush in the eastern province of paktia , near the border with pakistan .
" their bodies were lying on the ground , " general sami-ul haq badar told afp .
the soldiers had been tipped off that there were taliban in the area , he said .
the coalition announced separately that an estimated " several dozen enemy fighters " were killed in battles around midnight friday about 60 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- from kabul in kapisa province .
the death tolls issued by the military are impossible to verify independently .
the taliban , a movement rooted in an ultraconservative interpretation of islam , was removed from government nearly six years ago by the coalition .
thousands of foreign troops arrived soon afterwards to help stabilize the fragile and fractured country but they have been unable to tame the insurgents , who are supported by the al-qaeda movement .
taliban threatened revenge in the biggest success against the taliban , the group 's famously brutal top military commander mullah dadullah was killed a week ago in the southern province of helmand after being tracked from the border with pakistan .
the group threatened this week a wave of violence , including suicide bombings , roadside blasts and attacks to avenge his killing .
they said a suicide car bomb aimed at the governor of the southern province of kandahar on thursday was part of this campaign .
the governor was not in the targeted motorcade but the information and culture minister abdul karim khoram was wounded . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany criticizes us over afghan civilian deaths german defense minister franz josef jung has called for a rethink of us military tactics in afghanistan after us coalition operations caused a spate of civilian casualties .

" it was the average car people would have in east germany , " said johannes drexler , who is a tour guide for trabi safari , a company in berlin that allows people to see berlin 's sites from the vantage point of this micro car .
" everyone tried to afford a trabant during the east german times .
you had to have yourself put on a list and you had to wait for the car between 11 and 15 years , " drexler said .
the 11 or 15 years was for those lucky enough to be living in berlin , which enjoyed some advantages over other parts of east germany .
those in other places could wait up to 18 years to get their car .
pure luxury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis were never this colorful before the fall of the berlin wall the trabi was probably one of the only cars that was more expensive to buy used than it was new .
a new trabi would set you back between 8,500 and 12,500 east german marks .
for a used car , which you could get much faster , you could pay as much as 4,000 more .
" to have a car in east germany was considered to be pure luxury , " drexler said .
the trabi plant in the city of zwickau churned out around 3.7 million of the cars in 34 years .
some were exported to other communist countries .
today , there are still about 58,000 trabis in use in germany , about 85 percent of them in the former east .
when the berlin wall fell in 1989 , the trabi was still produced for two more years .
but many easterners wanted flashier western cars at the time , so the market dried up .
numerous trabi jokes , however , have survived to this day .
how do you double the value of a trabant ?
fill up its gas tank .
why does the trabi have a heated rear window ?
it keeps your hands warm while you push it .
environmental concerns what finally might spell the end of the trabi - at least on the roads - is not ridicule , or even a lack of replacement parts .
it could be growing concerns about the environment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabi exhaust fumes can even be bought in cans as trabi fragrance trabis are not the " greenest " cars going .
they were n't built with pollution-reducing catalytic converters .
one study found that they spew about nine times as many hydrocarbons and five times as much carbon monoxide as most other cars in western europe .
in several cities in germany , restrictions are being put in place that will prohibit cars from entering city centers if they do n't meet certain environmental standards .
and those standards are getting tougher .
at the moment , the german government makes an exception for trabants to be on the road , because they are n't being made anymore .
but that could end , especially if eu rules begin to supercede german ones .
in the next few months , many vintage car fans will be holding protests to champion their cars as cultural artifacts which should be given a dispensation to stay on the streets and not just be relegated to garages or museums .
" well , you have to stay optimistic in order to get your point across , but in reality , it does n't look so good for us . "

the german soldiers were hit while shopping in a market in the town of kunduz , the provincial governor told afp .
" three of our german friends were killed and two were wounded .
one afghan interpreter was also wounded , " kunduz governor mohammad omar said .
six afghans were killed and 12 others wounded , six of them critically , he said .
all that was left of the bomber was two legs , omar said .
worst attack in years for germans the attack was the most deadly against the german troops since 2003 , when four were killed in a suicide car bombing in kabul .
nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- media office in the capital kabul confirmed there had been an explosion but said it had no details .
the german military based in the main northern city of mazar-i-sharif said it could not yet release any information .
germany has around 3,000 troops in afghanistan , operating largely in the north of the country .
twenty-one german soldiers have lost their lives in afghanistan since 2002 , including the ones killed on saturday .
around 60 foreign soldiers involved in the international mission to afghanistan have died this year , most of them in attacks or combat inside the country .
coalition claims to have killed dozens in another attack on saturday , a district police chief and one of his bodyguards were killed in a remote controlled bomb explosion in the eastern province of nangarhar , a district chief said .
an afghan general reported saturday meanwhile that soldiers from the army and the coalition led by the united states had killed 67 taliban in an ambush in the eastern province of paktia , near the border with pakistan .
" their bodies were lying on the ground , " general sami-ul haq badar told afp .
the soldiers had been tipped off that there were taliban in the area , he said .
the coalition announced separately that an estimated " several dozen enemy fighters " were killed in battles around midnight friday about 60 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- from kabul in kapisa province .
the death tolls issued by the military are impossible to verify independently .
the taliban , a movement rooted in an ultraconservative interpretation of islam , was removed from government nearly six years ago by the coalition .
thousands of foreign troops arrived soon afterwards to help stabilize the fragile and fractured country but they have been unable to tame the insurgents , who are supported by the al-qaeda movement .
taliban threatened revenge in the biggest success against the taliban , the group 's famously brutal top military commander mullah dadullah was killed a week ago in the southern province of helmand after being tracked from the border with pakistan .
the group threatened this week a wave of violence , including suicide bombings , roadside blasts and attacks to avenge his killing .
they said a suicide car bomb aimed at the governor of the southern province of kandahar on thursday was part of this campaign .
the governor was not in the targeted motorcade but the information and culture minister abdul karim khoram was wounded . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany criticizes us over afghan civilian deaths german defense minister franz josef jung has called for a rethink of us military tactics in afghanistan after us coalition operations caused a spate of civilian casualties .

" i heard of this underhanded attack with great shock , " merkel said in a statement released in berlin .
" this perfidious murder fills all of us with disgust . "
she said the bombing was aimed at preventing the process of reconstruction in afghanistan from becoming a success , " but added that the international community was resolved to continue helping afghans create a better future for themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the bombing would n't deter the international community three german soldiers were killed and three wounded while six afghan civilians were killed and 14 others wounded when a suicide attacker detonated his explosive-laden vest in northern afghanistan , officials said .
provincial governor mohammad omar told german news agency dpa that three german soldiers were killed and two soldiers and an interpreter were wounded when the bomber struck in chaiferoshi market in kunduz on saturday morning .
six afghan shopkeepers and civilian passers-by were killed and another 14 were wounded , omar said .
" we received intelligence information a couple of days ago that four would-be suicide bombers entered the city and would use motorcycles to carry out their attacks , " omar said , adding that the police started searching motorbikes on thursday .
he said that the security forces would intensify their search to track down the remaining bombers .
general noor mohammad omarkhail , provincial security chief of the kunduz police , described the condition of seven of the wounded afghans as critical .
taliban claims responsibility a spokesperson for the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul confirmed the incident in a statement , but said that three isaf soldiers and five afghans were killed and 10 , including two isaf soldiers , were wounded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 3,000 german troops are stationed in afghanistan " this senseless act of violence shows the barbarity of extremists and criminals targeting civilians and isaf troops who are working to rebuild afghanistan , " lieutenant colonel angela billings , an isaf spokeswoman was quoted in the statement as saying .
taliban militants took responsibility for the attack and said 11 german soldiers were killed in the suicide blast that destroyed the windows of the shops as far as one kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- .
" today at 11:00 a.m. a mujahedeen hero , jawad , who is a resident of kunduz province , attacked the german soldiers who were patrolling in the area , " zabeeullah mujahed , a taliban spokesman said in a statement posted at their web site .
at the german defense ministry in berlin , officials declined to confirm any death toll , speaking only of " several " soldiers being killed , which was taken as a hint that the german wounded were in critical condition .
debate expected in parliament voicing shock at the attack , german defense minister franz josef jung broke off a private weekend trip and flew back to berlin to respond to the crisis .
the attack was expected to lead to renewed debate in germany about whether german soldiers should be posted to afghanistan .
germany 's green party , which has supported the afghan peace mission , appeared to be foreshadowing that debate saturday , calling for a massive rise in spending on training the afghan military .
the green parliamentary co-leaders said the attack was " intended to stop the establishment of democratic structures . "
german television reported that the soldiers got out of their patrol vehicle to do some shopping .
21 german dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not the first bundeswehr funerals in afghanistan it was the biggest suicide attack against german troops in afghanistan since june 2003 when four german soldiers were killed and 29 wounded .
apart from saturday 's incident , 18 german soldiers have been killed in afghanistan since the ouster of the taliban regime in late 2001 .
ten of them were killed by hostile acts while eight died in non-combat incidents .
there are around 3,000 german troops under the banner of the nato- led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in the country , the bulk of them stationed in the northern provinces .

east germany 's darling car turns 50 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other car in the world is such a powerful symbol of a bygone era looking like a cross between a golf cart and an amusement park bumper car , the trabant - a sluggish two-cylinder vehicle from east germany - was arguably the most venerated object of desire behind the iron curtain . the trabants , or trabis for short , were in production in the german democratic republic without any significant change for more than three decades .
and although the last new trabi hit the roads in 1991 , the vehicle - which turns 50 this year - has gained cult status in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis evoke memories of living in the gdr " i love my car , it 's like a child to me , " said christian marotz , board member of the trabant club berlin , a group that devotes a good deal of time and personal finance investment into all things trabant .
" it symbolizes a simpler life from earlier , in the east … oh , and insurance is cheap too , because they are n't stolen very often ! "
accidentally , a car the first trabi rolled off the factory floor in 1957 .
it was actually never really intended to be a car , but was planned as a three-wheeled motorcycle .
and even though the designers only expected production to last about 10 years , it ended up lasting 34 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last trabant left the assembly line on april 30 , 1991 the name trabant means " fellow traveler , " or satellite , and was inspired by the russian satellite sputnik , which went into space the year went on sale .
television ads by the trabant 's maker , the sachsenring automobile works in east germany , praised the trabi for offering " a lot of room for your luggage " and for being " agile , " " fast , " " long-lasting " and " robust , " but in reality the car left much to be desired .
at the time the trabi was launched , western countries already used cars with cleaner and more efficient engines .
the trabi 's own motor was a two-stroke affair with just two cylinders .
it delivered all of 25 horsepower , and took a full 21 seconds to get from 0 to 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- per hour .
its top speed was all of 112 kilometers per hour .
an entirely different perspective the trabi 's a little thing .
just under 360 cm -lrb- 140 inches -rrb- long , about 150 cm wide and 146 cm tall .
in today 's world of hummers and other suvs , it 's a real shrimp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's a real beauty !
while it had a steel frame , the body was made of something called duroplast - a form of hardened plastic made of cotton waste from russia and resins from the east german dye industry .
" it was the average car people would have in east germany , " said johannes drexler , who is a tour guide for trabi safari , a company in berlin that allows people to see berlin 's sites from the vantage point of this micro car .
" everyone tried to afford a trabant during the east german times .
you had to have yourself put on a list and you had to wait for the car between 11 and 15 years , " drexler said .

six afghan shopkeepers and civilian passers-by were killed and another 14 were wounded , omar said .
" we received intelligence information a couple of days ago that four would-be suicide bombers entered the city and would use motorcycles to carry out their attacks , " omar said , adding that the police started searching motorbikes on thursday .

the german soldiers were hit while shopping in a market in the town of kunduz , the provincial governor told afp .
" three of our german friends were killed and two were wounded .
one afghan interpreter was also wounded , " kunduz governor mohammad omar said .
six afghans were killed and 12 others wounded , six of them critically , he said .
all that was left of the bomber was two legs , omar said .
worst attack in years for germans the attack was the most deadly against the german troops since 2003 , when four were killed in a suicide car bombing in kabul .
nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- media office in the capital kabul confirmed there had been an explosion but said it had no details .
the german military based in the main northern city of mazar-i-sharif said it could not yet release any information .
germany has around 3,000 troops in afghanistan , operating largely in the north of the country .
twenty-one german soldiers have lost their lives in afghanistan since 2002 , including the ones killed on saturday .
around 60 foreign soldiers involved in the international mission to afghanistan have died this year , most of them in attacks or combat inside the country .
coalition claims to have killed dozens in another attack on saturday , a district police chief and one of his bodyguards were killed in a remote controlled bomb explosion in the eastern province of nangarhar , a district chief said .
an afghan general reported saturday meanwhile that soldiers from the army and the coalition led by the united states had killed 67 taliban in an ambush in the eastern province of paktia , near the border with pakistan .
" their bodies were lying on the ground , " general sami-ul haq badar told afp .
the soldiers had been tipped off that there were taliban in the area , he said .
the coalition announced separately that an estimated " several dozen enemy fighters " were killed in battles around midnight friday about 60 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- from kabul in kapisa province .
the death tolls issued by the military are impossible to verify independently .
the taliban , a movement rooted in an ultraconservative interpretation of islam , was removed from government nearly six years ago by the coalition .
thousands of foreign troops arrived soon afterwards to help stabilize the fragile and fractured country but they have been unable to tame the insurgents , who are supported by the al-qaeda movement .
taliban threatened revenge in the biggest success against the taliban , the group 's famously brutal top military commander mullah dadullah was killed a week ago in the southern province of helmand after being tracked from the border with pakistan .
the group threatened this week a wave of violence , including suicide bombings , roadside blasts and attacks to avenge his killing .
they said a suicide car bomb aimed at the governor of the southern province of kandahar on thursday was part of this campaign .
the governor was not in the targeted motorcade but the information and culture minister abdul karim khoram was wounded . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany criticizes us over afghan civilian deaths german defense minister franz josef jung has called for a rethink of us military tactics in afghanistan after us coalition operations caused a spate of civilian casualties .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 19.05.2007 european organizations hard-pressed to represent all muslims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are part of europe but are n't necessarily represented as such several european states have islamic associations that intend to represent all muslims in that country .
but opinions are widely divergent as to what representation really means .
dw-world.de offers a brief overview . spain : contract with the state in spain , 2.5 percent of the population is muslim , with the majority coming from north africa .
the spanish government granted islam official legal status back in 1992 in a cooperation agreement between the state and the spanish islamic commission -lrb- cie -rrb- . an estimated 30 percent of spanish muslim communities currently belong to the cie , which is made up of two federations , and as such as has two general secretaries instead of a president .
decisions can only be made when both federations agree .
because secularism is one of the spanish state 's fundamental principles , there is no real legal basis for an agreement of this kind with specific faiths .
the state has , however , also signed a similar agreement with organizations representing both christian confessions and with the jewish community .
islam has , therefore , been placed on an equal legal footing with the other major religions .
austria : criticism from within the ranks islam 's position in austria is very clear cut - islam has been recognized as a religion since 1912 and the islamic faith community in austria -lrb- iggiö -rrb- has enjoyed the status of a public corporation since its foundation in 1979 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconciling the different muslim denominatons under one group is difficult because of this , the austrian model is often held up as an example , but - and this is a large " but " - although the iggiö seeks to represent all muslims , many shiite and alevi muslims living in austria do not feel represented by the iggiö . in 2006 , the alevi submitted an application to the austrian ministry for religious affairs to have alevism recognized as an official religion . criticism has also been voiced by the sunnis , who claim that the iggiö does not represent their interests and allege that its structures are undemocratic .
the iggiö has been widely criticized for the lack of transparency in its membership practices .
only those who pay the annual membership fee are entitled to vote , but the organization does not release information about votes or lists of members . there have also been allegations of fees being returned without reason , and the rejection of membership applications , such as happened to günther ahmed rusznak , secretary general of the islamic information and documentation center and a harsh critic of the iggiö .
moreover , although almost 70 percent of austrian muslims are of turkish extraction , the iggiö leadership is almost exclusively made up of arab muslims .
this means that the iggiö 's status as a state-recognized body is at risk .
french islam by state decree ?
although the french council for the muslim faith -lrb- cfcm -rrb- was founded in 2003 at the instigation of the then interior minister nicolas sarkozy , it is only informally recognized as a representative by the state .
the council 's legal status corresponds to that of a registered charitable association .
some 88 percent of the 4,032 delegates from french mosques voted in council 's first elections .
the number of delegates is based on the size of each mosque ; there are also 25 representatives at regional level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has the biggest muslim population in the european union despite this high level of representation , the cfcm has been continually criticized for failing in its responsibility to represent muslims , particularly given that the french government influences the selection of candidates for all important posts within the organization . after all , sarkozy succeeded in installing his preferred candidate , the imam of paris ' central mosque , dalil boubakeur , as the head of the cfcm .
the french state is patently looking for a proponent of " liberal " islam as their muslim representative - someone who , for instance , would assist with the enforcement of the law banning religious symbols in schools .
this is exactly what upsets french muslims , who do not consider such policies to be in line with their interests .
other critics , however , consider the council to be too radical , as one of its member federations is said to have close links to the egyptian muslim brotherhood .
uk : disagreement on the political angle the muslim council of britain -lrb- mcb -rrb- was founded in the united kingdom in 1997 with the support of the labour government .
it fulfils its responsibility of representing all muslims in so far as it brings together some 3000 organizations from across the spectrum of british islam , and represents an estimated 70 percent of british muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated two million muslims live in great britain the mcb used to have a good relationship with the labour government ; however , since the london bombings , many muslims feel badly treated and misunderstood .
the mcb has to meet the difficult twin objectives of lobbying to enable stricter forms of islam to be practiced on the one hand , and of meeting the british public 's expectation of a firm rejection of terrorism and islamist acts of violence on the other .
the substantial group of sufist barelwi muslims in britain does not believe that the mcb can really represent all muslims because it is dominated by the deobandi , who practice a stricter form of islam and are more politically organized .
the barelwi are represented by the british muslim forum , which does not belong to the muslim council of britain .
although there has been no agreement with the government on muslim affairs in the uk , the construction of muslim primary and secondary schools is funded by the state .

east germany 's darling car turns 50 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other car in the world is such a powerful symbol of a bygone era looking like a cross between a golf cart and an amusement park bumper car , the trabant - a sluggish two-cylinder vehicle from east germany - was arguably the most venerated object of desire behind the iron curtain . the trabants , or trabis for short , were in production in the german democratic republic without any significant change for more than three decades .
and although the last new trabi hit the roads in 1991 , the vehicle - which turns 50 this year - has gained cult status in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis evoke memories of living in the gdr " i love my car , it 's like a child to me , " said christian marotz , board member of the trabant club berlin , a group that devotes a good deal of time and personal finance investment into all things trabant .
" it symbolizes a simpler life from earlier , in the east … oh , and insurance is cheap too , because they are n't stolen very often ! "
accidentally , a car the first trabi rolled off the factory floor in 1957 .
it was actually never really intended to be a car , but was planned as a three-wheeled motorcycle .
and even though the designers only expected production to last about 10 years , it ended up lasting 34 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last trabant left the assembly line on april 30 , 1991 the name trabant means " fellow traveler , " or satellite , and was inspired by the russian satellite sputnik , which went into space the year went on sale .
television ads by the trabant 's maker , the sachsenring automobile works in east germany , praised the trabi for offering " a lot of room for your luggage " and for being " agile , " " fast , " " long-lasting " and " robust , " but in reality the car left much to be desired .
at the time the trabi was launched , western countries already used cars with cleaner and more efficient engines .
the trabi 's own motor was a two-stroke affair with just two cylinders .
it delivered all of 25 horsepower , and took a full 21 seconds to get from 0 to 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- per hour .
its top speed was all of 112 kilometers per hour .
an entirely different perspective the trabi 's a little thing .
just under 360 cm -lrb- 140 inches -rrb- long , about 150 cm wide and 146 cm tall .
in today 's world of hummers and other suvs , it 's a real shrimp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's a real beauty !
while it had a steel frame , the body was made of something called duroplast - a form of hardened plastic made of cotton waste from russia and resins from the east german dye industry .
" it was the average car people would have in east germany , " said johannes drexler , who is a tour guide for trabi safari , a company in berlin that allows people to see berlin 's sites from the vantage point of this micro car .
" everyone tried to afford a trabant during the east german times .
you had to have yourself put on a list and you had to wait for the car between 11 and 15 years , " drexler said .
the 11 or 15 years was for those lucky enough to be living in berlin , which enjoyed some advantages over other parts of east germany .
those in other places could wait up to 18 years to get their car .
pure luxury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis were never this colorful before the fall of the berlin wall the trabi was probably one of the only cars that was more expensive to buy used than it was new .
a new trabi would set you back between 8,500 and 12,500 east german marks .
for a used car , which you could get much faster , you could pay as much as 4,000 more .
" to have a car in east germany was considered to be pure luxury , " drexler said .
the trabi plant in the city of zwickau churned out around 3.7 million of the cars in 34 years .
some were exported to other communist countries .
today , there are still about 58,000 trabis in use in germany , about 85 percent of them in the former east .
when the berlin wall fell in 1989 , the trabi was still produced for two more years .
but many easterners wanted flashier western cars at the time , so the market dried up .
numerous trabi jokes , however , have survived to this day .
how do you double the value of a trabant ?
fill up its gas tank .
why does the trabi have a heated rear window ?
it keeps your hands warm while you push it .
environmental concerns what finally might spell the end of the trabi - at least on the roads - is not ridicule , or even a lack of replacement parts .
it could be growing concerns about the environment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabi exhaust fumes can even be bought in cans as trabi fragrance trabis are not the " greenest " cars going .
they were n't built with pollution-reducing catalytic converters .
one study found that they spew about nine times as many hydrocarbons and five times as much carbon monoxide as most other cars in western europe .
in several cities in germany , restrictions are being put in place that will prohibit cars from entering city centers if they do n't meet certain environmental standards .
and those standards are getting tougher .
at the moment , the german government makes an exception for trabants to be on the road , because they are n't being made anymore .

east germany 's darling car turns 50 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other car in the world is such a powerful symbol of a bygone era looking like a cross between a golf cart and an amusement park bumper car , the trabant - a sluggish two-cylinder vehicle from east germany - was arguably the most venerated object of desire behind the iron curtain . the trabants , or trabis for short , were in production in the german democratic republic without any significant change for more than three decades .
and although the last new trabi hit the roads in 1991 , the vehicle - which turns 50 this year - has gained cult status in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis evoke memories of living in the gdr " i love my car , it 's like a child to me , " said christian marotz , board member of the trabant club berlin , a group that devotes a good deal of time and personal finance investment into all things trabant .
" it symbolizes a simpler life from earlier , in the east … oh , and insurance is cheap too , because they are n't stolen very often ! "
accidentally , a car the first trabi rolled off the factory floor in 1957 .
it was actually never really intended to be a car , but was planned as a three-wheeled motorcycle .
and even though the designers only expected production to last about 10 years , it ended up lasting 34 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last trabant left the assembly line on april 30 , 1991 the name trabant means " fellow traveler , " or satellite , and was inspired by the russian satellite sputnik , which went into space the year went on sale .
television ads by the trabant 's maker , the sachsenring automobile works in east germany , praised the trabi for offering " a lot of room for your luggage " and for being " agile , " " fast , " " long-lasting " and " robust , " but in reality the car left much to be desired .
at the time the trabi was launched , western countries already used cars with cleaner and more efficient engines .
the trabi 's own motor was a two-stroke affair with just two cylinders .
it delivered all of 25 horsepower , and took a full 21 seconds to get from 0 to 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- per hour .
its top speed was all of 112 kilometers per hour .
an entirely different perspective the trabi 's a little thing .
just under 360 cm -lrb- 140 inches -rrb- long , about 150 cm wide and 146 cm tall .
in today 's world of hummers and other suvs , it 's a real shrimp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's a real beauty !
while it had a steel frame , the body was made of something called duroplast - a form of hardened plastic made of cotton waste from russia and resins from the east german dye industry .
" it was the average car people would have in east germany , " said johannes drexler , who is a tour guide for trabi safari , a company in berlin that allows people to see berlin 's sites from the vantage point of this micro car .
" everyone tried to afford a trabant during the east german times .
you had to have yourself put on a list and you had to wait for the car between 11 and 15 years , " drexler said .
the 11 or 15 years was for those lucky enough to be living in berlin , which enjoyed some advantages over other parts of east germany .
those in other places could wait up to 18 years to get their car .
pure luxury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis were never this colorful before the fall of the berlin wall the trabi was probably one of the only cars that was more expensive to buy used than it was new .
a new trabi would set you back between 8,500 and 12,500 east german marks .
for a used car , which you could get much faster , you could pay as much as 4,000 more .
" to have a car in east germany was considered to be pure luxury , " drexler said .
the trabi plant in the city of zwickau churned out around 3.7 million of the cars in 34 years .
some were exported to other communist countries .
today , there are still about 58,000 trabis in use in germany , about 85 percent of them in the former east .
when the berlin wall fell in 1989 , the trabi was still produced for two more years .
but many easterners wanted flashier western cars at the time , so the market dried up .
numerous trabi jokes , however , have survived to this day .
how do you double the value of a trabant ?
fill up its gas tank .
why does the trabi have a heated rear window ?
it keeps your hands warm while you push it .
environmental concerns what finally might spell the end of the trabi - at least on the roads - is not ridicule , or even a lack of replacement parts .
it could be growing concerns about the environment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabi exhaust fumes can even be bought in cans as trabi fragrance trabis are not the " greenest " cars going .
they were n't built with pollution-reducing catalytic converters .
one study found that they spew about nine times as many hydrocarbons and five times as much carbon monoxide as most other cars in western europe .
in several cities in germany , restrictions are being put in place that will prohibit cars from entering city centers if they do n't meet certain environmental standards .
and those standards are getting tougher .
at the moment , the german government makes an exception for trabants to be on the road , because they are n't being made anymore .
but that could end , especially if eu rules begin to supercede german ones .
in the next few months , many vintage car fans will be holding protests to champion their cars as cultural artifacts which should be given a dispensation to stay on the streets and not just be relegated to garages or museums .

east germany 's darling car turns 50 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other car in the world is such a powerful symbol of a bygone era looking like a cross between a golf cart and an amusement park bumper car , the trabant - a sluggish two-cylinder vehicle from east germany - was arguably the most venerated object of desire behind the iron curtain . the trabants , or trabis for short , were in production in the german democratic republic without any significant change for more than three decades .
and although the last new trabi hit the roads in 1991 , the vehicle - which turns 50 this year - has gained cult status in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis evoke memories of living in the gdr " i love my car , it 's like a child to me , " said christian marotz , board member of the trabant club berlin , a group that devotes a good deal of time and personal finance investment into all things trabant .
" it symbolizes a simpler life from earlier , in the east … oh , and insurance is cheap too , because they are n't stolen very often ! "
accidentally , a car the first trabi rolled off the factory floor in 1957 .
it was actually never really intended to be a car , but was planned as a three-wheeled motorcycle .
and even though the designers only expected production to last about 10 years , it ended up lasting 34 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last trabant left the assembly line on april 30 , 1991 the name trabant means " fellow traveler , " or satellite , and was inspired by the russian satellite sputnik , which went into space the year went on sale .
television ads by the trabant 's maker , the sachsenring automobile works in east germany , praised the trabi for offering " a lot of room for your luggage " and for being " agile , " " fast , " " long-lasting " and " robust , " but in reality the car left much to be desired .
at the time the trabi was launched , western countries already used cars with cleaner and more efficient engines .
the trabi 's own motor was a two-stroke affair with just two cylinders .
it delivered all of 25 horsepower , and took a full 21 seconds to get from 0 to 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- per hour .
its top speed was all of 112 kilometers per hour .
an entirely different perspective the trabi 's a little thing .
just under 360 cm -lrb- 140 inches -rrb- long , about 150 cm wide and 146 cm tall .
in today 's world of hummers and other suvs , it 's a real shrimp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's a real beauty !
while it had a steel frame , the body was made of something called duroplast - a form of hardened plastic made of cotton waste from russia and resins from the east german dye industry .
" it was the average car people would have in east germany , " said johannes drexler , who is a tour guide for trabi safari , a company in berlin that allows people to see berlin 's sites from the vantage point of this micro car .
" everyone tried to afford a trabant during the east german times .
you had to have yourself put on a list and you had to wait for the car between 11 and 15 years , " drexler said .
the 11 or 15 years was for those lucky enough to be living in berlin , which enjoyed some advantages over other parts of east germany .
those in other places could wait up to 18 years to get their car .
pure luxury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis were never this colorful before the fall of the berlin wall the trabi was probably one of the only cars that was more expensive to buy used than it was new .
a new trabi would set you back between 8,500 and 12,500 east german marks .
for a used car , which you could get much faster , you could pay as much as 4,000 more .
" to have a car in east germany was considered to be pure luxury , " drexler said .
the trabi plant in the city of zwickau churned out around 3.7 million of the cars in 34 years .
some were exported to other communist countries .
today , there are still about 58,000 trabis in use in germany , about 85 percent of them in the former east .
when the berlin wall fell in 1989 , the trabi was still produced for two more years .
but many easterners wanted flashier western cars at the time , so the market dried up .
numerous trabi jokes , however , have survived to this day .
how do you double the value of a trabant ?
fill up its gas tank .
why does the trabi have a heated rear window ?
it keeps your hands warm while you push it .
environmental concerns what finally might spell the end of the trabi - at least on the roads - is not ridicule , or even a lack of replacement parts .
it could be growing concerns about the environment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabi exhaust fumes can even be bought in cans as trabi fragrance trabis are not the " greenest " cars going .
they were n't built with pollution-reducing catalytic converters .
one study found that they spew about nine times as many hydrocarbons and five times as much carbon monoxide as most other cars in western europe .
in several cities in germany , restrictions are being put in place that will prohibit cars from entering city centers if they do n't meet certain environmental standards .
and those standards are getting tougher .
at the moment , the german government makes an exception for trabants to be on the road , because they are n't being made anymore .
but that could end , especially if eu rules begin to supercede german ones .
in the next few months , many vintage car fans will be holding protests to champion their cars as cultural artifacts which should be given a dispensation to stay on the streets and not just be relegated to garages or museums .
" well , you have to stay optimistic in order to get your point across , but in reality , it does n't look so good for us . "

the german soldiers were hit while shopping in a market in the town of kunduz , the provincial governor told afp .
" three of our german friends were killed and two were wounded .
one afghan interpreter was also wounded , " kunduz governor mohammad omar said .
six afghans were killed and 12 others wounded , six of them critically , he said .
all that was left of the bomber was two legs , omar said .
worst attack in years for germans the attack was the most deadly against the german troops since 2003 , when four were killed in a suicide car bombing in kabul .
nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- media office in the capital kabul confirmed there had been an explosion but said it had no details .
the german military based in the main northern city of mazar-i-sharif said it could not yet release any information .
germany has around 3,000 troops in afghanistan , operating largely in the north of the country .
twenty-one german soldiers have lost their lives in afghanistan since 2002 , including the ones killed on saturday .

the coalition announced separately that an estimated " several dozen enemy fighters " were killed in battles around midnight friday about 60 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- from kabul in kapisa province .
the death tolls issued by the military are impossible to verify independently .
the taliban , a movement rooted in an ultraconservative interpretation of islam , was removed from government nearly six years ago by the coalition .
thousands of foreign troops arrived soon afterwards to help stabilize the fragile and fractured country but they have been unable to tame the insurgents , who are supported by the al-qaeda movement .

the german soldiers were hit while shopping in a market in the town of kunduz , the provincial governor told afp .
" three of our german friends were killed and two were wounded .
one afghan interpreter was also wounded , " kunduz governor mohammad omar said .
six afghans were killed and 12 others wounded , six of them critically , he said .
all that was left of the bomber was two legs , omar said .
worst attack in years for germans the attack was the most deadly against the german troops since 2003 , when four were killed in a suicide car bombing in kabul .
nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- media office in the capital kabul confirmed there had been an explosion but said it had no details .
the german military based in the main northern city of mazar-i-sharif said it could not yet release any information .
germany has around 3,000 troops in afghanistan , operating largely in the north of the country .
twenty-one german soldiers have lost their lives in afghanistan since 2002 , including the ones killed on saturday .
around 60 foreign soldiers involved in the international mission to afghanistan have died this year , most of them in attacks or combat inside the country .
coalition claims to have killed dozens in another attack on saturday , a district police chief and one of his bodyguards were killed in a remote controlled bomb explosion in the eastern province of nangarhar , a district chief said .
an afghan general reported saturday meanwhile that soldiers from the army and the coalition led by the united states had killed 67 taliban in an ambush in the eastern province of paktia , near the border with pakistan .
" their bodies were lying on the ground , " general sami-ul haq badar told afp .
the soldiers had been tipped off that there were taliban in the area , he said .
the coalition announced separately that an estimated " several dozen enemy fighters " were killed in battles around midnight friday about 60 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- from kabul in kapisa province .
the death tolls issued by the military are impossible to verify independently .
the taliban , a movement rooted in an ultraconservative interpretation of islam , was removed from government nearly six years ago by the coalition .
thousands of foreign troops arrived soon afterwards to help stabilize the fragile and fractured country but they have been unable to tame the insurgents , who are supported by the al-qaeda movement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 19.05.2007 european organizations hard-pressed to represent all muslims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are part of europe but are n't necessarily represented as such several european states have islamic associations that intend to represent all muslims in that country .
but opinions are widely divergent as to what representation really means .
dw-world.de offers a brief overview . spain : contract with the state in spain , 2.5 percent of the population is muslim , with the majority coming from north africa .
the spanish government granted islam official legal status back in 1992 in a cooperation agreement between the state and the spanish islamic commission -lrb- cie -rrb- . an estimated 30 percent of spanish muslim communities currently belong to the cie , which is made up of two federations , and as such as has two general secretaries instead of a president .
decisions can only be made when both federations agree .
because secularism is one of the spanish state 's fundamental principles , there is no real legal basis for an agreement of this kind with specific faiths .
the state has , however , also signed a similar agreement with organizations representing both christian confessions and with the jewish community .
islam has , therefore , been placed on an equal legal footing with the other major religions .
austria : criticism from within the ranks islam 's position in austria is very clear cut - islam has been recognized as a religion since 1912 and the islamic faith community in austria -lrb- iggiö -rrb- has enjoyed the status of a public corporation since its foundation in 1979 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconciling the different muslim denominatons under one group is difficult because of this , the austrian model is often held up as an example , but - and this is a large " but " - although the iggiö seeks to represent all muslims , many shiite and alevi muslims living in austria do not feel represented by the iggiö . in 2006 , the alevi submitted an application to the austrian ministry for religious affairs to have alevism recognized as an official religion . criticism has also been voiced by the sunnis , who claim that the iggiö does not represent their interests and allege that its structures are undemocratic .
the iggiö has been widely criticized for the lack of transparency in its membership practices .
only those who pay the annual membership fee are entitled to vote , but the organization does not release information about votes or lists of members . there have also been allegations of fees being returned without reason , and the rejection of membership applications , such as happened to günther ahmed rusznak , secretary general of the islamic information and documentation center and a harsh critic of the iggiö .
moreover , although almost 70 percent of austrian muslims are of turkish extraction , the iggiö leadership is almost exclusively made up of arab muslims .
this means that the iggiö 's status as a state-recognized body is at risk .
french islam by state decree ?
although the french council for the muslim faith -lrb- cfcm -rrb- was founded in 2003 at the instigation of the then interior minister nicolas sarkozy , it is only informally recognized as a representative by the state .
the council 's legal status corresponds to that of a registered charitable association .
some 88 percent of the 4,032 delegates from french mosques voted in council 's first elections .
the number of delegates is based on the size of each mosque ; there are also 25 representatives at regional level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has the biggest muslim population in the european union despite this high level of representation , the cfcm has been continually criticized for failing in its responsibility to represent muslims , particularly given that the french government influences the selection of candidates for all important posts within the organization . after all , sarkozy succeeded in installing his preferred candidate , the imam of paris ' central mosque , dalil boubakeur , as the head of the cfcm .
the french state is patently looking for a proponent of " liberal " islam as their muslim representative - someone who , for instance , would assist with the enforcement of the law banning religious symbols in schools .
this is exactly what upsets french muslims , who do not consider such policies to be in line with their interests .
other critics , however , consider the council to be too radical , as one of its member federations is said to have close links to the egyptian muslim brotherhood .
uk : disagreement on the political angle the muslim council of britain -lrb- mcb -rrb- was founded in the united kingdom in 1997 with the support of the labour government .
it fulfils its responsibility of representing all muslims in so far as it brings together some 3000 organizations from across the spectrum of british islam , and represents an estimated 70 percent of british muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated two million muslims live in great britain the mcb used to have a good relationship with the labour government ; however , since the london bombings , many muslims feel badly treated and misunderstood .
the mcb has to meet the difficult twin objectives of lobbying to enable stricter forms of islam to be practiced on the one hand , and of meeting the british public 's expectation of a firm rejection of terrorism and islamist acts of violence on the other .
the substantial group of sufist barelwi muslims in britain does not believe that the mcb can really represent all muslims because it is dominated by the deobandi , who practice a stricter form of islam and are more politically organized .
the barelwi are represented by the british muslim forum , which does not belong to the muslim council of britain .
although there has been no agreement with the government on muslim affairs in the uk , the construction of muslim primary and secondary schools is funded by the state .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 19.05.2007 european organizations hard-pressed to represent all muslims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are part of europe but are n't necessarily represented as such several european states have islamic associations that intend to represent all muslims in that country .
but opinions are widely divergent as to what representation really means .
dw-world.de offers a brief overview . spain : contract with the state in spain , 2.5 percent of the population is muslim , with the majority coming from north africa .
the spanish government granted islam official legal status back in 1992 in a cooperation agreement between the state and the spanish islamic commission -lrb- cie -rrb- . an estimated 30 percent of spanish muslim communities currently belong to the cie , which is made up of two federations , and as such as has two general secretaries instead of a president .
decisions can only be made when both federations agree .
because secularism is one of the spanish state 's fundamental principles , there is no real legal basis for an agreement of this kind with specific faiths .
the state has , however , also signed a similar agreement with organizations representing both christian confessions and with the jewish community .
islam has , therefore , been placed on an equal legal footing with the other major religions .
austria : criticism from within the ranks islam 's position in austria is very clear cut - islam has been recognized as a religion since 1912 and the islamic faith community in austria -lrb- iggiö -rrb- has enjoyed the status of a public corporation since its foundation in 1979 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconciling the different muslim denominatons under one group is difficult because of this , the austrian model is often held up as an example , but - and this is a large " but " - although the iggiö seeks to represent all muslims , many shiite and alevi muslims living in austria do not feel represented by the iggiö . in 2006 , the alevi submitted an application to the austrian ministry for religious affairs to have alevism recognized as an official religion . criticism has also been voiced by the sunnis , who claim that the iggiö does not represent their interests and allege that its structures are undemocratic .
the iggiö has been widely criticized for the lack of transparency in its membership practices .
only those who pay the annual membership fee are entitled to vote , but the organization does not release information about votes or lists of members . there have also been allegations of fees being returned without reason , and the rejection of membership applications , such as happened to günther ahmed rusznak , secretary general of the islamic information and documentation center and a harsh critic of the iggiö .
moreover , although almost 70 percent of austrian muslims are of turkish extraction , the iggiö leadership is almost exclusively made up of arab muslims .
this means that the iggiö 's status as a state-recognized body is at risk .
french islam by state decree ?
although the french council for the muslim faith -lrb- cfcm -rrb- was founded in 2003 at the instigation of the then interior minister nicolas sarkozy , it is only informally recognized as a representative by the state .
the council 's legal status corresponds to that of a registered charitable association .
some 88 percent of the 4,032 delegates from french mosques voted in council 's first elections .
the number of delegates is based on the size of each mosque ; there are also 25 representatives at regional level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has the biggest muslim population in the european union despite this high level of representation , the cfcm has been continually criticized for failing in its responsibility to represent muslims , particularly given that the french government influences the selection of candidates for all important posts within the organization . after all , sarkozy succeeded in installing his preferred candidate , the imam of paris ' central mosque , dalil boubakeur , as the head of the cfcm .
the french state is patently looking for a proponent of " liberal " islam as their muslim representative - someone who , for instance , would assist with the enforcement of the law banning religious symbols in schools .
this is exactly what upsets french muslims , who do not consider such policies to be in line with their interests .
other critics , however , consider the council to be too radical , as one of its member federations is said to have close links to the egyptian muslim brotherhood .
uk : disagreement on the political angle the muslim council of britain -lrb- mcb -rrb- was founded in the united kingdom in 1997 with the support of the labour government .
it fulfils its responsibility of representing all muslims in so far as it brings together some 3000 organizations from across the spectrum of british islam , and represents an estimated 70 percent of british muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated two million muslims live in great britain the mcb used to have a good relationship with the labour government ; however , since the london bombings , many muslims feel badly treated and misunderstood .
the mcb has to meet the difficult twin objectives of lobbying to enable stricter forms of islam to be practiced on the one hand , and of meeting the british public 's expectation of a firm rejection of terrorism and islamist acts of violence on the other .
the substantial group of sufist barelwi muslims in britain does not believe that the mcb can really represent all muslims because it is dominated by the deobandi , who practice a stricter form of islam and are more politically organized .
the barelwi are represented by the british muslim forum , which does not belong to the muslim council of britain .
although there has been no agreement with the government on muslim affairs in the uk , the construction of muslim primary and secondary schools is funded by the state .

east germany 's darling car turns 50 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other car in the world is such a powerful symbol of a bygone era looking like a cross between a golf cart and an amusement park bumper car , the trabant - a sluggish two-cylinder vehicle from east germany - was arguably the most venerated object of desire behind the iron curtain . the trabants , or trabis for short , were in production in the german democratic republic without any significant change for more than three decades .
and although the last new trabi hit the roads in 1991 , the vehicle - which turns 50 this year - has gained cult status in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis evoke memories of living in the gdr " i love my car , it 's like a child to me , " said christian marotz , board member of the trabant club berlin , a group that devotes a good deal of time and personal finance investment into all things trabant .
" it symbolizes a simpler life from earlier , in the east … oh , and insurance is cheap too , because they are n't stolen very often ! "
accidentally , a car the first trabi rolled off the factory floor in 1957 .
it was actually never really intended to be a car , but was planned as a three-wheeled motorcycle .
and even though the designers only expected production to last about 10 years , it ended up lasting 34 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last trabant left the assembly line on april 30 , 1991 the name trabant means " fellow traveler , " or satellite , and was inspired by the russian satellite sputnik , which went into space the year went on sale .
television ads by the trabant 's maker , the sachsenring automobile works in east germany , praised the trabi for offering " a lot of room for your luggage " and for being " agile , " " fast , " " long-lasting " and " robust , " but in reality the car left much to be desired .
at the time the trabi was launched , western countries already used cars with cleaner and more efficient engines .

why does the trabi have a heated rear window ?

in several cities in germany , restrictions are being put in place that will prohibit cars from entering city centers if they do n't meet certain environmental standards .

at the moment , the german government makes an exception for trabants to be on the road , because they are n't being made anymore .

east germany 's darling car turns 50 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other car in the world is such a powerful symbol of a bygone era looking like a cross between a golf cart and an amusement park bumper car , the trabant - a sluggish two-cylinder vehicle from east germany - was arguably the most venerated object of desire behind the iron curtain . the trabants , or trabis for short , were in production in the german democratic republic without any significant change for more than three decades .
and although the last new trabi hit the roads in 1991 , the vehicle - which turns 50 this year - has gained cult status in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis evoke memories of living in the gdr " i love my car , it 's like a child to me , " said christian marotz , board member of the trabant club berlin , a group that devotes a good deal of time and personal finance investment into all things trabant .

accidentally , a car the first trabi rolled off the factory floor in 1957 .
it was actually never really intended to be a car , but was planned as a three-wheeled motorcycle .

" i heard of this underhanded attack with great shock , " merkel said in a statement released in berlin .
" this perfidious murder fills all of us with disgust . "
she said the bombing was aimed at preventing the process of reconstruction in afghanistan from becoming a success , " but added that the international community was resolved to continue helping afghans create a better future for themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the bombing would n't deter the international community three german soldiers were killed and three wounded while six afghan civilians were killed and 14 others wounded when a suicide attacker detonated his explosive-laden vest in northern afghanistan , officials said .
provincial governor mohammad omar told german news agency dpa that three german soldiers were killed and two soldiers and an interpreter were wounded when the bomber struck in chaiferoshi market in kunduz on saturday morning .
six afghan shopkeepers and civilian passers-by were killed and another 14 were wounded , omar said .
" we received intelligence information a couple of days ago that four would-be suicide bombers entered the city and would use motorcycles to carry out their attacks , " omar said , adding that the police started searching motorbikes on thursday .
he said that the security forces would intensify their search to track down the remaining bombers .
general noor mohammad omarkhail , provincial security chief of the kunduz police , described the condition of seven of the wounded afghans as critical .
taliban claims responsibility a spokesperson for the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul confirmed the incident in a statement , but said that three isaf soldiers and five afghans were killed and 10 , including two isaf soldiers , were wounded .

" today at 11:00 a.m. a mujahedeen hero , jawad , who is a resident of kunduz province , attacked the german soldiers who were patrolling in the area , " zabeeullah mujahed , a taliban spokesman said in a statement posted at their web site .
at the german defense ministry in berlin , officials declined to confirm any death toll , speaking only of " several " soldiers being killed , which was taken as a hint that the german wounded were in critical condition .
debate expected in parliament voicing shock at the attack , german defense minister franz josef jung broke off a private weekend trip and flew back to berlin to respond to the crisis .
the attack was expected to lead to renewed debate in germany about whether german soldiers should be posted to afghanistan .
germany 's green party , which has supported the afghan peace mission , appeared to be foreshadowing that debate saturday , calling for a massive rise in spending on training the afghan military .
the green parliamentary co-leaders said the attack was " intended to stop the establishment of democratic structures . "
german television reported that the soldiers got out of their patrol vehicle to do some shopping .

the german soldiers were hit while shopping in a market in the town of kunduz , the provincial governor told afp .
" three of our german friends were killed and two were wounded .
one afghan interpreter was also wounded , " kunduz governor mohammad omar said .
six afghans were killed and 12 others wounded , six of them critically , he said .
all that was left of the bomber was two legs , omar said .
worst attack in years for germans the attack was the most deadly against the german troops since 2003 , when four were killed in a suicide car bombing in kabul .
nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- media office in the capital kabul confirmed there had been an explosion but said it had no details .
the german military based in the main northern city of mazar-i-sharif said it could not yet release any information .
germany has around 3,000 troops in afghanistan , operating largely in the north of the country .
twenty-one german soldiers have lost their lives in afghanistan since 2002 , including the ones killed on saturday .
around 60 foreign soldiers involved in the international mission to afghanistan have died this year , most of them in attacks or combat inside the country .
coalition claims to have killed dozens in another attack on saturday , a district police chief and one of his bodyguards were killed in a remote controlled bomb explosion in the eastern province of nangarhar , a district chief said .
an afghan general reported saturday meanwhile that soldiers from the army and the coalition led by the united states had killed 67 taliban in an ambush in the eastern province of paktia , near the border with pakistan .
" their bodies were lying on the ground , " general sami-ul haq badar told afp .
the soldiers had been tipped off that there were taliban in the area , he said .
the coalition announced separately that an estimated " several dozen enemy fighters " were killed in battles around midnight friday about 60 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- from kabul in kapisa province .
the death tolls issued by the military are impossible to verify independently .
the taliban , a movement rooted in an ultraconservative interpretation of islam , was removed from government nearly six years ago by the coalition .
thousands of foreign troops arrived soon afterwards to help stabilize the fragile and fractured country but they have been unable to tame the insurgents , who are supported by the al-qaeda movement .
taliban threatened revenge in the biggest success against the taliban , the group 's famously brutal top military commander mullah dadullah was killed a week ago in the southern province of helmand after being tracked from the border with pakistan .
the group threatened this week a wave of violence , including suicide bombings , roadside blasts and attacks to avenge his killing .
they said a suicide car bomb aimed at the governor of the southern province of kandahar on thursday was part of this campaign .
the governor was not in the targeted motorcade but the information and culture minister abdul karim khoram was wounded . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany criticizes us over afghan civilian deaths german defense minister franz josef jung has called for a rethink of us military tactics in afghanistan after us coalition operations caused a spate of civilian casualties .

the german soldiers were hit while shopping in a market in the town of kunduz , the provincial governor told afp .
" three of our german friends were killed and two were wounded .
one afghan interpreter was also wounded , " kunduz governor mohammad omar said .
six afghans were killed and 12 others wounded , six of them critically , he said .
all that was left of the bomber was two legs , omar said .
worst attack in years for germans the attack was the most deadly against the german troops since 2003 , when four were killed in a suicide car bombing in kabul .
nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- media office in the capital kabul confirmed there had been an explosion but said it had no details .
the german military based in the main northern city of mazar-i-sharif said it could not yet release any information .
germany has around 3,000 troops in afghanistan , operating largely in the north of the country .
twenty-one german soldiers have lost their lives in afghanistan since 2002 , including the ones killed on saturday .
around 60 foreign soldiers involved in the international mission to afghanistan have died this year , most of them in attacks or combat inside the country .
coalition claims to have killed dozens in another attack on saturday , a district police chief and one of his bodyguards were killed in a remote controlled bomb explosion in the eastern province of nangarhar , a district chief said .
an afghan general reported saturday meanwhile that soldiers from the army and the coalition led by the united states had killed 67 taliban in an ambush in the eastern province of paktia , near the border with pakistan .
" their bodies were lying on the ground , " general sami-ul haq badar told afp .
the soldiers had been tipped off that there were taliban in the area , he said .
the coalition announced separately that an estimated " several dozen enemy fighters " were killed in battles around midnight friday about 60 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- from kabul in kapisa province .
the death tolls issued by the military are impossible to verify independently .
the taliban , a movement rooted in an ultraconservative interpretation of islam , was removed from government nearly six years ago by the coalition .
thousands of foreign troops arrived soon afterwards to help stabilize the fragile and fractured country but they have been unable to tame the insurgents , who are supported by the al-qaeda movement .
taliban threatened revenge in the biggest success against the taliban , the group 's famously brutal top military commander mullah dadullah was killed a week ago in the southern province of helmand after being tracked from the border with pakistan .
the group threatened this week a wave of violence , including suicide bombings , roadside blasts and attacks to avenge his killing .
they said a suicide car bomb aimed at the governor of the southern province of kandahar on thursday was part of this campaign .
the governor was not in the targeted motorcade but the information and culture minister abdul karim khoram was wounded . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany criticizes us over afghan civilian deaths german defense minister franz josef jung has called for a rethink of us military tactics in afghanistan after us coalition operations caused a spate of civilian casualties .

" i heard of this underhanded attack with great shock , " merkel said in a statement released in berlin .
" this perfidious murder fills all of us with disgust . "
she said the bombing was aimed at preventing the process of reconstruction in afghanistan from becoming a success , " but added that the international community was resolved to continue helping afghans create a better future for themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the bombing would n't deter the international community three german soldiers were killed and three wounded while six afghan civilians were killed and 14 others wounded when a suicide attacker detonated his explosive-laden vest in northern afghanistan , officials said .
provincial governor mohammad omar told german news agency dpa that three german soldiers were killed and two soldiers and an interpreter were wounded when the bomber struck in chaiferoshi market in kunduz on saturday morning .
six afghan shopkeepers and civilian passers-by were killed and another 14 were wounded , omar said .
" we received intelligence information a couple of days ago that four would-be suicide bombers entered the city and would use motorcycles to carry out their attacks , " omar said , adding that the police started searching motorbikes on thursday .
he said that the security forces would intensify their search to track down the remaining bombers .
general noor mohammad omarkhail , provincial security chief of the kunduz police , described the condition of seven of the wounded afghans as critical .
taliban claims responsibility a spokesperson for the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul confirmed the incident in a statement , but said that three isaf soldiers and five afghans were killed and 10 , including two isaf soldiers , were wounded .

taliban militants took responsibility for the attack and said 11 german soldiers were killed in the suicide blast that destroyed the windows of the shops as far as one kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- .
" today at 11:00 a.m. a mujahedeen hero , jawad , who is a resident of kunduz province , attacked the german soldiers who were patrolling in the area , " zabeeullah mujahed , a taliban spokesman said in a statement posted at their web site .
at the german defense ministry in berlin , officials declined to confirm any death toll , speaking only of " several " soldiers being killed , which was taken as a hint that the german wounded were in critical condition .
debate expected in parliament voicing shock at the attack , german defense minister franz josef jung broke off a private weekend trip and flew back to berlin to respond to the crisis .
the attack was expected to lead to renewed debate in germany about whether german soldiers should be posted to afghanistan .
germany 's green party , which has supported the afghan peace mission , appeared to be foreshadowing that debate saturday , calling for a massive rise in spending on training the afghan military .
the green parliamentary co-leaders said the attack was " intended to stop the establishment of democratic structures . "
german television reported that the soldiers got out of their patrol vehicle to do some shopping .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 3,000 german troops are stationed in afghanistan " this senseless act of violence shows the barbarity of extremists and criminals targeting civilians and isaf troops who are working to rebuild afghanistan , " lieutenant colonel angela billings , an isaf spokeswoman was quoted in the statement as saying .
taliban militants took responsibility for the attack and said 11 german soldiers were killed in the suicide blast that destroyed the windows of the shops as far as one kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- .
" today at 11:00 a.m. a mujahedeen hero , jawad , who is a resident of kunduz province , attacked the german soldiers who were patrolling in the area , " zabeeullah mujahed , a taliban spokesman said in a statement posted at their web site .
at the german defense ministry in berlin , officials declined to confirm any death toll , speaking only of " several " soldiers being killed , which was taken as a hint that the german wounded were in critical condition .
debate expected in parliament voicing shock at the attack , german defense minister franz josef jung broke off a private weekend trip and flew back to berlin to respond to the crisis .
the attack was expected to lead to renewed debate in germany about whether german soldiers should be posted to afghanistan .
germany 's green party , which has supported the afghan peace mission , appeared to be foreshadowing that debate saturday , calling for a massive rise in spending on training the afghan military .
the green parliamentary co-leaders said the attack was " intended to stop the establishment of democratic structures . "
german television reported that the soldiers got out of their patrol vehicle to do some shopping .

east germany 's darling car turns 50 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other car in the world is such a powerful symbol of a bygone era looking like a cross between a golf cart and an amusement park bumper car , the trabant - a sluggish two-cylinder vehicle from east germany - was arguably the most venerated object of desire behind the iron curtain . the trabants , or trabis for short , were in production in the german democratic republic without any significant change for more than three decades .
and although the last new trabi hit the roads in 1991 , the vehicle - which turns 50 this year - has gained cult status in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis evoke memories of living in the gdr " i love my car , it 's like a child to me , " said christian marotz , board member of the trabant club berlin , a group that devotes a good deal of time and personal finance investment into all things trabant .
" it symbolizes a simpler life from earlier , in the east … oh , and insurance is cheap too , because they are n't stolen very often ! "
accidentally , a car the first trabi rolled off the factory floor in 1957 .
it was actually never really intended to be a car , but was planned as a three-wheeled motorcycle .
and even though the designers only expected production to last about 10 years , it ended up lasting 34 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last trabant left the assembly line on april 30 , 1991 the name trabant means " fellow traveler , " or satellite , and was inspired by the russian satellite sputnik , which went into space the year went on sale .
television ads by the trabant 's maker , the sachsenring automobile works in east germany , praised the trabi for offering " a lot of room for your luggage " and for being " agile , " " fast , " " long-lasting " and " robust , " but in reality the car left much to be desired .
at the time the trabi was launched , western countries already used cars with cleaner and more efficient engines .
the trabi 's own motor was a two-stroke affair with just two cylinders .
it delivered all of 25 horsepower , and took a full 21 seconds to get from 0 to 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- per hour .
its top speed was all of 112 kilometers per hour .
an entirely different perspective the trabi 's a little thing .
just under 360 cm -lrb- 140 inches -rrb- long , about 150 cm wide and 146 cm tall .
in today 's world of hummers and other suvs , it 's a real shrimp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's a real beauty !
while it had a steel frame , the body was made of something called duroplast - a form of hardened plastic made of cotton waste from russia and resins from the east german dye industry .
" it was the average car people would have in east germany , " said johannes drexler , who is a tour guide for trabi safari , a company in berlin that allows people to see berlin 's sites from the vantage point of this micro car .
" everyone tried to afford a trabant during the east german times .
you had to have yourself put on a list and you had to wait for the car between 11 and 15 years , " drexler said .
the 11 or 15 years was for those lucky enough to be living in berlin , which enjoyed some advantages over other parts of east germany .
those in other places could wait up to 18 years to get their car .
pure luxury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis were never this colorful before the fall of the berlin wall the trabi was probably one of the only cars that was more expensive to buy used than it was new .
a new trabi would set you back between 8,500 and 12,500 east german marks .
for a used car , which you could get much faster , you could pay as much as 4,000 more .
" to have a car in east germany was considered to be pure luxury , " drexler said .
the trabi plant in the city of zwickau churned out around 3.7 million of the cars in 34 years .
some were exported to other communist countries .
today , there are still about 58,000 trabis in use in germany , about 85 percent of them in the former east .
when the berlin wall fell in 1989 , the trabi was still produced for two more years .
but many easterners wanted flashier western cars at the time , so the market dried up .
numerous trabi jokes , however , have survived to this day .
how do you double the value of a trabant ?
fill up its gas tank .
why does the trabi have a heated rear window ?
it keeps your hands warm while you push it .
environmental concerns what finally might spell the end of the trabi - at least on the roads - is not ridicule , or even a lack of replacement parts .
it could be growing concerns about the environment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabi exhaust fumes can even be bought in cans as trabi fragrance trabis are not the " greenest " cars going .
they were n't built with pollution-reducing catalytic converters .
one study found that they spew about nine times as many hydrocarbons and five times as much carbon monoxide as most other cars in western europe .
in several cities in germany , restrictions are being put in place that will prohibit cars from entering city centers if they do n't meet certain environmental standards .
and those standards are getting tougher .
at the moment , the german government makes an exception for trabants to be on the road , because they are n't being made anymore .
but that could end , especially if eu rules begin to supercede german ones .
in the next few months , many vintage car fans will be holding protests to champion their cars as cultural artifacts which should be given a dispensation to stay on the streets and not just be relegated to garages or museums .
" well , you have to stay optimistic in order to get your point across , but in reality , it does n't look so good for us . "
marotz said . kyle james -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one of last remaining chunks of berlin wall disappears berliners woke up over easter weekend to find a giant piece of the berlin wall was missing .

" bremen were unable to maintain their autumn form and schalke lost the last two away games , cracking under pressure just like in 2001 .
that year they lost the title on the last play of the season to bayern munich , but a 1-0 defeat in stuttgart the week before was the crucial setback . as a result , many said that schalke , who once again appear not to be able to shake their reputation as perennial runners-up , now deserved the first national title since 1958 , including german soccer supremo theo zwanziger who said " the time was ripe " for them to succeed . that remark led to the only major outburst of anger from stuttgart this season . " i was very upset when i read the statements from zwanziger that it would be only just if schalke won the title , " veh said .

but opinions are widely divergent as to what representation really means .
dw-world.de offers a brief overview . spain : contract with the state in spain , 2.5 percent of the population is muslim , with the majority coming from north africa .
the spanish government granted islam official legal status back in 1992 in a cooperation agreement between the state and the spanish islamic commission -lrb- cie -rrb- . an estimated 30 percent of spanish muslim communities currently belong to the cie , which is made up of two federations , and as such as has two general secretaries instead of a president .
decisions can only be made when both federations agree .
because secularism is one of the spanish state 's fundamental principles , there is no real legal basis for an agreement of this kind with specific faiths .
the state has , however , also signed a similar agreement with organizations representing both christian confessions and with the jewish community .
islam has , therefore , been placed on an equal legal footing with the other major religions .
austria : criticism from within the ranks islam 's position in austria is very clear cut - islam has been recognized as a religion since 1912 and the islamic faith community in austria -lrb- iggiö -rrb- has enjoyed the status of a public corporation since its foundation in 1979 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconciling the different muslim denominatons under one group is difficult because of this , the austrian model is often held up as an example , but - and this is a large " but " - although the iggiö seeks to represent all muslims , many shiite and alevi muslims living in austria do not feel represented by the iggiö . in 2006 , the alevi submitted an application to the austrian ministry for religious affairs to have alevism recognized as an official religion . criticism has also been voiced by the sunnis , who claim that the iggiö does not represent their interests and allege that its structures are undemocratic .
the iggiö has been widely criticized for the lack of transparency in its membership practices .
only those who pay the annual membership fee are entitled to vote , but the organization does not release information about votes or lists of members . there have also been allegations of fees being returned without reason , and the rejection of membership applications , such as happened to günther ahmed rusznak , secretary general of the islamic information and documentation center and a harsh critic of the iggiö .
moreover , although almost 70 percent of austrian muslims are of turkish extraction , the iggiö leadership is almost exclusively made up of arab muslims .
this means that the iggiö 's status as a state-recognized body is at risk .
french islam by state decree ?
although the french council for the muslim faith -lrb- cfcm -rrb- was founded in 2003 at the instigation of the then interior minister nicolas sarkozy , it is only informally recognized as a representative by the state .
the council 's legal status corresponds to that of a registered charitable association .
some 88 percent of the 4,032 delegates from french mosques voted in council 's first elections .
the number of delegates is based on the size of each mosque ; there are also 25 representatives at regional level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has the biggest muslim population in the european union despite this high level of representation , the cfcm has been continually criticized for failing in its responsibility to represent muslims , particularly given that the french government influences the selection of candidates for all important posts within the organization . after all , sarkozy succeeded in installing his preferred candidate , the imam of paris ' central mosque , dalil boubakeur , as the head of the cfcm .
the french state is patently looking for a proponent of " liberal " islam as their muslim representative - someone who , for instance , would assist with the enforcement of the law banning religious symbols in schools .
this is exactly what upsets french muslims , who do not consider such policies to be in line with their interests .
other critics , however , consider the council to be too radical , as one of its member federations is said to have close links to the egyptian muslim brotherhood .
uk : disagreement on the political angle the muslim council of britain -lrb- mcb -rrb- was founded in the united kingdom in 1997 with the support of the labour government .
it fulfils its responsibility of representing all muslims in so far as it brings together some 3000 organizations from across the spectrum of british islam , and represents an estimated 70 percent of british muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated two million muslims live in great britain the mcb used to have a good relationship with the labour government ; however , since the london bombings , many muslims feel badly treated and misunderstood .
the mcb has to meet the difficult twin objectives of lobbying to enable stricter forms of islam to be practiced on the one hand , and of meeting the british public 's expectation of a firm rejection of terrorism and islamist acts of violence on the other .
the substantial group of sufist barelwi muslims in britain does not believe that the mcb can really represent all muslims because it is dominated by the deobandi , who practice a stricter form of islam and are more politically organized .
the barelwi are represented by the british muslim forum , which does not belong to the muslim council of britain .
although there has been no agreement with the government on muslim affairs in the uk , the construction of muslim primary and secondary schools is funded by the state .

east germany 's darling car turns 50 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other car in the world is such a powerful symbol of a bygone era looking like a cross between a golf cart and an amusement park bumper car , the trabant - a sluggish two-cylinder vehicle from east germany - was arguably the most venerated object of desire behind the iron curtain . the trabants , or trabis for short , were in production in the german democratic republic without any significant change for more than three decades .
and although the last new trabi hit the roads in 1991 , the vehicle - which turns 50 this year - has gained cult status in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis evoke memories of living in the gdr " i love my car , it 's like a child to me , " said christian marotz , board member of the trabant club berlin , a group that devotes a good deal of time and personal finance investment into all things trabant .
" it symbolizes a simpler life from earlier , in the east … oh , and insurance is cheap too , because they are n't stolen very often ! "
accidentally , a car the first trabi rolled off the factory floor in 1957 .
it was actually never really intended to be a car , but was planned as a three-wheeled motorcycle .
and even though the designers only expected production to last about 10 years , it ended up lasting 34 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last trabant left the assembly line on april 30 , 1991 the name trabant means " fellow traveler , " or satellite , and was inspired by the russian satellite sputnik , which went into space the year went on sale .
television ads by the trabant 's maker , the sachsenring automobile works in east germany , praised the trabi for offering " a lot of room for your luggage " and for being " agile , " " fast , " " long-lasting " and " robust , " but in reality the car left much to be desired .
at the time the trabi was launched , western countries already used cars with cleaner and more efficient engines .
the trabi 's own motor was a two-stroke affair with just two cylinders .
it delivered all of 25 horsepower , and took a full 21 seconds to get from 0 to 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- per hour .
its top speed was all of 112 kilometers per hour .
an entirely different perspective the trabi 's a little thing .
just under 360 cm -lrb- 140 inches -rrb- long , about 150 cm wide and 146 cm tall .
in today 's world of hummers and other suvs , it 's a real shrimp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's a real beauty !
while it had a steel frame , the body was made of something called duroplast - a form of hardened plastic made of cotton waste from russia and resins from the east german dye industry .
" it was the average car people would have in east germany , " said johannes drexler , who is a tour guide for trabi safari , a company in berlin that allows people to see berlin 's sites from the vantage point of this micro car .
" everyone tried to afford a trabant during the east german times .
you had to have yourself put on a list and you had to wait for the car between 11 and 15 years , " drexler said .
the 11 or 15 years was for those lucky enough to be living in berlin , which enjoyed some advantages over other parts of east germany .
those in other places could wait up to 18 years to get their car .
pure luxury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis were never this colorful before the fall of the berlin wall the trabi was probably one of the only cars that was more expensive to buy used than it was new .
a new trabi would set you back between 8,500 and 12,500 east german marks .
for a used car , which you could get much faster , you could pay as much as 4,000 more .
" to have a car in east germany was considered to be pure luxury , " drexler said .
the trabi plant in the city of zwickau churned out around 3.7 million of the cars in 34 years .
some were exported to other communist countries .
today , there are still about 58,000 trabis in use in germany , about 85 percent of them in the former east .
when the berlin wall fell in 1989 , the trabi was still produced for two more years .
but many easterners wanted flashier western cars at the time , so the market dried up .
numerous trabi jokes , however , have survived to this day .
how do you double the value of a trabant ?
fill up its gas tank .
why does the trabi have a heated rear window ?
it keeps your hands warm while you push it .
environmental concerns what finally might spell the end of the trabi - at least on the roads - is not ridicule , or even a lack of replacement parts .
it could be growing concerns about the environment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabi exhaust fumes can even be bought in cans as trabi fragrance trabis are not the " greenest " cars going .
they were n't built with pollution-reducing catalytic converters .
one study found that they spew about nine times as many hydrocarbons and five times as much carbon monoxide as most other cars in western europe .
in several cities in germany , restrictions are being put in place that will prohibit cars from entering city centers if they do n't meet certain environmental standards .
and those standards are getting tougher .
at the moment , the german government makes an exception for trabants to be on the road , because they are n't being made anymore .
but that could end , especially if eu rules begin to supercede german ones .
in the next few months , many vintage car fans will be holding protests to champion their cars as cultural artifacts which should be given a dispensation to stay on the streets and not just be relegated to garages or museums .
" well , you have to stay optimistic in order to get your point across , but in reality , it does n't look so good for us . "
marotz said . kyle james -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one of last remaining chunks of berlin wall disappears berliners woke up over easter weekend to find a giant piece of the berlin wall was missing .

on may 26 , they meet nuremberg in the german cup final in what could result in the first double in club history . confronted with expensive players who performed below par , cash-strapped stuttgart took the daring move last summer of making a total overhaul instead of getting only new players for certain positions . jon dahl tomasson , jesper gronkjaer , christian tiffert , andreas hinkel , zvonimir soldo , danijel ljuboja were retired or had to leave as new sports director horst heldt and coach armin -lrb- following matthias sammer and giovanni trapattoni -rrb- made sweeping changes . " the former team put together without love was made up of sammer-players who trapattoni did n't want and of trapattoni-players who veh did n't want , " the daily süddeutsche zeitung wrote before going on to call the changes the biggest in league history . an overhaul " without mercy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart needed to wipe away the remains of too many coaches but the changes were necessary for the team to have any success , according to heldt . " you could n't continue with the old squad , " he said .
" we had to risk the overhaul because the former team was driving the people out of the stadium .
we did the overhaul without mercy . " the result was stunning . an old guard of fernando meira , ludovic magnin , brazilian forward cacau , goalkeeper timo hildebrand and midfielder thomas hitzlsperger was joined by newcomers like mario gomez , serdar tasci , roberto hilbert and antonio da silva , who all made a big impact . heldt said stuttgart carefully chose the new players but admitted that " you could n't expect that it would work so well .

because secularism is one of the spanish state 's fundamental principles , there is no real legal basis for an agreement of this kind with specific faiths .
the state has , however , also signed a similar agreement with organizations representing both christian confessions and with the jewish community .
islam has , therefore , been placed on an equal legal footing with the other major religions .
austria : criticism from within the ranks islam 's position in austria is very clear cut - islam has been recognized as a religion since 1912 and the islamic faith community in austria -lrb- iggiö -rrb- has enjoyed the status of a public corporation since its foundation in 1979 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconciling the different muslim denominatons under one group is difficult because of this , the austrian model is often held up as an example , but - and this is a large " but " - although the iggiö seeks to represent all muslims , many shiite and alevi muslims living in austria do not feel represented by the iggiö . in 2006 , the alevi submitted an application to the austrian ministry for religious affairs to have alevism recognized as an official religion . criticism has also been voiced by the sunnis , who claim that the iggiö does not represent their interests and allege that its structures are undemocratic .
the iggiö has been widely criticized for the lack of transparency in its membership practices .
only those who pay the annual membership fee are entitled to vote , but the organization does not release information about votes or lists of members . there have also been allegations of fees being returned without reason , and the rejection of membership applications , such as happened to günther ahmed rusznak , secretary general of the islamic information and documentation center and a harsh critic of the iggiö .
moreover , although almost 70 percent of austrian muslims are of turkish extraction , the iggiö leadership is almost exclusively made up of arab muslims .
this means that the iggiö 's status as a state-recognized body is at risk .
french islam by state decree ?
although the french council for the muslim faith -lrb- cfcm -rrb- was founded in 2003 at the instigation of the then interior minister nicolas sarkozy , it is only informally recognized as a representative by the state .
the council 's legal status corresponds to that of a registered charitable association .
some 88 percent of the 4,032 delegates from french mosques voted in council 's first elections .
the number of delegates is based on the size of each mosque ; there are also 25 representatives at regional level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has the biggest muslim population in the european union despite this high level of representation , the cfcm has been continually criticized for failing in its responsibility to represent muslims , particularly given that the french government influences the selection of candidates for all important posts within the organization . after all , sarkozy succeeded in installing his preferred candidate , the imam of paris ' central mosque , dalil boubakeur , as the head of the cfcm .
the french state is patently looking for a proponent of " liberal " islam as their muslim representative - someone who , for instance , would assist with the enforcement of the law banning religious symbols in schools .
this is exactly what upsets french muslims , who do not consider such policies to be in line with their interests .
other critics , however , consider the council to be too radical , as one of its member federations is said to have close links to the egyptian muslim brotherhood .
uk : disagreement on the political angle the muslim council of britain -lrb- mcb -rrb- was founded in the united kingdom in 1997 with the support of the labour government .
it fulfils its responsibility of representing all muslims in so far as it brings together some 3000 organizations from across the spectrum of british islam , and represents an estimated 70 percent of british muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated two million muslims live in great britain the mcb used to have a good relationship with the labour government ; however , since the london bombings , many muslims feel badly treated and misunderstood .
the mcb has to meet the difficult twin objectives of lobbying to enable stricter forms of islam to be practiced on the one hand , and of meeting the british public 's expectation of a firm rejection of terrorism and islamist acts of violence on the other .
the substantial group of sufist barelwi muslims in britain does not believe that the mcb can really represent all muslims because it is dominated by the deobandi , who practice a stricter form of islam and are more politically organized .
the barelwi are represented by the british muslim forum , which does not belong to the muslim council of britain .
although there has been no agreement with the government on muslim affairs in the uk , the construction of muslim primary and secondary schools is funded by the state .

but opinions are widely divergent as to what representation really means .
dw-world.de offers a brief overview . spain : contract with the state in spain , 2.5 percent of the population is muslim , with the majority coming from north africa .
the spanish government granted islam official legal status back in 1992 in a cooperation agreement between the state and the spanish islamic commission -lrb- cie -rrb- . an estimated 30 percent of spanish muslim communities currently belong to the cie , which is made up of two federations , and as such as has two general secretaries instead of a president .
decisions can only be made when both federations agree .
because secularism is one of the spanish state 's fundamental principles , there is no real legal basis for an agreement of this kind with specific faiths .
the state has , however , also signed a similar agreement with organizations representing both christian confessions and with the jewish community .
islam has , therefore , been placed on an equal legal footing with the other major religions .
austria : criticism from within the ranks islam 's position in austria is very clear cut - islam has been recognized as a religion since 1912 and the islamic faith community in austria -lrb- iggiö -rrb- has enjoyed the status of a public corporation since its foundation in 1979 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconciling the different muslim denominatons under one group is difficult because of this , the austrian model is often held up as an example , but - and this is a large " but " - although the iggiö seeks to represent all muslims , many shiite and alevi muslims living in austria do not feel represented by the iggiö . in 2006 , the alevi submitted an application to the austrian ministry for religious affairs to have alevism recognized as an official religion . criticism has also been voiced by the sunnis , who claim that the iggiö does not represent their interests and allege that its structures are undemocratic .
the iggiö has been widely criticized for the lack of transparency in its membership practices .
only those who pay the annual membership fee are entitled to vote , but the organization does not release information about votes or lists of members . there have also been allegations of fees being returned without reason , and the rejection of membership applications , such as happened to günther ahmed rusznak , secretary general of the islamic information and documentation center and a harsh critic of the iggiö .
moreover , although almost 70 percent of austrian muslims are of turkish extraction , the iggiö leadership is almost exclusively made up of arab muslims .
this means that the iggiö 's status as a state-recognized body is at risk .
french islam by state decree ?
although the french council for the muslim faith -lrb- cfcm -rrb- was founded in 2003 at the instigation of the then interior minister nicolas sarkozy , it is only informally recognized as a representative by the state .
the council 's legal status corresponds to that of a registered charitable association .
some 88 percent of the 4,032 delegates from french mosques voted in council 's first elections .
the number of delegates is based on the size of each mosque ; there are also 25 representatives at regional level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has the biggest muslim population in the european union despite this high level of representation , the cfcm has been continually criticized for failing in its responsibility to represent muslims , particularly given that the french government influences the selection of candidates for all important posts within the organization . after all , sarkozy succeeded in installing his preferred candidate , the imam of paris ' central mosque , dalil boubakeur , as the head of the cfcm .
the french state is patently looking for a proponent of " liberal " islam as their muslim representative - someone who , for instance , would assist with the enforcement of the law banning religious symbols in schools .
this is exactly what upsets french muslims , who do not consider such policies to be in line with their interests .
other critics , however , consider the council to be too radical , as one of its member federations is said to have close links to the egyptian muslim brotherhood .
uk : disagreement on the political angle the muslim council of britain -lrb- mcb -rrb- was founded in the united kingdom in 1997 with the support of the labour government .
it fulfils its responsibility of representing all muslims in so far as it brings together some 3000 organizations from across the spectrum of british islam , and represents an estimated 70 percent of british muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated two million muslims live in great britain the mcb used to have a good relationship with the labour government ; however , since the london bombings , many muslims feel badly treated and misunderstood .
the mcb has to meet the difficult twin objectives of lobbying to enable stricter forms of islam to be practiced on the one hand , and of meeting the british public 's expectation of a firm rejection of terrorism and islamist acts of violence on the other .
the substantial group of sufist barelwi muslims in britain does not believe that the mcb can really represent all muslims because it is dominated by the deobandi , who practice a stricter form of islam and are more politically organized .
the barelwi are represented by the british muslim forum , which does not belong to the muslim council of britain .
although there has been no agreement with the government on muslim affairs in the uk , the construction of muslim primary and secondary schools is funded by the state .

" i heard of this underhanded attack with great shock , " merkel said in a statement released in berlin .
" this perfidious murder fills all of us with disgust . "
she said the bombing was aimed at preventing the process of reconstruction in afghanistan from becoming a success , " but added that the international community was resolved to continue helping afghans create a better future for themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the bombing would n't deter the international community three german soldiers were killed and three wounded while six afghan civilians were killed and 14 others wounded when a suicide attacker detonated his explosive-laden vest in northern afghanistan , officials said .
provincial governor mohammad omar told german news agency dpa that three german soldiers were killed and two soldiers and an interpreter were wounded when the bomber struck in chaiferoshi market in kunduz on saturday morning .
six afghan shopkeepers and civilian passers-by were killed and another 14 were wounded , omar said .
" we received intelligence information a couple of days ago that four would-be suicide bombers entered the city and would use motorcycles to carry out their attacks , " omar said , adding that the police started searching motorbikes on thursday .
he said that the security forces would intensify their search to track down the remaining bombers .
general noor mohammad omarkhail , provincial security chief of the kunduz police , described the condition of seven of the wounded afghans as critical .
taliban claims responsibility a spokesperson for the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul confirmed the incident in a statement , but said that three isaf soldiers and five afghans were killed and 10 , including two isaf soldiers , were wounded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 3,000 german troops are stationed in afghanistan " this senseless act of violence shows the barbarity of extremists and criminals targeting civilians and isaf troops who are working to rebuild afghanistan , " lieutenant colonel angela billings , an isaf spokeswoman was quoted in the statement as saying .
taliban militants took responsibility for the attack and said 11 german soldiers were killed in the suicide blast that destroyed the windows of the shops as far as one kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- .
" today at 11:00 a.m. a mujahedeen hero , jawad , who is a resident of kunduz province , attacked the german soldiers who were patrolling in the area , " zabeeullah mujahed , a taliban spokesman said in a statement posted at their web site .
at the german defense ministry in berlin , officials declined to confirm any death toll , speaking only of " several " soldiers being killed , which was taken as a hint that the german wounded were in critical condition .
debate expected in parliament voicing shock at the attack , german defense minister franz josef jung broke off a private weekend trip and flew back to berlin to respond to the crisis .
the attack was expected to lead to renewed debate in germany about whether german soldiers should be posted to afghanistan .
germany 's green party , which has supported the afghan peace mission , appeared to be foreshadowing that debate saturday , calling for a massive rise in spending on training the afghan military .
the green parliamentary co-leaders said the attack was " intended to stop the establishment of democratic structures . "
german television reported that the soldiers got out of their patrol vehicle to do some shopping .

the german soldiers were hit while shopping in a market in the town of kunduz , the provincial governor told afp .
" three of our german friends were killed and two were wounded .
one afghan interpreter was also wounded , " kunduz governor mohammad omar said .
six afghans were killed and 12 others wounded , six of them critically , he said .
all that was left of the bomber was two legs , omar said .
worst attack in years for germans the attack was the most deadly against the german troops since 2003 , when four were killed in a suicide car bombing in kabul .
nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- media office in the capital kabul confirmed there had been an explosion but said it had no details .
the german military based in the main northern city of mazar-i-sharif said it could not yet release any information .
germany has around 3,000 troops in afghanistan , operating largely in the north of the country .
twenty-one german soldiers have lost their lives in afghanistan since 2002 , including the ones killed on saturday .
around 60 foreign soldiers involved in the international mission to afghanistan have died this year , most of them in attacks or combat inside the country .
coalition claims to have killed dozens in another attack on saturday , a district police chief and one of his bodyguards were killed in a remote controlled bomb explosion in the eastern province of nangarhar , a district chief said .
an afghan general reported saturday meanwhile that soldiers from the army and the coalition led by the united states had killed 67 taliban in an ambush in the eastern province of paktia , near the border with pakistan .
" their bodies were lying on the ground , " general sami-ul haq badar told afp .
the soldiers had been tipped off that there were taliban in the area , he said .
the coalition announced separately that an estimated " several dozen enemy fighters " were killed in battles around midnight friday about 60 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- from kabul in kapisa province .
the death tolls issued by the military are impossible to verify independently .
the taliban , a movement rooted in an ultraconservative interpretation of islam , was removed from government nearly six years ago by the coalition .
thousands of foreign troops arrived soon afterwards to help stabilize the fragile and fractured country but they have been unable to tame the insurgents , who are supported by the al-qaeda movement .
taliban threatened revenge in the biggest success against the taliban , the group 's famously brutal top military commander mullah dadullah was killed a week ago in the southern province of helmand after being tracked from the border with pakistan .
the group threatened this week a wave of violence , including suicide bombings , roadside blasts and attacks to avenge his killing .
they said a suicide car bomb aimed at the governor of the southern province of kandahar on thursday was part of this campaign .
the governor was not in the targeted motorcade but the information and culture minister abdul karim khoram was wounded . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany criticizes us over afghan civilian deaths german defense minister franz josef jung has called for a rethink of us military tactics in afghanistan after us coalition operations caused a spate of civilian casualties .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 19.05.2007 european organizations hard-pressed to represent all muslims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are part of europe but are n't necessarily represented as such several european states have islamic associations that intend to represent all muslims in that country .
but opinions are widely divergent as to what representation really means .
dw-world.de offers a brief overview . spain : contract with the state in spain , 2.5 percent of the population is muslim , with the majority coming from north africa .
the spanish government granted islam official legal status back in 1992 in a cooperation agreement between the state and the spanish islamic commission -lrb- cie -rrb- . an estimated 30 percent of spanish muslim communities currently belong to the cie , which is made up of two federations , and as such as has two general secretaries instead of a president .
decisions can only be made when both federations agree .
because secularism is one of the spanish state 's fundamental principles , there is no real legal basis for an agreement of this kind with specific faiths .
the state has , however , also signed a similar agreement with organizations representing both christian confessions and with the jewish community .
islam has , therefore , been placed on an equal legal footing with the other major religions .
austria : criticism from within the ranks islam 's position in austria is very clear cut - islam has been recognized as a religion since 1912 and the islamic faith community in austria -lrb- iggiö -rrb- has enjoyed the status of a public corporation since its foundation in 1979 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconciling the different muslim denominatons under one group is difficult because of this , the austrian model is often held up as an example , but - and this is a large " but " - although the iggiö seeks to represent all muslims , many shiite and alevi muslims living in austria do not feel represented by the iggiö . in 2006 , the alevi submitted an application to the austrian ministry for religious affairs to have alevism recognized as an official religion . criticism has also been voiced by the sunnis , who claim that the iggiö does not represent their interests and allege that its structures are undemocratic .
the iggiö has been widely criticized for the lack of transparency in its membership practices .
only those who pay the annual membership fee are entitled to vote , but the organization does not release information about votes or lists of members . there have also been allegations of fees being returned without reason , and the rejection of membership applications , such as happened to günther ahmed rusznak , secretary general of the islamic information and documentation center and a harsh critic of the iggiö .
moreover , although almost 70 percent of austrian muslims are of turkish extraction , the iggiö leadership is almost exclusively made up of arab muslims .
this means that the iggiö 's status as a state-recognized body is at risk .
french islam by state decree ?
although the french council for the muslim faith -lrb- cfcm -rrb- was founded in 2003 at the instigation of the then interior minister nicolas sarkozy , it is only informally recognized as a representative by the state .
the council 's legal status corresponds to that of a registered charitable association .
some 88 percent of the 4,032 delegates from french mosques voted in council 's first elections .
the number of delegates is based on the size of each mosque ; there are also 25 representatives at regional level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has the biggest muslim population in the european union despite this high level of representation , the cfcm has been continually criticized for failing in its responsibility to represent muslims , particularly given that the french government influences the selection of candidates for all important posts within the organization . after all , sarkozy succeeded in installing his preferred candidate , the imam of paris ' central mosque , dalil boubakeur , as the head of the cfcm .
the french state is patently looking for a proponent of " liberal " islam as their muslim representative - someone who , for instance , would assist with the enforcement of the law banning religious symbols in schools .
this is exactly what upsets french muslims , who do not consider such policies to be in line with their interests .
other critics , however , consider the council to be too radical , as one of its member federations is said to have close links to the egyptian muslim brotherhood .
uk : disagreement on the political angle the muslim council of britain -lrb- mcb -rrb- was founded in the united kingdom in 1997 with the support of the labour government .
it fulfils its responsibility of representing all muslims in so far as it brings together some 3000 organizations from across the spectrum of british islam , and represents an estimated 70 percent of british muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated two million muslims live in great britain the mcb used to have a good relationship with the labour government ; however , since the london bombings , many muslims feel badly treated and misunderstood .
the mcb has to meet the difficult twin objectives of lobbying to enable stricter forms of islam to be practiced on the one hand , and of meeting the british public 's expectation of a firm rejection of terrorism and islamist acts of violence on the other .
the substantial group of sufist barelwi muslims in britain does not believe that the mcb can really represent all muslims because it is dominated by the deobandi , who practice a stricter form of islam and are more politically organized .
the barelwi are represented by the british muslim forum , which does not belong to the muslim council of britain .
although there has been no agreement with the government on muslim affairs in the uk , the construction of muslim primary and secondary schools is funded by the state .

on may 26 , they meet nuremberg in the german cup final in what could result in the first double in club history . confronted with expensive players who performed below par , cash-strapped stuttgart took the daring move last summer of making a total overhaul instead of getting only new players for certain positions . jon dahl tomasson , jesper gronkjaer , christian tiffert , andreas hinkel , zvonimir soldo , danijel ljuboja were retired or had to leave as new sports director horst heldt and coach armin -lrb- following matthias sammer and giovanni trapattoni -rrb- made sweeping changes . " the former team put together without love was made up of sammer-players who trapattoni did n't want and of trapattoni-players who veh did n't want , " the daily süddeutsche zeitung wrote before going on to call the changes the biggest in league history . an overhaul " without mercy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart needed to wipe away the remains of too many coaches but the changes were necessary for the team to have any success , according to heldt . " you could n't continue with the old squad , " he said .
" we had to risk the overhaul because the former team was driving the people out of the stadium .
we did the overhaul without mercy . " the result was stunning . an old guard of fernando meira , ludovic magnin , brazilian forward cacau , goalkeeper timo hildebrand and midfielder thomas hitzlsperger was joined by newcomers like mario gomez , serdar tasci , roberto hilbert and antonio da silva , who all made a big impact . heldt said stuttgart carefully chose the new players but admitted that " you could n't expect that it would work so well . " reliable weekly performances bildunterschrift : though not the showiest bundesliga side , stuttgart played consistently well all season stuttgart , who only claimed the bundesliga 's top spot once before the season 's final two weeks , were long vying for third place , but more became possible because they did n't have a slump like the title rivals schalke or werder bremen . it did n't even matter that gomez was sidelined for two months after scoring 14 goals until then .
he only returned saturday to score the important 2-2 equalizer in bochum . " we showed all season that we are a team , " said saturday 's match-winner cacau said . stuttgart became invincible on the home stretch , winning the last seven games after an unlucky 1-0 defeat at schalke in mid-march . many experts predicted over the past two weeks that stuttgart were the team to look out for in the title race because they had nothing to lose . who " deserves " to win ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saves from goalkeeper timo hildebrand kept stuttgart in several matches " stuttgart played a sensational season , " said bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld in admiration of the team where he formerly played . former germany player paul breitner said on sunday in the bild am sonntag newspaper that " stuttgart deserves the title . " bremen were unable to maintain their autumn form and schalke lost the last two away games , cracking under pressure just like in 2001 .
that year they lost the title on the last play of the season to bayern munich , but a 1-0 defeat in stuttgart the week before was the crucial setback . as a result , many said that schalke , who once again appear not to be able to shake their reputation as perennial runners-up , now deserved the first national title since 1958 , including german soccer supremo theo zwanziger who said " the time was ripe " for them to succeed . that remark led to the only major outburst of anger from stuttgart this season . " i was very upset when i read the statements from zwanziger that it would be only just if schalke won the title , " veh said .
" what is supposed to be just about that ? " now veh - and his players - will likely take even more pride when they are expected to receive the trophy for their fifth german title overall and first since 1992 on saturday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stuttgart steal pole position as schalke lose stuttgart climbed to the top of the bundesliga on saturday , with just one week left to the season , as their dramatic 3-2 win at vfl bochum knocked schalke 04 off first place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 19.05.2007 european organizations hard-pressed to represent all muslims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are part of europe but are n't necessarily represented as such several european states have islamic associations that intend to represent all muslims in that country .
but opinions are widely divergent as to what representation really means .
dw-world.de offers a brief overview . spain : contract with the state in spain , 2.5 percent of the population is muslim , with the majority coming from north africa .
the spanish government granted islam official legal status back in 1992 in a cooperation agreement between the state and the spanish islamic commission -lrb- cie -rrb- . an estimated 30 percent of spanish muslim communities currently belong to the cie , which is made up of two federations , and as such as has two general secretaries instead of a president .
decisions can only be made when both federations agree .
because secularism is one of the spanish state 's fundamental principles , there is no real legal basis for an agreement of this kind with specific faiths .
the state has , however , also signed a similar agreement with organizations representing both christian confessions and with the jewish community .
islam has , therefore , been placed on an equal legal footing with the other major religions .
austria : criticism from within the ranks islam 's position in austria is very clear cut - islam has been recognized as a religion since 1912 and the islamic faith community in austria -lrb- iggiö -rrb- has enjoyed the status of a public corporation since its foundation in 1979 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconciling the different muslim denominatons under one group is difficult because of this , the austrian model is often held up as an example , but - and this is a large " but " - although the iggiö seeks to represent all muslims , many shiite and alevi muslims living in austria do not feel represented by the iggiö . in 2006 , the alevi submitted an application to the austrian ministry for religious affairs to have alevism recognized as an official religion . criticism has also been voiced by the sunnis , who claim that the iggiö does not represent their interests and allege that its structures are undemocratic .
the iggiö has been widely criticized for the lack of transparency in its membership practices .
only those who pay the annual membership fee are entitled to vote , but the organization does not release information about votes or lists of members . there have also been allegations of fees being returned without reason , and the rejection of membership applications , such as happened to günther ahmed rusznak , secretary general of the islamic information and documentation center and a harsh critic of the iggiö .
moreover , although almost 70 percent of austrian muslims are of turkish extraction , the iggiö leadership is almost exclusively made up of arab muslims .
this means that the iggiö 's status as a state-recognized body is at risk .
french islam by state decree ?
although the french council for the muslim faith -lrb- cfcm -rrb- was founded in 2003 at the instigation of the then interior minister nicolas sarkozy , it is only informally recognized as a representative by the state .
the council 's legal status corresponds to that of a registered charitable association .
some 88 percent of the 4,032 delegates from french mosques voted in council 's first elections .
the number of delegates is based on the size of each mosque ; there are also 25 representatives at regional level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has the biggest muslim population in the european union despite this high level of representation , the cfcm has been continually criticized for failing in its responsibility to represent muslims , particularly given that the french government influences the selection of candidates for all important posts within the organization . after all , sarkozy succeeded in installing his preferred candidate , the imam of paris ' central mosque , dalil boubakeur , as the head of the cfcm .
the french state is patently looking for a proponent of " liberal " islam as their muslim representative - someone who , for instance , would assist with the enforcement of the law banning religious symbols in schools .
this is exactly what upsets french muslims , who do not consider such policies to be in line with their interests .
other critics , however , consider the council to be too radical , as one of its member federations is said to have close links to the egyptian muslim brotherhood .
uk : disagreement on the political angle the muslim council of britain -lrb- mcb -rrb- was founded in the united kingdom in 1997 with the support of the labour government .
it fulfils its responsibility of representing all muslims in so far as it brings together some 3000 organizations from across the spectrum of british islam , and represents an estimated 70 percent of british muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated two million muslims live in great britain the mcb used to have a good relationship with the labour government ; however , since the london bombings , many muslims feel badly treated and misunderstood .
the mcb has to meet the difficult twin objectives of lobbying to enable stricter forms of islam to be practiced on the one hand , and of meeting the british public 's expectation of a firm rejection of terrorism and islamist acts of violence on the other .
the substantial group of sufist barelwi muslims in britain does not believe that the mcb can really represent all muslims because it is dominated by the deobandi , who practice a stricter form of islam and are more politically organized .
the barelwi are represented by the british muslim forum , which does not belong to the muslim council of britain .
although there has been no agreement with the government on muslim affairs in the uk , the construction of muslim primary and secondary schools is funded by the state .

the german soldiers were hit while shopping in a market in the town of kunduz , the provincial governor told afp .
" three of our german friends were killed and two were wounded .
one afghan interpreter was also wounded , " kunduz governor mohammad omar said .
six afghans were killed and 12 others wounded , six of them critically , he said .
all that was left of the bomber was two legs , omar said .
worst attack in years for germans the attack was the most deadly against the german troops since 2003 , when four were killed in a suicide car bombing in kabul .
nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- media office in the capital kabul confirmed there had been an explosion but said it had no details .
the german military based in the main northern city of mazar-i-sharif said it could not yet release any information .
germany has around 3,000 troops in afghanistan , operating largely in the north of the country .
twenty-one german soldiers have lost their lives in afghanistan since 2002 , including the ones killed on saturday .
around 60 foreign soldiers involved in the international mission to afghanistan have died this year , most of them in attacks or combat inside the country .

the coalition announced separately that an estimated " several dozen enemy fighters " were killed in battles around midnight friday about 60 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- from kabul in kapisa province .
the death tolls issued by the military are impossible to verify independently .
the taliban , a movement rooted in an ultraconservative interpretation of islam , was removed from government nearly six years ago by the coalition .
thousands of foreign troops arrived soon afterwards to help stabilize the fragile and fractured country but they have been unable to tame the insurgents , who are supported by the al-qaeda movement .
taliban threatened revenge in the biggest success against the taliban , the group 's famously brutal top military commander mullah dadullah was killed a week ago in the southern province of helmand after being tracked from the border with pakistan .

the german soldiers were hit while shopping in a market in the town of kunduz , the provincial governor told afp .
" three of our german friends were killed and two were wounded .
one afghan interpreter was also wounded , " kunduz governor mohammad omar said .
six afghans were killed and 12 others wounded , six of them critically , he said .
all that was left of the bomber was two legs , omar said .
worst attack in years for germans the attack was the most deadly against the german troops since 2003 , when four were killed in a suicide car bombing in kabul .
nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- media office in the capital kabul confirmed there had been an explosion but said it had no details .
the german military based in the main northern city of mazar-i-sharif said it could not yet release any information .
germany has around 3,000 troops in afghanistan , operating largely in the north of the country .
twenty-one german soldiers have lost their lives in afghanistan since 2002 , including the ones killed on saturday .
around 60 foreign soldiers involved in the international mission to afghanistan have died this year , most of them in attacks or combat inside the country .
coalition claims to have killed dozens in another attack on saturday , a district police chief and one of his bodyguards were killed in a remote controlled bomb explosion in the eastern province of nangarhar , a district chief said .
an afghan general reported saturday meanwhile that soldiers from the army and the coalition led by the united states had killed 67 taliban in an ambush in the eastern province of paktia , near the border with pakistan .
" their bodies were lying on the ground , " general sami-ul haq badar told afp .
the soldiers had been tipped off that there were taliban in the area , he said .
the coalition announced separately that an estimated " several dozen enemy fighters " were killed in battles around midnight friday about 60 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- from kabul in kapisa province .
the death tolls issued by the military are impossible to verify independently .
the taliban , a movement rooted in an ultraconservative interpretation of islam , was removed from government nearly six years ago by the coalition .
thousands of foreign troops arrived soon afterwards to help stabilize the fragile and fractured country but they have been unable to tame the insurgents , who are supported by the al-qaeda movement .

east germany 's darling car turns 50 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other car in the world is such a powerful symbol of a bygone era looking like a cross between a golf cart and an amusement park bumper car , the trabant - a sluggish two-cylinder vehicle from east germany - was arguably the most venerated object of desire behind the iron curtain . the trabants , or trabis for short , were in production in the german democratic republic without any significant change for more than three decades .
and although the last new trabi hit the roads in 1991 , the vehicle - which turns 50 this year - has gained cult status in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis evoke memories of living in the gdr " i love my car , it 's like a child to me , " said christian marotz , board member of the trabant club berlin , a group that devotes a good deal of time and personal finance investment into all things trabant .
" it symbolizes a simpler life from earlier , in the east … oh , and insurance is cheap too , because they are n't stolen very often ! "
accidentally , a car the first trabi rolled off the factory floor in 1957 .
it was actually never really intended to be a car , but was planned as a three-wheeled motorcycle .
and even though the designers only expected production to last about 10 years , it ended up lasting 34 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last trabant left the assembly line on april 30 , 1991 the name trabant means " fellow traveler , " or satellite , and was inspired by the russian satellite sputnik , which went into space the year went on sale .
television ads by the trabant 's maker , the sachsenring automobile works in east germany , praised the trabi for offering " a lot of room for your luggage " and for being " agile , " " fast , " " long-lasting " and " robust , " but in reality the car left much to be desired .
at the time the trabi was launched , western countries already used cars with cleaner and more efficient engines .
the trabi 's own motor was a two-stroke affair with just two cylinders .
it delivered all of 25 horsepower , and took a full 21 seconds to get from 0 to 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- per hour .
its top speed was all of 112 kilometers per hour .
an entirely different perspective the trabi 's a little thing .
just under 360 cm -lrb- 140 inches -rrb- long , about 150 cm wide and 146 cm tall .
in today 's world of hummers and other suvs , it 's a real shrimp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's a real beauty !
while it had a steel frame , the body was made of something called duroplast - a form of hardened plastic made of cotton waste from russia and resins from the east german dye industry .
" it was the average car people would have in east germany , " said johannes drexler , who is a tour guide for trabi safari , a company in berlin that allows people to see berlin 's sites from the vantage point of this micro car .
" everyone tried to afford a trabant during the east german times .
you had to have yourself put on a list and you had to wait for the car between 11 and 15 years , " drexler said .
the 11 or 15 years was for those lucky enough to be living in berlin , which enjoyed some advantages over other parts of east germany .
those in other places could wait up to 18 years to get their car .
pure luxury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis were never this colorful before the fall of the berlin wall the trabi was probably one of the only cars that was more expensive to buy used than it was new .
a new trabi would set you back between 8,500 and 12,500 east german marks .
for a used car , which you could get much faster , you could pay as much as 4,000 more .
" to have a car in east germany was considered to be pure luxury , " drexler said .
the trabi plant in the city of zwickau churned out around 3.7 million of the cars in 34 years .
some were exported to other communist countries .
today , there are still about 58,000 trabis in use in germany , about 85 percent of them in the former east .
when the berlin wall fell in 1989 , the trabi was still produced for two more years .
but many easterners wanted flashier western cars at the time , so the market dried up .
numerous trabi jokes , however , have survived to this day .
how do you double the value of a trabant ?
fill up its gas tank .
why does the trabi have a heated rear window ?
it keeps your hands warm while you push it .
environmental concerns what finally might spell the end of the trabi - at least on the roads - is not ridicule , or even a lack of replacement parts .
it could be growing concerns about the environment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabi exhaust fumes can even be bought in cans as trabi fragrance trabis are not the " greenest " cars going .
they were n't built with pollution-reducing catalytic converters .
one study found that they spew about nine times as many hydrocarbons and five times as much carbon monoxide as most other cars in western europe .
in several cities in germany , restrictions are being put in place that will prohibit cars from entering city centers if they do n't meet certain environmental standards .
and those standards are getting tougher .
at the moment , the german government makes an exception for trabants to be on the road , because they are n't being made anymore .
but that could end , especially if eu rules begin to supercede german ones .
in the next few months , many vintage car fans will be holding protests to champion their cars as cultural artifacts which should be given a dispensation to stay on the streets and not just be relegated to garages or museums .
" well , you have to stay optimistic in order to get your point across , but in reality , it does n't look so good for us . "

you had to have yourself put on a list and you had to wait for the car between 11 and 15 years , " drexler said .
the 11 or 15 years was for those lucky enough to be living in berlin , which enjoyed some advantages over other parts of east germany .
those in other places could wait up to 18 years to get their car .
pure luxury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis were never this colorful before the fall of the berlin wall the trabi was probably one of the only cars that was more expensive to buy used than it was new .
a new trabi would set you back between 8,500 and 12,500 east german marks .
for a used car , which you could get much faster , you could pay as much as 4,000 more .
" to have a car in east germany was considered to be pure luxury , " drexler said .
the trabi plant in the city of zwickau churned out around 3.7 million of the cars in 34 years .
some were exported to other communist countries .
today , there are still about 58,000 trabis in use in germany , about 85 percent of them in the former east .
when the berlin wall fell in 1989 , the trabi was still produced for two more years .
but many easterners wanted flashier western cars at the time , so the market dried up .
numerous trabi jokes , however , have survived to this day .
how do you double the value of a trabant ?
fill up its gas tank .
why does the trabi have a heated rear window ?
it keeps your hands warm while you push it .
environmental concerns what finally might spell the end of the trabi - at least on the roads - is not ridicule , or even a lack of replacement parts .
it could be growing concerns about the environment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabi exhaust fumes can even be bought in cans as trabi fragrance trabis are not the " greenest " cars going .
they were n't built with pollution-reducing catalytic converters .
one study found that they spew about nine times as many hydrocarbons and five times as much carbon monoxide as most other cars in western europe .
in several cities in germany , restrictions are being put in place that will prohibit cars from entering city centers if they do n't meet certain environmental standards .
and those standards are getting tougher .
at the moment , the german government makes an exception for trabants to be on the road , because they are n't being made anymore .
but that could end , especially if eu rules begin to supercede german ones .
in the next few months , many vintage car fans will be holding protests to champion their cars as cultural artifacts which should be given a dispensation to stay on the streets and not just be relegated to garages or museums .

east germany 's darling car turns 50 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other car in the world is such a powerful symbol of a bygone era looking like a cross between a golf cart and an amusement park bumper car , the trabant - a sluggish two-cylinder vehicle from east germany - was arguably the most venerated object of desire behind the iron curtain . the trabants , or trabis for short , were in production in the german democratic republic without any significant change for more than three decades .
and although the last new trabi hit the roads in 1991 , the vehicle - which turns 50 this year - has gained cult status in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis evoke memories of living in the gdr " i love my car , it 's like a child to me , " said christian marotz , board member of the trabant club berlin , a group that devotes a good deal of time and personal finance investment into all things trabant .
" it symbolizes a simpler life from earlier , in the east … oh , and insurance is cheap too , because they are n't stolen very often ! "
accidentally , a car the first trabi rolled off the factory floor in 1957 .
it was actually never really intended to be a car , but was planned as a three-wheeled motorcycle .
and even though the designers only expected production to last about 10 years , it ended up lasting 34 .

television ads by the trabant 's maker , the sachsenring automobile works in east germany , praised the trabi for offering " a lot of room for your luggage " and for being " agile , " " fast , " " long-lasting " and " robust , " but in reality the car left much to be desired .
at the time the trabi was launched , western countries already used cars with cleaner and more efficient engines .
the trabi 's own motor was a two-stroke affair with just two cylinders .
it delivered all of 25 horsepower , and took a full 21 seconds to get from 0 to 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- per hour .

on may 26 , they meet nuremberg in the german cup final in what could result in the first double in club history . confronted with expensive players who performed below par , cash-strapped stuttgart took the daring move last summer of making a total overhaul instead of getting only new players for certain positions . jon dahl tomasson , jesper gronkjaer , christian tiffert , andreas hinkel , zvonimir soldo , danijel ljuboja were retired or had to leave as new sports director horst heldt and coach armin -lrb- following matthias sammer and giovanni trapattoni -rrb- made sweeping changes . " the former team put together without love was made up of sammer-players who trapattoni did n't want and of trapattoni-players who veh did n't want , " the daily süddeutsche zeitung wrote before going on to call the changes the biggest in league history . an overhaul " without mercy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart needed to wipe away the remains of too many coaches but the changes were necessary for the team to have any success , according to heldt . " you could n't continue with the old squad , " he said .
" we had to risk the overhaul because the former team was driving the people out of the stadium .
we did the overhaul without mercy . " the result was stunning . an old guard of fernando meira , ludovic magnin , brazilian forward cacau , goalkeeper timo hildebrand and midfielder thomas hitzlsperger was joined by newcomers like mario gomez , serdar tasci , roberto hilbert and antonio da silva , who all made a big impact . heldt said stuttgart carefully chose the new players but admitted that " you could n't expect that it would work so well . " reliable weekly performances bildunterschrift : though not the showiest bundesliga side , stuttgart played consistently well all season stuttgart , who only claimed the bundesliga 's top spot once before the season 's final two weeks , were long vying for third place , but more became possible because they did n't have a slump like the title rivals schalke or werder bremen . it did n't even matter that gomez was sidelined for two months after scoring 14 goals until then .
he only returned saturday to score the important 2-2 equalizer in bochum . " we showed all season that we are a team , " said saturday 's match-winner cacau said . stuttgart became invincible on the home stretch , winning the last seven games after an unlucky 1-0 defeat at schalke in mid-march . many experts predicted over the past two weeks that stuttgart were the team to look out for in the title race because they had nothing to lose . who " deserves " to win ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saves from goalkeeper timo hildebrand kept stuttgart in several matches " stuttgart played a sensational season , " said bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld in admiration of the team where he formerly played . former germany player paul breitner said on sunday in the bild am sonntag newspaper that " stuttgart deserves the title . " bremen were unable to maintain their autumn form and schalke lost the last two away games , cracking under pressure just like in 2001 .
that year they lost the title on the last play of the season to bayern munich , but a 1-0 defeat in stuttgart the week before was the crucial setback . as a result , many said that schalke , who once again appear not to be able to shake their reputation as perennial runners-up , now deserved the first national title since 1958 , including german soccer supremo theo zwanziger who said " the time was ripe " for them to succeed . that remark led to the only major outburst of anger from stuttgart this season . " i was very upset when i read the statements from zwanziger that it would be only just if schalke won the title , " veh said .
" what is supposed to be just about that ? " now veh - and his players - will likely take even more pride when they are expected to receive the trophy for their fifth german title overall and first since 1992 on saturday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stuttgart steal pole position as schalke lose stuttgart climbed to the top of the bundesliga on saturday , with just one week left to the season , as their dramatic 3-2 win at vfl bochum knocked schalke 04 off first place .

" i heard of this underhanded attack with great shock , " merkel said in a statement released in berlin .
" this perfidious murder fills all of us with disgust . "
she said the bombing was aimed at preventing the process of reconstruction in afghanistan from becoming a success , " but added that the international community was resolved to continue helping afghans create a better future for themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the bombing would n't deter the international community three german soldiers were killed and three wounded while six afghan civilians were killed and 14 others wounded when a suicide attacker detonated his explosive-laden vest in northern afghanistan , officials said .
provincial governor mohammad omar told german news agency dpa that three german soldiers were killed and two soldiers and an interpreter were wounded when the bomber struck in chaiferoshi market in kunduz on saturday morning .
six afghan shopkeepers and civilian passers-by were killed and another 14 were wounded , omar said .
" we received intelligence information a couple of days ago that four would-be suicide bombers entered the city and would use motorcycles to carry out their attacks , " omar said , adding that the police started searching motorbikes on thursday .
he said that the security forces would intensify their search to track down the remaining bombers .
general noor mohammad omarkhail , provincial security chief of the kunduz police , described the condition of seven of the wounded afghans as critical .
taliban claims responsibility a spokesperson for the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul confirmed the incident in a statement , but said that three isaf soldiers and five afghans were killed and 10 , including two isaf soldiers , were wounded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 3,000 german troops are stationed in afghanistan " this senseless act of violence shows the barbarity of extremists and criminals targeting civilians and isaf troops who are working to rebuild afghanistan , " lieutenant colonel angela billings , an isaf spokeswoman was quoted in the statement as saying .
taliban militants took responsibility for the attack and said 11 german soldiers were killed in the suicide blast that destroyed the windows of the shops as far as one kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- .
" today at 11:00 a.m. a mujahedeen hero , jawad , who is a resident of kunduz province , attacked the german soldiers who were patrolling in the area , " zabeeullah mujahed , a taliban spokesman said in a statement posted at their web site .
at the german defense ministry in berlin , officials declined to confirm any death toll , speaking only of " several " soldiers being killed , which was taken as a hint that the german wounded were in critical condition .
debate expected in parliament voicing shock at the attack , german defense minister franz josef jung broke off a private weekend trip and flew back to berlin to respond to the crisis .
the attack was expected to lead to renewed debate in germany about whether german soldiers should be posted to afghanistan .
germany 's green party , which has supported the afghan peace mission , appeared to be foreshadowing that debate saturday , calling for a massive rise in spending on training the afghan military .
the green parliamentary co-leaders said the attack was " intended to stop the establishment of democratic structures . "
german television reported that the soldiers got out of their patrol vehicle to do some shopping .
21 german dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not the first bundeswehr funerals in afghanistan it was the biggest suicide attack against german troops in afghanistan since june 2003 when four german soldiers were killed and 29 wounded .
apart from saturday 's incident , 18 german soldiers have been killed in afghanistan since the ouster of the taliban regime in late 2001 .
ten of them were killed by hostile acts while eight died in non-combat incidents .
there are around 3,000 german troops under the banner of the nato- led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in the country , the bulk of them stationed in the northern provinces .
northern provinces of the country are relatively calm .

" i heard of this underhanded attack with great shock , " merkel said in a statement released in berlin .
" this perfidious murder fills all of us with disgust . "
she said the bombing was aimed at preventing the process of reconstruction in afghanistan from becoming a success , " but added that the international community was resolved to continue helping afghans create a better future for themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the bombing would n't deter the international community three german soldiers were killed and three wounded while six afghan civilians were killed and 14 others wounded when a suicide attacker detonated his explosive-laden vest in northern afghanistan , officials said .
provincial governor mohammad omar told german news agency dpa that three german soldiers were killed and two soldiers and an interpreter were wounded when the bomber struck in chaiferoshi market in kunduz on saturday morning .
six afghan shopkeepers and civilian passers-by were killed and another 14 were wounded , omar said .
" we received intelligence information a couple of days ago that four would-be suicide bombers entered the city and would use motorcycles to carry out their attacks , " omar said , adding that the police started searching motorbikes on thursday .
he said that the security forces would intensify their search to track down the remaining bombers .

debate expected in parliament voicing shock at the attack , german defense minister franz josef jung broke off a private weekend trip and flew back to berlin to respond to the crisis .
the attack was expected to lead to renewed debate in germany about whether german soldiers should be posted to afghanistan .
germany 's green party , which has supported the afghan peace mission , appeared to be foreshadowing that debate saturday , calling for a massive rise in spending on training the afghan military .
the green parliamentary co-leaders said the attack was " intended to stop the establishment of democratic structures . "

six afghan shopkeepers and civilian passers-by were killed and another 14 were wounded , omar said .

the german soldiers were hit while shopping in a market in the town of kunduz , the provincial governor told afp .
" three of our german friends were killed and two were wounded .
one afghan interpreter was also wounded , " kunduz governor mohammad omar said .
six afghans were killed and 12 others wounded , six of them critically , he said .
all that was left of the bomber was two legs , omar said .
worst attack in years for germans the attack was the most deadly against the german troops since 2003 , when four were killed in a suicide car bombing in kabul .
nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- media office in the capital kabul confirmed there had been an explosion but said it had no details .
the german military based in the main northern city of mazar-i-sharif said it could not yet release any information .
germany has around 3,000 troops in afghanistan , operating largely in the north of the country .
twenty-one german soldiers have lost their lives in afghanistan since 2002 , including the ones killed on saturday .
around 60 foreign soldiers involved in the international mission to afghanistan have died this year , most of them in attacks or combat inside the country .
coalition claims to have killed dozens in another attack on saturday , a district police chief and one of his bodyguards were killed in a remote controlled bomb explosion in the eastern province of nangarhar , a district chief said .
an afghan general reported saturday meanwhile that soldiers from the army and the coalition led by the united states had killed 67 taliban in an ambush in the eastern province of paktia , near the border with pakistan .
" their bodies were lying on the ground , " general sami-ul haq badar told afp .
the soldiers had been tipped off that there were taliban in the area , he said .
the coalition announced separately that an estimated " several dozen enemy fighters " were killed in battles around midnight friday about 60 kilometers -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- from kabul in kapisa province .
the death tolls issued by the military are impossible to verify independently .
the taliban , a movement rooted in an ultraconservative interpretation of islam , was removed from government nearly six years ago by the coalition .
thousands of foreign troops arrived soon afterwards to help stabilize the fragile and fractured country but they have been unable to tame the insurgents , who are supported by the al-qaeda movement .
taliban threatened revenge in the biggest success against the taliban , the group 's famously brutal top military commander mullah dadullah was killed a week ago in the southern province of helmand after being tracked from the border with pakistan .
the group threatened this week a wave of violence , including suicide bombings , roadside blasts and attacks to avenge his killing .
they said a suicide car bomb aimed at the governor of the southern province of kandahar on thursday was part of this campaign .

" i heard of this underhanded attack with great shock , " merkel said in a statement released in berlin .
" this perfidious murder fills all of us with disgust . "
she said the bombing was aimed at preventing the process of reconstruction in afghanistan from becoming a success , " but added that the international community was resolved to continue helping afghans create a better future for themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the bombing would n't deter the international community three german soldiers were killed and three wounded while six afghan civilians were killed and 14 others wounded when a suicide attacker detonated his explosive-laden vest in northern afghanistan , officials said .
provincial governor mohammad omar told german news agency dpa that three german soldiers were killed and two soldiers and an interpreter were wounded when the bomber struck in chaiferoshi market in kunduz on saturday morning .
six afghan shopkeepers and civilian passers-by were killed and another 14 were wounded , omar said .
" we received intelligence information a couple of days ago that four would-be suicide bombers entered the city and would use motorcycles to carry out their attacks , " omar said , adding that the police started searching motorbikes on thursday .
he said that the security forces would intensify their search to track down the remaining bombers .
general noor mohammad omarkhail , provincial security chief of the kunduz police , described the condition of seven of the wounded afghans as critical .
taliban claims responsibility a spokesperson for the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul confirmed the incident in a statement , but said that three isaf soldiers and five afghans were killed and 10 , including two isaf soldiers , were wounded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 3,000 german troops are stationed in afghanistan " this senseless act of violence shows the barbarity of extremists and criminals targeting civilians and isaf troops who are working to rebuild afghanistan , " lieutenant colonel angela billings , an isaf spokeswoman was quoted in the statement as saying .
taliban militants took responsibility for the attack and said 11 german soldiers were killed in the suicide blast that destroyed the windows of the shops as far as one kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- .
" today at 11:00 a.m. a mujahedeen hero , jawad , who is a resident of kunduz province , attacked the german soldiers who were patrolling in the area , " zabeeullah mujahed , a taliban spokesman said in a statement posted at their web site .
at the german defense ministry in berlin , officials declined to confirm any death toll , speaking only of " several " soldiers being killed , which was taken as a hint that the german wounded were in critical condition .
debate expected in parliament voicing shock at the attack , german defense minister franz josef jung broke off a private weekend trip and flew back to berlin to respond to the crisis .
the attack was expected to lead to renewed debate in germany about whether german soldiers should be posted to afghanistan .
germany 's green party , which has supported the afghan peace mission , appeared to be foreshadowing that debate saturday , calling for a massive rise in spending on training the afghan military .
the green parliamentary co-leaders said the attack was " intended to stop the establishment of democratic structures . "
german television reported that the soldiers got out of their patrol vehicle to do some shopping .
21 german dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not the first bundeswehr funerals in afghanistan it was the biggest suicide attack against german troops in afghanistan since june 2003 when four german soldiers were killed and 29 wounded .
apart from saturday 's incident , 18 german soldiers have been killed in afghanistan since the ouster of the taliban regime in late 2001 .
ten of them were killed by hostile acts while eight died in non-combat incidents .
there are around 3,000 german troops under the banner of the nato- led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in the country , the bulk of them stationed in the northern provinces .
northern provinces of the country are relatively calm .

east germany 's darling car turns 50 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other car in the world is such a powerful symbol of a bygone era looking like a cross between a golf cart and an amusement park bumper car , the trabant - a sluggish two-cylinder vehicle from east germany - was arguably the most venerated object of desire behind the iron curtain . the trabants , or trabis for short , were in production in the german democratic republic without any significant change for more than three decades .
and although the last new trabi hit the roads in 1991 , the vehicle - which turns 50 this year - has gained cult status in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis evoke memories of living in the gdr " i love my car , it 's like a child to me , " said christian marotz , board member of the trabant club berlin , a group that devotes a good deal of time and personal finance investment into all things trabant .
" it symbolizes a simpler life from earlier , in the east … oh , and insurance is cheap too , because they are n't stolen very often ! "
accidentally , a car the first trabi rolled off the factory floor in 1957 .
it was actually never really intended to be a car , but was planned as a three-wheeled motorcycle .
and even though the designers only expected production to last about 10 years , it ended up lasting 34 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last trabant left the assembly line on april 30 , 1991 the name trabant means " fellow traveler , " or satellite , and was inspired by the russian satellite sputnik , which went into space the year went on sale .
television ads by the trabant 's maker , the sachsenring automobile works in east germany , praised the trabi for offering " a lot of room for your luggage " and for being " agile , " " fast , " " long-lasting " and " robust , " but in reality the car left much to be desired .
at the time the trabi was launched , western countries already used cars with cleaner and more efficient engines .
the trabi 's own motor was a two-stroke affair with just two cylinders .
it delivered all of 25 horsepower , and took a full 21 seconds to get from 0 to 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- per hour .
its top speed was all of 112 kilometers per hour .
an entirely different perspective the trabi 's a little thing .
just under 360 cm -lrb- 140 inches -rrb- long , about 150 cm wide and 146 cm tall .
in today 's world of hummers and other suvs , it 's a real shrimp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's a real beauty !
while it had a steel frame , the body was made of something called duroplast - a form of hardened plastic made of cotton waste from russia and resins from the east german dye industry .
" it was the average car people would have in east germany , " said johannes drexler , who is a tour guide for trabi safari , a company in berlin that allows people to see berlin 's sites from the vantage point of this micro car .
" everyone tried to afford a trabant during the east german times .
you had to have yourself put on a list and you had to wait for the car between 11 and 15 years , " drexler said .
the 11 or 15 years was for those lucky enough to be living in berlin , which enjoyed some advantages over other parts of east germany .
those in other places could wait up to 18 years to get their car .
pure luxury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis were never this colorful before the fall of the berlin wall the trabi was probably one of the only cars that was more expensive to buy used than it was new .
a new trabi would set you back between 8,500 and 12,500 east german marks .
for a used car , which you could get much faster , you could pay as much as 4,000 more .
" to have a car in east germany was considered to be pure luxury , " drexler said .
the trabi plant in the city of zwickau churned out around 3.7 million of the cars in 34 years .
some were exported to other communist countries .
today , there are still about 58,000 trabis in use in germany , about 85 percent of them in the former east .
when the berlin wall fell in 1989 , the trabi was still produced for two more years .
but many easterners wanted flashier western cars at the time , so the market dried up .
numerous trabi jokes , however , have survived to this day .
how do you double the value of a trabant ?
fill up its gas tank .
why does the trabi have a heated rear window ?
it keeps your hands warm while you push it .
environmental concerns what finally might spell the end of the trabi - at least on the roads - is not ridicule , or even a lack of replacement parts .
it could be growing concerns about the environment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabi exhaust fumes can even be bought in cans as trabi fragrance trabis are not the " greenest " cars going .
they were n't built with pollution-reducing catalytic converters .
one study found that they spew about nine times as many hydrocarbons and five times as much carbon monoxide as most other cars in western europe .
in several cities in germany , restrictions are being put in place that will prohibit cars from entering city centers if they do n't meet certain environmental standards .
and those standards are getting tougher .
at the moment , the german government makes an exception for trabants to be on the road , because they are n't being made anymore .
but that could end , especially if eu rules begin to supercede german ones .
in the next few months , many vintage car fans will be holding protests to champion their cars as cultural artifacts which should be given a dispensation to stay on the streets and not just be relegated to garages or museums .
" well , you have to stay optimistic in order to get your point across , but in reality , it does n't look so good for us . "

" i heard of this underhanded attack with great shock , " merkel said in a statement released in berlin .
" this perfidious murder fills all of us with disgust . "
she said the bombing was aimed at preventing the process of reconstruction in afghanistan from becoming a success , " but added that the international community was resolved to continue helping afghans create a better future for themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the bombing would n't deter the international community three german soldiers were killed and three wounded while six afghan civilians were killed and 14 others wounded when a suicide attacker detonated his explosive-laden vest in northern afghanistan , officials said .
provincial governor mohammad omar told german news agency dpa that three german soldiers were killed and two soldiers and an interpreter were wounded when the bomber struck in chaiferoshi market in kunduz on saturday morning .
six afghan shopkeepers and civilian passers-by were killed and another 14 were wounded , omar said .
" we received intelligence information a couple of days ago that four would-be suicide bombers entered the city and would use motorcycles to carry out their attacks , " omar said , adding that the police started searching motorbikes on thursday .
he said that the security forces would intensify their search to track down the remaining bombers .
general noor mohammad omarkhail , provincial security chief of the kunduz police , described the condition of seven of the wounded afghans as critical .
taliban claims responsibility a spokesperson for the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul confirmed the incident in a statement , but said that three isaf soldiers and five afghans were killed and 10 , including two isaf soldiers , were wounded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 3,000 german troops are stationed in afghanistan " this senseless act of violence shows the barbarity of extremists and criminals targeting civilians and isaf troops who are working to rebuild afghanistan , " lieutenant colonel angela billings , an isaf spokeswoman was quoted in the statement as saying .
taliban militants took responsibility for the attack and said 11 german soldiers were killed in the suicide blast that destroyed the windows of the shops as far as one kilometer -lrb- 0.6 miles -rrb- .
" today at 11:00 a.m. a mujahedeen hero , jawad , who is a resident of kunduz province , attacked the german soldiers who were patrolling in the area , " zabeeullah mujahed , a taliban spokesman said in a statement posted at their web site .
at the german defense ministry in berlin , officials declined to confirm any death toll , speaking only of " several " soldiers being killed , which was taken as a hint that the german wounded were in critical condition .
debate expected in parliament voicing shock at the attack , german defense minister franz josef jung broke off a private weekend trip and flew back to berlin to respond to the crisis .
the attack was expected to lead to renewed debate in germany about whether german soldiers should be posted to afghanistan .
germany 's green party , which has supported the afghan peace mission , appeared to be foreshadowing that debate saturday , calling for a massive rise in spending on training the afghan military .
the green parliamentary co-leaders said the attack was " intended to stop the establishment of democratic structures . "

ten of them were killed by hostile acts while eight died in non-combat incidents .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hildebrand missed the ball to give cottbus a 1-0 lead with schalke 04 winning 2-0 at that moment , the defeat would have sent the title to gelsenkirchen , but stuttgart settled and germany international thomas hitzlsperger equalized on 27 minutes to swing the title back their way . but it was midfielder khedira whose 63rd minute goal had stuttgart 's fans celebrating the win which gave them a two-point margin at the top of the league .

east germany 's darling car turns 50 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other car in the world is such a powerful symbol of a bygone era looking like a cross between a golf cart and an amusement park bumper car , the trabant - a sluggish two-cylinder vehicle from east germany - was arguably the most venerated object of desire behind the iron curtain . the trabants , or trabis for short , were in production in the german democratic republic without any significant change for more than three decades .
and although the last new trabi hit the roads in 1991 , the vehicle - which turns 50 this year - has gained cult status in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis evoke memories of living in the gdr " i love my car , it 's like a child to me , " said christian marotz , board member of the trabant club berlin , a group that devotes a good deal of time and personal finance investment into all things trabant .
" it symbolizes a simpler life from earlier , in the east … oh , and insurance is cheap too , because they are n't stolen very often ! "
accidentally , a car the first trabi rolled off the factory floor in 1957 .
it was actually never really intended to be a car , but was planned as a three-wheeled motorcycle .
and even though the designers only expected production to last about 10 years , it ended up lasting 34 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last trabant left the assembly line on april 30 , 1991 the name trabant means " fellow traveler , " or satellite , and was inspired by the russian satellite sputnik , which went into space the year went on sale .
television ads by the trabant 's maker , the sachsenring automobile works in east germany , praised the trabi for offering " a lot of room for your luggage " and for being " agile , " " fast , " " long-lasting " and " robust , " but in reality the car left much to be desired .
at the time the trabi was launched , western countries already used cars with cleaner and more efficient engines .
the trabi 's own motor was a two-stroke affair with just two cylinders .
it delivered all of 25 horsepower , and took a full 21 seconds to get from 0 to 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- per hour .
its top speed was all of 112 kilometers per hour .
an entirely different perspective the trabi 's a little thing .
just under 360 cm -lrb- 140 inches -rrb- long , about 150 cm wide and 146 cm tall .
in today 's world of hummers and other suvs , it 's a real shrimp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's a real beauty !
while it had a steel frame , the body was made of something called duroplast - a form of hardened plastic made of cotton waste from russia and resins from the east german dye industry .
" it was the average car people would have in east germany , " said johannes drexler , who is a tour guide for trabi safari , a company in berlin that allows people to see berlin 's sites from the vantage point of this micro car .
" everyone tried to afford a trabant during the east german times .
you had to have yourself put on a list and you had to wait for the car between 11 and 15 years , " drexler said .
the 11 or 15 years was for those lucky enough to be living in berlin , which enjoyed some advantages over other parts of east germany .
those in other places could wait up to 18 years to get their car .
pure luxury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis were never this colorful before the fall of the berlin wall the trabi was probably one of the only cars that was more expensive to buy used than it was new .
a new trabi would set you back between 8,500 and 12,500 east german marks .
for a used car , which you could get much faster , you could pay as much as 4,000 more .
" to have a car in east germany was considered to be pure luxury , " drexler said .
the trabi plant in the city of zwickau churned out around 3.7 million of the cars in 34 years .
some were exported to other communist countries .
today , there are still about 58,000 trabis in use in germany , about 85 percent of them in the former east .
when the berlin wall fell in 1989 , the trabi was still produced for two more years .
but many easterners wanted flashier western cars at the time , so the market dried up .
numerous trabi jokes , however , have survived to this day .
how do you double the value of a trabant ?
fill up its gas tank .
why does the trabi have a heated rear window ?
it keeps your hands warm while you push it .
environmental concerns what finally might spell the end of the trabi - at least on the roads - is not ridicule , or even a lack of replacement parts .
it could be growing concerns about the environment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabi exhaust fumes can even be bought in cans as trabi fragrance trabis are not the " greenest " cars going .
they were n't built with pollution-reducing catalytic converters .
one study found that they spew about nine times as many hydrocarbons and five times as much carbon monoxide as most other cars in western europe .
in several cities in germany , restrictions are being put in place that will prohibit cars from entering city centers if they do n't meet certain environmental standards .
and those standards are getting tougher .
at the moment , the german government makes an exception for trabants to be on the road , because they are n't being made anymore .
but that could end , especially if eu rules begin to supercede german ones .
in the next few months , many vintage car fans will be holding protests to champion their cars as cultural artifacts which should be given a dispensation to stay on the streets and not just be relegated to garages or museums .
" well , you have to stay optimistic in order to get your point across , but in reality , it does n't look so good for us . "

east germany 's darling car turns 50 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other car in the world is such a powerful symbol of a bygone era looking like a cross between a golf cart and an amusement park bumper car , the trabant - a sluggish two-cylinder vehicle from east germany - was arguably the most venerated object of desire behind the iron curtain . the trabants , or trabis for short , were in production in the german democratic republic without any significant change for more than three decades .
and although the last new trabi hit the roads in 1991 , the vehicle - which turns 50 this year - has gained cult status in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis evoke memories of living in the gdr " i love my car , it 's like a child to me , " said christian marotz , board member of the trabant club berlin , a group that devotes a good deal of time and personal finance investment into all things trabant .
" it symbolizes a simpler life from earlier , in the east … oh , and insurance is cheap too , because they are n't stolen very often ! "
accidentally , a car the first trabi rolled off the factory floor in 1957 .
it was actually never really intended to be a car , but was planned as a three-wheeled motorcycle .
and even though the designers only expected production to last about 10 years , it ended up lasting 34 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last trabant left the assembly line on april 30 , 1991 the name trabant means " fellow traveler , " or satellite , and was inspired by the russian satellite sputnik , which went into space the year went on sale .
television ads by the trabant 's maker , the sachsenring automobile works in east germany , praised the trabi for offering " a lot of room for your luggage " and for being " agile , " " fast , " " long-lasting " and " robust , " but in reality the car left much to be desired .
at the time the trabi was launched , western countries already used cars with cleaner and more efficient engines .
the trabi 's own motor was a two-stroke affair with just two cylinders .
it delivered all of 25 horsepower , and took a full 21 seconds to get from 0 to 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- per hour .
its top speed was all of 112 kilometers per hour .
an entirely different perspective the trabi 's a little thing .
just under 360 cm -lrb- 140 inches -rrb- long , about 150 cm wide and 146 cm tall .
in today 's world of hummers and other suvs , it 's a real shrimp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's a real beauty !
while it had a steel frame , the body was made of something called duroplast - a form of hardened plastic made of cotton waste from russia and resins from the east german dye industry .
" it was the average car people would have in east germany , " said johannes drexler , who is a tour guide for trabi safari , a company in berlin that allows people to see berlin 's sites from the vantage point of this micro car .
" everyone tried to afford a trabant during the east german times .
you had to have yourself put on a list and you had to wait for the car between 11 and 15 years , " drexler said .
the 11 or 15 years was for those lucky enough to be living in berlin , which enjoyed some advantages over other parts of east germany .
those in other places could wait up to 18 years to get their car .
pure luxury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabis were never this colorful before the fall of the berlin wall the trabi was probably one of the only cars that was more expensive to buy used than it was new .
a new trabi would set you back between 8,500 and 12,500 east german marks .
for a used car , which you could get much faster , you could pay as much as 4,000 more .
" to have a car in east germany was considered to be pure luxury , " drexler said .
the trabi plant in the city of zwickau churned out around 3.7 million of the cars in 34 years .
some were exported to other communist countries .
today , there are still about 58,000 trabis in use in germany , about 85 percent of them in the former east .
when the berlin wall fell in 1989 , the trabi was still produced for two more years .
but many easterners wanted flashier western cars at the time , so the market dried up .
numerous trabi jokes , however , have survived to this day .
how do you double the value of a trabant ?
fill up its gas tank .
why does the trabi have a heated rear window ?
it keeps your hands warm while you push it .
environmental concerns what finally might spell the end of the trabi - at least on the roads - is not ridicule , or even a lack of replacement parts .
it could be growing concerns about the environment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trabi exhaust fumes can even be bought in cans as trabi fragrance trabis are not the " greenest " cars going .
they were n't built with pollution-reducing catalytic converters .
one study found that they spew about nine times as many hydrocarbons and five times as much carbon monoxide as most other cars in western europe .
in several cities in germany , restrictions are being put in place that will prohibit cars from entering city centers if they do n't meet certain environmental standards .
and those standards are getting tougher .

president chiang led taiwan 's first government after fleeing china in 1949 .
the renaming is part of government efforts to remove reminders of taiwan 's authoritarian past and its links to its political rival , mainland china .
president chen shui-bian is expected to unveil a plaque renaming the building as the taiwan democracy memorial hall .
an exhibition inside the hall , entitled goodbye president chiang , will also be opened , documenting the island 's fight for democracy .
' timely move ' the move to rename taipei 's landmark building was approved at a cabinet meeting earlier this month .
officials said taiwan was a democracy and did not need monuments honouring a dictator .
but it is proving a highly controversial decision , with many opponents questioning the legality of such a step .
among the critics is taipei city mayor , hau lung-bin , who is a member of the island 's opposition kuomintang or nationalist party .
he has accused the government of making the decision for ideological and electoral reasons .
he has also baulked at changing the name of adjacent bus and subway stops in line with the monument 's planned name change , saying it would cost about $ 230,000 -lrb- £ 116,000 ; 170,000 euros -rrb- .
but advocates say the move is timely - and the island no longer needs so many reminders of its authoritarian past .
trial calls chiang kai-shek , who once governed all of china , fled with his nationalist troops to taiwan in 1949 after losing the chinese civil war to the communists .
he set up a rival government in taipei and ruled the island with an iron grip .
but the legacy of the military strongman , once revered as a hero , is increasingly coming under attack .
his statues have been removed from many schools , public buildings and military barracks and his name was recently erased from taiwan 's main international airport .
there have also been calls for him to face a posthumous trial after a government-backed report said he bore the greatest responsibility for the deaths of thousands of taiwanese killed by troops he had sent from china to suppress an uprising 60 years ago .
the future fate of a huge bronze statue of chiang , which sits inside the memorial hall , is still unclear .
it is also unclear if other plans will go ahead to tear down the elaborately latticed outer walls of the building to make the park more accessible to ordinary citizens .

dubbed " the father of samoa " , malietoa had ruled the nation since it gained independence from new zealand in 1962 .
he was the world 's third-longest serving head of state , after king bhumibol adulyadej of thailand and queen elizabeth ii .
cannon salute malietoa 's body lay in state overnight inside parliament before being placed outside on a decorated platform for the funeral ceremony .

bare-chested warriors in woven mourning mats and orange flower garlands surrounded the platform as the funeral took place .
the late leader was then interred in his family crypt , with a cannon salute .
malietoa , who was appointed for life , was the world 's oldest head of state when he died .

" samoa 's deep grief is shared ... by all these people , " the prime minister said , describing malietoa as " the personification of samoan peace and unity " .
bare-chested warriors in woven mourning mats and orange flower garlands surrounded the platform as the funeral took place .
the late leader was then interred in his family crypt , with a cannon salute .
malietoa , who was appointed for life , was the world 's oldest head of state when he died .
he was the architect of samoa 's constitution , under which the country 's next head of state will be selected by the legislature for a five-year term .

shambo has tested positive for bovine tb , but the multi-faith skanda vale temple in carmarthenshire , where he lives , wants to keep him alive .
graham brooks of the british cattle veterinary association said shambo was at risk of passing on the infection .
the welsh assembly government has said there is " no timetable for slaughter " .
the slaughter notice was issued on the six-year-old black friesian nearly two weeks ago - shortly after he tested positive for bovine tb during routine screening .
science says the animal should be destroyed graham brooks , british cattle veterinary association the provisional date for slaughter had been set for monday .
but monks at skanda vale at llanpumsaint said killing shambo would violate their religious principles and have mounted a campaign to save the animal .
an online petition has attracted more than 8,000 names and there is a video stream live from shambo 's pen in the temple .
shambo 's keepers claimed he was not proven to be a carrier of tb and said that even if it did develop " he can be expected to make a full recovery given appropriate care " .
the temple 's website said slaughter would be an " appalling desecration of life " .
it added : " we could no more allow the slaughter of shambo than we could the killing of a human being . "
final decision but according to mr brooks , president of the british cattle veterinary association - the cattle division of the british veterinary association - the risk of passing on infection increased the longer shambo remained alive .
earlier this month , mr brooks , said shambo " must be removed from the cattle population " .
he has now said that because shambo comes into regular contact with humans , there is a threat of animal-to-human infection .
" science says the animal should be destroyed , " said mr brooks .
the final decision on the bullock 's fate rests with the assembly government , which said its policy " in common with many other countries , is that cattle who have tested positive for tb should be slaughtered to protect public health and animal health . "
it said it was " continuing to assess all the issues surrounding this very sensitive case , " and there was " currently no timetable for the slaughter of the bullock , though the slaughter notice remains in force . "

mr carter told the bbc mr blair 's backing for us president george w bush had been " apparently subservient " .
he said the uk 's " almost undeviating " support for " the ill-advised policies of president bush in iraq had been a major tragedy for the world " .
his comments came as mr blair paid what is likely to be his last visit to iraq .
he flew into the capital , baghdad , for talks with president jalal talabani and prime minister nouri maliki at which he is expected to push for greater reconciliation between iraq 's sunni and shia factions .
mr blair is due to leave office at the end of next month .
' global schisms ' mr carter said that if mr blair had distanced himself from the bush administration 's policy during the run-up to the 2003 invasion of iraq it might have made a crucial difference to american political and public opinion .
" one of the defences of the bush administration ... has been , okay , we must be more correct in our actions than the world thinks because great britain is backing us , " he told the today programme on radio 4 .
" so i think the combination of bush and blair giving their support to this tragedy in iraq has strengthened the effort and has made the opposition less effective and prolonged the war and increased the tragedy that has resulted . "
the war had " caused deep schisms on a global basis " , he said , and he hoped mr blair 's successor , gordon brown , would be less enthusiastic in his support for it .
the former us president has been a fierce critic of the us-led war in iraq .
in an interview last year , he said he was " disappointed " by tony blair 's failure to use his influence with president bush more wisely .
in 1976 , mr carter unseated the incumbent gerald ford to become the 39th us president , serving until 1981 .
he won the nobel peace prize in 2002 , for what presenters cited as decades of work seeking peaceful solutions and promoting social and economic justice .

mr carter told the bbc mr blair 's backing for us president george w bush had been " apparently subservient " .
he said the uk 's " almost undeviating " support for " the ill-advised policies of president bush in iraq had been a major tragedy for the world " .
his comments came as mr blair paid what is likely to be his last visit to iraq .
he flew into the capital , baghdad , for talks with president jalal talabani and prime minister nouri maliki at which he is expected to push for greater reconciliation between iraq 's sunni and shia factions .
mr blair is due to leave office at the end of next month .
' global schisms ' mr carter said that if mr blair had distanced himself from the bush administration 's policy during the run-up to the 2003 invasion of iraq it might have made a crucial difference to american political and public opinion .
" one of the defences of the bush administration ... has been , okay , we must be more correct in our actions than the world thinks because great britain is backing us , " he told the today programme on radio 4 .
" so i think the combination of bush and blair giving their support to this tragedy in iraq has strengthened the effort and has made the opposition less effective and prolonged the war and increased the tragedy that has resulted . "
the war had " caused deep schisms on a global basis " , he said , and he hoped mr blair 's successor , gordon brown , would be less enthusiastic in his support for it .
the former us president has been a fierce critic of the us-led war in iraq .
in an interview last year , he said he was " disappointed " by tony blair 's failure to use his influence with president bush more wisely .
in 1976 , mr carter unseated the incumbent gerald ford to become the 39th us president , serving until 1981 .
he won the nobel peace prize in 2002 , for what presenters cited as decades of work seeking peaceful solutions and promoting social and economic justice .

it had previously been owned by the late margarete mauthner , a jewish woman whose possessions were seized by the nazis after she fled germany in 1939 .
her descendents sued dame elizabeth in 2004 , saying she failed to review the ownership history and that the 1963 auction brochure said it was likely to have been looted by the nazis .
' no proof ' but the appeals court upheld the decision that the three-year window for taking action under state law had expired .
it also agreed that the holocaust victims redress act did not establish a right to sue for the return of confiscated property .
dame elizabeth and her lawyers said there was no proof the nazis forced ms mauthner to give up the 1889 painting .
her defence said it had passed through two jewish art dealers without any sign of nazi coercion and there was evidence that it was sold in the late 1920s .

he told the bbc his biggest consideration was keeping labour in power , and that he believed mr johnson would help the party achieve that .
" you know what i 'm thinking about is who will best complement gordon , who 's going to be leader , " mr campbell said .
mr johnson faces hazel blears , peter hain , hilary benn , harriet harman and backbencher jon cruddas in the race .
' strong position ' mr campbell told bbc five live : " i 'm really thinking about the best kind of combination that 's going to help the labour party stay in power .
" i think that if you get gordon , with his strengths and experience , i think alan 's got a very attractive personality and has also got a real understanding of the labour party and labour politics . "
he said : " you then throw in the david milibands and all the rest of it , who are going to become the young kind of intellectual driving forces and i think we 'll be in a very very strong position come the next election . "
he said he did not believe the deputy leader had to be a woman .
" i think the deputy has got to be the person who best complements gordon brown 's skills as leader , " he said .
mr benn launched a bid on friday to replace john prescott , saying the party should be " unapologetic about our values " and pledging a " more straightforward kind of politics " if he became deputy leader .
mr cruddas ' campaign received a boost earlier when london mayor ken livingstone backed him . "
the first task of the deputy leader ... will be to put labour at the centre of a new and more straightforward kind of politics " hilary benn mp mr livingstone praised mr cruddas ' " tenacity " in campaigning against the bnp in his dagenham constituency , in east london , and said he had made a " thoughtful " contribution to the debate on the future of the party .
mr benn , who launched his campaign earlier at toynbee hall , in east london , was the last of the deputy contenders to gain the required 45 nominations to get on to the ballot paper , mr benn 's campaign team said he had strong support within the party .
on friday , the leeds central mp told his launch audience , which included his father tony : " the first task of the deputy leader ... will be to put labour at the centre of a new and more straightforward kind of politics . "
his other aims would be to empower communities and encourage the party to be " bolder " about the society labour wanted to create .
he emphasised that labour had to " talk straightforwardly about the future we want " and urged members to vote for the next deputy leader .
" no politician can create this society alone , as real leadership means having the humility to listen as well as the courage to act , " he said .
" the corridors of power belong to the british people , and making sure your voice is heard along them is why i am standing to be deputy leader . "
the six contenders will take part in a series of hustings around the uk , starting on sunday in coventry .
voting forms will go out to labour party members , meps and trade unionists from 1 june , with the ballot due to close on friday , 22 june .

in the lobby of one of bahrain 's more upmarket hotels a bellboy walks slowly amongst the guests , swinging a charcoal burner of omani frankincense .
the thin grey wisps of smoke circulate through the atrium , sweetening the air and clinging to people 's clothes .
so international is bahrain 's capital manama , that without the incense this could be almost anywhere in the world .
security in the gulf but as i pause over my cappuccino , waiting for my next meeting , a man approaches , wearing the traditional white robe of the gulf , the dishdasha .
" excuse me , " he says in perfect english , " but my father would like to meet you .
could you come now please . "
bahrain 's prime minister sheikh khalifah bin salman al-khalifah the man looks familiar and i am trying hard to remember who his father is .
ah yes , there we go , the bodyguards give it away - he is bahrain 's prime minister , sheikh khalifah bin salman al-khalifah .
the bodyguards move aside , parting like the red sea waves , and i take my seat on an over-stuffed couch .
a filipino waitress appears , quiet as a mouse , and we tinker with our teacups while the conversation drifts from iraq to iran and the security situation in the gulf .
" we would be happier , " says the prime minister , " if our american friends listened more to our advice .
we worry about the violence and extremism in this region because of what is going on in iraq .
there have been so many mistakes made there . "
relations with iran later that day i am introduced to the foreign minister sheikh khaled bin ahmad al-khalifah , a large , rotund and genial man .
he tells me how his recent public embrace with iran 's diminutive president mahmoud ahmedinejad had raised a smile in tehran .
" this must be the only time , " he jokes , " that bahrain is bigger than iran ! "
that evening i head out with bahraini friends for a dinner at an open-air restaurant beneath the palms .
a musician plucks gently at a traditional instrument and the air is thick with the scent of apple-flavoured hubble-bubble pipes .
once again , our conversation focuses on iran - just across the gulf - a country that used to claim bahrain as its own .
president ahmadinejad : high-speed policy ?
are people worried that the us or israel will attack iran 's nuclear plants , i ask .
" oh , the western expats talk about it the whole time , " said my friends , " but look around you - business is booming .
there is so much money pouring in here from around the gulf - everyone 's investing and they would n't be doing that if they thought there was a war coming . "
suhail , a young bahraini businessman , leans over to me and says : " we have a joke here about iran 's president ahmadinejad .
" you know how some young guys in the gulf like to drag-race their cars at night , you know , they drive flat out at over 100mph and then try to spin the car round as many times as they can without flipping ?
well we call this ' tafhees ' , and we say it sums up ahmadinejad 's foreign policy . "
another friend chips in saying : " dealing with this guy is like playing a game of chess .
you think you 've got him in check ... but then he just tips up the board and walks away . "
saddam 's execution so what do they think about the situation up the coast in iraq ?
for so many years saddam hussein 's shadow loomed over this region .
during the first gulf war , the smoke from kuwait 's oil fires that his troops set ablaze frequently blotted out the sun , leaving dirty smudges on my washing every time it rained .
now , from his grave , saddam 's name still brings a frown , but for different reasons .
" his execution was a disaster , " says a visiting saudi banker , toying with his half-drained glass of cabernet sauvignon .
" it made everyone here very angry , " he went on .
" even some of the shia mourned him and he was no friend of theirs .
executing him publicly like that turned saddam into a hero for people in this region .
they should have just left him in prison to be a non-entity . "
old charm as we drive back along the gulf corniche i wonder if bahrain really has changed all that much since i lived here in the 90s .
an international formula one racetrack has been built in bahrain superficially it has , at least along the coast around the capital .
a majestic new causeway links the city to the airport , spanning a shallow lagoon where i used to water-ski in my lunch breaks .
there are 21st century plate-glass skyscrapers shooting up into the cloudless sky , dwarfing the low-rise garden shed of a british embassy with its union jack wilting in the 40-degrees heat .
the building of a waterfront stock exchange is under way and there is an international formula one racetrack .
but scratch beneath the surface and bahrain , i believe , has not fundamentally changed .
my bahraini friends grumble about soaring property prices , traffic jams and rising crime and they say mps in parliament are wasting their time arguing over whether men should or should not be allowed to work in women 's lingerie shops .
but in a country where old friendships and leisurely conversations still count for something , one of britain 's longest standing allies in the gulf has not lost its old world charm .

" excuse me , " he says in perfect english , " but my father would like to meet you .
could you come now please . "
bahrain 's prime minister sheikh khalifah bin salman al-khalifah the man looks familiar and i am trying hard to remember who his father is .
ah yes , there we go , the bodyguards give it away - he is bahrain 's prime minister , sheikh khalifah bin salman al-khalifah .
the bodyguards move aside , parting like the red sea waves , and i take my seat on an over-stuffed couch .

a musician plucks gently at a traditional instrument and the air is thick with the scent of apple-flavoured hubble-bubble pipes .

president ahmadinejad : high-speed policy ?
are people worried that the us or israel will attack iran 's nuclear plants , i ask .
" oh , the western expats talk about it the whole time , " said my friends , " but look around you - business is booming .
there is so much money pouring in here from around the gulf - everyone 's investing and they would n't be doing that if they thought there was a war coming . "
suhail , a young bahraini businessman , leans over to me and says : " we have a joke here about iran 's president ahmadinejad .
" you know how some young guys in the gulf like to drag-race their cars at night , you know , they drive flat out at over 100mph and then try to spin the car round as many times as they can without flipping ?
well we call this ' tafhees ' , and we say it sums up ahmadinejad 's foreign policy . "
another friend chips in saying : " dealing with this guy is like playing a game of chess .
you think you 've got him in check ... but then he just tips up the board and walks away . "
saddam 's execution so what do they think about the situation up the coast in iraq ?
for so many years saddam hussein 's shadow loomed over this region .

but the government says if a mother wants less the father could take it instead .
he would be paid by his employer and businesses fear that could cause administrative problems .
but the government says the revenue would monitor the amounts paid .
under current laws a mother gets twelve months maternity leave but only the first nine months is paid - six weeks at 90 % of her pay and the remaining 33 weeks at a flat rate £ 112.75 -lrb- or 90 % of her pay if that is less -rrb- .
12 months pay the government plans to extend that period of flat-rate pay to the end of the 12 months leave .
it hopes to introduce that change from april 2009 .
the key concern is who is in charge of communicating to the two employers .
stephen alambritis , fsb if a mother decides to take less time off , the government plans to let the father take the balance as paid paternity leave at the same flat-rate pay .
at the moment fathers get up to two weeks paid paternity leave .
speaking on radio 4 's money box programme stephen alambritis of the federation of small businesses said his members were not against extending family friendly policies but he was concerned about how the scheme would work .
" the key concern is who is in charge of communicating to the two employers if the mother has taken the six months or more than the six months and if the father is entitled to say another three months .
it can be open to fraud and abuse .
government agency " we urge the government to find some middle person , perhaps a government agency rather than leave two employers fumbling in the dark about who has taken what leave and when . "
we do n't want to clutter employers with additional red tape .
jim fitzpatrick mp but jim fitzpatrick , the minster at the department of trade and industry in charge of the new policy gave that idea short shrift .
" i think you then get a horrendously extensive bureaucratic system that would complicate matters .
we do n't want to clutter employers with additional red tape .
we want to make it as simple as possible and let parents determine who takes time off . "
and he said maternity pay would be monitored as it is now and it may be that employers would have to trust the word of parents .
" there will always be some people who work the system to their own personal advantage , sometimes selfishly , sometimes fraudulently .
but self-certification is an option and we are very keen to hear employers ' views on that .
the new system will apply equally to adoptive parents and to same sex couples .

by april 2009 new mums should be able to take 12 months paid leave .
but the government says if a mother wants less the father could take it instead .
he would be paid by his employer and businesses fear that could cause administrative problems .
but the government says the revenue would monitor the amounts paid .
under current laws a mother gets twelve months maternity leave but only the first nine months is paid - six weeks at 90 % of her pay and the remaining 33 weeks at a flat rate £ 112.75 -lrb- or 90 % of her pay if that is less -rrb- .
12 months pay the government plans to extend that period of flat-rate pay to the end of the 12 months leave .
it hopes to introduce that change from april 2009 .
the key concern is who is in charge of communicating to the two employers .
stephen alambritis , fsb if a mother decides to take less time off , the government plans to let the father take the balance as paid paternity leave at the same flat-rate pay .
at the moment fathers get up to two weeks paid paternity leave .
speaking on radio 4 's money box programme stephen alambritis of the federation of small businesses said his members were not against extending family friendly policies but he was concerned about how the scheme would work .
" the key concern is who is in charge of communicating to the two employers if the mother has taken the six months or more than the six months and if the father is entitled to say another three months .
it can be open to fraud and abuse .
government agency " we urge the government to find some middle person , perhaps a government agency rather than leave two employers fumbling in the dark about who has taken what leave and when . "
we do n't want to clutter employers with additional red tape .
jim fitzpatrick mp but jim fitzpatrick , the minster at the department of trade and industry in charge of the new policy gave that idea short shrift .
" i think you then get a horrendously extensive bureaucratic system that would complicate matters .
we do n't want to clutter employers with additional red tape .
we want to make it as simple as possible and let parents determine who takes time off . "
and he said maternity pay would be monitored as it is now and it may be that employers would have to trust the word of parents .
" there will always be some people who work the system to their own personal advantage , sometimes selfishly , sometimes fraudulently .
but self-certification is an option and we are very keen to hear employers ' views on that .
the new system will apply equally to adoptive parents and to same sex couples .

the warship , which is believed to be british and built in 1575 , sunk off the coast of alderney carrying a large cargo of military supplies .
it was discovered in 1977 after a fisherman reeled in a musket .
the alderney maritime trust said it needed to attract major funding for work to preserve " a very important piece of english maritime history " .
the ship 's remains are about 25 metres -lrb- 82 ft -rrb- below the surface .
artefacts found on the seabed include muskets , swords , spurs and stirrups .
preliminary surveys have been carried out and the project is entering a new phase of exploration and conservation .
funds are needed for work ranging from underwater surveys to archiving and long-term protection of the site .
excavation director mensum bound said he hoped that enough sponsors will come forward .
he said : " the wreck covers a period of english history which is really very little known .
it was a period when britain was really fighting for its very survival . "
the alderney maritime trust was established to safeguard the wreck , curate the site and ensure the proper management of diving operations .
