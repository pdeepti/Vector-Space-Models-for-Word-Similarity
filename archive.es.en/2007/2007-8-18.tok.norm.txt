hunger for more is pushing the makers of bionade to conquer new markets .
the organic soda will be launched internationally - in the us , canada , spain and ireland .
currently , bionade is also available in italy , france , ireland , benelux and scandinavia .
competition is never far away bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fermented fruity drink is very popular in germany the dominance which bionade enjoyed on the german market , however , is beginning to get challenged by other makers of organic beverages , especially now that the world 's largest brewer , inbey , is jumping on the organic fuzz wagon .
inbev has been selling drinks made of the brazilian guarana plant , so they are already familiar with selling alcohol-free beverages .
despite the competition , however , bionade does not plan to advertise widely abroad .
" our strategy will be the same as in germany , " peter kowalski , manager of bionade corporation , told the daily newspaper der tagesspiegel . " we will let the consumer discover our bionade . "

in subsequent years , it enjoyed an annual growth of 300 percent .
and this year , bionade plans to produce 200 million bottles , up from 70 million last year .
dieter leopold , the man behind bionade , came up with the idea of making a refreshing organic beverage as an alternative to the popular coca-cola in the 80s .
it took him eight years to complete the formula .
besides malt , bionade is primarily made out of ingredients that are found in honey with added vitamins and minerals .
bionade is brewed naturally in a process similar to that of making beer , except that , in the case of the organic soda , sugar does not convert to alcohol but gluconic acid , instead .
the exact technology , however , remains a trade secret .
in 1996 , the blueberry-flavored bionade - made and bottled in the small family-owned brewery - hit the german market .
with it , leopold not only created a popular drink , but also saved a small family brewery from extinction .
enjoyed by young and old , anywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , bionade has become available everywhere , from cafes to train restaurants today , this ultimate hip drink can be found anywhere in germany - at restaurants , schools or bars alike .
it is available in various exotic , fruity flavors , such as elderberry , litchi and ginger-orange .

with its eu entrance , things changed .
in some industries , the wage entitlements are rising , and there is a deficiency of skilled labor . the fashion boutique rollmann is situated in downtown sofia , the capital of bulgaria , and it is one of the best stores for men 's and women 's outerwear in the area .
the store has branches in four other bulgarian cities , as well as in greece and macedonia . the german bertram rollmann , who trained to be a toolmaker , has been attracting the bulgarian fashionistas for the past 13 years .
he began virtually at the bottom , in 1993 . " i found 25 young bulgarians , whom i sent to a special nine-month training to greece and germany , " he said .
with the same people , he began to develop a manufacture in 1994 . profitable virgin land bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of rollmann 's boutiques is located in downtown sofia rollmann first opened a small tailor shop in gotse delchev , a small town in southern bulgaria .
he began to manufacture for the german market , which is still his main market today .
trading in switzerland , france , turkey and greece followed . " for the german investors , bulgaria was a virgin land in 1993 , " rollmann said .
" then , i was managing a company in greece , through which i put the investment into the company in bulgaria , and i came to realize that bulgaria was good as headquarters , and it developed very well , " he said . the german entrepreneur can indeed be very satisfied - 650.000 men 's suits are yearly delivered from " pirintex , " his company in gotse delchev .
the number of employees has considerably risen , going from 25 in 1994 , to 2350 employees and skilled laborers . outstanding wage wars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with its low wages , bulgaria was a profitable country for foreign investors rollmann is afraid that the requirements for foreign investors in bulgaria are going to change now that the country is a member of the eu .
he is expecting many amendments in the next few years , especially in the area of wages . " i hope that the corrections are modest , so that the young business association can stem the wage and price evolution , " he said . the first wage war has already occurred .
at the beginning of june , rollmann 's employees in gotse delchev went on strike .
the labor union asked for a wage increase of 100 levs -lrb- 50 euros -rrb- , which is an increase of 40 percent . the management declined it , calling the union demands unacceptable . after 21 days on strike , rollmann and the strike committee agreed on a compromising solution .
the wages were increased by 80 levs , and the employees agreed to introduce improvements , such as more vacationing days and more money for overtime and nightly work . mecca for craftsmen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu membership drastically change bulgarian concepts of trade and industry ?
with the wage increases , rollmann became worried about the ability to be compatible , because the prices of his products had to rise as well .
he also worried about the availability of a qualified work force . in the next 15 to 20 years , various types of professionals in bulgaria will die out , and there is no controlled educational system for skill-based professions . every company educates their workers depending on their own demands . " there are no industry-standards that go through a central organization , such as the board of industry and trade in germany , which promote the technological and creative development of an industry , and push it forward . " the old master craftsmen are slowly retiring and the young people are not educated in any skill-based profession .
according to rollmann , it is a problem that could be solved , if from now on , the influx of a qualified work force changed directions . " there would be many opportunities for german and northern european craftsmen to settle in bulgaria and through their qualification and specialization contribute to the exchange of technology and the know-how . " rollmann himself can influence the reversal of the migrant storms in europe : he is the new elected president of the german-bulgarian board of industry and trade in sofia . roumania taslakowa -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hunger for more is pushing the makers of bionade to conquer new markets .
the organic soda will be launched internationally - in the us , canada , spain and ireland .
currently , bionade is also available in italy , france , ireland , benelux and scandinavia .
competition is never far away bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fermented fruity drink is very popular in germany the dominance which bionade enjoyed on the german market , however , is beginning to get challenged by other makers of organic beverages , especially now that the world 's largest brewer , inbey , is jumping on the organic fuzz wagon .
inbev has been selling drinks made of the brazilian guarana plant , so they are already familiar with selling alcohol-free beverages .
despite the competition , however , bionade does not plan to advertise widely abroad .
" our strategy will be the same as in germany , " peter kowalski , manager of bionade corporation , told the daily newspaper der tagesspiegel . " we will let the consumer discover our bionade . "
the company is planning to introduce a new flavor , which is still kept secret , once the competition heats up .
sales rising quickly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the classic soft drink coca-cola achieved dominance throughout the world the discovery and wild popularity of bionade in germany resembles an economic miracle .
according to wolfgang blum , co-partner of the bionade international corporation , the company filled up 2 million bottles in 2003 .
in subsequent years , it enjoyed an annual growth of 300 percent .
and this year , bionade plans to produce 200 million bottles , up from 70 million last year .
dieter leopold , the man behind bionade , came up with the idea of making a refreshing organic beverage as an alternative to the popular coca-cola in the 80s .
it took him eight years to complete the formula .
besides malt , bionade is primarily made out of ingredients that are found in honey with added vitamins and minerals .
bionade is brewed naturally in a process similar to that of making beer , except that , in the case of the organic soda , sugar does not convert to alcohol but gluconic acid , instead .
the exact technology , however , remains a trade secret .
in 1996 , the blueberry-flavored bionade - made and bottled in the small family-owned brewery - hit the german market .
with it , leopold not only created a popular drink , but also saved a small family brewery from extinction .
enjoyed by young and old , anywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , bionade has become available everywhere , from cafes to train restaurants today , this ultimate hip drink can be found anywhere in germany - at restaurants , schools or bars alike .
it is available in various exotic , fruity flavors , such as elderberry , litchi and ginger-orange .
from a marketing point of view , bionade does not target any particular group .
" we believe that bionade appeals to everybody , " blum said .
" it is geared towards anybody , ranging from children to adults and the elderly . "
sarah schneider , a college student at the university in cologne is thrilled .
" i always drink bionade in my classes , " schneider said .
" my favorite flavors are elderberry and herbs . "
as with every other successful novel product , imitations of bionade have already appeared on the market .
the company , however , has a zero-tolerance policy for such piggybacking .

hunger for more is pushing the makers of bionade to conquer new markets .
the organic soda will be launched internationally - in the us , canada , spain and ireland .
currently , bionade is also available in italy , france , ireland , benelux and scandinavia .
competition is never far away bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fermented fruity drink is very popular in germany the dominance which bionade enjoyed on the german market , however , is beginning to get challenged by other makers of organic beverages , especially now that the world 's largest brewer , inbey , is jumping on the organic fuzz wagon .
inbev has been selling drinks made of the brazilian guarana plant , so they are already familiar with selling alcohol-free beverages .
despite the competition , however , bionade does not plan to advertise widely abroad .
" our strategy will be the same as in germany , " peter kowalski , manager of bionade corporation , told the daily newspaper der tagesspiegel . " we will let the consumer discover our bionade . "

in subsequent years , it enjoyed an annual growth of 300 percent .
and this year , bionade plans to produce 200 million bottles , up from 70 million last year .
dieter leopold , the man behind bionade , came up with the idea of making a refreshing organic beverage as an alternative to the popular coca-cola in the 80s .
it took him eight years to complete the formula .
besides malt , bionade is primarily made out of ingredients that are found in honey with added vitamins and minerals .
bionade is brewed naturally in a process similar to that of making beer , except that , in the case of the organic soda , sugar does not convert to alcohol but gluconic acid , instead .
the exact technology , however , remains a trade secret .
in 1996 , the blueberry-flavored bionade - made and bottled in the small family-owned brewery - hit the german market .
with it , leopold not only created a popular drink , but also saved a small family brewery from extinction .
enjoyed by young and old , anywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , bionade has become available everywhere , from cafes to train restaurants today , this ultimate hip drink can be found anywhere in germany - at restaurants , schools or bars alike .

hunger for more is pushing the makers of bionade to conquer new markets .
the organic soda will be launched internationally - in the us , canada , spain and ireland .
currently , bionade is also available in italy , france , ireland , benelux and scandinavia .
competition is never far away bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fermented fruity drink is very popular in germany the dominance which bionade enjoyed on the german market , however , is beginning to get challenged by other makers of organic beverages , especially now that the world 's largest brewer , inbey , is jumping on the organic fuzz wagon .
inbev has been selling drinks made of the brazilian guarana plant , so they are already familiar with selling alcohol-free beverages .
despite the competition , however , bionade does not plan to advertise widely abroad .
" our strategy will be the same as in germany , " peter kowalski , manager of bionade corporation , told the daily newspaper der tagesspiegel . " we will let the consumer discover our bionade . "
the company is planning to introduce a new flavor , which is still kept secret , once the competition heats up .
sales rising quickly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the classic soft drink coca-cola achieved dominance throughout the world the discovery and wild popularity of bionade in germany resembles an economic miracle .
according to wolfgang blum , co-partner of the bionade international corporation , the company filled up 2 million bottles in 2003 .
in subsequent years , it enjoyed an annual growth of 300 percent .
and this year , bionade plans to produce 200 million bottles , up from 70 million last year .
dieter leopold , the man behind bionade , came up with the idea of making a refreshing organic beverage as an alternative to the popular coca-cola in the 80s .
it took him eight years to complete the formula .
besides malt , bionade is primarily made out of ingredients that are found in honey with added vitamins and minerals .
bionade is brewed naturally in a process similar to that of making beer , except that , in the case of the organic soda , sugar does not convert to alcohol but gluconic acid , instead .
the exact technology , however , remains a trade secret .
in 1996 , the blueberry-flavored bionade - made and bottled in the small family-owned brewery - hit the german market .
with it , leopold not only created a popular drink , but also saved a small family brewery from extinction .
enjoyed by young and old , anywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , bionade has become available everywhere , from cafes to train restaurants today , this ultimate hip drink can be found anywhere in germany - at restaurants , schools or bars alike .
it is available in various exotic , fruity flavors , such as elderberry , litchi and ginger-orange .
from a marketing point of view , bionade does not target any particular group .
" we believe that bionade appeals to everybody , " blum said .
" it is geared towards anybody , ranging from children to adults and the elderly . "
sarah schneider , a college student at the university in cologne is thrilled .
" i always drink bionade in my classes , " schneider said .
" my favorite flavors are elderberry and herbs . "
as with every other successful novel product , imitations of bionade have already appeared on the market .
the company , however , has a zero-tolerance policy for such piggybacking .

hunger for more is pushing the makers of bionade to conquer new markets .
the organic soda will be launched internationally - in the us , canada , spain and ireland .
currently , bionade is also available in italy , france , ireland , benelux and scandinavia .
competition is never far away bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fermented fruity drink is very popular in germany the dominance which bionade enjoyed on the german market , however , is beginning to get challenged by other makers of organic beverages , especially now that the world 's largest brewer , inbey , is jumping on the organic fuzz wagon .
inbev has been selling drinks made of the brazilian guarana plant , so they are already familiar with selling alcohol-free beverages .
despite the competition , however , bionade does not plan to advertise widely abroad .
" our strategy will be the same as in germany , " peter kowalski , manager of bionade corporation , told the daily newspaper der tagesspiegel . " we will let the consumer discover our bionade . "

according to wolfgang blum , co-partner of the bionade international corporation , the company filled up 2 million bottles in 2003 .
in subsequent years , it enjoyed an annual growth of 300 percent .
and this year , bionade plans to produce 200 million bottles , up from 70 million last year .
dieter leopold , the man behind bionade , came up with the idea of making a refreshing organic beverage as an alternative to the popular coca-cola in the 80s .
it took him eight years to complete the formula .
besides malt , bionade is primarily made out of ingredients that are found in honey with added vitamins and minerals .
bionade is brewed naturally in a process similar to that of making beer , except that , in the case of the organic soda , sugar does not convert to alcohol but gluconic acid , instead .
the exact technology , however , remains a trade secret .
in 1996 , the blueberry-flavored bionade - made and bottled in the small family-owned brewery - hit the german market .
with it , leopold not only created a popular drink , but also saved a small family brewery from extinction .
enjoyed by young and old , anywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , bionade has become available everywhere , from cafes to train restaurants today , this ultimate hip drink can be found anywhere in germany - at restaurants , schools or bars alike .
it is available in various exotic , fruity flavors , such as elderberry , litchi and ginger-orange .
from a marketing point of view , bionade does not target any particular group .
" we believe that bionade appeals to everybody , " blum said .
" it is geared towards anybody , ranging from children to adults and the elderly . "
sarah schneider , a college student at the university in cologne is thrilled .
" i always drink bionade in my classes , " schneider said .

with its eu entrance , things changed .
in some industries , the wage entitlements are rising , and there is a deficiency of skilled labor . the fashion boutique rollmann is situated in downtown sofia , the capital of bulgaria , and it is one of the best stores for men 's and women 's outerwear in the area .
the store has branches in four other bulgarian cities , as well as in greece and macedonia . the german bertram rollmann , who trained to be a toolmaker , has been attracting the bulgarian fashionistas for the past 13 years .
he began virtually at the bottom , in 1993 . " i found 25 young bulgarians , whom i sent to a special nine-month training to greece and germany , " he said .
with the same people , he began to develop a manufacture in 1994 . profitable virgin land bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of rollmann 's boutiques is located in downtown sofia rollmann first opened a small tailor shop in gotse delchev , a small town in southern bulgaria .
he began to manufacture for the german market , which is still his main market today .
trading in switzerland , france , turkey and greece followed . " for the german investors , bulgaria was a virgin land in 1993 , " rollmann said .
" then , i was managing a company in greece , through which i put the investment into the company in bulgaria , and i came to realize that bulgaria was good as headquarters , and it developed very well , " he said . the german entrepreneur can indeed be very satisfied - 650.000 men 's suits are yearly delivered from " pirintex , " his company in gotse delchev .
the number of employees has considerably risen , going from 25 in 1994 , to 2350 employees and skilled laborers . outstanding wage wars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with its low wages , bulgaria was a profitable country for foreign investors rollmann is afraid that the requirements for foreign investors in bulgaria are going to change now that the country is a member of the eu .
he is expecting many amendments in the next few years , especially in the area of wages . " i hope that the corrections are modest , so that the young business association can stem the wage and price evolution , " he said . the first wage war has already occurred .
at the beginning of june , rollmann 's employees in gotse delchev went on strike .
the labor union asked for a wage increase of 100 levs -lrb- 50 euros -rrb- , which is an increase of 40 percent . the management declined it , calling the union demands unacceptable . after 21 days on strike , rollmann and the strike committee agreed on a compromising solution .
the wages were increased by 80 levs , and the employees agreed to introduce improvements , such as more vacationing days and more money for overtime and nightly work . mecca for craftsmen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu membership drastically change bulgarian concepts of trade and industry ?
with the wage increases , rollmann became worried about the ability to be compatible , because the prices of his products had to rise as well .
he also worried about the availability of a qualified work force . in the next 15 to 20 years , various types of professionals in bulgaria will die out , and there is no controlled educational system for skill-based professions . every company educates their workers depending on their own demands . " there are no industry-standards that go through a central organization , such as the board of industry and trade in germany , which promote the technological and creative development of an industry , and push it forward . " the old master craftsmen are slowly retiring and the young people are not educated in any skill-based profession .
according to rollmann , it is a problem that could be solved , if from now on , the influx of a qualified work force changed directions . " there would be many opportunities for german and northern european craftsmen to settle in bulgaria and through their qualification and specialization contribute to the exchange of technology and the know-how . " rollmann himself can influence the reversal of the migrant storms in europe : he is the new elected president of the german-bulgarian board of industry and trade in sofia . roumania taslakowa -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hunger for more is pushing the makers of bionade to conquer new markets .

competition is never far away bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fermented fruity drink is very popular in germany the dominance which bionade enjoyed on the german market , however , is beginning to get challenged by other makers of organic beverages , especially now that the world 's largest brewer , inbey , is jumping on the organic fuzz wagon .
inbev has been selling drinks made of the brazilian guarana plant , so they are already familiar with selling alcohol-free beverages .
despite the competition , however , bionade does not plan to advertise widely abroad .
" our strategy will be the same as in germany , " peter kowalski , manager of bionade corporation , told the daily newspaper der tagesspiegel . " we will let the consumer discover our bionade . "

it took him eight years to complete the formula .
besides malt , bionade is primarily made out of ingredients that are found in honey with added vitamins and minerals .
bionade is brewed naturally in a process similar to that of making beer , except that , in the case of the organic soda , sugar does not convert to alcohol but gluconic acid , instead .
the exact technology , however , remains a trade secret .
in 1996 , the blueberry-flavored bionade - made and bottled in the small family-owned brewery - hit the german market .
with it , leopold not only created a popular drink , but also saved a small family brewery from extinction .
enjoyed by young and old , anywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , bionade has become available everywhere , from cafes to train restaurants today , this ultimate hip drink can be found anywhere in germany - at restaurants , schools or bars alike .

hunger for more is pushing the makers of bionade to conquer new markets .
the organic soda will be launched internationally - in the us , canada , spain and ireland .
currently , bionade is also available in italy , france , ireland , benelux and scandinavia .
competition is never far away bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fermented fruity drink is very popular in germany the dominance which bionade enjoyed on the german market , however , is beginning to get challenged by other makers of organic beverages , especially now that the world 's largest brewer , inbey , is jumping on the organic fuzz wagon .
inbev has been selling drinks made of the brazilian guarana plant , so they are already familiar with selling alcohol-free beverages .
despite the competition , however , bionade does not plan to advertise widely abroad .
" our strategy will be the same as in germany , " peter kowalski , manager of bionade corporation , told the daily newspaper der tagesspiegel . " we will let the consumer discover our bionade . "
the company is planning to introduce a new flavor , which is still kept secret , once the competition heats up .
sales rising quickly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the classic soft drink coca-cola achieved dominance throughout the world the discovery and wild popularity of bionade in germany resembles an economic miracle .
according to wolfgang blum , co-partner of the bionade international corporation , the company filled up 2 million bottles in 2003 .
in subsequent years , it enjoyed an annual growth of 300 percent .
and this year , bionade plans to produce 200 million bottles , up from 70 million last year .
dieter leopold , the man behind bionade , came up with the idea of making a refreshing organic beverage as an alternative to the popular coca-cola in the 80s .
it took him eight years to complete the formula .
besides malt , bionade is primarily made out of ingredients that are found in honey with added vitamins and minerals .
bionade is brewed naturally in a process similar to that of making beer , except that , in the case of the organic soda , sugar does not convert to alcohol but gluconic acid , instead .
the exact technology , however , remains a trade secret .
in 1996 , the blueberry-flavored bionade - made and bottled in the small family-owned brewery - hit the german market .
with it , leopold not only created a popular drink , but also saved a small family brewery from extinction .
enjoyed by young and old , anywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , bionade has become available everywhere , from cafes to train restaurants today , this ultimate hip drink can be found anywhere in germany - at restaurants , schools or bars alike .
it is available in various exotic , fruity flavors , such as elderberry , litchi and ginger-orange .
from a marketing point of view , bionade does not target any particular group .
" we believe that bionade appeals to everybody , " blum said .
" it is geared towards anybody , ranging from children to adults and the elderly . "
sarah schneider , a college student at the university in cologne is thrilled .
" i always drink bionade in my classes , " schneider said .
" my favorite flavors are elderberry and herbs . "
as with every other successful novel product , imitations of bionade have already appeared on the market .
the company , however , has a zero-tolerance policy for such piggybacking .

with its eu entrance , things changed .
in some industries , the wage entitlements are rising , and there is a deficiency of skilled labor . the fashion boutique rollmann is situated in downtown sofia , the capital of bulgaria , and it is one of the best stores for men 's and women 's outerwear in the area .
the store has branches in four other bulgarian cities , as well as in greece and macedonia . the german bertram rollmann , who trained to be a toolmaker , has been attracting the bulgarian fashionistas for the past 13 years .
he began virtually at the bottom , in 1993 . " i found 25 young bulgarians , whom i sent to a special nine-month training to greece and germany , " he said .
with the same people , he began to develop a manufacture in 1994 . profitable virgin land bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of rollmann 's boutiques is located in downtown sofia rollmann first opened a small tailor shop in gotse delchev , a small town in southern bulgaria .
he began to manufacture for the german market , which is still his main market today .
trading in switzerland , france , turkey and greece followed . " for the german investors , bulgaria was a virgin land in 1993 , " rollmann said .
" then , i was managing a company in greece , through which i put the investment into the company in bulgaria , and i came to realize that bulgaria was good as headquarters , and it developed very well , " he said . the german entrepreneur can indeed be very satisfied - 650.000 men 's suits are yearly delivered from " pirintex , " his company in gotse delchev .
the number of employees has considerably risen , going from 25 in 1994 , to 2350 employees and skilled laborers . outstanding wage wars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with its low wages , bulgaria was a profitable country for foreign investors rollmann is afraid that the requirements for foreign investors in bulgaria are going to change now that the country is a member of the eu .
he is expecting many amendments in the next few years , especially in the area of wages . " i hope that the corrections are modest , so that the young business association can stem the wage and price evolution , " he said . the first wage war has already occurred .
at the beginning of june , rollmann 's employees in gotse delchev went on strike .
the labor union asked for a wage increase of 100 levs -lrb- 50 euros -rrb- , which is an increase of 40 percent . the management declined it , calling the union demands unacceptable . after 21 days on strike , rollmann and the strike committee agreed on a compromising solution .
the wages were increased by 80 levs , and the employees agreed to introduce improvements , such as more vacationing days and more money for overtime and nightly work . mecca for craftsmen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu membership drastically change bulgarian concepts of trade and industry ?
with the wage increases , rollmann became worried about the ability to be compatible , because the prices of his products had to rise as well .
he also worried about the availability of a qualified work force . in the next 15 to 20 years , various types of professionals in bulgaria will die out , and there is no controlled educational system for skill-based professions . every company educates their workers depending on their own demands . " there are no industry-standards that go through a central organization , such as the board of industry and trade in germany , which promote the technological and creative development of an industry , and push it forward . " the old master craftsmen are slowly retiring and the young people are not educated in any skill-based profession .
according to rollmann , it is a problem that could be solved , if from now on , the influx of a qualified work force changed directions . " there would be many opportunities for german and northern european craftsmen to settle in bulgaria and through their qualification and specialization contribute to the exchange of technology and the know-how . " rollmann himself can influence the reversal of the migrant storms in europe : he is the new elected president of the german-bulgarian board of industry and trade in sofia . roumania taslakowa -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but instead of pools and picnics , germans are searching out indoor attractions that normally attract a winter crowd . while rain clouds and falling temperatures have left sunbathers , beer garden enthusiasts and grill experts with a mild case of withdrawal , spa lovers , museum aficionados and moviegoers have had to put up with longer lines and more crowded facilities this summer . the summer so far has been as successful for tourism as last year , but vacationers have been headed to places that usually get more visitors during the winter , said nicole habrich , director of press and public relations for the german tourism association . " it is to assume that museums and other bad-weather-friendly areas had a larger then previous year 's number of guests , " she said . unlike last year , when germans were taking spontaneous trips to the north and baltic seas or traveling around the country to follow world cup teams , big cities - and their indoor attractions - are high on this year 's list of summer destinations . unusual summer activities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite a balmy summer afternoon arne schmidt , a spokesperson for cinemaxx movie theaters , said more people are going to the movies than last year .

the temperatures throughout the nation were 3 degrees celsius -lrb- 5.4 degrees f -rrb- higher than average . but when summer officially arrived , the heat plunged and early tans faded from bronze to orange with germans unwilling to go without some sort of summer glow . tanning studios noticed an increase of about 15 to 25 percent this summer , compared to last year 's , according to beatrix heimann , ayk sonnenstudios . germans are seeking warmth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spa visits offer enjoyment , regardless of the weather spa providers also saw a boost of visitors in 2007 's colder summer months . the claudius wellness spa in cologne noted a 20 percent visitor increase in the month of june , while the warm april brought a 25 percent decrease , according to manager simon nothhelfer . " spas are very much dependant on the weather , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 18.08.2007 bionade : riding the wave of success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bionade is considered healthy , hip and fun : it 's the german " anti-coke " so to speak a unique organic drink , produced by a small family-operated brewery in bavaria , has become the new trend in the world of refreshing drinks : it is now marketed internationally , while expanding on the home market as well . germany 's hip soda drink recently bonded with mcdonald 's ' mccafe to become one of the novel products that the international chain will introduce as part of their new and healthier approach to fast food .
hunger for more is pushing the makers of bionade to conquer new markets .
the organic soda will be launched internationally - in the us , canada , spain and ireland .
currently , bionade is also available in italy , france , ireland , benelux and scandinavia .
competition is never far away bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fermented fruity drink is very popular in germany the dominance which bionade enjoyed on the german market , however , is beginning to get challenged by other makers of organic beverages , especially now that the world 's largest brewer , inbey , is jumping on the organic fuzz wagon .
inbev has been selling drinks made of the brazilian guarana plant , so they are already familiar with selling alcohol-free beverages .
despite the competition , however , bionade does not plan to advertise widely abroad .
" our strategy will be the same as in germany , " peter kowalski , manager of bionade corporation , told the daily newspaper der tagesspiegel . " we will let the consumer discover our bionade . "
the company is planning to introduce a new flavor , which is still kept secret , once the competition heats up .
sales rising quickly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the classic soft drink coca-cola achieved dominance throughout the world the discovery and wild popularity of bionade in germany resembles an economic miracle .
according to wolfgang blum , co-partner of the bionade international corporation , the company filled up 2 million bottles in 2003 .
in subsequent years , it enjoyed an annual growth of 300 percent .
and this year , bionade plans to produce 200 million bottles , up from 70 million last year .
dieter leopold , the man behind bionade , came up with the idea of making a refreshing organic beverage as an alternative to the popular coca-cola in the 80s .
it took him eight years to complete the formula .
besides malt , bionade is primarily made out of ingredients that are found in honey with added vitamins and minerals .
bionade is brewed naturally in a process similar to that of making beer , except that , in the case of the organic soda , sugar does not convert to alcohol but gluconic acid , instead .
the exact technology , however , remains a trade secret .
in 1996 , the blueberry-flavored bionade - made and bottled in the small family-owned brewery - hit the german market .
with it , leopold not only created a popular drink , but also saved a small family brewery from extinction .
enjoyed by young and old , anywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , bionade has become available everywhere , from cafes to train restaurants today , this ultimate hip drink can be found anywhere in germany - at restaurants , schools or bars alike .
it is available in various exotic , fruity flavors , such as elderberry , litchi and ginger-orange .
from a marketing point of view , bionade does not target any particular group .
" we believe that bionade appeals to everybody , " blum said .
" it is geared towards anybody , ranging from children to adults and the elderly . "
sarah schneider , a college student at the university in cologne is thrilled .
" i always drink bionade in my classes , " schneider said .
" my favorite flavors are elderberry and herbs . "
as with every other successful novel product , imitations of bionade have already appeared on the market .
the company , however , has a zero-tolerance policy for such piggybacking . " we will take to court anybody that comes out with a product that looks even slightly like a bionade imitation , " kowalski said . dw staff -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but instead of pools and picnics , germans are searching out indoor attractions that normally attract a winter crowd . while rain clouds and falling temperatures have left sunbathers , beer garden enthusiasts and grill experts with a mild case of withdrawal , spa lovers , museum aficionados and moviegoers have had to put up with longer lines and more crowded facilities this summer . the summer so far has been as successful for tourism as last year , but vacationers have been headed to places that usually get more visitors during the winter , said nicole habrich , director of press and public relations for the german tourism association . " it is to assume that museums and other bad-weather-friendly areas had a larger then previous year 's number of guests , " she said . unlike last year , when germans were taking spontaneous trips to the north and baltic seas or traveling around the country to follow world cup teams , big cities - and their indoor attractions - are high on this year 's list of summer destinations . unusual summer activities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite a balmy summer afternoon arne schmidt , a spokesperson for cinemaxx movie theaters , said more people are going to the movies than last year . " when the weather is extremely good , the number of visitors in our theaters declines , " he said , adding that he a better selection of blockbusters was at least partly responsible for increased ticket sales . the beginning of the year actually showed potential for germany ' sun-starved population .
the period between june 2006 and may 2007 was the warmest 12-month period since records began being kept in 1893 .
the temperatures throughout the nation were 3 degrees celsius -lrb- 5.4 degrees f -rrb- higher than average . but when summer officially arrived , the heat plunged and early tans faded from bronze to orange with germans unwilling to go without some sort of summer glow . tanning studios noticed an increase of about 15 to 25 percent this summer , compared to last year 's , according to beatrix heimann , ayk sonnenstudios . germans are seeking warmth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spa visits offer enjoyment , regardless of the weather spa providers also saw a boost of visitors in 2007 's colder summer months . the claudius wellness spa in cologne noted a 20 percent visitor increase in the month of june , while the warm april brought a 25 percent decrease , according to manager simon nothhelfer . " spas are very much dependant on the weather , " he said .
" we sell warmth , and that 's what people needed this summer . " a foreign search for the sun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans wanted a tan any way they could get it those who did travel to escape german weather turned to the beloved spanish island of mallorca .
this summer about 5 percent more germans visited the island compared to last year , volker böttcher , director of the travel agency tui , said at a press conference . italy was second among road trip destinations , according to the adac , germany 's largest automobile club . online travel agency expedia.de found that many germans were traveling farther to places including oman and vietnam in an anxious search for the sun . tina pandza send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with its eu entrance , things changed .
in some industries , the wage entitlements are rising , and there is a deficiency of skilled labor . the fashion boutique rollmann is situated in downtown sofia , the capital of bulgaria , and it is one of the best stores for men 's and women 's outerwear in the area .
the store has branches in four other bulgarian cities , as well as in greece and macedonia . the german bertram rollmann , who trained to be a toolmaker , has been attracting the bulgarian fashionistas for the past 13 years .
he began virtually at the bottom , in 1993 . " i found 25 young bulgarians , whom i sent to a special nine-month training to greece and germany , " he said .
with the same people , he began to develop a manufacture in 1994 . profitable virgin land bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of rollmann 's boutiques is located in downtown sofia rollmann first opened a small tailor shop in gotse delchev , a small town in southern bulgaria .
he began to manufacture for the german market , which is still his main market today .
trading in switzerland , france , turkey and greece followed . " for the german investors , bulgaria was a virgin land in 1993 , " rollmann said .
" then , i was managing a company in greece , through which i put the investment into the company in bulgaria , and i came to realize that bulgaria was good as headquarters , and it developed very well , " he said . the german entrepreneur can indeed be very satisfied - 650.000 men 's suits are yearly delivered from " pirintex , " his company in gotse delchev .
the number of employees has considerably risen , going from 25 in 1994 , to 2350 employees and skilled laborers . outstanding wage wars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with its low wages , bulgaria was a profitable country for foreign investors rollmann is afraid that the requirements for foreign investors in bulgaria are going to change now that the country is a member of the eu .
he is expecting many amendments in the next few years , especially in the area of wages . " i hope that the corrections are modest , so that the young business association can stem the wage and price evolution , " he said . the first wage war has already occurred .
at the beginning of june , rollmann 's employees in gotse delchev went on strike .
the labor union asked for a wage increase of 100 levs -lrb- 50 euros -rrb- , which is an increase of 40 percent . the management declined it , calling the union demands unacceptable . after 21 days on strike , rollmann and the strike committee agreed on a compromising solution .
the wages were increased by 80 levs , and the employees agreed to introduce improvements , such as more vacationing days and more money for overtime and nightly work . mecca for craftsmen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu membership drastically change bulgarian concepts of trade and industry ?
with the wage increases , rollmann became worried about the ability to be compatible , because the prices of his products had to rise as well .
he also worried about the availability of a qualified work force . in the next 15 to 20 years , various types of professionals in bulgaria will die out , and there is no controlled educational system for skill-based professions . every company educates their workers depending on their own demands . " there are no industry-standards that go through a central organization , such as the board of industry and trade in germany , which promote the technological and creative development of an industry , and push it forward . " the old master craftsmen are slowly retiring and the young people are not educated in any skill-based profession .
according to rollmann , it is a problem that could be solved , if from now on , the influx of a qualified work force changed directions . " there would be many opportunities for german and northern european craftsmen to settle in bulgaria and through their qualification and specialization contribute to the exchange of technology and the know-how . " rollmann himself can influence the reversal of the migrant storms in europe : he is the new elected president of the german-bulgarian board of industry and trade in sofia . roumania taslakowa -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but instead of pools and picnics , germans are searching out indoor attractions that normally attract a winter crowd . while rain clouds and falling temperatures have left sunbathers , beer garden enthusiasts and grill experts with a mild case of withdrawal , spa lovers , museum aficionados and moviegoers have had to put up with longer lines and more crowded facilities this summer . the summer so far has been as successful for tourism as last year , but vacationers have been headed to places that usually get more visitors during the winter , said nicole habrich , director of press and public relations for the german tourism association . " it is to assume that museums and other bad-weather-friendly areas had a larger then previous year 's number of guests , " she said . unlike last year , when germans were taking spontaneous trips to the north and baltic seas or traveling around the country to follow world cup teams , big cities - and their indoor attractions - are high on this year 's list of summer destinations . unusual summer activities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite a balmy summer afternoon arne schmidt , a spokesperson for cinemaxx movie theaters , said more people are going to the movies than last year . " when the weather is extremely good , the number of visitors in our theaters declines , " he said , adding that he a better selection of blockbusters was at least partly responsible for increased ticket sales . the beginning of the year actually showed potential for germany ' sun-starved population .
the period between june 2006 and may 2007 was the warmest 12-month period since records began being kept in 1893 .
the temperatures throughout the nation were 3 degrees celsius -lrb- 5.4 degrees f -rrb- higher than average . but when summer officially arrived , the heat plunged and early tans faded from bronze to orange with germans unwilling to go without some sort of summer glow . tanning studios noticed an increase of about 15 to 25 percent this summer , compared to last year 's , according to beatrix heimann , ayk sonnenstudios . germans are seeking warmth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spa visits offer enjoyment , regardless of the weather spa providers also saw a boost of visitors in 2007 's colder summer months . the claudius wellness spa in cologne noted a 20 percent visitor increase in the month of june , while the warm april brought a 25 percent decrease , according to manager simon nothhelfer . " spas are very much dependant on the weather , " he said .
" we sell warmth , and that 's what people needed this summer . " a foreign search for the sun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans wanted a tan any way they could get it those who did travel to escape german weather turned to the beloved spanish island of mallorca .
this summer about 5 percent more germans visited the island compared to last year , volker böttcher , director of the travel agency tui , said at a press conference . italy was second among road trip destinations , according to the adac , germany 's largest automobile club . online travel agency expedia.de found that many germans were traveling farther to places including oman and vietnam in an anxious search for the sun . tina pandza send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is expecting many amendments in the next few years , especially in the area of wages . " i hope that the corrections are modest , so that the young business association can stem the wage and price evolution , " he said . the first wage war has already occurred .
at the beginning of june , rollmann 's employees in gotse delchev went on strike .
the labor union asked for a wage increase of 100 levs -lrb- 50 euros -rrb- , which is an increase of 40 percent . the management declined it , calling the union demands unacceptable . after 21 days on strike , rollmann and the strike committee agreed on a compromising solution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 18.08.2007 bionade : riding the wave of success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bionade is considered healthy , hip and fun : it 's the german " anti-coke " so to speak a unique organic drink , produced by a small family-operated brewery in bavaria , has become the new trend in the world of refreshing drinks : it is now marketed internationally , while expanding on the home market as well . germany 's hip soda drink recently bonded with mcdonald 's ' mccafe to become one of the novel products that the international chain will introduce as part of their new and healthier approach to fast food .
hunger for more is pushing the makers of bionade to conquer new markets .
the organic soda will be launched internationally - in the us , canada , spain and ireland .
currently , bionade is also available in italy , france , ireland , benelux and scandinavia .
competition is never far away bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fermented fruity drink is very popular in germany the dominance which bionade enjoyed on the german market , however , is beginning to get challenged by other makers of organic beverages , especially now that the world 's largest brewer , inbey , is jumping on the organic fuzz wagon .
inbev has been selling drinks made of the brazilian guarana plant , so they are already familiar with selling alcohol-free beverages .
despite the competition , however , bionade does not plan to advertise widely abroad .
" our strategy will be the same as in germany , " peter kowalski , manager of bionade corporation , told the daily newspaper der tagesspiegel . " we will let the consumer discover our bionade . "
the company is planning to introduce a new flavor , which is still kept secret , once the competition heats up .
sales rising quickly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the classic soft drink coca-cola achieved dominance throughout the world the discovery and wild popularity of bionade in germany resembles an economic miracle .
according to wolfgang blum , co-partner of the bionade international corporation , the company filled up 2 million bottles in 2003 .
in subsequent years , it enjoyed an annual growth of 300 percent .
and this year , bionade plans to produce 200 million bottles , up from 70 million last year .
dieter leopold , the man behind bionade , came up with the idea of making a refreshing organic beverage as an alternative to the popular coca-cola in the 80s .
it took him eight years to complete the formula .
besides malt , bionade is primarily made out of ingredients that are found in honey with added vitamins and minerals .
bionade is brewed naturally in a process similar to that of making beer , except that , in the case of the organic soda , sugar does not convert to alcohol but gluconic acid , instead .
the exact technology , however , remains a trade secret .
in 1996 , the blueberry-flavored bionade - made and bottled in the small family-owned brewery - hit the german market .
with it , leopold not only created a popular drink , but also saved a small family brewery from extinction .
enjoyed by young and old , anywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , bionade has become available everywhere , from cafes to train restaurants today , this ultimate hip drink can be found anywhere in germany - at restaurants , schools or bars alike .
it is available in various exotic , fruity flavors , such as elderberry , litchi and ginger-orange .
from a marketing point of view , bionade does not target any particular group .
" we believe that bionade appeals to everybody , " blum said .
" it is geared towards anybody , ranging from children to adults and the elderly . "
sarah schneider , a college student at the university in cologne is thrilled .
" i always drink bionade in my classes , " schneider said .
" my favorite flavors are elderberry and herbs . "
as with every other successful novel product , imitations of bionade have already appeared on the market .
the company , however , has a zero-tolerance policy for such piggybacking . " we will take to court anybody that comes out with a product that looks even slightly like a bionade imitation , " kowalski said . dw staff -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 18.08.2007 bionade : riding the wave of success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bionade is considered healthy , hip and fun : it 's the german " anti-coke " so to speak a unique organic drink , produced by a small family-operated brewery in bavaria , has become the new trend in the world of refreshing drinks : it is now marketed internationally , while expanding on the home market as well . germany 's hip soda drink recently bonded with mcdonald 's ' mccafe to become one of the novel products that the international chain will introduce as part of their new and healthier approach to fast food .
hunger for more is pushing the makers of bionade to conquer new markets .
the organic soda will be launched internationally - in the us , canada , spain and ireland .
currently , bionade is also available in italy , france , ireland , benelux and scandinavia .
competition is never far away bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fermented fruity drink is very popular in germany the dominance which bionade enjoyed on the german market , however , is beginning to get challenged by other makers of organic beverages , especially now that the world 's largest brewer , inbey , is jumping on the organic fuzz wagon .
inbev has been selling drinks made of the brazilian guarana plant , so they are already familiar with selling alcohol-free beverages .
despite the competition , however , bionade does not plan to advertise widely abroad .
" our strategy will be the same as in germany , " peter kowalski , manager of bionade corporation , told the daily newspaper der tagesspiegel . " we will let the consumer discover our bionade . "
the company is planning to introduce a new flavor , which is still kept secret , once the competition heats up .
sales rising quickly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the classic soft drink coca-cola achieved dominance throughout the world the discovery and wild popularity of bionade in germany resembles an economic miracle .
according to wolfgang blum , co-partner of the bionade international corporation , the company filled up 2 million bottles in 2003 .
in subsequent years , it enjoyed an annual growth of 300 percent .
and this year , bionade plans to produce 200 million bottles , up from 70 million last year .
dieter leopold , the man behind bionade , came up with the idea of making a refreshing organic beverage as an alternative to the popular coca-cola in the 80s .
it took him eight years to complete the formula .
besides malt , bionade is primarily made out of ingredients that are found in honey with added vitamins and minerals .
bionade is brewed naturally in a process similar to that of making beer , except that , in the case of the organic soda , sugar does not convert to alcohol but gluconic acid , instead .
the exact technology , however , remains a trade secret .
in 1996 , the blueberry-flavored bionade - made and bottled in the small family-owned brewery - hit the german market .
with it , leopold not only created a popular drink , but also saved a small family brewery from extinction .
enjoyed by young and old , anywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , bionade has become available everywhere , from cafes to train restaurants today , this ultimate hip drink can be found anywhere in germany - at restaurants , schools or bars alike .
it is available in various exotic , fruity flavors , such as elderberry , litchi and ginger-orange .
from a marketing point of view , bionade does not target any particular group .
" we believe that bionade appeals to everybody , " blum said .
" it is geared towards anybody , ranging from children to adults and the elderly . "
sarah schneider , a college student at the university in cologne is thrilled .
" i always drink bionade in my classes , " schneider said .
" my favorite flavors are elderberry and herbs . "
as with every other successful novel product , imitations of bionade have already appeared on the market .
the company , however , has a zero-tolerance policy for such piggybacking . " we will take to court anybody that comes out with a product that looks even slightly like a bionade imitation , " kowalski said . dw staff -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hunger for more is pushing the makers of bionade to conquer new markets .
the organic soda will be launched internationally - in the us , canada , spain and ireland .
currently , bionade is also available in italy , france , ireland , benelux and scandinavia .
competition is never far away bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fermented fruity drink is very popular in germany the dominance which bionade enjoyed on the german market , however , is beginning to get challenged by other makers of organic beverages , especially now that the world 's largest brewer , inbey , is jumping on the organic fuzz wagon .
inbev has been selling drinks made of the brazilian guarana plant , so they are already familiar with selling alcohol-free beverages .
despite the competition , however , bionade does not plan to advertise widely abroad .
" our strategy will be the same as in germany , " peter kowalski , manager of bionade corporation , told the daily newspaper der tagesspiegel . " we will let the consumer discover our bionade . "

bionade is brewed naturally in a process similar to that of making beer , except that , in the case of the organic soda , sugar does not convert to alcohol but gluconic acid , instead .
the exact technology , however , remains a trade secret .
in 1996 , the blueberry-flavored bionade - made and bottled in the small family-owned brewery - hit the german market .
with it , leopold not only created a popular drink , but also saved a small family brewery from extinction .

the store has branches in four other bulgarian cities , as well as in greece and macedonia . the german bertram rollmann , who trained to be a toolmaker , has been attracting the bulgarian fashionistas for the past 13 years .
he began virtually at the bottom , in 1993 . " i found 25 young bulgarians , whom i sent to a special nine-month training to greece and germany , " he said .
with the same people , he began to develop a manufacture in 1994 . profitable virgin land bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of rollmann 's boutiques is located in downtown sofia rollmann first opened a small tailor shop in gotse delchev , a small town in southern bulgaria .
he began to manufacture for the german market , which is still his main market today .
trading in switzerland , france , turkey and greece followed . " for the german investors , bulgaria was a virgin land in 1993 , " rollmann said .
" then , i was managing a company in greece , through which i put the investment into the company in bulgaria , and i came to realize that bulgaria was good as headquarters , and it developed very well , " he said . the german entrepreneur can indeed be very satisfied - 650.000 men 's suits are yearly delivered from " pirintex , " his company in gotse delchev .
the number of employees has considerably risen , going from 25 in 1994 , to 2350 employees and skilled laborers . outstanding wage wars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with its low wages , bulgaria was a profitable country for foreign investors rollmann is afraid that the requirements for foreign investors in bulgaria are going to change now that the country is a member of the eu .
he is expecting many amendments in the next few years , especially in the area of wages . " i hope that the corrections are modest , so that the young business association can stem the wage and price evolution , " he said . the first wage war has already occurred .
at the beginning of june , rollmann 's employees in gotse delchev went on strike .
the labor union asked for a wage increase of 100 levs -lrb- 50 euros -rrb- , which is an increase of 40 percent . the management declined it , calling the union demands unacceptable . after 21 days on strike , rollmann and the strike committee agreed on a compromising solution .
the wages were increased by 80 levs , and the employees agreed to introduce improvements , such as more vacationing days and more money for overtime and nightly work . mecca for craftsmen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu membership drastically change bulgarian concepts of trade and industry ?
with the wage increases , rollmann became worried about the ability to be compatible , because the prices of his products had to rise as well .
he also worried about the availability of a qualified work force . in the next 15 to 20 years , various types of professionals in bulgaria will die out , and there is no controlled educational system for skill-based professions . every company educates their workers depending on their own demands . " there are no industry-standards that go through a central organization , such as the board of industry and trade in germany , which promote the technological and creative development of an industry , and push it forward . " the old master craftsmen are slowly retiring and the young people are not educated in any skill-based profession .
according to rollmann , it is a problem that could be solved , if from now on , the influx of a qualified work force changed directions . " there would be many opportunities for german and northern european craftsmen to settle in bulgaria and through their qualification and specialization contribute to the exchange of technology and the know-how . " rollmann himself can influence the reversal of the migrant storms in europe : he is the new elected president of the german-bulgarian board of industry and trade in sofia . roumania taslakowa -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the wages were increased by 80 levs , and the employees agreed to introduce improvements , such as more vacationing days and more money for overtime and nightly work . mecca for craftsmen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu membership drastically change bulgarian concepts of trade and industry ?
with the wage increases , rollmann became worried about the ability to be compatible , because the prices of his products had to rise as well .
he also worried about the availability of a qualified work force . in the next 15 to 20 years , various types of professionals in bulgaria will die out , and there is no controlled educational system for skill-based professions . every company educates their workers depending on their own demands . " there are no industry-standards that go through a central organization , such as the board of industry and trade in germany , which promote the technological and creative development of an industry , and push it forward . " the old master craftsmen are slowly retiring and the young people are not educated in any skill-based profession .
according to rollmann , it is a problem that could be solved , if from now on , the influx of a qualified work force changed directions . " there would be many opportunities for german and northern european craftsmen to settle in bulgaria and through their qualification and specialization contribute to the exchange of technology and the know-how .

with its eu entrance , things changed .
in some industries , the wage entitlements are rising , and there is a deficiency of skilled labor . the fashion boutique rollmann is situated in downtown sofia , the capital of bulgaria , and it is one of the best stores for men 's and women 's outerwear in the area .
the store has branches in four other bulgarian cities , as well as in greece and macedonia . the german bertram rollmann , who trained to be a toolmaker , has been attracting the bulgarian fashionistas for the past 13 years .
he began virtually at the bottom , in 1993 . " i found 25 young bulgarians , whom i sent to a special nine-month training to greece and germany , " he said .
with the same people , he began to develop a manufacture in 1994 . profitable virgin land bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of rollmann 's boutiques is located in downtown sofia rollmann first opened a small tailor shop in gotse delchev , a small town in southern bulgaria .
he began to manufacture for the german market , which is still his main market today .
trading in switzerland , france , turkey and greece followed . " for the german investors , bulgaria was a virgin land in 1993 , " rollmann said .
" then , i was managing a company in greece , through which i put the investment into the company in bulgaria , and i came to realize that bulgaria was good as headquarters , and it developed very well , " he said . the german entrepreneur can indeed be very satisfied - 650.000 men 's suits are yearly delivered from " pirintex , " his company in gotse delchev .
the number of employees has considerably risen , going from 25 in 1994 , to 2350 employees and skilled laborers . outstanding wage wars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with its low wages , bulgaria was a profitable country for foreign investors rollmann is afraid that the requirements for foreign investors in bulgaria are going to change now that the country is a member of the eu .
he is expecting many amendments in the next few years , especially in the area of wages . " i hope that the corrections are modest , so that the young business association can stem the wage and price evolution , " he said . the first wage war has already occurred .
at the beginning of june , rollmann 's employees in gotse delchev went on strike .
the labor union asked for a wage increase of 100 levs -lrb- 50 euros -rrb- , which is an increase of 40 percent . the management declined it , calling the union demands unacceptable . after 21 days on strike , rollmann and the strike committee agreed on a compromising solution .

hunger for more is pushing the makers of bionade to conquer new markets .
the organic soda will be launched internationally - in the us , canada , spain and ireland .
currently , bionade is also available in italy , france , ireland , benelux and scandinavia .
competition is never far away bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fermented fruity drink is very popular in germany the dominance which bionade enjoyed on the german market , however , is beginning to get challenged by other makers of organic beverages , especially now that the world 's largest brewer , inbey , is jumping on the organic fuzz wagon .
inbev has been selling drinks made of the brazilian guarana plant , so they are already familiar with selling alcohol-free beverages .
despite the competition , however , bionade does not plan to advertise widely abroad .
" our strategy will be the same as in germany , " peter kowalski , manager of bionade corporation , told the daily newspaper der tagesspiegel . " we will let the consumer discover our bionade . "
the company is planning to introduce a new flavor , which is still kept secret , once the competition heats up .
sales rising quickly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the classic soft drink coca-cola achieved dominance throughout the world the discovery and wild popularity of bionade in germany resembles an economic miracle .
according to wolfgang blum , co-partner of the bionade international corporation , the company filled up 2 million bottles in 2003 .
in subsequent years , it enjoyed an annual growth of 300 percent .
and this year , bionade plans to produce 200 million bottles , up from 70 million last year .
dieter leopold , the man behind bionade , came up with the idea of making a refreshing organic beverage as an alternative to the popular coca-cola in the 80s .
it took him eight years to complete the formula .
besides malt , bionade is primarily made out of ingredients that are found in honey with added vitamins and minerals .
bionade is brewed naturally in a process similar to that of making beer , except that , in the case of the organic soda , sugar does not convert to alcohol but gluconic acid , instead .
the exact technology , however , remains a trade secret .
in 1996 , the blueberry-flavored bionade - made and bottled in the small family-owned brewery - hit the german market .
with it , leopold not only created a popular drink , but also saved a small family brewery from extinction .
enjoyed by young and old , anywhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , bionade has become available everywhere , from cafes to train restaurants today , this ultimate hip drink can be found anywhere in germany - at restaurants , schools or bars alike .
it is available in various exotic , fruity flavors , such as elderberry , litchi and ginger-orange .
from a marketing point of view , bionade does not target any particular group .
" we believe that bionade appeals to everybody , " blum said .
" it is geared towards anybody , ranging from children to adults and the elderly . "
sarah schneider , a college student at the university in cologne is thrilled .
" i always drink bionade in my classes , " schneider said .
" my favorite flavors are elderberry and herbs . "
as with every other successful novel product , imitations of bionade have already appeared on the market .
the company , however , has a zero-tolerance policy for such piggybacking . " we will take to court anybody that comes out with a product that looks even slightly like a bionade imitation , " kowalski said . dw staff -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but instead of pools and picnics , germans are searching out indoor attractions that normally attract a winter crowd . while rain clouds and falling temperatures have left sunbathers , beer garden enthusiasts and grill experts with a mild case of withdrawal , spa lovers , museum aficionados and moviegoers have had to put up with longer lines and more crowded facilities this summer . the summer so far has been as successful for tourism as last year , but vacationers have been headed to places that usually get more visitors during the winter , said nicole habrich , director of press and public relations for the german tourism association . " it is to assume that museums and other bad-weather-friendly areas had a larger then previous year 's number of guests , " she said . unlike last year , when germans were taking spontaneous trips to the north and baltic seas or traveling around the country to follow world cup teams , big cities - and their indoor attractions - are high on this year 's list of summer destinations . unusual summer activities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite a balmy summer afternoon arne schmidt , a spokesperson for cinemaxx movie theaters , said more people are going to the movies than last year . " when the weather is extremely good , the number of visitors in our theaters declines , " he said , adding that he a better selection of blockbusters was at least partly responsible for increased ticket sales . the beginning of the year actually showed potential for germany ' sun-starved population .
the period between june 2006 and may 2007 was the warmest 12-month period since records began being kept in 1893 .
the temperatures throughout the nation were 3 degrees celsius -lrb- 5.4 degrees f -rrb- higher than average . but when summer officially arrived , the heat plunged and early tans faded from bronze to orange with germans unwilling to go without some sort of summer glow . tanning studios noticed an increase of about 15 to 25 percent this summer , compared to last year 's , according to beatrix heimann , ayk sonnenstudios . germans are seeking warmth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spa visits offer enjoyment , regardless of the weather spa providers also saw a boost of visitors in 2007 's colder summer months . the claudius wellness spa in cologne noted a 20 percent visitor increase in the month of june , while the warm april brought a 25 percent decrease , according to manager simon nothhelfer . " spas are very much dependant on the weather , " he said .
" we sell warmth , and that 's what people needed this summer . " a foreign search for the sun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans wanted a tan any way they could get it those who did travel to escape german weather turned to the beloved spanish island of mallorca .
this summer about 5 percent more germans visited the island compared to last year , volker böttcher , director of the travel agency tui , said at a press conference . italy was second among road trip destinations , according to the adac , germany 's largest automobile club . online travel agency expedia.de found that many germans were traveling farther to places including oman and vietnam in an anxious search for the sun . tina pandza send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the next year and a half , more than two million borrowers may be in for a nasty shock when they come to the end of short-term fixed-rate deals taken out when rates were low back in 2005 and 2006 .
considering how much interest rates have risen since then , when these consumers come to remortgage , they may face much higher monthly payments .
the government believes one way to avoid this kind of volatility would be if more of us took out longer term fixed rate mortgages .
we asked for your comments , a selection of which are below .
this debate is now closed .
it was interesting to note that most people in the financial services industry are against the idea of 25 year fixes .
that is , of course , because it would reduce their commission and fees .
i can not help wondering why it is fine to give an insurance company your pension pot and agree to a fixed rate annuity , but it is not ok to have fixed rate mortgages .
richard riley , wallsend , north tyneside " in the coming years , bankrupts i deal with may have to sell their house and their three buy-to-lets " stephen hunt the point of my investigation was to look at the issue of 25 year fixed-term products .
i was interested to find out why the government feel that creating an obscure financial instrument will help promote more widespread use - it will not - and why consumers do not take them up - in the current market where everyone is trying to borrow to their limit , their main focus is on next month 's payment , not the long-term .
a property crash is more likely than many experts are prepared to admit .
too many conditions are the same or worse than when the market last crashed .
i reject that a shortage of housing means there is no chance of a crash .
this suggests that in the early ' 90s there was no shortage of property , which was not the case .
people are propping up the market by taking out loans they can barely afford .
they are willing to borrow , and lenders lend , on the assumption that prices will rise to cover short-term risk .
if prices fall , that assumption will change and there will be a drop in purchasers who are willing to stretch themselves to enter the market .
why take out a 100 % mortgage when prices are falling - why not wait a year ?
lenders who were driven by short-term targets or salesmen on commission , will find this lending is no longer covered by an appreciating asset .
the sub-prime lending crisis in the usa shows signs of this .
it would be foolish to think that it could not happen here .
there are many property owners who would be more prepared to sell at a discount than there were in the early ' 90s .
more people have buy-to-lets and have overstretched themselves to make " an investment " .
if these people get into financial difficulty there could be a lot of property on the market .
i am an insolvency practitioner .
in the early ' 90s i dealt with people going bankrupt who had to sell their houses .
in the coming years , bankrupts i deal with may have to sell their house and their three buy-to-lets .
stephen hunt , -lrb- listener who joined lesley curwen to make " a quick fix " -rrb- , london " the government is totally missing the point " liz ward , tenterden , kent back in the ' 80s i worked for a mortgage lender structuring one of the first five year fixed-rate mortgages .
we did n't borrow money to lend on , but " hedged it " in the swaps market .
if the borrower defaulted -lrb- i.e. changed mortgage -rrb- the bank still had to pay their agreed payments , so the bank 's risk was mitigated by redemption penalties payable by the householder .
one of the problems with any long-term fixed-rate mortgage taker was that they would probably want to move house , so the mortgage companies made sure that this could be done smoothly .
most fixed rate mortgages are , therefore , portable .
however , not many people want long-term fixed-rate mortgages .
the government is totally missing the point .
in the late ' 80s when mortgages and house prices went up so fast , it was linked to double miras being removed .
it fuelled a new generation to buy houses , because it would be so much more expensive later .
now buy-to-let has taken off .
this has reduced the properties available for first time buyers .
when i was in my 20s in 1980 i worked flat out to pay my mortgage , but now it seems that people expect to pay huge amounts of interest on their credit cards of 10 % or more a year , buying things they can live without , but are complaining because mortgage loans are about 7 % .
the banks have a responsibility not to lend to those they feel will get into difficulty , but ultimately it is the responsibility of the individual taking out the loan .
twenty-five year mortgages will be very expensive for the banks to put in place which , ultimately , may make them unattractive to the borrower , who is always looking for the next bargain round the corner .
liz ward , tenterden , kent " mortgages do n't of themselves create new dwellings and that is what is needed " adrian , plymouth for those on modest salaries unlikely to rise above inflation and who tend to stay put , there is some attraction to the fixed rate mortgage , however mortgages do n't of themselves create new dwellings and that is what is needed .
as a plymouth landlord for many years i can confirm what the gentleman from exeter said concerning the effect of immigration ; the proportion of foreign applicants is much greater now than it was 25 years ago .
family break-up , children leaving home to live ' independently ' at taxpayer 's expense also add to demand for small occupation units .
all good for me personally but bad for our country .
one of the effects of the security of tenure provided by the rent acts -lrb- no eviction without leave from a court -rrb- is to make landlords much more wary of offering accommodation to an applicant who requires housing benefit ; thus an unemployed man , ex- prisoner , pregnant woman or student is unlikely to be regarded with enthusiasm .
people in these categories will generally find it more difficult to obtain the sort of accommodation they would like , or even any accommodation at all .
the rent acts tend to inhibit property owners from offering accommodation , thus reducing the overall housing provision .
adrian l romilly , plymouth fixed term mortgages are the norm in france .
i was surprised to feel so much reticence for this system on your programme .
the other big difference is choosing a shorter length of mortgage , usually 15-20 years only .
my mortgage was a fixed 6.15 % over 9 years in 1995 for example .
sure , you can always be annoyed that the rates may fall , but you know exactly how much you will pay .
david vollborth , paris " it was one of the best financial decisions i have made " alex , phoenix , usa i have never owned property in the uk , however growing up there i am certain that the lack of long term fixed rate mortgages and debt pushing tactics of the banking industry was a factor in my parent 's financial difficulties .
my parents were surprised when i told them that in the usa i had taken out a 30-years fixed-rate mortgage on my first house .
they told me that there was no such thing in the uk .
it was one of the best financial decisions i have made , and the current global housing market woes are not hurting me like many others with flexible or interest-only rates .
i thought ahead when hunting for a mortgage , 5 years ago , and only looked at fixed rates for 15 and 30 year terms with no pre-pay penalties .
i wanted the security of knowing exactly what my payments would be each month .
i also anticipated an increase in future annual income which would lower my income to debt ratio if i had the fixed interest rate and thus would allow me to increase my monthly payments to pay-off additional principle .
my mortgage is now less than a typical rent payment for a flat in the same area .
alex , phoenix , usa there are long term dangers for lenders issuing 25 year fixed rate mortgages .
after 10 years , borrowers can leave without penalty if we have lower interest rates or stay on at the same cost if we have higher interest rates - a case of heads i win , tails you lose .
remember equitable life who guaranteed too much and were all but bankrupted by interest rates moving the " wrong " way .
regarding covered bonds , what exactly are they ?
just how will they support penalty free 25 year fixed-rate mortgages without danger to the lenders ' solvency , while costing only 0.01 % ?
it will take a lot more to convince me .
chris grey , guildford " talking endlessly about making mortgages more affordable is not going to solve our housing problems " david topple , exeter as is the case with the insane intention to build 3 million new homes in the coming years , we have here yet another distraction from the more important issues that should be discussed in relation to housing , such as why we 've ended up with this ridiculous boom in the first place .
i 'd say it 's probably something to do with : city bonuses pouring into the market in the south-east , foreign capital pouring in as well , people moving to this country from abroad , low interest rates , easy credit finance , the british people 's obsession with owning their own homes and our shortage of living space .
talking endlessly about making mortgages more affordable is not going to solve our housing problems or lead to affordable homes .
of course , of the above points the most controversial is immigration .
when are we going to discuss its effect on the demand for housing ?
david topple , exeter the comments we publish are not necessarily the views of the bbc but will reflect the balance of views we have received .
it is helpful if contributors state if they work for any organisation relevant to an issue discussed .
readers should form their own views on whether messages published represent undeclared interests , or views prompted by a common source .

will a fixed-rate mortgage still be a good deal 25 years later ?

will a fixed-rate mortgage still be a good deal 25 years later ?
in the next year and a half , more than two million borrowers may be in for a nasty shock when they come to the end of short-term fixed-rate deals taken out when rates were low back in 2005 and 2006 .
considering how much interest rates have risen since then , when these consumers come to remortgage , they may face much higher monthly payments .
the government believes one way to avoid this kind of volatility would be if more of us took out longer term fixed rate mortgages .
we asked for your comments , a selection of which are below .
this debate is now closed .
it was interesting to note that most people in the financial services industry are against the idea of 25 year fixes .
that is , of course , because it would reduce their commission and fees .
i can not help wondering why it is fine to give an insurance company your pension pot and agree to a fixed rate annuity , but it is not ok to have fixed rate mortgages .
richard riley , wallsend , north tyneside in the coming years , bankrupts i deal with may have to sell their house and their three buy-to-lets stephen hunt the point of my investigation was to look at the issue of 25 year fixed-term products .
i was interested to find out why the government feel that creating an obscure financial instrument will help promote more widespread use - it will not - and why consumers do not take them up - in the current market where everyone is trying to borrow to their limit , their main focus is on next month 's payment , not the long-term .
a property crash is more likely than many experts are prepared to admit .
too many conditions are the same or worse than when the market last crashed .
i reject that a shortage of housing means there is no chance of a crash .
this suggests that in the early ' 90s there was no shortage of property , which was not the case .
people are propping up the market by taking out loans they can barely afford .
they are willing to borrow , and lenders lend , on the assumption that prices will rise to cover short-term risk .
if prices fall , that assumption will change and there will be a drop in purchasers who are willing to stretch themselves to enter the market .
why take out a 100 % mortgage when prices are falling - why not wait a year ?
lenders who were driven by short-term targets or salesmen on commission , will find this lending is no longer covered by an appreciating asset .
the sub-prime lending crisis in the usa shows signs of this .
it would be foolish to think that it could not happen here .
there are many property owners who would be more prepared to sell at a discount than there were in the early ' 90s .
more people have buy-to-lets and have overstretched themselves to make " an investment " .
if these people get into financial difficulty there could be a lot of property on the market .
i am an insolvency practitioner .
in the early ' 90s i dealt with people going bankrupt who had to sell their houses .
in the coming years , bankrupts i deal with may have to sell their house and their three buy-to-lets .
stephen hunt , -lrb- listener who joined lesley curwen to make " a quick fix " -rrb- , london the government is totally missing the point liz ward , tenterden , kent back in the ' 80s i worked for a mortgage lender structuring one of the first five year fixed-rate mortgages .
we did n't borrow money to lend on , but " hedged it " in the swaps market .
if the borrower defaulted -lrb- i.e. changed mortgage -rrb- the bank still had to pay their agreed payments , so the bank 's risk was mitigated by redemption penalties payable by the householder .
one of the problems with any long-term fixed-rate mortgage taker was that they would probably want to move house , so the mortgage companies made sure that this could be done smoothly .
most fixed rate mortgages are , therefore , portable .
however , not many people want long-term fixed-rate mortgages .
the government is totally missing the point .
in the late ' 80s when mortgages and house prices went up so fast , it was linked to double miras being removed .
it fuelled a new generation to buy houses , because it would be so much more expensive later .
now buy-to-let has taken off .
this has reduced the properties available for first time buyers .
when i was in my 20s in 1980 i worked flat out to pay my mortgage , but now it seems that people expect to pay huge amounts of interest on their credit cards of 10 % or more a year , buying things they can live without , but are complaining because mortgage loans are about 7 % .
the banks have a responsibility not to lend to those they feel will get into difficulty , but ultimately it is the responsibility of the individual taking out the loan .
twenty-five year mortgages will be very expensive for the banks to put in place which , ultimately , may make them unattractive to the borrower , who is always looking for the next bargain round the corner .
liz ward , tenterden , kent mortgages do n't of themselves create new dwellings and that is what is needed adrian , plymouth for those on modest salaries unlikely to rise above inflation and who tend to stay put , there is some attraction to the fixed rate mortgage , however mortgages do n't of themselves create new dwellings and that is what is needed .
as a plymouth landlord for many years i can confirm what the gentleman from exeter said concerning the effect of immigration ; the proportion of foreign applicants is much greater now than it was 25 years ago .
family break-up , children leaving home to live ' independently ' at taxpayer 's expense also add to demand for small occupation units .
all good for me personally but bad for our country .
one of the effects of the security of tenure provided by the rent acts -lrb- no eviction without leave from a court -rrb- is to make landlords much more wary of offering accommodation to an applicant who requires housing benefit ; thus an unemployed man , ex- prisoner , pregnant woman or student is unlikely to be regarded with enthusiasm .
people in these categories will generally find it more difficult to obtain the sort of accommodation they would like , or even any accommodation at all .
the rent acts tend to inhibit property owners from offering accommodation , thus reducing the overall housing provision .

will a fixed-rate mortgage still be a good deal 25 years later ?
in the next year and a half , more than two million borrowers may be in for a nasty shock when they come to the end of short-term fixed-rate deals taken out when rates were low back in 2005 and 2006 .
considering how much interest rates have risen since then , when these consumers come to remortgage , they may face much higher monthly payments .
the government believes one way to avoid this kind of volatility would be if more of us took out longer term fixed rate mortgages .
we asked for your comments , a selection of which are below .
this debate is now closed .
it was interesting to note that most people in the financial services industry are against the idea of 25 year fixes .
that is , of course , because it would reduce their commission and fees .
i can not help wondering why it is fine to give an insurance company your pension pot and agree to a fixed rate annuity , but it is not ok to have fixed rate mortgages .
richard riley , wallsend , north tyneside in the coming years , bankrupts i deal with may have to sell their house and their three buy-to-lets stephen hunt the point of my investigation was to look at the issue of 25 year fixed-term products .
i was interested to find out why the government feel that creating an obscure financial instrument will help promote more widespread use - it will not - and why consumers do not take them up - in the current market where everyone is trying to borrow to their limit , their main focus is on next month 's payment , not the long-term .
a property crash is more likely than many experts are prepared to admit .
too many conditions are the same or worse than when the market last crashed .
i reject that a shortage of housing means there is no chance of a crash .
this suggests that in the early ' 90s there was no shortage of property , which was not the case .
people are propping up the market by taking out loans they can barely afford .
they are willing to borrow , and lenders lend , on the assumption that prices will rise to cover short-term risk .
if prices fall , that assumption will change and there will be a drop in purchasers who are willing to stretch themselves to enter the market .
why take out a 100 % mortgage when prices are falling - why not wait a year ?
lenders who were driven by short-term targets or salesmen on commission , will find this lending is no longer covered by an appreciating asset .
the sub-prime lending crisis in the usa shows signs of this .
it would be foolish to think that it could not happen here .
there are many property owners who would be more prepared to sell at a discount than there were in the early ' 90s .
more people have buy-to-lets and have overstretched themselves to make " an investment " .
if these people get into financial difficulty there could be a lot of property on the market .
i am an insolvency practitioner .
in the early ' 90s i dealt with people going bankrupt who had to sell their houses .
in the coming years , bankrupts i deal with may have to sell their house and their three buy-to-lets .
stephen hunt , -lrb- listener who joined lesley curwen to make " a quick fix " -rrb- , london the government is totally missing the point liz ward , tenterden , kent back in the ' 80s i worked for a mortgage lender structuring one of the first five year fixed-rate mortgages .
we did n't borrow money to lend on , but " hedged it " in the swaps market .
if the borrower defaulted -lrb- i.e. changed mortgage -rrb- the bank still had to pay their agreed payments , so the bank 's risk was mitigated by redemption penalties payable by the householder .
one of the problems with any long-term fixed-rate mortgage taker was that they would probably want to move house , so the mortgage companies made sure that this could be done smoothly .
most fixed rate mortgages are , therefore , portable .
however , not many people want long-term fixed-rate mortgages .
the government is totally missing the point .
in the late ' 80s when mortgages and house prices went up so fast , it was linked to double miras being removed .
it fuelled a new generation to buy houses , because it would be so much more expensive later .
now buy-to-let has taken off .

mervyn meredith , 69 , from swansea , has been told he will not be funded for lucentis , which costs £ 20,000 per year .
the national institute for clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- said it needed more data on the drug , but local health boards were still free to prescribe it .
swansea local health board -lrb- lhb -rrb- , which would fund the treatment , said mr meredith was appealing his case .
mr meredith is one of several patients in the swansea area who have been refused funding for lucentis .
he has lost the sight in his left eye and the vision in his right eye is failing .
lucentis is being made available by only a few lhbs in wales while clinical guidelines are prepared .
it is unacceptable for primary care trusts to use the absence of nice guidance as an excuse not to prescribe a treatment national institute for clinical excellence nice has recommended it should be given to only a small number of patients who had already lost sight in one eye and suffered from a specific form of wet age-related macular degeneration -lrb- wet amd -rrb- .
it was expected to give its final guidance on the drug in december but has since postponed the decision as it wants more information on the drug 's clinical and cost effectiveness .
mr meredith said : " it 's a postcode lottery .
if i lived in scotland or pembrokeshire or even in cardiff , i could have it .
" it 's depressing me as well .
i was praying that my sight would last until september , then it was mentioned about december .
" now they 've moved it to next year .
no way .
it 's going fast .
" it wo n't last until next april .
i know this . "
wet amd is the leading cause of sight loss in the uk , affecting about 250,000 people .
there are 26,000 new cases each year .
amd is the leading cause of sight loss in the uk but the guidelines body said nhs boards were still able to make their own judgement about whether to fund the drug .
it said : " the department of health has however made it clear that it is unacceptable for primary care trusts to use the absence of nice guidance as an excuse not to prescribe a treatment .

the brand vanished from uk shelves four years ago amid declining sales and was replaced with dairy milk bubbles .
but online petitions and campaigns on social networking websites have been calling for cadbury to think again .
the firm , which has its main factory in birmingham , has agreed to relaunch the wispa for a limited period and 23m bars will be available from october .
' intrinsic role ' cadbury spokesman tony bilsborough said : " we have noticed the web interest for some time and the consumer passion has undeniably swayed our opinion to relaunch wispa .
" this is the first time that the power of the internet played such an intrinsic role in the return of a cadbury brand , " he added .
the return of the wispa , originally launched in 1981 , is scheduled to be for a limited period , but cadbury has suggested that if sales are high , the chocolate bar could remain on uk shelves .

chief constable of cheshire peter fahy spoke after four teenagers were charged with the murder of garry newlove , 47 .
he said underage drinking was a " child protection issue " and parents must take action to stop it or face " sanctions " from the care system .
ministers say there are already tough powers in place to compel them , such as parenting contracts and orders .
mr fahy is leading the investigation into mr newlove 's death .
the father-of-three died in hospital in warrington last sunday after youths allegedly attacked him .
last week , mr fahy called for the legal drinking age to be raised to 21 .
' a tragedy ' mr fahy said parents must not be allowed to ignore their children 's anti-social behaviour . "
society has recently stepped back from laying down too many standards , and telling people how to run their lives , but i think we 've seen the consequences of that " chief constable peter fahy profile : peter fahy " there are schemes whereby youth workers and other people offer support to parents who may have a problem with a youngster who 's drinking .
but we find a lot of parents will not take up that offer , " he said .
" if people are not willing to take up that offer , then there is some form of sanction which actually makes them come and take up that offer .
" this should be a child protection issue and this should be dealt with as part of care proceedings . "
he said the nation had been " touched " by the death of mr newlove , close to his home and seemingly protecting property from vandalism .
but he continued : " it is also a tragedy that we have four young people charged with murder .
" young people who are drinking are putting themselves in vulnerable positions both in terms of being the victim of crime or committing crime . "
curfews mr fahy added : " on the whole , society has recently stepped back from laying down too many standards , and telling people how to run their lives , and doing things like saying what time should children be home at night .
but i think we 've seen the consequences of that .
" i think a lot of police officers absolutely would be in favour of a time when it 's expected that young people are actually at home indoors . "
a spokesman for the department for children , schools and families said some parents wanted to help their children , but struggled to do so .
" in these situations parents need to be given support and help , for their sake and that of the wider community .
" for the tiny proportion of parents who choose to turn a blind eye using parenting contracts and where necessary parenting orders which require parents to get help , can help reinforce their responsibilities as well as improving their children 's behaviour . "
tv presenter and founder of childline esther rantzen told bbc radio five live she had recently visited italy where teenagers appeared not to view alcohol as vital to enjoying themselves .
" they were going out to eat ice cream .
there were families together .
" no-one was getting drunk .
no-one was being sick into a gutter .
it was a completely different culture . "
community ' rocked ' trevor averre-beeson , a headmaster who has turned around failing schools , told bbc radio 4 's today programme that he had never met a parent who " does n't have high aspirations for their youngsters " .

after lighting candles , those gathered held a minute 's silence followed by a round of applause for mr newlove .
inspector derek lockie , who is in charge of neighbourhood policing in the area , said local officers also felt " the pain and the sense of loss in the community " .

chief constable of cheshire peter fahy spoke after four teenagers were charged with the murder of garry newlove , 47 .
he said underage drinking was a " child protection issue " and parents must take action to stop it or face " sanctions " from the care system .
ministers say there are already tough powers in place to compel them , such as parenting contracts and orders .
mr fahy is leading the investigation into mr newlove 's death .
the father-of-three died in hospital in warrington last sunday after youths allegedly attacked him .
last week , mr fahy called for the legal drinking age to be raised to 21 .
' a tragedy ' mr fahy said parents must not be allowed to ignore their children 's anti-social behaviour .

but we find a lot of parents will not take up that offer , " he said .
" if people are not willing to take up that offer , then there is some form of sanction which actually makes them come and take up that offer .
" this should be a child protection issue and this should be dealt with as part of care proceedings . "
he said the nation had been " touched " by the death of mr newlove , close to his home and seemingly protecting property from vandalism .

but i think we 've seen the consequences of that .
mr fahy wants the legal drinking age to be raised from 18 to 21 " i think a lot of police officers absolutely would be in favour of a time when it 's expected that young people are actually at home indoors . "
a spokesman for the department for children , schools and families said some parents wanted to help their children , but struggled to do so .
" in these situations parents need to be given support and help , for their sake and that of the wider community .
" for the tiny proportion of parents who choose to turn a blind eye using parenting contracts and where necessary parenting orders which require parents to get help , can help reinforce their responsibilities as well as improving their children 's behaviour . "
tv presenter and founder of childline esther rantzen told bbc radio five live she had recently visited italy where teenagers appeared not to view alcohol as vital to enjoying themselves .
