rahr said that two years after she came to office , the difference between putin 's relationship with merkel and his far closer ties to her predecessor , schröder , were clear .
" their relationship is normal without being friendly .
she is careful and pragmatic and she never misses an opportunity to say that the united states is more important to her than russia , although she is not anti-russian , " rahr told afp . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 , for his work on documenting the holocaust . in awarding friedländer its top prize , the association said the historian had given " a voice to the grievances and cries of those human beings who were turned to dust - he gave them memory and a name . "
friedländer , a jewish historian of the holocaust , read from the letters of family members who died at the hands of the nazis before 1,000 guests at the award ceremony , which marked the high point of the frankfurt book fair on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler and his wife greet friedländer and his partner orna kenan the 75-year-old french-educated israeli academic , who lost his parents in the holocaust , was honored with germany 's top literary prize for " restoring the stolen dignity of the victims of the holocaust , a recognition of which is the basis of peace . "
friedländer called for the voices of the holocaust victims not to be silenced .
the personal documents of the victims " move us precisely because of their utter helplessness , their innocence and the solitariness of their desperation , " he said .
parents ' last words friedländer chose not to make the usual speech , but read the last words written by his parents and thrown from the train taking them to a french concentration camp .
the letters were addressed to the french woman who saved friedländer 's own life by placing him in a catholic school under an assumed name .
in his letter , friedländer 's father wrote he had sent money , jewelry and stamps to the woman , madame mace de lepinay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedländer 's parents died in auschwitz " do n't leave the boy .
may god repay you for everything and may he bless you and your family , " he wrote .
in an earlier letter , friedländer 's parents wrote : " if we must perish , at least we have the great good fortune of knowing that our beloved child has been saved . "
in an earlier speech , alexander von humboldt foundation president wolfgang frühwald stressed the need to remember .
the nazis had driven naiveté from the world , " destroying the original sense of trust in the moral power of civilization , " frühwald said .
complex emotions after being told he was to receive the award , friedländer , who speaks fluent german , referred to the " terrible feeling of fear " he had sometimes felt during his early stays in germany after world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedländer was honored for restoring the jews ' " stolen dignity " " i had to keep going away for periods .
but in time that changed , " he said .
germany was now a country like any other .
he even had a german grandchild in berlin , since his daughter is married to a german musician .
he said he had a " dual response " to being awarded the annual german literary prize , and was both happy to be honored for his scholarship while aware that this was closely bound to the loss of his parents .
" i wo n't have mixed feelings , but i would say complex feelings , " he said .
the award ceremony marks the climax of the book fair , the world 's largest .
more than 280,000 people attended the 59th fair , the same number as last year .
" from an economic point of view it went well , " book fair spokesman thomas minkus told the dpa news agency .
the politics and show business categories had drawn the most attention , he added .
attack on president the event was marred by an attack on german president horst köhler , who was attending the ceremony in the historic st. paul 's church in the city center .
an apparently mentally disturbed man rushed at köhler after the ceremony , grabbing him by the lapels before being overpowered by bodyguards and led away .
köhler was unhurt and continued with his schedule . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

topics are expected to be energy security , economic questions and the us missile shield . a number of tough global issues will also be on the table at the meeting of the german and russian leaders in the german city of wiesbaden .
it comes straight after talks in moscow between us secretary of state condoleezza rice and her russian counterpart sergei lavrov , as well as both countries ' defense ministers .
russia strongly opposes us plans to deploy parts of its anti-missile defence system in the czech republic and poland .
moscow says the missiles will target russia and not " rogue states " such as iran and north korea , which washington says the system is designed to defend against . in rancorous bilateral talks on friday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice rejected a russian call to freeze plans to place 10 us interceptor missiles in poland and a targeting radar station in the czech republic by 2010 . a spokesman for the kremlin on sunday confirmed that putin would raise " questions of strategic stability within the context of the us missile shield project " with the chancellor .
germany has taken a cautious stance on the issue , insisting that nato should be consulted about us plans and also warning poland and the czechs that their going it alone could prove divisive for europe . fyodor lukyanov , editor of the magazine russia in global affairs , says that he expects putin to try to play on germany 's " ambivalence " towards the shield .
putin has threatened to tear up several cold war-era agreements , including the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty which sets limits on troops , tanks and other hardware across the continent . bilateral issues russian presidential spokesman dimitri peskov said another priority of the talks would be on " clarifying " merkel 's position on bilateral investment projects , particularly those of gazprom in europe .

merkel and putin briefly clashed on the issue during her visit to russia in may , prompting the russian president to say that demonstrators " were also arrested in germany . "
rahr said that two years after she came to office , the difference between putin 's relationship with merkel and his far closer ties to her predecessor , schröder , were clear .

merkel and putin briefly clashed on the issue during her visit to russia in may , prompting the russian president to say that demonstrators " were also arrested in germany . "
rahr said that two years after she came to office , the difference between putin 's relationship with merkel and his far closer ties to her predecessor , schröder , were clear .
" their relationship is normal without being friendly .
she is careful and pragmatic and she never misses an opportunity to say that the united states is more important to her than russia , although she is not anti-russian , " rahr told afp . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 .
topics are expected to be energy security , economic questions and the us missile shield . a number of tough global issues will also be on the table at the meeting of the german and russian leaders in the german city of wiesbaden .
it comes straight after talks in moscow between us secretary of state condoleezza rice and her russian counterpart sergei lavrov , as well as both countries ' defense ministers .
russia strongly opposes us plans to deploy parts of its anti-missile defence system in the czech republic and poland .
moscow says the missiles will target russia and not " rogue states " such as iran and north korea , which washington says the system is designed to defend against . in rancorous bilateral talks on friday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice rejected a russian call to freeze plans to place 10 us interceptor missiles in poland and a targeting radar station in the czech republic by 2010 . a spokesman for the kremlin on sunday confirmed that putin would raise " questions of strategic stability within the context of the us missile shield project " with the chancellor .
germany has taken a cautious stance on the issue , insisting that nato should be consulted about us plans and also warning poland and the czechs that their going it alone could prove divisive for europe . fyodor lukyanov , editor of the magazine russia in global affairs , says that he expects putin to try to play on germany 's " ambivalence " towards the shield .
putin has threatened to tear up several cold war-era agreements , including the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty which sets limits on troops , tanks and other hardware across the continent . bilateral issues russian presidential spokesman dimitri peskov said another priority of the talks would be on " clarifying " merkel 's position on bilateral investment projects , particularly those of gazprom in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the smiles , there were gritted teeth on both sides after recent us-russia talks " for putin , the most important thing will be evening the scales with regard to the latest draft of the european commission in terms of protecting their market from foreign competition , " peskov told the german press agency dpa .
the commission is considering the introduction of a tough reciprocity clause for energy relations with third countries .
" of course , russia is looking for equal conditions and fair competition for russian companies , including gazprom , " peskov said ahead of the summit .

it comes straight after talks in moscow between us secretary of state condoleezza rice and her russian counterpart sergei lavrov , as well as both countries ' defense ministers .
russia strongly opposes us plans to deploy parts of its anti-missile defence system in the czech republic and poland .
moscow says the missiles will target russia and not " rogue states " such as iran and north korea , which washington says the system is designed to defend against . in rancorous bilateral talks on friday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice rejected a russian call to freeze plans to place 10 us interceptor missiles in poland and a targeting radar station in the czech republic by 2010 . a spokesman for the kremlin on sunday confirmed that putin would raise " questions of strategic stability within the context of the us missile shield project " with the chancellor .
germany has taken a cautious stance on the issue , insisting that nato should be consulted about us plans and also warning poland and the czechs that their going it alone could prove divisive for europe . fyodor lukyanov , editor of the magazine russia in global affairs , says that he expects putin to try to play on germany 's " ambivalence " towards the shield .
putin has threatened to tear up several cold war-era agreements , including the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty which sets limits on troops , tanks and other hardware across the continent . bilateral issues russian presidential spokesman dimitri peskov said another priority of the talks would be on " clarifying " merkel 's position on bilateral investment projects , particularly those of gazprom in europe .

merkel and putin briefly clashed on the issue during her visit to russia in may , prompting the russian president to say that demonstrators " were also arrested in germany . "
rahr said that two years after she came to office , the difference between putin 's relationship with merkel and his far closer ties to her predecessor , schröder , were clear .

inside it is a maze of cement passages covering several levels and usually filled with nothing more than army-issue mattresses , green metal folding beds and water purification tablets . according bonn ’ s emergency services the bunker could be used in the event of any future catastrophe , including a terrorist attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the outside the windeck bunker looks like a big cube but this october the bunker has become a refuge for ten german artists who are participating in an exhibition called " licht in den bunker " or " light in the bunker . "
for exhibition organizer and artist gabriele lutterbeck the bunker is a unique and very german place . " we had world war two and we had the nazi regime which ended in a bunker , " she said .
" we wanted to use a space that was old and of no use today and which provides a very special atmosphere . " a world war ii relic built in 1940 , the windeck bunker was an air raid shelter for bonn ’ s residents .
today it is closed to the public and this is the first time an independent art exhibition has been held in the space .
two previous exhibitions were organized by the city of bonn in the bunker as part of local festivals . while some of bonn ’ s residents were glad to stay in the bunker during the war due to the protection it provided , many people today cringe at the thought . " i 'm not sure i want to stay in there - the art is nice but everything else is horrible .
it ’ s creepy because it makes us think about war and everything that could force us go there , " lutterbeck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only twenty people are permitted in the bunker at a time " there 's a strange sensation when you turn the big , red heavy door to go down into the bunker " she said . on the other side of a red metal door marked schleuse , or gate , visitors climb into a large , square cement room and see the spartan green metal beds and mattresses , and the thin tin partitions that hide toilets behind them . in the middle of the room thomas schneider 's " self-made sm-chair , " a wooden torture chair , immediately puts a chill in the room .
opposite the chair , stuffed colored parrots are arranged behind a glass frame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schneider ’ s installation the " twin-tower-cigarette lighter , " a cigarette lighter decorated with the skyline of new york with the world trade center still standing , is schneider ’ s third work exhibited .
the top of the cigarette lighter is open , splitting the design and cutting the towers in two . lutterbeck said the artists decided to exhibit their existing works or create pieces specifically for the exhibition that would relate to a wartime bunker and the themes associated with it . connecting with germany 's nazi past the three pieces lutterbeck prepared for the exhibition are a very personal reaction to the space .
when she decided to hold an exhibition in the bunker she initially focussed on her own private and personal reactions to it . " i really went into the nazi story because this bunker , although it was changed and maintained , is really a world war ii bunker , " she said her series of blue sketches are a reaction to the lebensborn project – a nazi ss program that set up maternity homes where women of " pure blood " could bear children who fitted the nazi 's preferred racial profile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutterbeck 's work is her personal reaction to the bunker lutterbeck 's second work features the six goebbels children who died in berlin bunker .
their mother , magda , who was married to hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , allegedly killed the children with cyanide capsules in hitler 's führer bunker on may 1 , 1945 .
lutterbeck 's painting features the family and was photographed and made into a slide which is projected onto the bunker wall . " i put it on a slide because germans like to have these slide shows , usually at christmas , where families look at their own pictures , " she said . everything lutterbeck knows about bunkers comes from her parents who are now deceased .
in order to represent this lutterbeck also chose to exhibit a photograph of her mother at age 12 . a symbol of security during world war ii , the bunker was divided into cells and the nazi party allocated the spaces where between eight to ten people , and later up to 15 people , sat on wooden benches from 5 p.m. every afternoon .
in the last four months leading up to the allies ' arrival in bonn the bunker became even more overcrowded as the number of people looking for safety grew . walter , a 73 -year-old bonn resident who did n't want to give his last name , sought refuge in the bunker with his family when he was aged ten .
he said it was the only place he felt safe . " it 's not a terrible place for me because it was a place of security .
it was a wonderful place and the terrible conditions were accepted because the alternatives were worse , " said walter , who was at the exhibition 's opening . while the bunker for him symbolizes security , he thought having an art exhibition in the space was a " good idea because it demonstrates that the same place can be different depending on the circumstances . " art takes on a different meaning the second floor of the exhibition is much lighter in its themes with tine holterhoff 's colorful photographs featuring facades in red , yellow and blue arranged in grids brighten up the otherwise bleak room .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tatjana schuelke 's speechless takes on a different meaning in the space for berlin artist tatjana schuelke , the use of the bunker as an exhibition space is more interesting than in a typical gallery .
she says her work - like her sculpture " speechless " currently on display - is transformed in a way in this environment .
the candy pink sculpture looks like a bomb and is covered with plaster cast teeth . " in most exhibition spaces it 's a comic sculpture but here in the bunker it takes on a different meaning , " said schuelke . in the final exhibition room two large paintings of red poppies , the symbol of war remembrance in some countries , lie flat on two metal army beds .
along the bottom of the paintings are thick , milky strips of paint . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the lights go out marni 's installation transforms flashlights are handed out and the lights go off .
then participants use the light from the flashlights to draw patterns on the reflective white paint at the bottom edge of the paintings and on other white strips hung on the walls around the room .
lasers project red patterns on the ceiling while a mix of classical and electronic music plays . some participants draw squiggles , others peace signs while some choose to reflect simply on their surroundings .
for the installation 's creators , marni -lrb- the duo of nika rossmöller-schmidt and martin schmidt -rrb- , the bunker is all about insiders and outsiders and protection . and when it comes to protection at least the artists wo n't have to worry about insuring their art - it should be quite safe in the bunker . should a catastrophe happen during the next two weeks , lutterbeck at least has the keys to the bunker . stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

inside it is a maze of cement passages covering several levels and usually filled with nothing more than army-issue mattresses , green metal folding beds and water purification tablets . according bonn ’ s emergency services the bunker could be used in the event of any future catastrophe , including a terrorist attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the outside the windeck bunker looks like a big cube but this october the bunker has become a refuge for ten german artists who are participating in an exhibition called " licht in den bunker " or " light in the bunker . "
for exhibition organizer and artist gabriele lutterbeck the bunker is a unique and very german place . " we had world war two and we had the nazi regime which ended in a bunker , " she said .
" we wanted to use a space that was old and of no use today and which provides a very special atmosphere . " a world war ii relic built in 1940 , the windeck bunker was an air raid shelter for bonn ’ s residents .
today it is closed to the public and this is the first time an independent art exhibition has been held in the space .
two previous exhibitions were organized by the city of bonn in the bunker as part of local festivals . while some of bonn ’ s residents were glad to stay in the bunker during the war due to the protection it provided , many people today cringe at the thought . " i 'm not sure i want to stay in there - the art is nice but everything else is horrible .
it ’ s creepy because it makes us think about war and everything that could force us go there , " lutterbeck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only twenty people are permitted in the bunker at a time " there 's a strange sensation when you turn the big , red heavy door to go down into the bunker " she said . on the other side of a red metal door marked schleuse , or gate , visitors climb into a large , square cement room and see the spartan green metal beds and mattresses , and the thin tin partitions that hide toilets behind them . in the middle of the room thomas schneider 's " self-made sm-chair , " a wooden torture chair , immediately puts a chill in the room .
opposite the chair , stuffed colored parrots are arranged behind a glass frame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schneider ’ s installation the " twin-tower-cigarette lighter , " a cigarette lighter decorated with the skyline of new york with the world trade center still standing , is schneider ’ s third work exhibited .
the top of the cigarette lighter is open , splitting the design and cutting the towers in two . lutterbeck said the artists decided to exhibit their existing works or create pieces specifically for the exhibition that would relate to a wartime bunker and the themes associated with it . connecting with germany 's nazi past the three pieces lutterbeck prepared for the exhibition are a very personal reaction to the space .
when she decided to hold an exhibition in the bunker she initially focussed on her own private and personal reactions to it . " i really went into the nazi story because this bunker , although it was changed and maintained , is really a world war ii bunker , " she said her series of blue sketches are a reaction to the lebensborn project – a nazi ss program that set up maternity homes where women of " pure blood " could bear children who fitted the nazi 's preferred racial profile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutterbeck 's work is her personal reaction to the bunker lutterbeck 's second work features the six goebbels children who died in berlin bunker .
their mother , magda , who was married to hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , allegedly killed the children with cyanide capsules in hitler 's führer bunker on may 1 , 1945 .
lutterbeck 's painting features the family and was photographed and made into a slide which is projected onto the bunker wall . " i put it on a slide because germans like to have these slide shows , usually at christmas , where families look at their own pictures , " she said . everything lutterbeck knows about bunkers comes from her parents who are now deceased .

the famous race track , often called " the ring , " has been a favorite among motor sport enthusiasts and tourists since its opening in 1927 . located around the village and medieval castle of nürburg in the eifel mountains , the racing track at the nürburgring is known around the world for its extraordinary formula 1 grand prix racing , but it can also be driven by any visitor with a valid driver 's license .
the constant noise produced by race cars speeding by can get visitors in the mood for serious automotive action .
daily drives , guided backstage tours , field trips and adventure parks are a few of the possibilities offered besides the big races .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test your car and your driving skill on the northern loop the most famous of the attractions is the nordschleife , or northern loop , which is more popularly known as the green hell .
it is made up of 20,8 kilometers -lrb- 13 miles -rrb- of challenging one-way track in beautiful surroundings on which any driver can assess his or her racing abilities .
" the nürburgring myth is definitely tied to the green hell , as jackie stewart baptized the track , " said walter kafitz , ceo of the nürburgring .
" history has been written here . "
" at the first race in 1927 there were hundreds of thousands of visitors there .
today , there are about two million guests on the ring yearly who come to experience the place 's unique atmosphere , " he said .
not just for professionals bildunterschrift : the green hell : it 's a picturesque inferno the so called " tourist drives , " which have taken place since 1927 , welcome anybody who wants to take part .
" driving on the nordschleife personally is for many fans the highlight , " kafitz said .
although there is no oncoming traffic , driving the northern loop is challenging for amateurs since it can be hard to judge where exactly on the track to drive .
there are no lane markings , but there are many sharp curves and slopes .
due to the number of drivers , and the potential hazards , there are specific rules that need to be followed .
one suggestion : drivers and passengers on the northern loop should go easy on foods that could upset your stomach if they do n't want a serious case of car sickness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ring has known its share of tragedy a regular visitor to the ring , christopher heiser , who has a web page devoted to the track and racing devotees , has said that " nothing , absolutely nothing will prepare you for your first time around the track .
it is nothing like anything you 've ever driven on .
the track is so much bigger , so much steeper , so much faster than you can possibly imagine . "
the history of the legend the nürburgring opened on june 18 , 1927 as a dedicated racing circuit .
soon after it was obvious how important an economic role it would play for the entire region .
" restaurants with spare rooms became hotels , cow fields became parking lots , and racing became a blessing for one of the poorest regions in germany , " said kafitz .
after the war , reconstruction work began in 1947 and the eifel cup was held , rushing in a new nürburgring racing era , according to kafitz .
" the entrance fee was five reichsmarks , with a voucher for wine , sausage and bread .
four years later the first formula one world championship took place and the ring became international , " he said .
life beyond cars bildunterschrift : the nürburgring puts on many large-scale events the nürburgring area is an ideal tourist destination with its striking scenery , churches , lakes , castles , museums and notable architecture - besides the race track , of course . although few would call the northern loop " regular , " but those who do find the fairly flat track uninteresting can turn their attentions to the off-road park and try a little four-wheeling .
there is more than just four-wheel-centered activity .
guests can ride bikes on the bike-lane that runs parallel to the northern loop .
part of the 30 kilometer -lrb- 18.6 mile -rrb- ride runs through forests near the town of adenau .
those who prefer staying on their own two feet can take on a hiking trail , with a guide providing information about the history of the track as well as the whole eifel area .
camping facilities are also available .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much more is in the planning for the nürburgring plans are to develop the nürburgring into a year-round recreation and business center , with event possibilities that do n't depend on good weather , according to kafitz .
poor conditions can shut the track down for weeks .
" there will also be a roller coaster that will have an acceleration value like formula one race cars , directly above the actual start and finish lines - 365 days a year , " kafitz said . tina pandza send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

inside it is a maze of cement passages covering several levels and usually filled with nothing more than army-issue mattresses , green metal folding beds and water purification tablets . according bonn ’ s emergency services the bunker could be used in the event of any future catastrophe , including a terrorist attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the outside the windeck bunker looks like a big cube but this october the bunker has become a refuge for ten german artists who are participating in an exhibition called " licht in den bunker " or " light in the bunker . "
for exhibition organizer and artist gabriele lutterbeck the bunker is a unique and very german place . " we had world war two and we had the nazi regime which ended in a bunker , " she said .
" we wanted to use a space that was old and of no use today and which provides a very special atmosphere . " a world war ii relic built in 1940 , the windeck bunker was an air raid shelter for bonn ’ s residents .
today it is closed to the public and this is the first time an independent art exhibition has been held in the space .
two previous exhibitions were organized by the city of bonn in the bunker as part of local festivals . while some of bonn ’ s residents were glad to stay in the bunker during the war due to the protection it provided , many people today cringe at the thought . " i 'm not sure i want to stay in there - the art is nice but everything else is horrible .
it ’ s creepy because it makes us think about war and everything that could force us go there , " lutterbeck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only twenty people are permitted in the bunker at a time " there 's a strange sensation when you turn the big , red heavy door to go down into the bunker " she said . on the other side of a red metal door marked schleuse , or gate , visitors climb into a large , square cement room and see the spartan green metal beds and mattresses , and the thin tin partitions that hide toilets behind them . in the middle of the room thomas schneider 's " self-made sm-chair , " a wooden torture chair , immediately puts a chill in the room .
opposite the chair , stuffed colored parrots are arranged behind a glass frame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schneider ’ s installation the " twin-tower-cigarette lighter , " a cigarette lighter decorated with the skyline of new york with the world trade center still standing , is schneider ’ s third work exhibited .
the top of the cigarette lighter is open , splitting the design and cutting the towers in two . lutterbeck said the artists decided to exhibit their existing works or create pieces specifically for the exhibition that would relate to a wartime bunker and the themes associated with it . connecting with germany 's nazi past the three pieces lutterbeck prepared for the exhibition are a very personal reaction to the space .
when she decided to hold an exhibition in the bunker she initially focussed on her own private and personal reactions to it . " i really went into the nazi story because this bunker , although it was changed and maintained , is really a world war ii bunker , " she said her series of blue sketches are a reaction to the lebensborn project – a nazi ss program that set up maternity homes where women of " pure blood " could bear children who fitted the nazi 's preferred racial profile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutterbeck 's work is her personal reaction to the bunker lutterbeck 's second work features the six goebbels children who died in berlin bunker .
their mother , magda , who was married to hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , allegedly killed the children with cyanide capsules in hitler 's führer bunker on may 1 , 1945 .
lutterbeck 's painting features the family and was photographed and made into a slide which is projected onto the bunker wall . " i put it on a slide because germans like to have these slide shows , usually at christmas , where families look at their own pictures , " she said . everything lutterbeck knows about bunkers comes from her parents who are now deceased .
in order to represent this lutterbeck also chose to exhibit a photograph of her mother at age 12 . a symbol of security during world war ii , the bunker was divided into cells and the nazi party allocated the spaces where between eight to ten people , and later up to 15 people , sat on wooden benches from 5 p.m. every afternoon .
in the last four months leading up to the allies ' arrival in bonn the bunker became even more overcrowded as the number of people looking for safety grew . walter , a 73 -year-old bonn resident who did n't want to give his last name , sought refuge in the bunker with his family when he was aged ten .
he said it was the only place he felt safe . " it 's not a terrible place for me because it was a place of security .
it was a wonderful place and the terrible conditions were accepted because the alternatives were worse , " said walter , who was at the exhibition 's opening . while the bunker for him symbolizes security , he thought having an art exhibition in the space was a " good idea because it demonstrates that the same place can be different depending on the circumstances .

russia strongly opposes us plans to deploy parts of its anti-missile defence system in the czech republic and poland .
moscow says the missiles will target russia and not " rogue states " such as iran and north korea , which washington says the system is designed to defend against . in rancorous bilateral talks on friday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice rejected a russian call to freeze plans to place 10 us interceptor missiles in poland and a targeting radar station in the czech republic by 2010 . a spokesman for the kremlin on sunday confirmed that putin would raise " questions of strategic stability within the context of the us missile shield project " with the chancellor .
germany has taken a cautious stance on the issue , insisting that nato should be consulted about us plans and also warning poland and the czechs that their going it alone could prove divisive for europe . fyodor lukyanov , editor of the magazine russia in global affairs , says that he expects putin to try to play on germany 's " ambivalence " towards the shield .
putin has threatened to tear up several cold war-era agreements , including the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty which sets limits on troops , tanks and other hardware across the continent . bilateral issues russian presidential spokesman dimitri peskov said another priority of the talks would be on " clarifying " merkel 's position on bilateral investment projects , particularly those of gazprom in europe .

merkel and putin briefly clashed on the issue during her visit to russia in may , prompting the russian president to say that demonstrators " were also arrested in germany . "
rahr said that two years after she came to office , the difference between putin 's relationship with merkel and his far closer ties to her predecessor , schröder , were clear .
" their relationship is normal without being friendly .

14 .
topics are expected to be energy security , economic questions and the us missile shield . a number of tough global issues will also be on the table at the meeting of the german and russian leaders in the german city of wiesbaden .
it comes straight after talks in moscow between us secretary of state condoleezza rice and her russian counterpart sergei lavrov , as well as both countries ' defense ministers .
russia strongly opposes us plans to deploy parts of its anti-missile defence system in the czech republic and poland .
moscow says the missiles will target russia and not " rogue states " such as iran and north korea , which washington says the system is designed to defend against . in rancorous bilateral talks on friday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice rejected a russian call to freeze plans to place 10 us interceptor missiles in poland and a targeting radar station in the czech republic by 2010 . a spokesman for the kremlin on sunday confirmed that putin would raise " questions of strategic stability within the context of the us missile shield project " with the chancellor .
germany has taken a cautious stance on the issue , insisting that nato should be consulted about us plans and also warning poland and the czechs that their going it alone could prove divisive for europe . fyodor lukyanov , editor of the magazine russia in global affairs , says that he expects putin to try to play on germany 's " ambivalence " towards the shield .
putin has threatened to tear up several cold war-era agreements , including the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty which sets limits on troops , tanks and other hardware across the continent . bilateral issues russian presidential spokesman dimitri peskov said another priority of the talks would be on " clarifying " merkel 's position on bilateral investment projects , particularly those of gazprom in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the smiles , there were gritted teeth on both sides after recent us-russia talks " for putin , the most important thing will be evening the scales with regard to the latest draft of the european commission in terms of protecting their market from foreign competition , " peskov told the german press agency dpa .
the commission is considering the introduction of a tough reciprocity clause for energy relations with third countries .
" of course , russia is looking for equal conditions and fair competition for russian companies , including gazprom , " peskov said ahead of the summit .
the talks in wiesbaden will stretch over two days , with the two leaders participating in a forum on monday , oct .
14 that is part of the petersburg dialogue , a civil society discussion that was set up by putin and former chancellor gerhard schröder . kosovo and human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albanians in kosovo are demanding independence for the province kosovo is another delicate issue expected to be raised in wiesbaden . russia has denounced western support for independence for kosovo , the ethnic albanian-led province which has threatened to declare independence unilaterally from serbia unless the international community comes up with a solution by december 10 . although berlin has said little officially about the visit , alexander rahr , a researcher at the german council on foreign relations told the afp news agency that he also expected merkel to raise the issue of freedom of speech in russia .
merkel and putin briefly clashed on the issue during her visit to russia in may , prompting the russian president to say that demonstrators " were also arrested in germany . "
rahr said that two years after she came to office , the difference between putin 's relationship with merkel and his far closer ties to her predecessor , schröder , were clear .
" their relationship is normal without being friendly .
she is careful and pragmatic and she never misses an opportunity to say that the united states is more important to her than russia , although she is not anti-russian , " rahr told afp . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

inside it is a maze of cement passages covering several levels and usually filled with nothing more than army-issue mattresses , green metal folding beds and water purification tablets . according bonn ’ s emergency services the bunker could be used in the event of any future catastrophe , including a terrorist attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the outside the windeck bunker looks like a big cube but this october the bunker has become a refuge for ten german artists who are participating in an exhibition called " licht in den bunker " or " light in the bunker . "
for exhibition organizer and artist gabriele lutterbeck the bunker is a unique and very german place . " we had world war two and we had the nazi regime which ended in a bunker , " she said .
" we wanted to use a space that was old and of no use today and which provides a very special atmosphere . " a world war ii relic built in 1940 , the windeck bunker was an air raid shelter for bonn ’ s residents .
today it is closed to the public and this is the first time an independent art exhibition has been held in the space .
two previous exhibitions were organized by the city of bonn in the bunker as part of local festivals . while some of bonn ’ s residents were glad to stay in the bunker during the war due to the protection it provided , many people today cringe at the thought . " i 'm not sure i want to stay in there - the art is nice but everything else is horrible .
it ’ s creepy because it makes us think about war and everything that could force us go there , " lutterbeck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only twenty people are permitted in the bunker at a time " there 's a strange sensation when you turn the big , red heavy door to go down into the bunker " she said . on the other side of a red metal door marked schleuse , or gate , visitors climb into a large , square cement room and see the spartan green metal beds and mattresses , and the thin tin partitions that hide toilets behind them . in the middle of the room thomas schneider 's " self-made sm-chair , " a wooden torture chair , immediately puts a chill in the room .
opposite the chair , stuffed colored parrots are arranged behind a glass frame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schneider ’ s installation the " twin-tower-cigarette lighter , " a cigarette lighter decorated with the skyline of new york with the world trade center still standing , is schneider ’ s third work exhibited .
the top of the cigarette lighter is open , splitting the design and cutting the towers in two . lutterbeck said the artists decided to exhibit their existing works or create pieces specifically for the exhibition that would relate to a wartime bunker and the themes associated with it . connecting with germany 's nazi past the three pieces lutterbeck prepared for the exhibition are a very personal reaction to the space .
when she decided to hold an exhibition in the bunker she initially focussed on her own private and personal reactions to it . " i really went into the nazi story because this bunker , although it was changed and maintained , is really a world war ii bunker , " she said her series of blue sketches are a reaction to the lebensborn project – a nazi ss program that set up maternity homes where women of " pure blood " could bear children who fitted the nazi 's preferred racial profile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutterbeck 's work is her personal reaction to the bunker lutterbeck 's second work features the six goebbels children who died in berlin bunker .
their mother , magda , who was married to hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , allegedly killed the children with cyanide capsules in hitler 's führer bunker on may 1 , 1945 .
lutterbeck 's painting features the family and was photographed and made into a slide which is projected onto the bunker wall . " i put it on a slide because germans like to have these slide shows , usually at christmas , where families look at their own pictures , " she said . everything lutterbeck knows about bunkers comes from her parents who are now deceased .
in order to represent this lutterbeck also chose to exhibit a photograph of her mother at age 12 . a symbol of security during world war ii , the bunker was divided into cells and the nazi party allocated the spaces where between eight to ten people , and later up to 15 people , sat on wooden benches from 5 p.m. every afternoon .
in the last four months leading up to the allies ' arrival in bonn the bunker became even more overcrowded as the number of people looking for safety grew . walter , a 73 -year-old bonn resident who did n't want to give his last name , sought refuge in the bunker with his family when he was aged ten .
he said it was the only place he felt safe . " it 's not a terrible place for me because it was a place of security .
it was a wonderful place and the terrible conditions were accepted because the alternatives were worse , " said walter , who was at the exhibition 's opening . while the bunker for him symbolizes security , he thought having an art exhibition in the space was a " good idea because it demonstrates that the same place can be different depending on the circumstances . " art takes on a different meaning the second floor of the exhibition is much lighter in its themes with tine holterhoff 's colorful photographs featuring facades in red , yellow and blue arranged in grids brighten up the otherwise bleak room .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tatjana schuelke 's speechless takes on a different meaning in the space for berlin artist tatjana schuelke , the use of the bunker as an exhibition space is more interesting than in a typical gallery .
she says her work - like her sculpture " speechless " currently on display - is transformed in a way in this environment .
the candy pink sculpture looks like a bomb and is covered with plaster cast teeth . " in most exhibition spaces it 's a comic sculpture but here in the bunker it takes on a different meaning , " said schuelke . in the final exhibition room two large paintings of red poppies , the symbol of war remembrance in some countries , lie flat on two metal army beds .
along the bottom of the paintings are thick , milky strips of paint . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the lights go out marni 's installation transforms flashlights are handed out and the lights go off .
then participants use the light from the flashlights to draw patterns on the reflective white paint at the bottom edge of the paintings and on other white strips hung on the walls around the room .
lasers project red patterns on the ceiling while a mix of classical and electronic music plays . some participants draw squiggles , others peace signs while some choose to reflect simply on their surroundings .
for the installation 's creators , marni -lrb- the duo of nika rossmöller-schmidt and martin schmidt -rrb- , the bunker is all about insiders and outsiders and protection . and when it comes to protection at least the artists wo n't have to worry about insuring their art - it should be quite safe in the bunker . should a catastrophe happen during the next two weeks , lutterbeck at least has the keys to the bunker . stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

inside it is a maze of cement passages covering several levels and usually filled with nothing more than army-issue mattresses , green metal folding beds and water purification tablets . according bonn ’ s emergency services the bunker could be used in the event of any future catastrophe , including a terrorist attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the outside the windeck bunker looks like a big cube but this october the bunker has become a refuge for ten german artists who are participating in an exhibition called " licht in den bunker " or " light in the bunker . "
for exhibition organizer and artist gabriele lutterbeck the bunker is a unique and very german place . " we had world war two and we had the nazi regime which ended in a bunker , " she said .
" we wanted to use a space that was old and of no use today and which provides a very special atmosphere . " a world war ii relic built in 1940 , the windeck bunker was an air raid shelter for bonn ’ s residents .
today it is closed to the public and this is the first time an independent art exhibition has been held in the space .
two previous exhibitions were organized by the city of bonn in the bunker as part of local festivals . while some of bonn ’ s residents were glad to stay in the bunker during the war due to the protection it provided , many people today cringe at the thought . " i 'm not sure i want to stay in there - the art is nice but everything else is horrible .
it ’ s creepy because it makes us think about war and everything that could force us go there , " lutterbeck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only twenty people are permitted in the bunker at a time " there 's a strange sensation when you turn the big , red heavy door to go down into the bunker " she said . on the other side of a red metal door marked schleuse , or gate , visitors climb into a large , square cement room and see the spartan green metal beds and mattresses , and the thin tin partitions that hide toilets behind them . in the middle of the room thomas schneider 's " self-made sm-chair , " a wooden torture chair , immediately puts a chill in the room .
opposite the chair , stuffed colored parrots are arranged behind a glass frame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schneider ’ s installation the " twin-tower-cigarette lighter , " a cigarette lighter decorated with the skyline of new york with the world trade center still standing , is schneider ’ s third work exhibited .
the top of the cigarette lighter is open , splitting the design and cutting the towers in two . lutterbeck said the artists decided to exhibit their existing works or create pieces specifically for the exhibition that would relate to a wartime bunker and the themes associated with it . connecting with germany 's nazi past the three pieces lutterbeck prepared for the exhibition are a very personal reaction to the space .
when she decided to hold an exhibition in the bunker she initially focussed on her own private and personal reactions to it . " i really went into the nazi story because this bunker , although it was changed and maintained , is really a world war ii bunker , " she said her series of blue sketches are a reaction to the lebensborn project – a nazi ss program that set up maternity homes where women of " pure blood " could bear children who fitted the nazi 's preferred racial profile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutterbeck 's work is her personal reaction to the bunker lutterbeck 's second work features the six goebbels children who died in berlin bunker .
their mother , magda , who was married to hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , allegedly killed the children with cyanide capsules in hitler 's führer bunker on may 1 , 1945 .
lutterbeck 's painting features the family and was photographed and made into a slide which is projected onto the bunker wall . " i put it on a slide because germans like to have these slide shows , usually at christmas , where families look at their own pictures , " she said . everything lutterbeck knows about bunkers comes from her parents who are now deceased .
in order to represent this lutterbeck also chose to exhibit a photograph of her mother at age 12 . a symbol of security during world war ii , the bunker was divided into cells and the nazi party allocated the spaces where between eight to ten people , and later up to 15 people , sat on wooden benches from 5 p.m. every afternoon .
in the last four months leading up to the allies ' arrival in bonn the bunker became even more overcrowded as the number of people looking for safety grew . walter , a 73 -year-old bonn resident who did n't want to give his last name , sought refuge in the bunker with his family when he was aged ten .
he said it was the only place he felt safe . " it 's not a terrible place for me because it was a place of security .
it was a wonderful place and the terrible conditions were accepted because the alternatives were worse , " said walter , who was at the exhibition 's opening . while the bunker for him symbolizes security , he thought having an art exhibition in the space was a " good idea because it demonstrates that the same place can be different depending on the circumstances . " art takes on a different meaning the second floor of the exhibition is much lighter in its themes with tine holterhoff 's colorful photographs featuring facades in red , yellow and blue arranged in grids brighten up the otherwise bleak room .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tatjana schuelke 's speechless takes on a different meaning in the space for berlin artist tatjana schuelke , the use of the bunker as an exhibition space is more interesting than in a typical gallery .
she says her work - like her sculpture " speechless " currently on display - is transformed in a way in this environment .
the candy pink sculpture looks like a bomb and is covered with plaster cast teeth . " in most exhibition spaces it 's a comic sculpture but here in the bunker it takes on a different meaning , " said schuelke . in the final exhibition room two large paintings of red poppies , the symbol of war remembrance in some countries , lie flat on two metal army beds .
along the bottom of the paintings are thick , milky strips of paint . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the lights go out marni 's installation transforms flashlights are handed out and the lights go off .
then participants use the light from the flashlights to draw patterns on the reflective white paint at the bottom edge of the paintings and on other white strips hung on the walls around the room .
lasers project red patterns on the ceiling while a mix of classical and electronic music plays . some participants draw squiggles , others peace signs while some choose to reflect simply on their surroundings .
for the installation 's creators , marni -lrb- the duo of nika rossmöller-schmidt and martin schmidt -rrb- , the bunker is all about insiders and outsiders and protection . and when it comes to protection at least the artists wo n't have to worry about insuring their art - it should be quite safe in the bunker . should a catastrophe happen during the next two weeks , lutterbeck at least has the keys to the bunker . stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the famous race track , often called " the ring , " has been a favorite among motor sport enthusiasts and tourists since its opening in 1927 . located around the village and medieval castle of nürburg in the eifel mountains , the racing track at the nürburgring is known around the world for its extraordinary formula 1 grand prix racing , but it can also be driven by any visitor with a valid driver 's license .
the constant noise produced by race cars speeding by can get visitors in the mood for serious automotive action .
daily drives , guided backstage tours , field trips and adventure parks are a few of the possibilities offered besides the big races .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test your car and your driving skill on the northern loop the most famous of the attractions is the nordschleife , or northern loop , which is more popularly known as the green hell .
it is made up of 20,8 kilometers -lrb- 13 miles -rrb- of challenging one-way track in beautiful surroundings on which any driver can assess his or her racing abilities .
" the nürburgring myth is definitely tied to the green hell , as jackie stewart baptized the track , " said walter kafitz , ceo of the nürburgring .
" history has been written here . "
" at the first race in 1927 there were hundreds of thousands of visitors there .
today , there are about two million guests on the ring yearly who come to experience the place 's unique atmosphere , " he said .
not just for professionals bildunterschrift : the green hell : it 's a picturesque inferno the so called " tourist drives , " which have taken place since 1927 , welcome anybody who wants to take part .
" driving on the nordschleife personally is for many fans the highlight , " kafitz said .
although there is no oncoming traffic , driving the northern loop is challenging for amateurs since it can be hard to judge where exactly on the track to drive .
there are no lane markings , but there are many sharp curves and slopes .
due to the number of drivers , and the potential hazards , there are specific rules that need to be followed .
one suggestion : drivers and passengers on the northern loop should go easy on foods that could upset your stomach if they do n't want a serious case of car sickness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ring has known its share of tragedy a regular visitor to the ring , christopher heiser , who has a web page devoted to the track and racing devotees , has said that " nothing , absolutely nothing will prepare you for your first time around the track .
it is nothing like anything you 've ever driven on .
the track is so much bigger , so much steeper , so much faster than you can possibly imagine . "
the history of the legend the nürburgring opened on june 18 , 1927 as a dedicated racing circuit .
soon after it was obvious how important an economic role it would play for the entire region .
" restaurants with spare rooms became hotels , cow fields became parking lots , and racing became a blessing for one of the poorest regions in germany , " said kafitz .
after the war , reconstruction work began in 1947 and the eifel cup was held , rushing in a new nürburgring racing era , according to kafitz .
" the entrance fee was five reichsmarks , with a voucher for wine , sausage and bread .
four years later the first formula one world championship took place and the ring became international , " he said .
life beyond cars bildunterschrift : the nürburgring puts on many large-scale events the nürburgring area is an ideal tourist destination with its striking scenery , churches , lakes , castles , museums and notable architecture - besides the race track , of course . although few would call the northern loop " regular , " but those who do find the fairly flat track uninteresting can turn their attentions to the off-road park and try a little four-wheeling .
there is more than just four-wheel-centered activity .
guests can ride bikes on the bike-lane that runs parallel to the northern loop .
part of the 30 kilometer -lrb- 18.6 mile -rrb- ride runs through forests near the town of adenau .
those who prefer staying on their own two feet can take on a hiking trail , with a guide providing information about the history of the track as well as the whole eifel area .
camping facilities are also available .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much more is in the planning for the nürburgring plans are to develop the nürburgring into a year-round recreation and business center , with event possibilities that do n't depend on good weather , according to kafitz .
poor conditions can shut the track down for weeks .
" there will also be a roller coaster that will have an acceleration value like formula one race cars , directly above the actual start and finish lines - 365 days a year , " kafitz said . tina pandza send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

inside it is a maze of cement passages covering several levels and usually filled with nothing more than army-issue mattresses , green metal folding beds and water purification tablets . according bonn ’ s emergency services the bunker could be used in the event of any future catastrophe , including a terrorist attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the outside the windeck bunker looks like a big cube but this october the bunker has become a refuge for ten german artists who are participating in an exhibition called " licht in den bunker " or " light in the bunker . "
for exhibition organizer and artist gabriele lutterbeck the bunker is a unique and very german place . " we had world war two and we had the nazi regime which ended in a bunker , " she said .
" we wanted to use a space that was old and of no use today and which provides a very special atmosphere . " a world war ii relic built in 1940 , the windeck bunker was an air raid shelter for bonn ’ s residents .
today it is closed to the public and this is the first time an independent art exhibition has been held in the space .
two previous exhibitions were organized by the city of bonn in the bunker as part of local festivals . while some of bonn ’ s residents were glad to stay in the bunker during the war due to the protection it provided , many people today cringe at the thought . " i 'm not sure i want to stay in there - the art is nice but everything else is horrible .
it ’ s creepy because it makes us think about war and everything that could force us go there , " lutterbeck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only twenty people are permitted in the bunker at a time " there 's a strange sensation when you turn the big , red heavy door to go down into the bunker " she said . on the other side of a red metal door marked schleuse , or gate , visitors climb into a large , square cement room and see the spartan green metal beds and mattresses , and the thin tin partitions that hide toilets behind them . in the middle of the room thomas schneider 's " self-made sm-chair , " a wooden torture chair , immediately puts a chill in the room .
opposite the chair , stuffed colored parrots are arranged behind a glass frame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schneider ’ s installation the " twin-tower-cigarette lighter , " a cigarette lighter decorated with the skyline of new york with the world trade center still standing , is schneider ’ s third work exhibited .
the top of the cigarette lighter is open , splitting the design and cutting the towers in two . lutterbeck said the artists decided to exhibit their existing works or create pieces specifically for the exhibition that would relate to a wartime bunker and the themes associated with it . connecting with germany 's nazi past the three pieces lutterbeck prepared for the exhibition are a very personal reaction to the space .
when she decided to hold an exhibition in the bunker she initially focussed on her own private and personal reactions to it . " i really went into the nazi story because this bunker , although it was changed and maintained , is really a world war ii bunker , " she said her series of blue sketches are a reaction to the lebensborn project – a nazi ss program that set up maternity homes where women of " pure blood " could bear children who fitted the nazi 's preferred racial profile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutterbeck 's work is her personal reaction to the bunker lutterbeck 's second work features the six goebbels children who died in berlin bunker .
their mother , magda , who was married to hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , allegedly killed the children with cyanide capsules in hitler 's führer bunker on may 1 , 1945 .
lutterbeck 's painting features the family and was photographed and made into a slide which is projected onto the bunker wall . " i put it on a slide because germans like to have these slide shows , usually at christmas , where families look at their own pictures , " she said . everything lutterbeck knows about bunkers comes from her parents who are now deceased .
in order to represent this lutterbeck also chose to exhibit a photograph of her mother at age 12 . a symbol of security during world war ii , the bunker was divided into cells and the nazi party allocated the spaces where between eight to ten people , and later up to 15 people , sat on wooden benches from 5 p.m. every afternoon .
in the last four months leading up to the allies ' arrival in bonn the bunker became even more overcrowded as the number of people looking for safety grew . walter , a 73 -year-old bonn resident who did n't want to give his last name , sought refuge in the bunker with his family when he was aged ten .
he said it was the only place he felt safe . " it 's not a terrible place for me because it was a place of security .
it was a wonderful place and the terrible conditions were accepted because the alternatives were worse , " said walter , who was at the exhibition 's opening . while the bunker for him symbolizes security , he thought having an art exhibition in the space was a " good idea because it demonstrates that the same place can be different depending on the circumstances . " art takes on a different meaning the second floor of the exhibition is much lighter in its themes with tine holterhoff 's colorful photographs featuring facades in red , yellow and blue arranged in grids brighten up the otherwise bleak room .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tatjana schuelke 's speechless takes on a different meaning in the space for berlin artist tatjana schuelke , the use of the bunker as an exhibition space is more interesting than in a typical gallery .

the candy pink sculpture looks like a bomb and is covered with plaster cast teeth . " in most exhibition spaces it 's a comic sculpture but here in the bunker it takes on a different meaning , " said schuelke . in the final exhibition room two large paintings of red poppies , the symbol of war remembrance in some countries , lie flat on two metal army beds .

inside it is a maze of cement passages covering several levels and usually filled with nothing more than army-issue mattresses , green metal folding beds and water purification tablets . according bonn ’ s emergency services the bunker could be used in the event of any future catastrophe , including a terrorist attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the outside the windeck bunker looks like a big cube but this october the bunker has become a refuge for ten german artists who are participating in an exhibition called " licht in den bunker " or " light in the bunker . "
for exhibition organizer and artist gabriele lutterbeck the bunker is a unique and very german place . " we had world war two and we had the nazi regime which ended in a bunker , " she said .
" we wanted to use a space that was old and of no use today and which provides a very special atmosphere . " a world war ii relic built in 1940 , the windeck bunker was an air raid shelter for bonn ’ s residents .
today it is closed to the public and this is the first time an independent art exhibition has been held in the space .
two previous exhibitions were organized by the city of bonn in the bunker as part of local festivals . while some of bonn ’ s residents were glad to stay in the bunker during the war due to the protection it provided , many people today cringe at the thought . " i 'm not sure i want to stay in there - the art is nice but everything else is horrible .
it ’ s creepy because it makes us think about war and everything that could force us go there , " lutterbeck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only twenty people are permitted in the bunker at a time " there 's a strange sensation when you turn the big , red heavy door to go down into the bunker " she said . on the other side of a red metal door marked schleuse , or gate , visitors climb into a large , square cement room and see the spartan green metal beds and mattresses , and the thin tin partitions that hide toilets behind them . in the middle of the room thomas schneider 's " self-made sm-chair , " a wooden torture chair , immediately puts a chill in the room .
opposite the chair , stuffed colored parrots are arranged behind a glass frame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schneider ’ s installation the " twin-tower-cigarette lighter , " a cigarette lighter decorated with the skyline of new york with the world trade center still standing , is schneider ’ s third work exhibited .
the top of the cigarette lighter is open , splitting the design and cutting the towers in two . lutterbeck said the artists decided to exhibit their existing works or create pieces specifically for the exhibition that would relate to a wartime bunker and the themes associated with it . connecting with germany 's nazi past the three pieces lutterbeck prepared for the exhibition are a very personal reaction to the space .
when she decided to hold an exhibition in the bunker she initially focussed on her own private and personal reactions to it . " i really went into the nazi story because this bunker , although it was changed and maintained , is really a world war ii bunker , " she said her series of blue sketches are a reaction to the lebensborn project – a nazi ss program that set up maternity homes where women of " pure blood " could bear children who fitted the nazi 's preferred racial profile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutterbeck 's work is her personal reaction to the bunker lutterbeck 's second work features the six goebbels children who died in berlin bunker .
their mother , magda , who was married to hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , allegedly killed the children with cyanide capsules in hitler 's führer bunker on may 1 , 1945 .
lutterbeck 's painting features the family and was photographed and made into a slide which is projected onto the bunker wall . " i put it on a slide because germans like to have these slide shows , usually at christmas , where families look at their own pictures , " she said . everything lutterbeck knows about bunkers comes from her parents who are now deceased .
in order to represent this lutterbeck also chose to exhibit a photograph of her mother at age 12 . a symbol of security during world war ii , the bunker was divided into cells and the nazi party allocated the spaces where between eight to ten people , and later up to 15 people , sat on wooden benches from 5 p.m. every afternoon .
in the last four months leading up to the allies ' arrival in bonn the bunker became even more overcrowded as the number of people looking for safety grew . walter , a 73 -year-old bonn resident who did n't want to give his last name , sought refuge in the bunker with his family when he was aged ten .
he said it was the only place he felt safe . " it 's not a terrible place for me because it was a place of security .
it was a wonderful place and the terrible conditions were accepted because the alternatives were worse , " said walter , who was at the exhibition 's opening . while the bunker for him symbolizes security , he thought having an art exhibition in the space was a " good idea because it demonstrates that the same place can be different depending on the circumstances . " art takes on a different meaning the second floor of the exhibition is much lighter in its themes with tine holterhoff 's colorful photographs featuring facades in red , yellow and blue arranged in grids brighten up the otherwise bleak room .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tatjana schuelke 's speechless takes on a different meaning in the space for berlin artist tatjana schuelke , the use of the bunker as an exhibition space is more interesting than in a typical gallery .
she says her work - like her sculpture " speechless " currently on display - is transformed in a way in this environment .
the candy pink sculpture looks like a bomb and is covered with plaster cast teeth . " in most exhibition spaces it 's a comic sculpture but here in the bunker it takes on a different meaning , " said schuelke . in the final exhibition room two large paintings of red poppies , the symbol of war remembrance in some countries , lie flat on two metal army beds .
along the bottom of the paintings are thick , milky strips of paint . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the lights go out marni 's installation transforms flashlights are handed out and the lights go off .
then participants use the light from the flashlights to draw patterns on the reflective white paint at the bottom edge of the paintings and on other white strips hung on the walls around the room .
lasers project red patterns on the ceiling while a mix of classical and electronic music plays . some participants draw squiggles , others peace signs while some choose to reflect simply on their surroundings .
for the installation 's creators , marni -lrb- the duo of nika rossmöller-schmidt and martin schmidt -rrb- , the bunker is all about insiders and outsiders and protection . and when it comes to protection at least the artists wo n't have to worry about insuring their art - it should be quite safe in the bunker . should a catastrophe happen during the next two weeks , lutterbeck at least has the keys to the bunker . stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the famous race track , often called " the ring , " has been a favorite among motor sport enthusiasts and tourists since its opening in 1927 . located around the village and medieval castle of nürburg in the eifel mountains , the racing track at the nürburgring is known around the world for its extraordinary formula 1 grand prix racing , but it can also be driven by any visitor with a valid driver 's license .
the constant noise produced by race cars speeding by can get visitors in the mood for serious automotive action .
daily drives , guided backstage tours , field trips and adventure parks are a few of the possibilities offered besides the big races .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test your car and your driving skill on the northern loop the most famous of the attractions is the nordschleife , or northern loop , which is more popularly known as the green hell .
it is made up of 20,8 kilometers -lrb- 13 miles -rrb- of challenging one-way track in beautiful surroundings on which any driver can assess his or her racing abilities .
" the nürburgring myth is definitely tied to the green hell , as jackie stewart baptized the track , " said walter kafitz , ceo of the nürburgring .
" history has been written here . "
" at the first race in 1927 there were hundreds of thousands of visitors there .
today , there are about two million guests on the ring yearly who come to experience the place 's unique atmosphere , " he said .
not just for professionals bildunterschrift : the green hell : it 's a picturesque inferno the so called " tourist drives , " which have taken place since 1927 , welcome anybody who wants to take part .
" driving on the nordschleife personally is for many fans the highlight , " kafitz said .
although there is no oncoming traffic , driving the northern loop is challenging for amateurs since it can be hard to judge where exactly on the track to drive .
there are no lane markings , but there are many sharp curves and slopes .
due to the number of drivers , and the potential hazards , there are specific rules that need to be followed .
one suggestion : drivers and passengers on the northern loop should go easy on foods that could upset your stomach if they do n't want a serious case of car sickness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ring has known its share of tragedy a regular visitor to the ring , christopher heiser , who has a web page devoted to the track and racing devotees , has said that " nothing , absolutely nothing will prepare you for your first time around the track .
it is nothing like anything you 've ever driven on .
the track is so much bigger , so much steeper , so much faster than you can possibly imagine . "
the history of the legend the nürburgring opened on june 18 , 1927 as a dedicated racing circuit .
soon after it was obvious how important an economic role it would play for the entire region .
" restaurants with spare rooms became hotels , cow fields became parking lots , and racing became a blessing for one of the poorest regions in germany , " said kafitz .
after the war , reconstruction work began in 1947 and the eifel cup was held , rushing in a new nürburgring racing era , according to kafitz .
" the entrance fee was five reichsmarks , with a voucher for wine , sausage and bread .
four years later the first formula one world championship took place and the ring became international , " he said .
life beyond cars bildunterschrift : the nürburgring puts on many large-scale events the nürburgring area is an ideal tourist destination with its striking scenery , churches , lakes , castles , museums and notable architecture - besides the race track , of course . although few would call the northern loop " regular , " but those who do find the fairly flat track uninteresting can turn their attentions to the off-road park and try a little four-wheeling .
there is more than just four-wheel-centered activity .
guests can ride bikes on the bike-lane that runs parallel to the northern loop .
part of the 30 kilometer -lrb- 18.6 mile -rrb- ride runs through forests near the town of adenau .
those who prefer staying on their own two feet can take on a hiking trail , with a guide providing information about the history of the track as well as the whole eifel area .
camping facilities are also available .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much more is in the planning for the nürburgring plans are to develop the nürburgring into a year-round recreation and business center , with event possibilities that do n't depend on good weather , according to kafitz .
poor conditions can shut the track down for weeks .
" there will also be a roller coaster that will have an acceleration value like formula one race cars , directly above the actual start and finish lines - 365 days a year , " kafitz said . tina pandza send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

inside it is a maze of cement passages covering several levels and usually filled with nothing more than army-issue mattresses , green metal folding beds and water purification tablets . according bonn ’ s emergency services the bunker could be used in the event of any future catastrophe , including a terrorist attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the outside the windeck bunker looks like a big cube but this october the bunker has become a refuge for ten german artists who are participating in an exhibition called " licht in den bunker " or " light in the bunker . "
for exhibition organizer and artist gabriele lutterbeck the bunker is a unique and very german place . " we had world war two and we had the nazi regime which ended in a bunker , " she said .
" we wanted to use a space that was old and of no use today and which provides a very special atmosphere . " a world war ii relic built in 1940 , the windeck bunker was an air raid shelter for bonn ’ s residents .
today it is closed to the public and this is the first time an independent art exhibition has been held in the space .
two previous exhibitions were organized by the city of bonn in the bunker as part of local festivals . while some of bonn ’ s residents were glad to stay in the bunker during the war due to the protection it provided , many people today cringe at the thought . " i 'm not sure i want to stay in there - the art is nice but everything else is horrible .
it ’ s creepy because it makes us think about war and everything that could force us go there , " lutterbeck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only twenty people are permitted in the bunker at a time " there 's a strange sensation when you turn the big , red heavy door to go down into the bunker " she said . on the other side of a red metal door marked schleuse , or gate , visitors climb into a large , square cement room and see the spartan green metal beds and mattresses , and the thin tin partitions that hide toilets behind them . in the middle of the room thomas schneider 's " self-made sm-chair , " a wooden torture chair , immediately puts a chill in the room .
opposite the chair , stuffed colored parrots are arranged behind a glass frame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schneider ’ s installation the " twin-tower-cigarette lighter , " a cigarette lighter decorated with the skyline of new york with the world trade center still standing , is schneider ’ s third work exhibited .
the top of the cigarette lighter is open , splitting the design and cutting the towers in two . lutterbeck said the artists decided to exhibit their existing works or create pieces specifically for the exhibition that would relate to a wartime bunker and the themes associated with it . connecting with germany 's nazi past the three pieces lutterbeck prepared for the exhibition are a very personal reaction to the space .
when she decided to hold an exhibition in the bunker she initially focussed on her own private and personal reactions to it . " i really went into the nazi story because this bunker , although it was changed and maintained , is really a world war ii bunker , " she said her series of blue sketches are a reaction to the lebensborn project – a nazi ss program that set up maternity homes where women of " pure blood " could bear children who fitted the nazi 's preferred racial profile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutterbeck 's work is her personal reaction to the bunker lutterbeck 's second work features the six goebbels children who died in berlin bunker .
their mother , magda , who was married to hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , allegedly killed the children with cyanide capsules in hitler 's führer bunker on may 1 , 1945 .
lutterbeck 's painting features the family and was photographed and made into a slide which is projected onto the bunker wall . " i put it on a slide because germans like to have these slide shows , usually at christmas , where families look at their own pictures , " she said . everything lutterbeck knows about bunkers comes from her parents who are now deceased .
in order to represent this lutterbeck also chose to exhibit a photograph of her mother at age 12 . a symbol of security during world war ii , the bunker was divided into cells and the nazi party allocated the spaces where between eight to ten people , and later up to 15 people , sat on wooden benches from 5 p.m. every afternoon .
in the last four months leading up to the allies ' arrival in bonn the bunker became even more overcrowded as the number of people looking for safety grew . walter , a 73 -year-old bonn resident who did n't want to give his last name , sought refuge in the bunker with his family when he was aged ten .
he said it was the only place he felt safe . " it 's not a terrible place for me because it was a place of security .
it was a wonderful place and the terrible conditions were accepted because the alternatives were worse , " said walter , who was at the exhibition 's opening . while the bunker for him symbolizes security , he thought having an art exhibition in the space was a " good idea because it demonstrates that the same place can be different depending on the circumstances . " art takes on a different meaning the second floor of the exhibition is much lighter in its themes with tine holterhoff 's colorful photographs featuring facades in red , yellow and blue arranged in grids brighten up the otherwise bleak room .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tatjana schuelke 's speechless takes on a different meaning in the space for berlin artist tatjana schuelke , the use of the bunker as an exhibition space is more interesting than in a typical gallery .
she says her work - like her sculpture " speechless " currently on display - is transformed in a way in this environment .
the candy pink sculpture looks like a bomb and is covered with plaster cast teeth . " in most exhibition spaces it 's a comic sculpture but here in the bunker it takes on a different meaning , " said schuelke . in the final exhibition room two large paintings of red poppies , the symbol of war remembrance in some countries , lie flat on two metal army beds .
along the bottom of the paintings are thick , milky strips of paint . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the lights go out marni 's installation transforms flashlights are handed out and the lights go off .
then participants use the light from the flashlights to draw patterns on the reflective white paint at the bottom edge of the paintings and on other white strips hung on the walls around the room .
lasers project red patterns on the ceiling while a mix of classical and electronic music plays . some participants draw squiggles , others peace signs while some choose to reflect simply on their surroundings .
for the installation 's creators , marni -lrb- the duo of nika rossmöller-schmidt and martin schmidt -rrb- , the bunker is all about insiders and outsiders and protection . and when it comes to protection at least the artists wo n't have to worry about insuring their art - it should be quite safe in the bunker . should a catastrophe happen during the next two weeks , lutterbeck at least has the keys to the bunker . stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the famous race track , often called " the ring , " has been a favorite among motor sport enthusiasts and tourists since its opening in 1927 . located around the village and medieval castle of nürburg in the eifel mountains , the racing track at the nürburgring is known around the world for its extraordinary formula 1 grand prix racing , but it can also be driven by any visitor with a valid driver 's license .
the constant noise produced by race cars speeding by can get visitors in the mood for serious automotive action .
daily drives , guided backstage tours , field trips and adventure parks are a few of the possibilities offered besides the big races .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test your car and your driving skill on the northern loop the most famous of the attractions is the nordschleife , or northern loop , which is more popularly known as the green hell .
it is made up of 20,8 kilometers -lrb- 13 miles -rrb- of challenging one-way track in beautiful surroundings on which any driver can assess his or her racing abilities .
" the nürburgring myth is definitely tied to the green hell , as jackie stewart baptized the track , " said walter kafitz , ceo of the nürburgring .
" history has been written here . "
" at the first race in 1927 there were hundreds of thousands of visitors there .
today , there are about two million guests on the ring yearly who come to experience the place 's unique atmosphere , " he said .
not just for professionals bildunterschrift : the green hell : it 's a picturesque inferno the so called " tourist drives , " which have taken place since 1927 , welcome anybody who wants to take part .
" driving on the nordschleife personally is for many fans the highlight , " kafitz said .
although there is no oncoming traffic , driving the northern loop is challenging for amateurs since it can be hard to judge where exactly on the track to drive .
there are no lane markings , but there are many sharp curves and slopes .
due to the number of drivers , and the potential hazards , there are specific rules that need to be followed .
one suggestion : drivers and passengers on the northern loop should go easy on foods that could upset your stomach if they do n't want a serious case of car sickness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ring has known its share of tragedy a regular visitor to the ring , christopher heiser , who has a web page devoted to the track and racing devotees , has said that " nothing , absolutely nothing will prepare you for your first time around the track .
it is nothing like anything you 've ever driven on .
the track is so much bigger , so much steeper , so much faster than you can possibly imagine . "
the history of the legend the nürburgring opened on june 18 , 1927 as a dedicated racing circuit .
soon after it was obvious how important an economic role it would play for the entire region .
" restaurants with spare rooms became hotels , cow fields became parking lots , and racing became a blessing for one of the poorest regions in germany , " said kafitz .
after the war , reconstruction work began in 1947 and the eifel cup was held , rushing in a new nürburgring racing era , according to kafitz .
" the entrance fee was five reichsmarks , with a voucher for wine , sausage and bread .
four years later the first formula one world championship took place and the ring became international , " he said .
life beyond cars bildunterschrift : the nürburgring puts on many large-scale events the nürburgring area is an ideal tourist destination with its striking scenery , churches , lakes , castles , museums and notable architecture - besides the race track , of course . although few would call the northern loop " regular , " but those who do find the fairly flat track uninteresting can turn their attentions to the off-road park and try a little four-wheeling .
there is more than just four-wheel-centered activity .
guests can ride bikes on the bike-lane that runs parallel to the northern loop .
part of the 30 kilometer -lrb- 18.6 mile -rrb- ride runs through forests near the town of adenau .
those who prefer staying on their own two feet can take on a hiking trail , with a guide providing information about the history of the track as well as the whole eifel area .
camping facilities are also available .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much more is in the planning for the nürburgring plans are to develop the nürburgring into a year-round recreation and business center , with event possibilities that do n't depend on good weather , according to kafitz .
poor conditions can shut the track down for weeks .
" there will also be a roller coaster that will have an acceleration value like formula one race cars , directly above the actual start and finish lines - 365 days a year , " kafitz said . tina pandza send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

inside it is a maze of cement passages covering several levels and usually filled with nothing more than army-issue mattresses , green metal folding beds and water purification tablets . according bonn ’ s emergency services the bunker could be used in the event of any future catastrophe , including a terrorist attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the outside the windeck bunker looks like a big cube but this october the bunker has become a refuge for ten german artists who are participating in an exhibition called " licht in den bunker " or " light in the bunker . "
for exhibition organizer and artist gabriele lutterbeck the bunker is a unique and very german place . " we had world war two and we had the nazi regime which ended in a bunker , " she said .
" we wanted to use a space that was old and of no use today and which provides a very special atmosphere . " a world war ii relic built in 1940 , the windeck bunker was an air raid shelter for bonn ’ s residents .
today it is closed to the public and this is the first time an independent art exhibition has been held in the space .
two previous exhibitions were organized by the city of bonn in the bunker as part of local festivals . while some of bonn ’ s residents were glad to stay in the bunker during the war due to the protection it provided , many people today cringe at the thought . " i 'm not sure i want to stay in there - the art is nice but everything else is horrible .
it ’ s creepy because it makes us think about war and everything that could force us go there , " lutterbeck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only twenty people are permitted in the bunker at a time " there 's a strange sensation when you turn the big , red heavy door to go down into the bunker " she said . on the other side of a red metal door marked schleuse , or gate , visitors climb into a large , square cement room and see the spartan green metal beds and mattresses , and the thin tin partitions that hide toilets behind them . in the middle of the room thomas schneider 's " self-made sm-chair , " a wooden torture chair , immediately puts a chill in the room .
opposite the chair , stuffed colored parrots are arranged behind a glass frame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schneider ’ s installation the " twin-tower-cigarette lighter , " a cigarette lighter decorated with the skyline of new york with the world trade center still standing , is schneider ’ s third work exhibited .
the top of the cigarette lighter is open , splitting the design and cutting the towers in two . lutterbeck said the artists decided to exhibit their existing works or create pieces specifically for the exhibition that would relate to a wartime bunker and the themes associated with it . connecting with germany 's nazi past the three pieces lutterbeck prepared for the exhibition are a very personal reaction to the space .
when she decided to hold an exhibition in the bunker she initially focussed on her own private and personal reactions to it . " i really went into the nazi story because this bunker , although it was changed and maintained , is really a world war ii bunker , " she said her series of blue sketches are a reaction to the lebensborn project – a nazi ss program that set up maternity homes where women of " pure blood " could bear children who fitted the nazi 's preferred racial profile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutterbeck 's work is her personal reaction to the bunker lutterbeck 's second work features the six goebbels children who died in berlin bunker .
their mother , magda , who was married to hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , allegedly killed the children with cyanide capsules in hitler 's führer bunker on may 1 , 1945 .
lutterbeck 's painting features the family and was photographed and made into a slide which is projected onto the bunker wall . " i put it on a slide because germans like to have these slide shows , usually at christmas , where families look at their own pictures , " she said . everything lutterbeck knows about bunkers comes from her parents who are now deceased .
in order to represent this lutterbeck also chose to exhibit a photograph of her mother at age 12 . a symbol of security during world war ii , the bunker was divided into cells and the nazi party allocated the spaces where between eight to ten people , and later up to 15 people , sat on wooden benches from 5 p.m. every afternoon .
in the last four months leading up to the allies ' arrival in bonn the bunker became even more overcrowded as the number of people looking for safety grew . walter , a 73 -year-old bonn resident who did n't want to give his last name , sought refuge in the bunker with his family when he was aged ten .
he said it was the only place he felt safe . " it 's not a terrible place for me because it was a place of security .
it was a wonderful place and the terrible conditions were accepted because the alternatives were worse , " said walter , who was at the exhibition 's opening . while the bunker for him symbolizes security , he thought having an art exhibition in the space was a " good idea because it demonstrates that the same place can be different depending on the circumstances . " art takes on a different meaning the second floor of the exhibition is much lighter in its themes with tine holterhoff 's colorful photographs featuring facades in red , yellow and blue arranged in grids brighten up the otherwise bleak room .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tatjana schuelke 's speechless takes on a different meaning in the space for berlin artist tatjana schuelke , the use of the bunker as an exhibition space is more interesting than in a typical gallery .
she says her work - like her sculpture " speechless " currently on display - is transformed in a way in this environment .
the candy pink sculpture looks like a bomb and is covered with plaster cast teeth . " in most exhibition spaces it 's a comic sculpture but here in the bunker it takes on a different meaning , " said schuelke . in the final exhibition room two large paintings of red poppies , the symbol of war remembrance in some countries , lie flat on two metal army beds .
along the bottom of the paintings are thick , milky strips of paint . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the lights go out marni 's installation transforms flashlights are handed out and the lights go off .
then participants use the light from the flashlights to draw patterns on the reflective white paint at the bottom edge of the paintings and on other white strips hung on the walls around the room .
lasers project red patterns on the ceiling while a mix of classical and electronic music plays . some participants draw squiggles , others peace signs while some choose to reflect simply on their surroundings .
for the installation 's creators , marni -lrb- the duo of nika rossmöller-schmidt and martin schmidt -rrb- , the bunker is all about insiders and outsiders and protection . and when it comes to protection at least the artists wo n't have to worry about insuring their art - it should be quite safe in the bunker . should a catastrophe happen during the next two weeks , lutterbeck at least has the keys to the bunker . stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two previous exhibitions were organized by the city of bonn in the bunker as part of local festivals . while some of bonn ’ s residents were glad to stay in the bunker during the war due to the protection it provided , many people today cringe at the thought . " i 'm not sure i want to stay in there - the art is nice but everything else is horrible .
it ’ s creepy because it makes us think about war and everything that could force us go there , " lutterbeck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only twenty people are permitted in the bunker at a time " there 's a strange sensation when you turn the big , red heavy door to go down into the bunker " she said . on the other side of a red metal door marked schleuse , or gate , visitors climb into a large , square cement room and see the spartan green metal beds and mattresses , and the thin tin partitions that hide toilets behind them . in the middle of the room thomas schneider 's " self-made sm-chair , " a wooden torture chair , immediately puts a chill in the room .
opposite the chair , stuffed colored parrots are arranged behind a glass frame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schneider ’ s installation the " twin-tower-cigarette lighter , " a cigarette lighter decorated with the skyline of new york with the world trade center still standing , is schneider ’ s third work exhibited .
the top of the cigarette lighter is open , splitting the design and cutting the towers in two . lutterbeck said the artists decided to exhibit their existing works or create pieces specifically for the exhibition that would relate to a wartime bunker and the themes associated with it . connecting with germany 's nazi past the three pieces lutterbeck prepared for the exhibition are a very personal reaction to the space .
when she decided to hold an exhibition in the bunker she initially focussed on her own private and personal reactions to it . " i really went into the nazi story because this bunker , although it was changed and maintained , is really a world war ii bunker , " she said her series of blue sketches are a reaction to the lebensborn project – a nazi ss program that set up maternity homes where women of " pure blood " could bear children who fitted the nazi 's preferred racial profile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutterbeck 's work is her personal reaction to the bunker lutterbeck 's second work features the six goebbels children who died in berlin bunker .
their mother , magda , who was married to hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , allegedly killed the children with cyanide capsules in hitler 's führer bunker on may 1 , 1945 .
lutterbeck 's painting features the family and was photographed and made into a slide which is projected onto the bunker wall . " i put it on a slide because germans like to have these slide shows , usually at christmas , where families look at their own pictures , " she said . everything lutterbeck knows about bunkers comes from her parents who are now deceased .
in order to represent this lutterbeck also chose to exhibit a photograph of her mother at age 12 . a symbol of security during world war ii , the bunker was divided into cells and the nazi party allocated the spaces where between eight to ten people , and later up to 15 people , sat on wooden benches from 5 p.m. every afternoon .
in the last four months leading up to the allies ' arrival in bonn the bunker became even more overcrowded as the number of people looking for safety grew . walter , a 73 -year-old bonn resident who did n't want to give his last name , sought refuge in the bunker with his family when he was aged ten .
he said it was the only place he felt safe . " it 's not a terrible place for me because it was a place of security .
it was a wonderful place and the terrible conditions were accepted because the alternatives were worse , " said walter , who was at the exhibition 's opening . while the bunker for him symbolizes security , he thought having an art exhibition in the space was a " good idea because it demonstrates that the same place can be different depending on the circumstances . " art takes on a different meaning the second floor of the exhibition is much lighter in its themes with tine holterhoff 's colorful photographs featuring facades in red , yellow and blue arranged in grids brighten up the otherwise bleak room .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tatjana schuelke 's speechless takes on a different meaning in the space for berlin artist tatjana schuelke , the use of the bunker as an exhibition space is more interesting than in a typical gallery .

the candy pink sculpture looks like a bomb and is covered with plaster cast teeth . " in most exhibition spaces it 's a comic sculpture but here in the bunker it takes on a different meaning , " said schuelke . in the final exhibition room two large paintings of red poppies , the symbol of war remembrance in some countries , lie flat on two metal army beds .

opposite the chair , stuffed colored parrots are arranged behind a glass frame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schneider ’ s installation the " twin-tower-cigarette lighter , " a cigarette lighter decorated with the skyline of new york with the world trade center still standing , is schneider ’ s third work exhibited .
the top of the cigarette lighter is open , splitting the design and cutting the towers in two . lutterbeck said the artists decided to exhibit their existing works or create pieces specifically for the exhibition that would relate to a wartime bunker and the themes associated with it . connecting with germany 's nazi past the three pieces lutterbeck prepared for the exhibition are a very personal reaction to the space .
when she decided to hold an exhibition in the bunker she initially focussed on her own private and personal reactions to it . " i really went into the nazi story because this bunker , although it was changed and maintained , is really a world war ii bunker , " she said her series of blue sketches are a reaction to the lebensborn project – a nazi ss program that set up maternity homes where women of " pure blood " could bear children who fitted the nazi 's preferred racial profile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutterbeck 's work is her personal reaction to the bunker lutterbeck 's second work features the six goebbels children who died in berlin bunker .
their mother , magda , who was married to hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , allegedly killed the children with cyanide capsules in hitler 's führer bunker on may 1 , 1945 .
lutterbeck 's painting features the family and was photographed and made into a slide which is projected onto the bunker wall . " i put it on a slide because germans like to have these slide shows , usually at christmas , where families look at their own pictures , " she said . everything lutterbeck knows about bunkers comes from her parents who are now deceased .
in order to represent this lutterbeck also chose to exhibit a photograph of her mother at age 12 . a symbol of security during world war ii , the bunker was divided into cells and the nazi party allocated the spaces where between eight to ten people , and later up to 15 people , sat on wooden benches from 5 p.m. every afternoon .
in the last four months leading up to the allies ' arrival in bonn the bunker became even more overcrowded as the number of people looking for safety grew . walter , a 73 -year-old bonn resident who did n't want to give his last name , sought refuge in the bunker with his family when he was aged ten .
he said it was the only place he felt safe . " it 's not a terrible place for me because it was a place of security .
it was a wonderful place and the terrible conditions were accepted because the alternatives were worse , " said walter , who was at the exhibition 's opening . while the bunker for him symbolizes security , he thought having an art exhibition in the space was a " good idea because it demonstrates that the same place can be different depending on the circumstances . " art takes on a different meaning the second floor of the exhibition is much lighter in its themes with tine holterhoff 's colorful photographs featuring facades in red , yellow and blue arranged in grids brighten up the otherwise bleak room .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tatjana schuelke 's speechless takes on a different meaning in the space for berlin artist tatjana schuelke , the use of the bunker as an exhibition space is more interesting than in a typical gallery .
she says her work - like her sculpture " speechless " currently on display - is transformed in a way in this environment .
the candy pink sculpture looks like a bomb and is covered with plaster cast teeth . " in most exhibition spaces it 's a comic sculpture but here in the bunker it takes on a different meaning , " said schuelke . in the final exhibition room two large paintings of red poppies , the symbol of war remembrance in some countries , lie flat on two metal army beds .
along the bottom of the paintings are thick , milky strips of paint . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the lights go out marni 's installation transforms flashlights are handed out and the lights go off .
then participants use the light from the flashlights to draw patterns on the reflective white paint at the bottom edge of the paintings and on other white strips hung on the walls around the room .
lasers project red patterns on the ceiling while a mix of classical and electronic music plays . some participants draw squiggles , others peace signs while some choose to reflect simply on their surroundings .
for the installation 's creators , marni -lrb- the duo of nika rossmöller-schmidt and martin schmidt -rrb- , the bunker is all about insiders and outsiders and protection . and when it comes to protection at least the artists wo n't have to worry about insuring their art - it should be quite safe in the bunker . should a catastrophe happen during the next two weeks , lutterbeck at least has the keys to the bunker . stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the famous race track , often called " the ring , " has been a favorite among motor sport enthusiasts and tourists since its opening in 1927 . located around the village and medieval castle of nürburg in the eifel mountains , the racing track at the nürburgring is known around the world for its extraordinary formula 1 grand prix racing , but it can also be driven by any visitor with a valid driver 's license .
the constant noise produced by race cars speeding by can get visitors in the mood for serious automotive action .
daily drives , guided backstage tours , field trips and adventure parks are a few of the possibilities offered besides the big races .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test your car and your driving skill on the northern loop the most famous of the attractions is the nordschleife , or northern loop , which is more popularly known as the green hell .
it is made up of 20,8 kilometers -lrb- 13 miles -rrb- of challenging one-way track in beautiful surroundings on which any driver can assess his or her racing abilities .
" the nürburgring myth is definitely tied to the green hell , as jackie stewart baptized the track , " said walter kafitz , ceo of the nürburgring .
" history has been written here . "
" at the first race in 1927 there were hundreds of thousands of visitors there .
today , there are about two million guests on the ring yearly who come to experience the place 's unique atmosphere , " he said .
not just for professionals bildunterschrift : the green hell : it 's a picturesque inferno the so called " tourist drives , " which have taken place since 1927 , welcome anybody who wants to take part .
" driving on the nordschleife personally is for many fans the highlight , " kafitz said .
although there is no oncoming traffic , driving the northern loop is challenging for amateurs since it can be hard to judge where exactly on the track to drive .
there are no lane markings , but there are many sharp curves and slopes .
due to the number of drivers , and the potential hazards , there are specific rules that need to be followed .
one suggestion : drivers and passengers on the northern loop should go easy on foods that could upset your stomach if they do n't want a serious case of car sickness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ring has known its share of tragedy a regular visitor to the ring , christopher heiser , who has a web page devoted to the track and racing devotees , has said that " nothing , absolutely nothing will prepare you for your first time around the track .
it is nothing like anything you 've ever driven on .
the track is so much bigger , so much steeper , so much faster than you can possibly imagine . "
the history of the legend the nürburgring opened on june 18 , 1927 as a dedicated racing circuit .
soon after it was obvious how important an economic role it would play for the entire region .
" restaurants with spare rooms became hotels , cow fields became parking lots , and racing became a blessing for one of the poorest regions in germany , " said kafitz .
after the war , reconstruction work began in 1947 and the eifel cup was held , rushing in a new nürburgring racing era , according to kafitz .
" the entrance fee was five reichsmarks , with a voucher for wine , sausage and bread .
four years later the first formula one world championship took place and the ring became international , " he said .
life beyond cars bildunterschrift : the nürburgring puts on many large-scale events the nürburgring area is an ideal tourist destination with its striking scenery , churches , lakes , castles , museums and notable architecture - besides the race track , of course . although few would call the northern loop " regular , " but those who do find the fairly flat track uninteresting can turn their attentions to the off-road park and try a little four-wheeling .
there is more than just four-wheel-centered activity .
guests can ride bikes on the bike-lane that runs parallel to the northern loop .
part of the 30 kilometer -lrb- 18.6 mile -rrb- ride runs through forests near the town of adenau .
those who prefer staying on their own two feet can take on a hiking trail , with a guide providing information about the history of the track as well as the whole eifel area .
camping facilities are also available .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much more is in the planning for the nürburgring plans are to develop the nürburgring into a year-round recreation and business center , with event possibilities that do n't depend on good weather , according to kafitz .
poor conditions can shut the track down for weeks .

inside it is a maze of cement passages covering several levels and usually filled with nothing more than army-issue mattresses , green metal folding beds and water purification tablets . according bonn ’ s emergency services the bunker could be used in the event of any future catastrophe , including a terrorist attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the outside the windeck bunker looks like a big cube but this october the bunker has become a refuge for ten german artists who are participating in an exhibition called " licht in den bunker " or " light in the bunker . "
for exhibition organizer and artist gabriele lutterbeck the bunker is a unique and very german place . " we had world war two and we had the nazi regime which ended in a bunker , " she said .
" we wanted to use a space that was old and of no use today and which provides a very special atmosphere . " a world war ii relic built in 1940 , the windeck bunker was an air raid shelter for bonn ’ s residents .
today it is closed to the public and this is the first time an independent art exhibition has been held in the space .
two previous exhibitions were organized by the city of bonn in the bunker as part of local festivals . while some of bonn ’ s residents were glad to stay in the bunker during the war due to the protection it provided , many people today cringe at the thought . " i 'm not sure i want to stay in there - the art is nice but everything else is horrible .

inside it is a maze of cement passages covering several levels and usually filled with nothing more than army-issue mattresses , green metal folding beds and water purification tablets . according bonn ’ s emergency services the bunker could be used in the event of any future catastrophe , including a terrorist attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the outside the windeck bunker looks like a big cube but this october the bunker has become a refuge for ten german artists who are participating in an exhibition called " licht in den bunker " or " light in the bunker . "
for exhibition organizer and artist gabriele lutterbeck the bunker is a unique and very german place . " we had world war two and we had the nazi regime which ended in a bunker , " she said .
" we wanted to use a space that was old and of no use today and which provides a very special atmosphere . " a world war ii relic built in 1940 , the windeck bunker was an air raid shelter for bonn ’ s residents .
today it is closed to the public and this is the first time an independent art exhibition has been held in the space .
two previous exhibitions were organized by the city of bonn in the bunker as part of local festivals . while some of bonn ’ s residents were glad to stay in the bunker during the war due to the protection it provided , many people today cringe at the thought . " i 'm not sure i want to stay in there - the art is nice but everything else is horrible .
it ’ s creepy because it makes us think about war and everything that could force us go there , " lutterbeck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only twenty people are permitted in the bunker at a time " there 's a strange sensation when you turn the big , red heavy door to go down into the bunker " she said . on the other side of a red metal door marked schleuse , or gate , visitors climb into a large , square cement room and see the spartan green metal beds and mattresses , and the thin tin partitions that hide toilets behind them . in the middle of the room thomas schneider 's " self-made sm-chair , " a wooden torture chair , immediately puts a chill in the room .
opposite the chair , stuffed colored parrots are arranged behind a glass frame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schneider ’ s installation the " twin-tower-cigarette lighter , " a cigarette lighter decorated with the skyline of new york with the world trade center still standing , is schneider ’ s third work exhibited .
the top of the cigarette lighter is open , splitting the design and cutting the towers in two . lutterbeck said the artists decided to exhibit their existing works or create pieces specifically for the exhibition that would relate to a wartime bunker and the themes associated with it . connecting with germany 's nazi past the three pieces lutterbeck prepared for the exhibition are a very personal reaction to the space .
when she decided to hold an exhibition in the bunker she initially focussed on her own private and personal reactions to it . " i really went into the nazi story because this bunker , although it was changed and maintained , is really a world war ii bunker , " she said her series of blue sketches are a reaction to the lebensborn project – a nazi ss program that set up maternity homes where women of " pure blood " could bear children who fitted the nazi 's preferred racial profile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutterbeck 's work is her personal reaction to the bunker lutterbeck 's second work features the six goebbels children who died in berlin bunker .
their mother , magda , who was married to hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , allegedly killed the children with cyanide capsules in hitler 's führer bunker on may 1 , 1945 .
lutterbeck 's painting features the family and was photographed and made into a slide which is projected onto the bunker wall . " i put it on a slide because germans like to have these slide shows , usually at christmas , where families look at their own pictures , " she said . everything lutterbeck knows about bunkers comes from her parents who are now deceased .
in order to represent this lutterbeck also chose to exhibit a photograph of her mother at age 12 . a symbol of security during world war ii , the bunker was divided into cells and the nazi party allocated the spaces where between eight to ten people , and later up to 15 people , sat on wooden benches from 5 p.m. every afternoon .
in the last four months leading up to the allies ' arrival in bonn the bunker became even more overcrowded as the number of people looking for safety grew . walter , a 73 -year-old bonn resident who did n't want to give his last name , sought refuge in the bunker with his family when he was aged ten .
he said it was the only place he felt safe . " it 's not a terrible place for me because it was a place of security .
it was a wonderful place and the terrible conditions were accepted because the alternatives were worse , " said walter , who was at the exhibition 's opening . while the bunker for him symbolizes security , he thought having an art exhibition in the space was a " good idea because it demonstrates that the same place can be different depending on the circumstances . " art takes on a different meaning the second floor of the exhibition is much lighter in its themes with tine holterhoff 's colorful photographs featuring facades in red , yellow and blue arranged in grids brighten up the otherwise bleak room .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tatjana schuelke 's speechless takes on a different meaning in the space for berlin artist tatjana schuelke , the use of the bunker as an exhibition space is more interesting than in a typical gallery .
she says her work - like her sculpture " speechless " currently on display - is transformed in a way in this environment .
the candy pink sculpture looks like a bomb and is covered with plaster cast teeth . " in most exhibition spaces it 's a comic sculpture but here in the bunker it takes on a different meaning , " said schuelke . in the final exhibition room two large paintings of red poppies , the symbol of war remembrance in some countries , lie flat on two metal army beds .
along the bottom of the paintings are thick , milky strips of paint . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the lights go out marni 's installation transforms flashlights are handed out and the lights go off .
then participants use the light from the flashlights to draw patterns on the reflective white paint at the bottom edge of the paintings and on other white strips hung on the walls around the room .
lasers project red patterns on the ceiling while a mix of classical and electronic music plays . some participants draw squiggles , others peace signs while some choose to reflect simply on their surroundings .
for the installation 's creators , marni -lrb- the duo of nika rossmöller-schmidt and martin schmidt -rrb- , the bunker is all about insiders and outsiders and protection . and when it comes to protection at least the artists wo n't have to worry about insuring their art - it should be quite safe in the bunker . should a catastrophe happen during the next two weeks , lutterbeck at least has the keys to the bunker . stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 .
topics are expected to be energy security , economic questions and the us missile shield . a number of tough global issues will also be on the table at the meeting of the german and russian leaders in the german city of wiesbaden .
it comes straight after talks in moscow between us secretary of state condoleezza rice and her russian counterpart sergei lavrov , as well as both countries ' defense ministers .
russia strongly opposes us plans to deploy parts of its anti-missile defence system in the czech republic and poland .
moscow says the missiles will target russia and not " rogue states " such as iran and north korea , which washington says the system is designed to defend against . in rancorous bilateral talks on friday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice rejected a russian call to freeze plans to place 10 us interceptor missiles in poland and a targeting radar station in the czech republic by 2010 . a spokesman for the kremlin on sunday confirmed that putin would raise " questions of strategic stability within the context of the us missile shield project " with the chancellor .

it comes straight after talks in moscow between us secretary of state condoleezza rice and her russian counterpart sergei lavrov , as well as both countries ' defense ministers .
russia strongly opposes us plans to deploy parts of its anti-missile defence system in the czech republic and poland .
moscow says the missiles will target russia and not " rogue states " such as iran and north korea , which washington says the system is designed to defend against . in rancorous bilateral talks on friday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice rejected a russian call to freeze plans to place 10 us interceptor missiles in poland and a targeting radar station in the czech republic by 2010 . a spokesman for the kremlin on sunday confirmed that putin would raise " questions of strategic stability within the context of the us missile shield project " with the chancellor .
germany has taken a cautious stance on the issue , insisting that nato should be consulted about us plans and also warning poland and the czechs that their going it alone could prove divisive for europe . fyodor lukyanov , editor of the magazine russia in global affairs , says that he expects putin to try to play on germany 's " ambivalence " towards the shield .
putin has threatened to tear up several cold war-era agreements , including the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty which sets limits on troops , tanks and other hardware across the continent . bilateral issues russian presidential spokesman dimitri peskov said another priority of the talks would be on " clarifying " merkel 's position on bilateral investment projects , particularly those of gazprom in europe .

the commission is considering the introduction of a tough reciprocity clause for energy relations with third countries .
" of course , russia is looking for equal conditions and fair competition for russian companies , including gazprom , " peskov said ahead of the summit .
the talks in wiesbaden will stretch over two days , with the two leaders participating in a forum on monday , oct .

merkel and putin briefly clashed on the issue during her visit to russia in may , prompting the russian president to say that demonstrators " were also arrested in germany . "
rahr said that two years after she came to office , the difference between putin 's relationship with merkel and his far closer ties to her predecessor , schröder , were clear .
" their relationship is normal without being friendly .
she is careful and pragmatic and she never misses an opportunity to say that the united states is more important to her than russia , although she is not anti-russian , " rahr told afp . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

inside it is a maze of cement passages covering several levels and usually filled with nothing more than army-issue mattresses , green metal folding beds and water purification tablets . according bonn ’ s emergency services the bunker could be used in the event of any future catastrophe , including a terrorist attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the outside the windeck bunker looks like a big cube but this october the bunker has become a refuge for ten german artists who are participating in an exhibition called " licht in den bunker " or " light in the bunker . "
for exhibition organizer and artist gabriele lutterbeck the bunker is a unique and very german place . " we had world war two and we had the nazi regime which ended in a bunker , " she said .
" we wanted to use a space that was old and of no use today and which provides a very special atmosphere . " a world war ii relic built in 1940 , the windeck bunker was an air raid shelter for bonn ’ s residents .
today it is closed to the public and this is the first time an independent art exhibition has been held in the space .
two previous exhibitions were organized by the city of bonn in the bunker as part of local festivals . while some of bonn ’ s residents were glad to stay in the bunker during the war due to the protection it provided , many people today cringe at the thought . " i 'm not sure i want to stay in there - the art is nice but everything else is horrible .
it ’ s creepy because it makes us think about war and everything that could force us go there , " lutterbeck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only twenty people are permitted in the bunker at a time " there 's a strange sensation when you turn the big , red heavy door to go down into the bunker " she said . on the other side of a red metal door marked schleuse , or gate , visitors climb into a large , square cement room and see the spartan green metal beds and mattresses , and the thin tin partitions that hide toilets behind them . in the middle of the room thomas schneider 's " self-made sm-chair , " a wooden torture chair , immediately puts a chill in the room .
opposite the chair , stuffed colored parrots are arranged behind a glass frame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schneider ’ s installation the " twin-tower-cigarette lighter , " a cigarette lighter decorated with the skyline of new york with the world trade center still standing , is schneider ’ s third work exhibited .
the top of the cigarette lighter is open , splitting the design and cutting the towers in two . lutterbeck said the artists decided to exhibit their existing works or create pieces specifically for the exhibition that would relate to a wartime bunker and the themes associated with it . connecting with germany 's nazi past the three pieces lutterbeck prepared for the exhibition are a very personal reaction to the space .
when she decided to hold an exhibition in the bunker she initially focussed on her own private and personal reactions to it . " i really went into the nazi story because this bunker , although it was changed and maintained , is really a world war ii bunker , " she said her series of blue sketches are a reaction to the lebensborn project – a nazi ss program that set up maternity homes where women of " pure blood " could bear children who fitted the nazi 's preferred racial profile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutterbeck 's work is her personal reaction to the bunker lutterbeck 's second work features the six goebbels children who died in berlin bunker .
their mother , magda , who was married to hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , allegedly killed the children with cyanide capsules in hitler 's führer bunker on may 1 , 1945 .
lutterbeck 's painting features the family and was photographed and made into a slide which is projected onto the bunker wall . " i put it on a slide because germans like to have these slide shows , usually at christmas , where families look at their own pictures , " she said . everything lutterbeck knows about bunkers comes from her parents who are now deceased .
in order to represent this lutterbeck also chose to exhibit a photograph of her mother at age 12 . a symbol of security during world war ii , the bunker was divided into cells and the nazi party allocated the spaces where between eight to ten people , and later up to 15 people , sat on wooden benches from 5 p.m. every afternoon .
in the last four months leading up to the allies ' arrival in bonn the bunker became even more overcrowded as the number of people looking for safety grew . walter , a 73 -year-old bonn resident who did n't want to give his last name , sought refuge in the bunker with his family when he was aged ten .
he said it was the only place he felt safe . " it 's not a terrible place for me because it was a place of security .
it was a wonderful place and the terrible conditions were accepted because the alternatives were worse , " said walter , who was at the exhibition 's opening . while the bunker for him symbolizes security , he thought having an art exhibition in the space was a " good idea because it demonstrates that the same place can be different depending on the circumstances . " art takes on a different meaning the second floor of the exhibition is much lighter in its themes with tine holterhoff 's colorful photographs featuring facades in red , yellow and blue arranged in grids brighten up the otherwise bleak room .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tatjana schuelke 's speechless takes on a different meaning in the space for berlin artist tatjana schuelke , the use of the bunker as an exhibition space is more interesting than in a typical gallery .
she says her work - like her sculpture " speechless " currently on display - is transformed in a way in this environment .
the candy pink sculpture looks like a bomb and is covered with plaster cast teeth . " in most exhibition spaces it 's a comic sculpture but here in the bunker it takes on a different meaning , " said schuelke . in the final exhibition room two large paintings of red poppies , the symbol of war remembrance in some countries , lie flat on two metal army beds .
along the bottom of the paintings are thick , milky strips of paint . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the lights go out marni 's installation transforms flashlights are handed out and the lights go off .
then participants use the light from the flashlights to draw patterns on the reflective white paint at the bottom edge of the paintings and on other white strips hung on the walls around the room .
lasers project red patterns on the ceiling while a mix of classical and electronic music plays . some participants draw squiggles , others peace signs while some choose to reflect simply on their surroundings .
for the installation 's creators , marni -lrb- the duo of nika rossmöller-schmidt and martin schmidt -rrb- , the bunker is all about insiders and outsiders and protection . and when it comes to protection at least the artists wo n't have to worry about insuring their art - it should be quite safe in the bunker . should a catastrophe happen during the next two weeks , lutterbeck at least has the keys to the bunker . stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

inside it is a maze of cement passages covering several levels and usually filled with nothing more than army-issue mattresses , green metal folding beds and water purification tablets . according bonn ’ s emergency services the bunker could be used in the event of any future catastrophe , including a terrorist attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the outside the windeck bunker looks like a big cube but this october the bunker has become a refuge for ten german artists who are participating in an exhibition called " licht in den bunker " or " light in the bunker . "
for exhibition organizer and artist gabriele lutterbeck the bunker is a unique and very german place . " we had world war two and we had the nazi regime which ended in a bunker , " she said .
" we wanted to use a space that was old and of no use today and which provides a very special atmosphere . " a world war ii relic built in 1940 , the windeck bunker was an air raid shelter for bonn ’ s residents .
today it is closed to the public and this is the first time an independent art exhibition has been held in the space .
two previous exhibitions were organized by the city of bonn in the bunker as part of local festivals . while some of bonn ’ s residents were glad to stay in the bunker during the war due to the protection it provided , many people today cringe at the thought . " i 'm not sure i want to stay in there - the art is nice but everything else is horrible .
it ’ s creepy because it makes us think about war and everything that could force us go there , " lutterbeck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only twenty people are permitted in the bunker at a time " there 's a strange sensation when you turn the big , red heavy door to go down into the bunker " she said . on the other side of a red metal door marked schleuse , or gate , visitors climb into a large , square cement room and see the spartan green metal beds and mattresses , and the thin tin partitions that hide toilets behind them . in the middle of the room thomas schneider 's " self-made sm-chair , " a wooden torture chair , immediately puts a chill in the room .
opposite the chair , stuffed colored parrots are arranged behind a glass frame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schneider ’ s installation the " twin-tower-cigarette lighter , " a cigarette lighter decorated with the skyline of new york with the world trade center still standing , is schneider ’ s third work exhibited .
the top of the cigarette lighter is open , splitting the design and cutting the towers in two . lutterbeck said the artists decided to exhibit their existing works or create pieces specifically for the exhibition that would relate to a wartime bunker and the themes associated with it . connecting with germany 's nazi past the three pieces lutterbeck prepared for the exhibition are a very personal reaction to the space .
when she decided to hold an exhibition in the bunker she initially focussed on her own private and personal reactions to it . " i really went into the nazi story because this bunker , although it was changed and maintained , is really a world war ii bunker , " she said her series of blue sketches are a reaction to the lebensborn project – a nazi ss program that set up maternity homes where women of " pure blood " could bear children who fitted the nazi 's preferred racial profile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutterbeck 's work is her personal reaction to the bunker lutterbeck 's second work features the six goebbels children who died in berlin bunker .
their mother , magda , who was married to hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , allegedly killed the children with cyanide capsules in hitler 's führer bunker on may 1 , 1945 .
lutterbeck 's painting features the family and was photographed and made into a slide which is projected onto the bunker wall . " i put it on a slide because germans like to have these slide shows , usually at christmas , where families look at their own pictures , " she said . everything lutterbeck knows about bunkers comes from her parents who are now deceased .
in order to represent this lutterbeck also chose to exhibit a photograph of her mother at age 12 . a symbol of security during world war ii , the bunker was divided into cells and the nazi party allocated the spaces where between eight to ten people , and later up to 15 people , sat on wooden benches from 5 p.m. every afternoon .
in the last four months leading up to the allies ' arrival in bonn the bunker became even more overcrowded as the number of people looking for safety grew . walter , a 73 -year-old bonn resident who did n't want to give his last name , sought refuge in the bunker with his family when he was aged ten .
he said it was the only place he felt safe . " it 's not a terrible place for me because it was a place of security .
it was a wonderful place and the terrible conditions were accepted because the alternatives were worse , " said walter , who was at the exhibition 's opening . while the bunker for him symbolizes security , he thought having an art exhibition in the space was a " good idea because it demonstrates that the same place can be different depending on the circumstances . " art takes on a different meaning the second floor of the exhibition is much lighter in its themes with tine holterhoff 's colorful photographs featuring facades in red , yellow and blue arranged in grids brighten up the otherwise bleak room .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tatjana schuelke 's speechless takes on a different meaning in the space for berlin artist tatjana schuelke , the use of the bunker as an exhibition space is more interesting than in a typical gallery .
she says her work - like her sculpture " speechless " currently on display - is transformed in a way in this environment .
the candy pink sculpture looks like a bomb and is covered with plaster cast teeth . " in most exhibition spaces it 's a comic sculpture but here in the bunker it takes on a different meaning , " said schuelke . in the final exhibition room two large paintings of red poppies , the symbol of war remembrance in some countries , lie flat on two metal army beds .
along the bottom of the paintings are thick , milky strips of paint . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the lights go out marni 's installation transforms flashlights are handed out and the lights go off .
then participants use the light from the flashlights to draw patterns on the reflective white paint at the bottom edge of the paintings and on other white strips hung on the walls around the room .
lasers project red patterns on the ceiling while a mix of classical and electronic music plays . some participants draw squiggles , others peace signs while some choose to reflect simply on their surroundings .
for the installation 's creators , marni -lrb- the duo of nika rossmöller-schmidt and martin schmidt -rrb- , the bunker is all about insiders and outsiders and protection . and when it comes to protection at least the artists wo n't have to worry about insuring their art - it should be quite safe in the bunker . should a catastrophe happen during the next two weeks , lutterbeck at least has the keys to the bunker . stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

inside it is a maze of cement passages covering several levels and usually filled with nothing more than army-issue mattresses , green metal folding beds and water purification tablets . according bonn ’ s emergency services the bunker could be used in the event of any future catastrophe , including a terrorist attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the outside the windeck bunker looks like a big cube but this october the bunker has become a refuge for ten german artists who are participating in an exhibition called " licht in den bunker " or " light in the bunker . "
for exhibition organizer and artist gabriele lutterbeck the bunker is a unique and very german place . " we had world war two and we had the nazi regime which ended in a bunker , " she said .
" we wanted to use a space that was old and of no use today and which provides a very special atmosphere . " a world war ii relic built in 1940 , the windeck bunker was an air raid shelter for bonn ’ s residents .
today it is closed to the public and this is the first time an independent art exhibition has been held in the space .
two previous exhibitions were organized by the city of bonn in the bunker as part of local festivals . while some of bonn ’ s residents were glad to stay in the bunker during the war due to the protection it provided , many people today cringe at the thought . " i 'm not sure i want to stay in there - the art is nice but everything else is horrible .
it ’ s creepy because it makes us think about war and everything that could force us go there , " lutterbeck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only twenty people are permitted in the bunker at a time " there 's a strange sensation when you turn the big , red heavy door to go down into the bunker " she said . on the other side of a red metal door marked schleuse , or gate , visitors climb into a large , square cement room and see the spartan green metal beds and mattresses , and the thin tin partitions that hide toilets behind them . in the middle of the room thomas schneider 's " self-made sm-chair , " a wooden torture chair , immediately puts a chill in the room .
opposite the chair , stuffed colored parrots are arranged behind a glass frame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schneider ’ s installation the " twin-tower-cigarette lighter , " a cigarette lighter decorated with the skyline of new york with the world trade center still standing , is schneider ’ s third work exhibited .
the top of the cigarette lighter is open , splitting the design and cutting the towers in two . lutterbeck said the artists decided to exhibit their existing works or create pieces specifically for the exhibition that would relate to a wartime bunker and the themes associated with it . connecting with germany 's nazi past the three pieces lutterbeck prepared for the exhibition are a very personal reaction to the space .
when she decided to hold an exhibition in the bunker she initially focussed on her own private and personal reactions to it . " i really went into the nazi story because this bunker , although it was changed and maintained , is really a world war ii bunker , " she said her series of blue sketches are a reaction to the lebensborn project – a nazi ss program that set up maternity homes where women of " pure blood " could bear children who fitted the nazi 's preferred racial profile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutterbeck 's work is her personal reaction to the bunker lutterbeck 's second work features the six goebbels children who died in berlin bunker .
their mother , magda , who was married to hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , allegedly killed the children with cyanide capsules in hitler 's führer bunker on may 1 , 1945 .
lutterbeck 's painting features the family and was photographed and made into a slide which is projected onto the bunker wall . " i put it on a slide because germans like to have these slide shows , usually at christmas , where families look at their own pictures , " she said . everything lutterbeck knows about bunkers comes from her parents who are now deceased .
in order to represent this lutterbeck also chose to exhibit a photograph of her mother at age 12 . a symbol of security during world war ii , the bunker was divided into cells and the nazi party allocated the spaces where between eight to ten people , and later up to 15 people , sat on wooden benches from 5 p.m. every afternoon .
in the last four months leading up to the allies ' arrival in bonn the bunker became even more overcrowded as the number of people looking for safety grew . walter , a 73 -year-old bonn resident who did n't want to give his last name , sought refuge in the bunker with his family when he was aged ten .
he said it was the only place he felt safe . " it 's not a terrible place for me because it was a place of security .
it was a wonderful place and the terrible conditions were accepted because the alternatives were worse , " said walter , who was at the exhibition 's opening . while the bunker for him symbolizes security , he thought having an art exhibition in the space was a " good idea because it demonstrates that the same place can be different depending on the circumstances . " art takes on a different meaning the second floor of the exhibition is much lighter in its themes with tine holterhoff 's colorful photographs featuring facades in red , yellow and blue arranged in grids brighten up the otherwise bleak room .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tatjana schuelke 's speechless takes on a different meaning in the space for berlin artist tatjana schuelke , the use of the bunker as an exhibition space is more interesting than in a typical gallery .
she says her work - like her sculpture " speechless " currently on display - is transformed in a way in this environment .
the candy pink sculpture looks like a bomb and is covered with plaster cast teeth . " in most exhibition spaces it 's a comic sculpture but here in the bunker it takes on a different meaning , " said schuelke . in the final exhibition room two large paintings of red poppies , the symbol of war remembrance in some countries , lie flat on two metal army beds .
along the bottom of the paintings are thick , milky strips of paint . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the lights go out marni 's installation transforms flashlights are handed out and the lights go off .
then participants use the light from the flashlights to draw patterns on the reflective white paint at the bottom edge of the paintings and on other white strips hung on the walls around the room .
lasers project red patterns on the ceiling while a mix of classical and electronic music plays . some participants draw squiggles , others peace signs while some choose to reflect simply on their surroundings .
for the installation 's creators , marni -lrb- the duo of nika rossmöller-schmidt and martin schmidt -rrb- , the bunker is all about insiders and outsiders and protection . and when it comes to protection at least the artists wo n't have to worry about insuring their art - it should be quite safe in the bunker . should a catastrophe happen during the next two weeks , lutterbeck at least has the keys to the bunker . stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de travel -pipe- 14.10.2007 the nürburgring : nirvana for racing enthusiasts of every stripe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just for professionals , all visitors can actively enjoy the nürburgring the word nürburgring can make a car aficionado 's heart beat a little faster .
the famous race track , often called " the ring , " has been a favorite among motor sport enthusiasts and tourists since its opening in 1927 . located around the village and medieval castle of nürburg in the eifel mountains , the racing track at the nürburgring is known around the world for its extraordinary formula 1 grand prix racing , but it can also be driven by any visitor with a valid driver 's license .
the constant noise produced by race cars speeding by can get visitors in the mood for serious automotive action .
daily drives , guided backstage tours , field trips and adventure parks are a few of the possibilities offered besides the big races .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test your car and your driving skill on the northern loop the most famous of the attractions is the nordschleife , or northern loop , which is more popularly known as the green hell .
it is made up of 20,8 kilometers -lrb- 13 miles -rrb- of challenging one-way track in beautiful surroundings on which any driver can assess his or her racing abilities .
" the nürburgring myth is definitely tied to the green hell , as jackie stewart baptized the track , " said walter kafitz , ceo of the nürburgring .
" history has been written here . "
" at the first race in 1927 there were hundreds of thousands of visitors there .
today , there are about two million guests on the ring yearly who come to experience the place 's unique atmosphere , " he said .
not just for professionals bildunterschrift : the green hell : it 's a picturesque inferno the so called " tourist drives , " which have taken place since 1927 , welcome anybody who wants to take part .
" driving on the nordschleife personally is for many fans the highlight , " kafitz said .
although there is no oncoming traffic , driving the northern loop is challenging for amateurs since it can be hard to judge where exactly on the track to drive .
there are no lane markings , but there are many sharp curves and slopes .
due to the number of drivers , and the potential hazards , there are specific rules that need to be followed .
one suggestion : drivers and passengers on the northern loop should go easy on foods that could upset your stomach if they do n't want a serious case of car sickness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ring has known its share of tragedy a regular visitor to the ring , christopher heiser , who has a web page devoted to the track and racing devotees , has said that " nothing , absolutely nothing will prepare you for your first time around the track .
it is nothing like anything you 've ever driven on .
the track is so much bigger , so much steeper , so much faster than you can possibly imagine . "
the history of the legend the nürburgring opened on june 18 , 1927 as a dedicated racing circuit .
soon after it was obvious how important an economic role it would play for the entire region .
" restaurants with spare rooms became hotels , cow fields became parking lots , and racing became a blessing for one of the poorest regions in germany , " said kafitz .
after the war , reconstruction work began in 1947 and the eifel cup was held , rushing in a new nürburgring racing era , according to kafitz .
" the entrance fee was five reichsmarks , with a voucher for wine , sausage and bread .
four years later the first formula one world championship took place and the ring became international , " he said .
life beyond cars bildunterschrift : the nürburgring puts on many large-scale events the nürburgring area is an ideal tourist destination with its striking scenery , churches , lakes , castles , museums and notable architecture - besides the race track , of course . although few would call the northern loop " regular , " but those who do find the fairly flat track uninteresting can turn their attentions to the off-road park and try a little four-wheeling .
there is more than just four-wheel-centered activity .
guests can ride bikes on the bike-lane that runs parallel to the northern loop .
part of the 30 kilometer -lrb- 18.6 mile -rrb- ride runs through forests near the town of adenau .
those who prefer staying on their own two feet can take on a hiking trail , with a guide providing information about the history of the track as well as the whole eifel area .
camping facilities are also available .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much more is in the planning for the nürburgring plans are to develop the nürburgring into a year-round recreation and business center , with event possibilities that do n't depend on good weather , according to kafitz .
poor conditions can shut the track down for weeks .
" there will also be a roller coaster that will have an acceleration value like formula one race cars , directly above the actual start and finish lines - 365 days a year , " kafitz said . tina pandza send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

inside it is a maze of cement passages covering several levels and usually filled with nothing more than army-issue mattresses , green metal folding beds and water purification tablets . according bonn ’ s emergency services the bunker could be used in the event of any future catastrophe , including a terrorist attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the outside the windeck bunker looks like a big cube but this october the bunker has become a refuge for ten german artists who are participating in an exhibition called " licht in den bunker " or " light in the bunker . "
for exhibition organizer and artist gabriele lutterbeck the bunker is a unique and very german place . " we had world war two and we had the nazi regime which ended in a bunker , " she said .
" we wanted to use a space that was old and of no use today and which provides a very special atmosphere . " a world war ii relic built in 1940 , the windeck bunker was an air raid shelter for bonn ’ s residents .
today it is closed to the public and this is the first time an independent art exhibition has been held in the space .
two previous exhibitions were organized by the city of bonn in the bunker as part of local festivals . while some of bonn ’ s residents were glad to stay in the bunker during the war due to the protection it provided , many people today cringe at the thought . " i 'm not sure i want to stay in there - the art is nice but everything else is horrible .
it ’ s creepy because it makes us think about war and everything that could force us go there , " lutterbeck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only twenty people are permitted in the bunker at a time " there 's a strange sensation when you turn the big , red heavy door to go down into the bunker " she said . on the other side of a red metal door marked schleuse , or gate , visitors climb into a large , square cement room and see the spartan green metal beds and mattresses , and the thin tin partitions that hide toilets behind them . in the middle of the room thomas schneider 's " self-made sm-chair , " a wooden torture chair , immediately puts a chill in the room .
opposite the chair , stuffed colored parrots are arranged behind a glass frame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schneider ’ s installation the " twin-tower-cigarette lighter , " a cigarette lighter decorated with the skyline of new york with the world trade center still standing , is schneider ’ s third work exhibited .
the top of the cigarette lighter is open , splitting the design and cutting the towers in two . lutterbeck said the artists decided to exhibit their existing works or create pieces specifically for the exhibition that would relate to a wartime bunker and the themes associated with it . connecting with germany 's nazi past the three pieces lutterbeck prepared for the exhibition are a very personal reaction to the space .
when she decided to hold an exhibition in the bunker she initially focussed on her own private and personal reactions to it . " i really went into the nazi story because this bunker , although it was changed and maintained , is really a world war ii bunker , " she said her series of blue sketches are a reaction to the lebensborn project – a nazi ss program that set up maternity homes where women of " pure blood " could bear children who fitted the nazi 's preferred racial profile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutterbeck 's work is her personal reaction to the bunker lutterbeck 's second work features the six goebbels children who died in berlin bunker .
their mother , magda , who was married to hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , allegedly killed the children with cyanide capsules in hitler 's führer bunker on may 1 , 1945 .
lutterbeck 's painting features the family and was photographed and made into a slide which is projected onto the bunker wall . " i put it on a slide because germans like to have these slide shows , usually at christmas , where families look at their own pictures , " she said . everything lutterbeck knows about bunkers comes from her parents who are now deceased .
in order to represent this lutterbeck also chose to exhibit a photograph of her mother at age 12 . a symbol of security during world war ii , the bunker was divided into cells and the nazi party allocated the spaces where between eight to ten people , and later up to 15 people , sat on wooden benches from 5 p.m. every afternoon .
in the last four months leading up to the allies ' arrival in bonn the bunker became even more overcrowded as the number of people looking for safety grew . walter , a 73 -year-old bonn resident who did n't want to give his last name , sought refuge in the bunker with his family when he was aged ten .
he said it was the only place he felt safe . " it 's not a terrible place for me because it was a place of security .
it was a wonderful place and the terrible conditions were accepted because the alternatives were worse , " said walter , who was at the exhibition 's opening . while the bunker for him symbolizes security , he thought having an art exhibition in the space was a " good idea because it demonstrates that the same place can be different depending on the circumstances . " art takes on a different meaning the second floor of the exhibition is much lighter in its themes with tine holterhoff 's colorful photographs featuring facades in red , yellow and blue arranged in grids brighten up the otherwise bleak room .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tatjana schuelke 's speechless takes on a different meaning in the space for berlin artist tatjana schuelke , the use of the bunker as an exhibition space is more interesting than in a typical gallery .
she says her work - like her sculpture " speechless " currently on display - is transformed in a way in this environment .
the candy pink sculpture looks like a bomb and is covered with plaster cast teeth . " in most exhibition spaces it 's a comic sculpture but here in the bunker it takes on a different meaning , " said schuelke . in the final exhibition room two large paintings of red poppies , the symbol of war remembrance in some countries , lie flat on two metal army beds .
along the bottom of the paintings are thick , milky strips of paint . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the lights go out marni 's installation transforms flashlights are handed out and the lights go off .
then participants use the light from the flashlights to draw patterns on the reflective white paint at the bottom edge of the paintings and on other white strips hung on the walls around the room .
lasers project red patterns on the ceiling while a mix of classical and electronic music plays . some participants draw squiggles , others peace signs while some choose to reflect simply on their surroundings .
for the installation 's creators , marni -lrb- the duo of nika rossmöller-schmidt and martin schmidt -rrb- , the bunker is all about insiders and outsiders and protection . and when it comes to protection at least the artists wo n't have to worry about insuring their art - it should be quite safe in the bunker . should a catastrophe happen during the next two weeks , lutterbeck at least has the keys to the bunker . stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 .
topics are expected to be energy security , economic questions and the us missile shield . a number of tough global issues will also be on the table at the meeting of the german and russian leaders in the german city of wiesbaden .
it comes straight after talks in moscow between us secretary of state condoleezza rice and her russian counterpart sergei lavrov , as well as both countries ' defense ministers .
russia strongly opposes us plans to deploy parts of its anti-missile defence system in the czech republic and poland .
moscow says the missiles will target russia and not " rogue states " such as iran and north korea , which washington says the system is designed to defend against . in rancorous bilateral talks on friday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice rejected a russian call to freeze plans to place 10 us interceptor missiles in poland and a targeting radar station in the czech republic by 2010 . a spokesman for the kremlin on sunday confirmed that putin would raise " questions of strategic stability within the context of the us missile shield project " with the chancellor .
germany has taken a cautious stance on the issue , insisting that nato should be consulted about us plans and also warning poland and the czechs that their going it alone could prove divisive for europe . fyodor lukyanov , editor of the magazine russia in global affairs , says that he expects putin to try to play on germany 's " ambivalence " towards the shield .
putin has threatened to tear up several cold war-era agreements , including the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty which sets limits on troops , tanks and other hardware across the continent . bilateral issues russian presidential spokesman dimitri peskov said another priority of the talks would be on " clarifying " merkel 's position on bilateral investment projects , particularly those of gazprom in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the smiles , there were gritted teeth on both sides after recent us-russia talks " for putin , the most important thing will be evening the scales with regard to the latest draft of the european commission in terms of protecting their market from foreign competition , " peskov told the german press agency dpa .
the commission is considering the introduction of a tough reciprocity clause for energy relations with third countries .
" of course , russia is looking for equal conditions and fair competition for russian companies , including gazprom , " peskov said ahead of the summit .
the talks in wiesbaden will stretch over two days , with the two leaders participating in a forum on monday , oct .
14 that is part of the petersburg dialogue , a civil society discussion that was set up by putin and former chancellor gerhard schröder . kosovo and human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albanians in kosovo are demanding independence for the province kosovo is another delicate issue expected to be raised in wiesbaden . russia has denounced western support for independence for kosovo , the ethnic albanian-led province which has threatened to declare independence unilaterally from serbia unless the international community comes up with a solution by december 10 . although berlin has said little officially about the visit , alexander rahr , a researcher at the german council on foreign relations told the afp news agency that he also expected merkel to raise the issue of freedom of speech in russia .
merkel and putin briefly clashed on the issue during her visit to russia in may , prompting the russian president to say that demonstrators " were also arrested in germany . "
rahr said that two years after she came to office , the difference between putin 's relationship with merkel and his far closer ties to her predecessor , schröder , were clear .
" their relationship is normal without being friendly .
she is careful and pragmatic and she never misses an opportunity to say that the united states is more important to her than russia , although she is not anti-russian , " rahr told afp . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

topics are expected to be energy security , economic questions and the us missile shield . a number of tough global issues will also be on the table at the meeting of the german and russian leaders in the german city of wiesbaden .
it comes straight after talks in moscow between us secretary of state condoleezza rice and her russian counterpart sergei lavrov , as well as both countries ' defense ministers .
russia strongly opposes us plans to deploy parts of its anti-missile defence system in the czech republic and poland .
moscow says the missiles will target russia and not " rogue states " such as iran and north korea , which washington says the system is designed to defend against . in rancorous bilateral talks on friday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice rejected a russian call to freeze plans to place 10 us interceptor missiles in poland and a targeting radar station in the czech republic by 2010 . a spokesman for the kremlin on sunday confirmed that putin would raise " questions of strategic stability within the context of the us missile shield project " with the chancellor .
germany has taken a cautious stance on the issue , insisting that nato should be consulted about us plans and also warning poland and the czechs that their going it alone could prove divisive for europe . fyodor lukyanov , editor of the magazine russia in global affairs , says that he expects putin to try to play on germany 's " ambivalence " towards the shield .
putin has threatened to tear up several cold war-era agreements , including the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty which sets limits on troops , tanks and other hardware across the continent . bilateral issues russian presidential spokesman dimitri peskov said another priority of the talks would be on " clarifying " merkel 's position on bilateral investment projects , particularly those of gazprom in europe .

the commission is considering the introduction of a tough reciprocity clause for energy relations with third countries .
" of course , russia is looking for equal conditions and fair competition for russian companies , including gazprom , " peskov said ahead of the summit .

merkel and putin briefly clashed on the issue during her visit to russia in may , prompting the russian president to say that demonstrators " were also arrested in germany . "
rahr said that two years after she came to office , the difference between putin 's relationship with merkel and his far closer ties to her predecessor , schröder , were clear .

germany has taken a cautious stance on the issue , insisting that nato should be consulted about us plans and also warning poland and the czechs that their going it alone could prove divisive for europe . fyodor lukyanov , editor of the magazine russia in global affairs , says that he expects putin to try to play on germany 's " ambivalence " towards the shield .
putin has threatened to tear up several cold war-era agreements , including the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty which sets limits on troops , tanks and other hardware across the continent . bilateral issues russian presidential spokesman dimitri peskov said another priority of the talks would be on " clarifying " merkel 's position on bilateral investment projects , particularly those of gazprom in europe .

inside it is a maze of cement passages covering several levels and usually filled with nothing more than army-issue mattresses , green metal folding beds and water purification tablets . according bonn ’ s emergency services the bunker could be used in the event of any future catastrophe , including a terrorist attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the outside the windeck bunker looks like a big cube but this october the bunker has become a refuge for ten german artists who are participating in an exhibition called " licht in den bunker " or " light in the bunker . "
for exhibition organizer and artist gabriele lutterbeck the bunker is a unique and very german place . " we had world war two and we had the nazi regime which ended in a bunker , " she said .
" we wanted to use a space that was old and of no use today and which provides a very special atmosphere . " a world war ii relic built in 1940 , the windeck bunker was an air raid shelter for bonn ’ s residents .
today it is closed to the public and this is the first time an independent art exhibition has been held in the space .
two previous exhibitions were organized by the city of bonn in the bunker as part of local festivals . while some of bonn ’ s residents were glad to stay in the bunker during the war due to the protection it provided , many people today cringe at the thought . " i 'm not sure i want to stay in there - the art is nice but everything else is horrible .
it ’ s creepy because it makes us think about war and everything that could force us go there , " lutterbeck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only twenty people are permitted in the bunker at a time " there 's a strange sensation when you turn the big , red heavy door to go down into the bunker " she said . on the other side of a red metal door marked schleuse , or gate , visitors climb into a large , square cement room and see the spartan green metal beds and mattresses , and the thin tin partitions that hide toilets behind them . in the middle of the room thomas schneider 's " self-made sm-chair , " a wooden torture chair , immediately puts a chill in the room .
opposite the chair , stuffed colored parrots are arranged behind a glass frame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schneider ’ s installation the " twin-tower-cigarette lighter , " a cigarette lighter decorated with the skyline of new york with the world trade center still standing , is schneider ’ s third work exhibited .
the top of the cigarette lighter is open , splitting the design and cutting the towers in two . lutterbeck said the artists decided to exhibit their existing works or create pieces specifically for the exhibition that would relate to a wartime bunker and the themes associated with it . connecting with germany 's nazi past the three pieces lutterbeck prepared for the exhibition are a very personal reaction to the space .
when she decided to hold an exhibition in the bunker she initially focussed on her own private and personal reactions to it . " i really went into the nazi story because this bunker , although it was changed and maintained , is really a world war ii bunker , " she said her series of blue sketches are a reaction to the lebensborn project – a nazi ss program that set up maternity homes where women of " pure blood " could bear children who fitted the nazi 's preferred racial profile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutterbeck 's work is her personal reaction to the bunker lutterbeck 's second work features the six goebbels children who died in berlin bunker .
their mother , magda , who was married to hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , allegedly killed the children with cyanide capsules in hitler 's führer bunker on may 1 , 1945 .
lutterbeck 's painting features the family and was photographed and made into a slide which is projected onto the bunker wall . " i put it on a slide because germans like to have these slide shows , usually at christmas , where families look at their own pictures , " she said . everything lutterbeck knows about bunkers comes from her parents who are now deceased .
in order to represent this lutterbeck also chose to exhibit a photograph of her mother at age 12 . a symbol of security during world war ii , the bunker was divided into cells and the nazi party allocated the spaces where between eight to ten people , and later up to 15 people , sat on wooden benches from 5 p.m. every afternoon .
in the last four months leading up to the allies ' arrival in bonn the bunker became even more overcrowded as the number of people looking for safety grew . walter , a 73 -year-old bonn resident who did n't want to give his last name , sought refuge in the bunker with his family when he was aged ten .
he said it was the only place he felt safe . " it 's not a terrible place for me because it was a place of security .
it was a wonderful place and the terrible conditions were accepted because the alternatives were worse , " said walter , who was at the exhibition 's opening . while the bunker for him symbolizes security , he thought having an art exhibition in the space was a " good idea because it demonstrates that the same place can be different depending on the circumstances . " art takes on a different meaning the second floor of the exhibition is much lighter in its themes with tine holterhoff 's colorful photographs featuring facades in red , yellow and blue arranged in grids brighten up the otherwise bleak room .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tatjana schuelke 's speechless takes on a different meaning in the space for berlin artist tatjana schuelke , the use of the bunker as an exhibition space is more interesting than in a typical gallery .
she says her work - like her sculpture " speechless " currently on display - is transformed in a way in this environment .
the candy pink sculpture looks like a bomb and is covered with plaster cast teeth . " in most exhibition spaces it 's a comic sculpture but here in the bunker it takes on a different meaning , " said schuelke . in the final exhibition room two large paintings of red poppies , the symbol of war remembrance in some countries , lie flat on two metal army beds .
along the bottom of the paintings are thick , milky strips of paint . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the lights go out marni 's installation transforms flashlights are handed out and the lights go off .
then participants use the light from the flashlights to draw patterns on the reflective white paint at the bottom edge of the paintings and on other white strips hung on the walls around the room .
lasers project red patterns on the ceiling while a mix of classical and electronic music plays . some participants draw squiggles , others peace signs while some choose to reflect simply on their surroundings .
for the installation 's creators , marni -lrb- the duo of nika rossmöller-schmidt and martin schmidt -rrb- , the bunker is all about insiders and outsiders and protection . and when it comes to protection at least the artists wo n't have to worry about insuring their art - it should be quite safe in the bunker . should a catastrophe happen during the next two weeks , lutterbeck at least has the keys to the bunker . stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

inside it is a maze of cement passages covering several levels and usually filled with nothing more than army-issue mattresses , green metal folding beds and water purification tablets . according bonn ’ s emergency services the bunker could be used in the event of any future catastrophe , including a terrorist attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the outside the windeck bunker looks like a big cube but this october the bunker has become a refuge for ten german artists who are participating in an exhibition called " licht in den bunker " or " light in the bunker . "
for exhibition organizer and artist gabriele lutterbeck the bunker is a unique and very german place . " we had world war two and we had the nazi regime which ended in a bunker , " she said .
" we wanted to use a space that was old and of no use today and which provides a very special atmosphere . " a world war ii relic built in 1940 , the windeck bunker was an air raid shelter for bonn ’ s residents .
today it is closed to the public and this is the first time an independent art exhibition has been held in the space .
two previous exhibitions were organized by the city of bonn in the bunker as part of local festivals . while some of bonn ’ s residents were glad to stay in the bunker during the war due to the protection it provided , many people today cringe at the thought . " i 'm not sure i want to stay in there - the art is nice but everything else is horrible .
it ’ s creepy because it makes us think about war and everything that could force us go there , " lutterbeck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only twenty people are permitted in the bunker at a time " there 's a strange sensation when you turn the big , red heavy door to go down into the bunker " she said . on the other side of a red metal door marked schleuse , or gate , visitors climb into a large , square cement room and see the spartan green metal beds and mattresses , and the thin tin partitions that hide toilets behind them . in the middle of the room thomas schneider 's " self-made sm-chair , " a wooden torture chair , immediately puts a chill in the room .
opposite the chair , stuffed colored parrots are arranged behind a glass frame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schneider ’ s installation the " twin-tower-cigarette lighter , " a cigarette lighter decorated with the skyline of new york with the world trade center still standing , is schneider ’ s third work exhibited .
the top of the cigarette lighter is open , splitting the design and cutting the towers in two . lutterbeck said the artists decided to exhibit their existing works or create pieces specifically for the exhibition that would relate to a wartime bunker and the themes associated with it . connecting with germany 's nazi past the three pieces lutterbeck prepared for the exhibition are a very personal reaction to the space .
when she decided to hold an exhibition in the bunker she initially focussed on her own private and personal reactions to it . " i really went into the nazi story because this bunker , although it was changed and maintained , is really a world war ii bunker , " she said her series of blue sketches are a reaction to the lebensborn project – a nazi ss program that set up maternity homes where women of " pure blood " could bear children who fitted the nazi 's preferred racial profile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutterbeck 's work is her personal reaction to the bunker lutterbeck 's second work features the six goebbels children who died in berlin bunker .
their mother , magda , who was married to hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , allegedly killed the children with cyanide capsules in hitler 's führer bunker on may 1 , 1945 .
lutterbeck 's painting features the family and was photographed and made into a slide which is projected onto the bunker wall . " i put it on a slide because germans like to have these slide shows , usually at christmas , where families look at their own pictures , " she said . everything lutterbeck knows about bunkers comes from her parents who are now deceased .
in order to represent this lutterbeck also chose to exhibit a photograph of her mother at age 12 . a symbol of security during world war ii , the bunker was divided into cells and the nazi party allocated the spaces where between eight to ten people , and later up to 15 people , sat on wooden benches from 5 p.m. every afternoon .
in the last four months leading up to the allies ' arrival in bonn the bunker became even more overcrowded as the number of people looking for safety grew . walter , a 73 -year-old bonn resident who did n't want to give his last name , sought refuge in the bunker with his family when he was aged ten .
he said it was the only place he felt safe . " it 's not a terrible place for me because it was a place of security .
it was a wonderful place and the terrible conditions were accepted because the alternatives were worse , " said walter , who was at the exhibition 's opening . while the bunker for him symbolizes security , he thought having an art exhibition in the space was a " good idea because it demonstrates that the same place can be different depending on the circumstances . " art takes on a different meaning the second floor of the exhibition is much lighter in its themes with tine holterhoff 's colorful photographs featuring facades in red , yellow and blue arranged in grids brighten up the otherwise bleak room .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tatjana schuelke 's speechless takes on a different meaning in the space for berlin artist tatjana schuelke , the use of the bunker as an exhibition space is more interesting than in a typical gallery .
she says her work - like her sculpture " speechless " currently on display - is transformed in a way in this environment .
the candy pink sculpture looks like a bomb and is covered with plaster cast teeth . " in most exhibition spaces it 's a comic sculpture but here in the bunker it takes on a different meaning , " said schuelke . in the final exhibition room two large paintings of red poppies , the symbol of war remembrance in some countries , lie flat on two metal army beds .
along the bottom of the paintings are thick , milky strips of paint . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the lights go out marni 's installation transforms flashlights are handed out and the lights go off .
then participants use the light from the flashlights to draw patterns on the reflective white paint at the bottom edge of the paintings and on other white strips hung on the walls around the room .
lasers project red patterns on the ceiling while a mix of classical and electronic music plays . some participants draw squiggles , others peace signs while some choose to reflect simply on their surroundings .
for the installation 's creators , marni -lrb- the duo of nika rossmöller-schmidt and martin schmidt -rrb- , the bunker is all about insiders and outsiders and protection . and when it comes to protection at least the artists wo n't have to worry about insuring their art - it should be quite safe in the bunker . should a catastrophe happen during the next two weeks , lutterbeck at least has the keys to the bunker . stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 , for his work on documenting the holocaust . in awarding friedländer its top prize , the association said the historian had given " a voice to the grievances and cries of those human beings who were turned to dust - he gave them memory and a name . "
friedländer , a jewish historian of the holocaust , read from the letters of family members who died at the hands of the nazis before 1,000 guests at the award ceremony , which marked the high point of the frankfurt book fair on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler and his wife greet friedländer and his partner orna kenan the 75-year-old french-educated israeli academic , who lost his parents in the holocaust , was honored with germany 's top literary prize for " restoring the stolen dignity of the victims of the holocaust , a recognition of which is the basis of peace . "
friedländer called for the voices of the holocaust victims not to be silenced .
the personal documents of the victims " move us precisely because of their utter helplessness , their innocence and the solitariness of their desperation , " he said .
parents ' last words friedländer chose not to make the usual speech , but read the last words written by his parents and thrown from the train taking them to a french concentration camp .
the letters were addressed to the french woman who saved friedländer 's own life by placing him in a catholic school under an assumed name .
in his letter , friedländer 's father wrote he had sent money , jewelry and stamps to the woman , madame mace de lepinay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedländer 's parents died in auschwitz " do n't leave the boy .
may god repay you for everything and may he bless you and your family , " he wrote .
in an earlier letter , friedländer 's parents wrote : " if we must perish , at least we have the great good fortune of knowing that our beloved child has been saved . "
in an earlier speech , alexander von humboldt foundation president wolfgang frühwald stressed the need to remember .
the nazis had driven naiveté from the world , " destroying the original sense of trust in the moral power of civilization , " frühwald said .
complex emotions after being told he was to receive the award , friedländer , who speaks fluent german , referred to the " terrible feeling of fear " he had sometimes felt during his early stays in germany after world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedländer was honored for restoring the jews ' " stolen dignity " " i had to keep going away for periods .
but in time that changed , " he said .
germany was now a country like any other .
he even had a german grandchild in berlin , since his daughter is married to a german musician .
he said he had a " dual response " to being awarded the annual german literary prize , and was both happy to be honored for his scholarship while aware that this was closely bound to the loss of his parents .
" i wo n't have mixed feelings , but i would say complex feelings , " he said .
the award ceremony marks the climax of the book fair , the world 's largest .
more than 280,000 people attended the 59th fair , the same number as last year .
" from an economic point of view it went well , " book fair spokesman thomas minkus told the dpa news agency .
the politics and show business categories had drawn the most attention , he added .
attack on president the event was marred by an attack on german president horst köhler , who was attending the ceremony in the historic st. paul 's church in the city center .
an apparently mentally disturbed man rushed at köhler after the ceremony , grabbing him by the lapels before being overpowered by bodyguards and led away .

inside it is a maze of cement passages covering several levels and usually filled with nothing more than army-issue mattresses , green metal folding beds and water purification tablets . according bonn ’ s emergency services the bunker could be used in the event of any future catastrophe , including a terrorist attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the outside the windeck bunker looks like a big cube but this october the bunker has become a refuge for ten german artists who are participating in an exhibition called " licht in den bunker " or " light in the bunker . "
for exhibition organizer and artist gabriele lutterbeck the bunker is a unique and very german place . " we had world war two and we had the nazi regime which ended in a bunker , " she said .
" we wanted to use a space that was old and of no use today and which provides a very special atmosphere . " a world war ii relic built in 1940 , the windeck bunker was an air raid shelter for bonn ’ s residents .
today it is closed to the public and this is the first time an independent art exhibition has been held in the space .
two previous exhibitions were organized by the city of bonn in the bunker as part of local festivals . while some of bonn ’ s residents were glad to stay in the bunker during the war due to the protection it provided , many people today cringe at the thought . " i 'm not sure i want to stay in there - the art is nice but everything else is horrible .
it ’ s creepy because it makes us think about war and everything that could force us go there , " lutterbeck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only twenty people are permitted in the bunker at a time " there 's a strange sensation when you turn the big , red heavy door to go down into the bunker " she said . on the other side of a red metal door marked schleuse , or gate , visitors climb into a large , square cement room and see the spartan green metal beds and mattresses , and the thin tin partitions that hide toilets behind them . in the middle of the room thomas schneider 's " self-made sm-chair , " a wooden torture chair , immediately puts a chill in the room .
opposite the chair , stuffed colored parrots are arranged behind a glass frame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schneider ’ s installation the " twin-tower-cigarette lighter , " a cigarette lighter decorated with the skyline of new york with the world trade center still standing , is schneider ’ s third work exhibited .
the top of the cigarette lighter is open , splitting the design and cutting the towers in two . lutterbeck said the artists decided to exhibit their existing works or create pieces specifically for the exhibition that would relate to a wartime bunker and the themes associated with it . connecting with germany 's nazi past the three pieces lutterbeck prepared for the exhibition are a very personal reaction to the space .
when she decided to hold an exhibition in the bunker she initially focussed on her own private and personal reactions to it . " i really went into the nazi story because this bunker , although it was changed and maintained , is really a world war ii bunker , " she said her series of blue sketches are a reaction to the lebensborn project – a nazi ss program that set up maternity homes where women of " pure blood " could bear children who fitted the nazi 's preferred racial profile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutterbeck 's work is her personal reaction to the bunker lutterbeck 's second work features the six goebbels children who died in berlin bunker .
their mother , magda , who was married to hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , allegedly killed the children with cyanide capsules in hitler 's führer bunker on may 1 , 1945 .
lutterbeck 's painting features the family and was photographed and made into a slide which is projected onto the bunker wall . " i put it on a slide because germans like to have these slide shows , usually at christmas , where families look at their own pictures , " she said . everything lutterbeck knows about bunkers comes from her parents who are now deceased .
in order to represent this lutterbeck also chose to exhibit a photograph of her mother at age 12 . a symbol of security during world war ii , the bunker was divided into cells and the nazi party allocated the spaces where between eight to ten people , and later up to 15 people , sat on wooden benches from 5 p.m. every afternoon .
in the last four months leading up to the allies ' arrival in bonn the bunker became even more overcrowded as the number of people looking for safety grew . walter , a 73 -year-old bonn resident who did n't want to give his last name , sought refuge in the bunker with his family when he was aged ten .
he said it was the only place he felt safe . " it 's not a terrible place for me because it was a place of security .
it was a wonderful place and the terrible conditions were accepted because the alternatives were worse , " said walter , who was at the exhibition 's opening . while the bunker for him symbolizes security , he thought having an art exhibition in the space was a " good idea because it demonstrates that the same place can be different depending on the circumstances . " art takes on a different meaning the second floor of the exhibition is much lighter in its themes with tine holterhoff 's colorful photographs featuring facades in red , yellow and blue arranged in grids brighten up the otherwise bleak room .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tatjana schuelke 's speechless takes on a different meaning in the space for berlin artist tatjana schuelke , the use of the bunker as an exhibition space is more interesting than in a typical gallery .
she says her work - like her sculpture " speechless " currently on display - is transformed in a way in this environment .
the candy pink sculpture looks like a bomb and is covered with plaster cast teeth . " in most exhibition spaces it 's a comic sculpture but here in the bunker it takes on a different meaning , " said schuelke . in the final exhibition room two large paintings of red poppies , the symbol of war remembrance in some countries , lie flat on two metal army beds .
along the bottom of the paintings are thick , milky strips of paint . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the lights go out marni 's installation transforms flashlights are handed out and the lights go off .

14 , for his work on documenting the holocaust . in awarding friedländer its top prize , the association said the historian had given " a voice to the grievances and cries of those human beings who were turned to dust - he gave them memory and a name . "
friedländer , a jewish historian of the holocaust , read from the letters of family members who died at the hands of the nazis before 1,000 guests at the award ceremony , which marked the high point of the frankfurt book fair on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler and his wife greet friedländer and his partner orna kenan the 75-year-old french-educated israeli academic , who lost his parents in the holocaust , was honored with germany 's top literary prize for " restoring the stolen dignity of the victims of the holocaust , a recognition of which is the basis of peace . "
friedländer called for the voices of the holocaust victims not to be silenced .
the personal documents of the victims " move us precisely because of their utter helplessness , their innocence and the solitariness of their desperation , " he said .
parents ' last words friedländer chose not to make the usual speech , but read the last words written by his parents and thrown from the train taking them to a french concentration camp .
the letters were addressed to the french woman who saved friedländer 's own life by placing him in a catholic school under an assumed name .
in his letter , friedländer 's father wrote he had sent money , jewelry and stamps to the woman , madame mace de lepinay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedländer 's parents died in auschwitz " do n't leave the boy .
may god repay you for everything and may he bless you and your family , " he wrote .
in an earlier letter , friedländer 's parents wrote : " if we must perish , at least we have the great good fortune of knowing that our beloved child has been saved . "
in an earlier speech , alexander von humboldt foundation president wolfgang frühwald stressed the need to remember .
the nazis had driven naiveté from the world , " destroying the original sense of trust in the moral power of civilization , " frühwald said .
complex emotions after being told he was to receive the award , friedländer , who speaks fluent german , referred to the " terrible feeling of fear " he had sometimes felt during his early stays in germany after world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedländer was honored for restoring the jews ' " stolen dignity " " i had to keep going away for periods .
but in time that changed , " he said .
germany was now a country like any other .
he even had a german grandchild in berlin , since his daughter is married to a german musician .
he said he had a " dual response " to being awarded the annual german literary prize , and was both happy to be honored for his scholarship while aware that this was closely bound to the loss of his parents .
" i wo n't have mixed feelings , but i would say complex feelings , " he said .
the award ceremony marks the climax of the book fair , the world 's largest .
more than 280,000 people attended the 59th fair , the same number as last year .
" from an economic point of view it went well , " book fair spokesman thomas minkus told the dpa news agency .
the politics and show business categories had drawn the most attention , he added .
attack on president the event was marred by an attack on german president horst köhler , who was attending the ceremony in the historic st. paul 's church in the city center .
an apparently mentally disturbed man rushed at köhler after the ceremony , grabbing him by the lapels before being overpowered by bodyguards and led away .

14 .
topics are expected to be energy security , economic questions and the us missile shield . a number of tough global issues will also be on the table at the meeting of the german and russian leaders in the german city of wiesbaden .
it comes straight after talks in moscow between us secretary of state condoleezza rice and her russian counterpart sergei lavrov , as well as both countries ' defense ministers .
russia strongly opposes us plans to deploy parts of its anti-missile defence system in the czech republic and poland .
moscow says the missiles will target russia and not " rogue states " such as iran and north korea , which washington says the system is designed to defend against . in rancorous bilateral talks on friday , us secretary of state condoleezza rice rejected a russian call to freeze plans to place 10 us interceptor missiles in poland and a targeting radar station in the czech republic by 2010 . a spokesman for the kremlin on sunday confirmed that putin would raise " questions of strategic stability within the context of the us missile shield project " with the chancellor .
germany has taken a cautious stance on the issue , insisting that nato should be consulted about us plans and also warning poland and the czechs that their going it alone could prove divisive for europe . fyodor lukyanov , editor of the magazine russia in global affairs , says that he expects putin to try to play on germany 's " ambivalence " towards the shield .
putin has threatened to tear up several cold war-era agreements , including the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty which sets limits on troops , tanks and other hardware across the continent . bilateral issues russian presidential spokesman dimitri peskov said another priority of the talks would be on " clarifying " merkel 's position on bilateral investment projects , particularly those of gazprom in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the smiles , there were gritted teeth on both sides after recent us-russia talks " for putin , the most important thing will be evening the scales with regard to the latest draft of the european commission in terms of protecting their market from foreign competition , " peskov told the german press agency dpa .
the commission is considering the introduction of a tough reciprocity clause for energy relations with third countries .
" of course , russia is looking for equal conditions and fair competition for russian companies , including gazprom , " peskov said ahead of the summit .
the talks in wiesbaden will stretch over two days , with the two leaders participating in a forum on monday , oct .
14 that is part of the petersburg dialogue , a civil society discussion that was set up by putin and former chancellor gerhard schröder . kosovo and human rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albanians in kosovo are demanding independence for the province kosovo is another delicate issue expected to be raised in wiesbaden . russia has denounced western support for independence for kosovo , the ethnic albanian-led province which has threatened to declare independence unilaterally from serbia unless the international community comes up with a solution by december 10 . although berlin has said little officially about the visit , alexander rahr , a researcher at the german council on foreign relations told the afp news agency that he also expected merkel to raise the issue of freedom of speech in russia .
merkel and putin briefly clashed on the issue during her visit to russia in may , prompting the russian president to say that demonstrators " were also arrested in germany . "
rahr said that two years after she came to office , the difference between putin 's relationship with merkel and his far closer ties to her predecessor , schröder , were clear .
" their relationship is normal without being friendly .
she is careful and pragmatic and she never misses an opportunity to say that the united states is more important to her than russia , although she is not anti-russian , " rahr told afp . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

inside it is a maze of cement passages covering several levels and usually filled with nothing more than army-issue mattresses , green metal folding beds and water purification tablets . according bonn ’ s emergency services the bunker could be used in the event of any future catastrophe , including a terrorist attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the outside the windeck bunker looks like a big cube but this october the bunker has become a refuge for ten german artists who are participating in an exhibition called " licht in den bunker " or " light in the bunker . "
for exhibition organizer and artist gabriele lutterbeck the bunker is a unique and very german place . " we had world war two and we had the nazi regime which ended in a bunker , " she said .
" we wanted to use a space that was old and of no use today and which provides a very special atmosphere . " a world war ii relic built in 1940 , the windeck bunker was an air raid shelter for bonn ’ s residents .
today it is closed to the public and this is the first time an independent art exhibition has been held in the space .
two previous exhibitions were organized by the city of bonn in the bunker as part of local festivals . while some of bonn ’ s residents were glad to stay in the bunker during the war due to the protection it provided , many people today cringe at the thought . " i 'm not sure i want to stay in there - the art is nice but everything else is horrible .
it ’ s creepy because it makes us think about war and everything that could force us go there , " lutterbeck said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only twenty people are permitted in the bunker at a time " there 's a strange sensation when you turn the big , red heavy door to go down into the bunker " she said . on the other side of a red metal door marked schleuse , or gate , visitors climb into a large , square cement room and see the spartan green metal beds and mattresses , and the thin tin partitions that hide toilets behind them . in the middle of the room thomas schneider 's " self-made sm-chair , " a wooden torture chair , immediately puts a chill in the room .
opposite the chair , stuffed colored parrots are arranged behind a glass frame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schneider ’ s installation the " twin-tower-cigarette lighter , " a cigarette lighter decorated with the skyline of new york with the world trade center still standing , is schneider ’ s third work exhibited .
the top of the cigarette lighter is open , splitting the design and cutting the towers in two . lutterbeck said the artists decided to exhibit their existing works or create pieces specifically for the exhibition that would relate to a wartime bunker and the themes associated with it . connecting with germany 's nazi past the three pieces lutterbeck prepared for the exhibition are a very personal reaction to the space .
when she decided to hold an exhibition in the bunker she initially focussed on her own private and personal reactions to it . " i really went into the nazi story because this bunker , although it was changed and maintained , is really a world war ii bunker , " she said her series of blue sketches are a reaction to the lebensborn project – a nazi ss program that set up maternity homes where women of " pure blood " could bear children who fitted the nazi 's preferred racial profile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutterbeck 's work is her personal reaction to the bunker lutterbeck 's second work features the six goebbels children who died in berlin bunker .
their mother , magda , who was married to hitler 's propaganda minister joseph goebbels , allegedly killed the children with cyanide capsules in hitler 's führer bunker on may 1 , 1945 .
lutterbeck 's painting features the family and was photographed and made into a slide which is projected onto the bunker wall . " i put it on a slide because germans like to have these slide shows , usually at christmas , where families look at their own pictures , " she said . everything lutterbeck knows about bunkers comes from her parents who are now deceased .
in order to represent this lutterbeck also chose to exhibit a photograph of her mother at age 12 . a symbol of security during world war ii , the bunker was divided into cells and the nazi party allocated the spaces where between eight to ten people , and later up to 15 people , sat on wooden benches from 5 p.m. every afternoon .
in the last four months leading up to the allies ' arrival in bonn the bunker became even more overcrowded as the number of people looking for safety grew . walter , a 73 -year-old bonn resident who did n't want to give his last name , sought refuge in the bunker with his family when he was aged ten .
he said it was the only place he felt safe . " it 's not a terrible place for me because it was a place of security .
it was a wonderful place and the terrible conditions were accepted because the alternatives were worse , " said walter , who was at the exhibition 's opening . while the bunker for him symbolizes security , he thought having an art exhibition in the space was a " good idea because it demonstrates that the same place can be different depending on the circumstances . " art takes on a different meaning the second floor of the exhibition is much lighter in its themes with tine holterhoff 's colorful photographs featuring facades in red , yellow and blue arranged in grids brighten up the otherwise bleak room .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tatjana schuelke 's speechless takes on a different meaning in the space for berlin artist tatjana schuelke , the use of the bunker as an exhibition space is more interesting than in a typical gallery .
she says her work - like her sculpture " speechless " currently on display - is transformed in a way in this environment .
the candy pink sculpture looks like a bomb and is covered with plaster cast teeth . " in most exhibition spaces it 's a comic sculpture but here in the bunker it takes on a different meaning , " said schuelke . in the final exhibition room two large paintings of red poppies , the symbol of war remembrance in some countries , lie flat on two metal army beds .
along the bottom of the paintings are thick , milky strips of paint . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the lights go out marni 's installation transforms flashlights are handed out and the lights go off .

individuals react more quickly to a fearful expression than to faces showing other emotions such as joy , a study in the journal emotion found .
researchers from vanderbilt university found the same speedy reaction to fear when only the eyes were visible .
it is thought the brain has evolved to react more quickly to potentially threatening situations the brain responds very quickly to all facial expressions - at a speed of less than 40 milliseconds .
so to assess if certain emotions prompt a faster reaction , the researchers had to slow down the speed at which volunteers became aware of facial expressions .
a happy face prompted the slowest reaction time volunteers looked through a viewer which flashed a black and white , quick-changing pattern to one eye and a static image of a face to the other eye .
the flashing image had the effect of slowing down the speed at which the individual noticed the face .
quick response participants became aware of a fearful expression far faster than a neutral or happy face .
reaction to happy faces was consistently slower than for the other expressions looked at .
the fast reaction to fear was the same if the whole face was visible or just the eyes .
it is thought an area of the brain called the amygdala can process simple visual signals bypassing the normal visual processing pathway .
dr david zald , associate professor of psychology at vanderbilt university in nashville , tennessee said : " we believe that the brain can detect certain cues even before we are aware of them , so that we can direct our attention to potentially threatening situations in our environment . "
neutral expressions also produced slower responses than fear he added there was other evidence showing the eyes were an important part of the picture .
" fearful eyes are a particular shape , where you get more of the whites of the eye showing .
" that may be the sort of simple feature that the amygdala can pick up on , because it 's only getting a fairly crude representation . "
he added that the brain may react to happy faces slowly because they signal safety and do not require immediate attention .
the team are now planning to do a similar study to look at the response to anger .
dr bahador bahrami , associate researcher in the ucl institute of cognitive neuroscience in london said the findings were very interesting but not unexpected .
" it 's quite well accepted that fearful faces have a special significance .

individuals react more quickly to a fearful expression than to faces showing other emotions such as joy , a study in the journal emotion found .
researchers from vanderbilt university found the same speedy reaction to fear when only the eyes were visible .
it is thought the brain has evolved to react more quickly to potentially threatening situations the brain responds very quickly to all facial expressions - at a speed of less than 40 milliseconds .
so to assess if certain emotions prompt a faster reaction , the researchers had to slow down the speed at which volunteers became aware of facial expressions .
a happy face prompted the slowest reaction time volunteers looked through a viewer which flashed a black and white , quick-changing pattern to one eye and a static image of a face to the other eye .
the flashing image had the effect of slowing down the speed at which the individual noticed the face .
quick response participants became aware of a fearful expression far faster than a neutral or happy face .
reaction to happy faces was consistently slower than for the other expressions looked at .
the fast reaction to fear was the same if the whole face was visible or just the eyes .
it is thought an area of the brain called the amygdala can process simple visual signals bypassing the normal visual processing pathway .
dr david zald , associate professor of psychology at vanderbilt university in nashville , tennessee said : " we believe that the brain can detect certain cues even before we are aware of them , so that we can direct our attention to potentially threatening situations in our environment . "
neutral expressions also produced slower responses than fear he added there was other evidence showing the eyes were an important part of the picture .
" fearful eyes are a particular shape , where you get more of the whites of the eye showing .
" that may be the sort of simple feature that the amygdala can pick up on , because it 's only getting a fairly crude representation . "
he added that the brain may react to happy faces slowly because they signal safety and do not require immediate attention .
the team are now planning to do a similar study to look at the response to anger .
dr bahador bahrami , associate researcher in the ucl institute of cognitive neuroscience in london said the findings were very interesting but not unexpected .

the observer says nhs data shows the number of men admitted as drink-related emergency cases in england rose by 27.3 % between 2001/02 and 2005/06 .
among women over the same period , there was a 28.9 % rise in admissions .
the figures , which come two years after 24-hour drinking was allowed , suggest the problem is worst in the north east . "
we have a serious alcohol problem in this country and measures to date have n't had any discernible effect " professor ian gilmore , of the royal college of physicians the department of health statistics , which will not be officially released until tuesday , also point towards a north-south divide .
the overall number of men in england admitted to hospital with drink-related problems rose from 714 per 100,000 in 2001-02 to 909 per 100,000 in 2005-06 , according to the report .
over the same period , the number of women admitted rose from 396 per 100,000 to 510 per 100,000 , a rise of 28.9 per cent .
the north east region had the highest number of admissions per 100,000 population for both men -lrb- 1,232 -rrb- and women -lrb- 689 -rrb- in 2005/06 .
the north west was close behind with 1,215 men per 100,000 and 674 women .
the region with the best record was the east of england with admission figures of 743 men and 425 women per 100,000 population .
north-south divide professor ian gilmore , president of the royal college of physicians , told the observer : " we have a serious alcohol problem in this country and measures to date have n't had any discernible effect " .
he suggested increasing the cost of drinking could have the most immediate effect and called for the government to review drink promotions and availability .
nine of the 10 areas with the highest number of alcohol-related emergency admissions are reportedly in the north and include liverpool , manchester and middlesbrough .
most with the lowest numbers are in the south of england .
the cases , taken from patient records kept by every nhs hospital , include people taken to a & e because of their own or someone else 's drinking .
among them are victims of assault , people in accidents or poisoned through drink and those with liver cirrhosis .

the north east region had the highest number of admissions per 100,000 population for both men -lrb- 1,232 -rrb- and women -lrb- 689 -rrb- in 2005/06 .
the north west was close behind with 1,215 men per 100,000 and 674 women .
the region with the best record was the east of england with admission figures of 743 men and 425 women per 100,000 population .
north-south divide professor ian gilmore , president of the royal college of physicians , told the observer : " we have a serious alcohol problem in this country and measures to date have n't had any discernible effect " .
he suggested increasing the cost of drinking could have the most immediate effect and called for the government to review drink promotions and availability .
nine of the 10 areas with the highest number of alcohol-related emergency admissions are reportedly in the north and include liverpool , manchester and middlesbrough .
most with the lowest numbers are in the south of england .
the cases , taken from patient records kept by every nhs hospital , include people taken to a & e because of their own or someone else 's drinking .
among them are victims of assault , people in accidents or poisoned through drink and those with liver cirrhosis .

the shadow home secretary told bbc one 's andrew marr show that the tories would still have to " battle " against gordon brown 's labour party .
but the british people were " listening to us " again , he added .
the comments come as one opinion poll suggests the tories have a seven-point lead over labour .
' copying ' this follows mr brown 's decision not to call an autumn general election and the announcement of conservative plans to raise the inheritance tax threshold to £ 1m .
the prime minister has also been bedevilled by a row over troop withdrawals from iraq and allegations that the government had " stolen " tory ideas by pledging to raise the inheritance tax threshold for couples to £ 700,000 . "
the things we have been putting out on public display in the last few weeks ... are things we 've been thinking about for some time " david davis mr davis said : " ten years as chancellor and now to copy the shadow chancellor 's policy - what sort of a vision is that ? "
he said of mr brown 's downturn in the opinion polls : " frankly , it was more gordon brown than us who did it . "
' raw truth ' the prime minister had " fractured this carefully cultured image " that he was not a " man of spin " .
mr davis said : " the raw truth is we 've been behind in the polls over the summer in brown 's honeymoon . "
he added that , behind the scenes , a " transformation has been going on in british politics .
people are listening to us again . "
mr davis denied criticism that the tories were creating policy in hurry .
he said : " the things we have been putting out on public display in the last few weeks - because we thought there was going to be an election called this week - are things we 've been thinking about for some time . "
of the period since the conservative party conference earlier this month , mr davis said : " the party rose to the occasion and has had the best couple of weeks since 1992 -lsb- when it last won a general election -rsb- . "
' instinct ' but he warned : " we are going to have to battle with them -lsb- labour -rsb- .
we can not forget that and become complacent over the next 18 months . "
mr brown has said he considered calling an election but his " first instinct " was to set aside more time to set out his vision .
this , he added , showed " real strength and real decisiveness " and would allow him to make the correct long-term decisions about the uk 's economy and the security .
an independent communications and marketing -lrb- icm -rrb- opinion poll for the sunday telegraph puts the tories on 43 % , labour on 36 % and the liberal democrats on 14 % .
the poll 's findings were obtained from a random sample of 1,010 adults phoned on 10 and 11 october .

the shadow home secretary told bbc one 's andrew marr show that the tories would still have to " battle " against gordon brown 's labour party .
but the british people were " listening to us " again , he added .
the comments come as one opinion poll suggests the tories have a seven-point lead over labour .
' copying ' this follows mr brown 's decision not to call an autumn general election and the announcement of conservative plans to raise the inheritance tax threshold to £ 1m .
the prime minister has also been bedevilled by a row over troop withdrawals from iraq and allegations that the government had " stolen " tory ideas by pledging to raise the inheritance tax threshold for couples to £ 700,000 .
the things we have been putting out on public display in the last few weeks ... are things we 've been thinking about for some time david davis mr davis said : " ten years as chancellor and now to copy the shadow chancellor 's policy - what sort of a vision is that ? "
he said of mr brown 's downturn in the opinion polls : " frankly , it was more gordon brown than us who did it . "
' raw truth ' the prime minister had " fractured this carefully cultured image " that he was not a " man of spin " .
mr davis said : " the raw truth is we 've been behind in the polls over the summer in brown 's honeymoon . "
he added that , behind the scenes , a " transformation has been going on in british politics .

mr davis denied criticism that the tories were creating policy in hurry .

' instinct ' but he warned : " we are going to have to battle with them -lsb- labour -rsb- .
we can not forget that and become complacent over the next 18 months . "
mr brown has said he considered calling an election but his " first instinct " was to set aside more time to set out his vision .
this , he added , showed " real strength and real decisiveness " and would allow him to make the correct long-term decisions about the uk 's economy and the security .
an independent communications and marketing -lrb- icm -rrb- opinion poll for the sunday telegraph puts the tories on 43 % , labour on 36 % and the liberal democrats on 14 % .

he added that , behind the scenes , a " transformation has been going on in british politics .
people are listening to us again . "
mr davis denied criticism that the tories were creating policy in hurry .
he said : " the things we have been putting out on public display in the last few weeks - because we thought there was going to be an election called this week - are things we 've been thinking about for some time . "
of the period since the conservative party conference earlier this month , mr davis said : " the party rose to the occasion and has had the best couple of weeks since 1992 -lsb- when it last won a general election -rsb- . "
' instinct ' but he warned : " we are going to have to battle with them -lsb- labour -rsb- .
we can not forget that and become complacent over the next 18 months . "
mr brown has said he considered calling an election but his " first instinct " was to set aside more time to set out his vision .
this , he added , showed " real strength and real decisiveness " and would allow him to make the correct long-term decisions about the uk 's economy and the security .
an independent communications and marketing -lrb- icm -rrb- opinion poll for the sunday telegraph puts the tories on 43 % , labour on 36 % and the liberal democrats on 14 % .
the poll 's findings were obtained from a random sample of 1,010 adults phoned on 10 and 11 october .

in an interview on bbc one 's andrew marr show , he said he also wanted the bbc to continue to contribute to the " very nature of the country " .
but he warned no part of the bbc was exempt from the " search for greater value " which began after it did not get the licence fee increase it sought .
the trust is due to unveil a report into the bbc 's six-year plan this week . "
the bbc needs to be more distinctive doing things that other people do n't do " sir michael lyons , bbc trust chairman in the interview , sir michael said less money and many demands from different audiences and technologies meant fewer programmes would be made .
" the only way this budget is going to be balanced is by doing less , " he told andrew marr .
but this would mean resources could be concentrated so there would be no reduction in quality , he said .
" the bbc needs to be more distinctive doing things that other people do n't do , and also those things it does do , doing them in a distinctive way . "
he also ruled out a change to the policy of minimising repeats on primetime bbc one .
asked if there would be more reshowings of popular shows on bbc channels two , three and four , he said there would be repeats . "
i 'm not looking for a fight with any particular presenter " sir michael lyons , bbc trust chairman it has been reported that thousands of jobs could be lost as director general mark thompson attempts to allow for the corporation 's estimated £ 2bn budget shortfall .
sir michael declined to go into specifics on the extent of any cutbacks .
he said : " there are no protected areas .
if you can do things more effectively in any areas , even the priority areas of news and current affairs , then you have to make those savings . "
earlier this week , sir michael told leading broadcasters who have criticised proposed savings to stay out of the public debate .
it followed journalists including john humphrys and jeremy paxman publicly voicing their concerns about cutbacks .
" i 'm not looking for a fight with any particular presenter , " sir michael told andrew marr .
' not apocalyptic ' he said he welcomed " flourishing " debate within the bbc but said it would be regrettable if the public heard an internal battle , which was essentially a " self-protectionist battle " .
" what they want to hear ... is every pound is being squeezed to get the maximum value .
and the bbc is going to be more distinctive in the future .
" we are going to offer something to every licence fee payer but equally we are going to cherish those loyal audiences and the products and programmes which they put the highest value on . "
in recent months , the bbc has been making efforts to restore public trust in the wake of a number of widely reported editorial breaches .
sir michael acknowledged there had been some serious errors revealed but said they were neither " apocalyptic " nor had they fundamentally threatened the corporation .
he suggested taking a lesson from the england rugby team 's exploits in the world cup .
" when times are looking hard , just concentrate on the core job and that will see you through , " he said .
mr thompson will announce the cuts next thursday , a day after he presents his final plans to the bbc trust .
