once heralded as the next great german soccer star , deisler carried the weight of a nation 's expectation with him onto the pitch . the sad sight of sebastian deisler announcing his retirement on tuesday brought to an end the career of a player not only tipped for greatness but one touted as a potential german legend .
while injuries and bouts of depression were certainly the main contributors to deisler 's retirement , could it be that the weight of such expectation also added to the premature end of such a promising career ? deisler , known in the german game as " das supertalent , " was lauded by everyone from coaches to journalists when he began his rise through the ranks at borussia mönchengladbach as an 18-year-old right winger blessed with acceleration , vision and a blistering shot . franz beckenbauer said that deisler was " physically and technically the best in germany " , while rudi völler said at the time that the youngster would be " influential for germany for another ten years . "
the mass-circulation bild newspaper famously exclaimed : " basti fantasti is magical ! " no fewer than 26 clubs were vying for his signature in 1999 when gladbach were relegated .
deisler chose hertha berlin and prompted further exhortations of a legend in the making ; the transfer seen by many as the next step of a journey which would see him eventually fulfil his potential at one of europe 's biggest clubs . after inspiring hertha to champions league qualification from a new right-sided midfield berth and then victories in that competition against the likes of ac milan and chelsea , the widely held belief that his destiny lay among the greats gathered credence when deisler moved to bayern munich . munich dream turns to nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler never hit the heights others expected of him it was in munich that it was all supposed to happen .

under the watchful eye of german icons such as oli hoeness , karl-heinz rummenigge and der kaiser himself , and with first ottmar hitzfeld and then felix magath as his coach , deisler could only prosper in such luminous company . hoeness himself joined the ever-rising chorus of approval on deisler 's arrival : " he 's got unbelievable potential .

deisler in full flow was an awesome sight ; determination , quick feet and pin-point crosses combining with a controlled aggression and a will to win . but it was n't to be .
deisler 's knee problems and the subsequent mental fragility born from the uncertainty and insecurities surrounding his future eventually wrecked his league and international career . twice injury ruled him out of world cups that were his for the taking .

" ' they tortured us with cold in solitary confinement or airlessness often to the point where i fell unconscious , " the now 24-year-old kurnaz told a german parliamentary committee investigating his case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz has made some serious accusations " sometimes , for example we would be punished with a month of cold or the air conditioners would be turned completely off for several weeks . " unhygienic conditions , sleep deprivation and lack of food were also common , he added . " they would hit you , tie you up and then leave you laying there for about 12 hours , " kurnaz said , describing a punishment for talking between prisoners . former government complicit ? on thursday , deputies from opposition parties and the conservative bloc of chancellor angela merkel serving on the parliamentary committee investigating the case demanded to know why former chancellor schröder 's government apparently failed to take action on murat kurnaz 's behalf . kurnaz , who was taken prisoner in pakistan in 2001 , was handed over to american troops and held as an enemy combatant until august 2006 .
he has also testified that he was abused by german intelligence agents while being held in guantanamo in 2002 . shown pictures of three men , bremen-born kurnaz was able to identify one of the germans who allegedly interrogated him in cuba and said it was " highly likely " he had seen a second and was unsure about the identity of the third . kurnaz ' lawyer bernhard docke , who also spoke in front of the parliamentary committee thursday , said the former coalition of social democrats and greens was complicit in the crime committed against kurnaz because it did not work to free him from american custody . " if kurnaz was german , he would have been freed in autumn 2002 , " docke said , adding that at the beginning of 2002 , former foreign minster joschka fischer told kurnaz ' mother germany could not help her son because of his turkish citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another committee is looking into whether german special forces interrogated kurnaz siegfried kauder , head of the parliamentary investigation into the matter , said the way kurnaz was treated in guantanamo was " unfathomable " and added that the committee would continue looking into whether such an offer was actually made . members of the then-governing coalition of social democrats and greens , however , said fischer , a green party member , did try to make the case for kurnaz ' release to then us secretary of state colin powell . two ongoing investigations docke said there was no reason for germany to refuse an alleged american offer to release kurnaz into german custody in 2002 as german and us officials were at that time aware he did not pose a terror threat . wolfgang neskovic , a committee member from the opposition left party , said if the government turned down a us release offer it would have been a " deeply inhumane decision that should have criminal , not just political consequences .

" ' they tortured us with cold in solitary confinement or airlessness often to the point where i fell unconscious , " the now 24-year-old kurnaz told a german parliamentary committee investigating his case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz has made some serious accusations " sometimes , for example we would be punished with a month of cold or the air conditioners would be turned completely off for several weeks . " unhygienic conditions , sleep deprivation and lack of food were also common , he added . " they would hit you , tie you up and then leave you laying there for about 12 hours , " kurnaz said , describing a punishment for talking between prisoners . former government complicit ? on thursday , deputies from opposition parties and the conservative bloc of chancellor angela merkel serving on the parliamentary committee investigating the case demanded to know why former chancellor schröder 's government apparently failed to take action on murat kurnaz 's behalf . kurnaz , who was taken prisoner in pakistan in 2001 , was handed over to american troops and held as an enemy combatant until august 2006 .
he has also testified that he was abused by german intelligence agents while being held in guantanamo in 2002 . shown pictures of three men , bremen-born kurnaz was able to identify one of the germans who allegedly interrogated him in cuba and said it was " highly likely " he had seen a second and was unsure about the identity of the third . kurnaz ' lawyer bernhard docke , who also spoke in front of the parliamentary committee thursday , said the former coalition of social democrats and greens was complicit in the crime committed against kurnaz because it did not work to free him from american custody . " if kurnaz was german , he would have been freed in autumn 2002 , " docke said , adding that at the beginning of 2002 , former foreign minster joschka fischer told kurnaz ' mother germany could not help her son because of his turkish citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another committee is looking into whether german special forces interrogated kurnaz siegfried kauder , head of the parliamentary investigation into the matter , said the way kurnaz was treated in guantanamo was " unfathomable " and added that the committee would continue looking into whether such an offer was actually made . members of the then-governing coalition of social democrats and greens , however , said fischer , a green party member , did try to make the case for kurnaz ' release to then us secretary of state colin powell . two ongoing investigations docke said there was no reason for germany to refuse an alleged american offer to release kurnaz into german custody in 2002 as german and us officials were at that time aware he did not pose a terror threat . wolfgang neskovic , a committee member from the opposition left party , said if the government turned down a us release offer it would have been a " deeply inhumane decision that should have criminal , not just political consequences .

it 's about time , writes deutsche welle 's ralf bosen . that was some political poker in bavaria !
at the very last minute , the head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- literally hit the emergency brake in order to prevent further damage to the party . the unresolved leadership questions in stoiber 's party hurt voter support for both the csu and its sister partner , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
nevertheless , things may not turn out to be all that bad after all .
with günther beckstein as the new bavarian premier and erwin huber as new head of the csu , stoiber 's successors already have a large part of the party and the voters behind them . another advantage of this personnel decision is that the csu chair and the post of the premier will be divided among two individuals - a move that many party members have been advocating for a long time already .
for them , stoiber was too powerful in his double role . stoiber dug his own political grave the political damage stoiber caused in this role is sizeable .
now the csu has to put its money where its mouth is and support a new team of leaders . for the past few weeks , bavaria has been witness to an unusual political drama , full of schmooze and hypocrisy , with edmund stoiber in the starring role - not just as the the victim but also mainly as the villain . it hardly bothered him that bavaria suffered as a result of the power struggle and that he led the csu into one of its worst crises to date . but he 's responsible for getting himself into this situation in the first place . and in the end , he stumbled on account of one of his critics , a councilwoman in his own party . the gabriele pauli affair , which involved allegations that stoiber was aware his top aide was snooping in her private life , was just the latest trigger . his downfall began much earlier , in the fall of 2005 .
at that time he aspired - enthusiastically at first - to the post of a super-minister in the new federal government led by merkel , only to abruptly reject it once he was offered it . his flip-flopping annoyed all of his potential successors and hurt his credibility .
since then , discontent has been simmering behind the csu 's sanitized facade despite stoiber 's many successes in bavaria 's economy and education sector . stoiber was never the sovereign that the bavarians wanted him to be . instead , the bland bavarian premier was more interested in paperwork than in winning the hearts of the citizens . nevertheless , if stoiber had thrown in the towel before the csu convention this week in the town of wildbad kreuth , he would have come away from the affair with a liitle more dignity . political weariness once again citizens have had to observe incredulously just how easily politics can be defined by power struggles and personalities . and they have experienced yet another top politician who just ca n't let go of power .
those who wonder why germany is talking about political jadedness just need to look at bavaria . as for stoiber , he has been the bavarian premier for 14 years and the head of the csu for 8 years .
he was even the conservatives ' candidate for chancellor once . these are all accomplishments that wo n't count for much after his act of self-destruction so far removed from reality . ralf bosen is an expert on german politics at dw-radio -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian premier stoiber says he will step down following a major debate in his christian social union party over his leadership , bavarian premier edmund stoiber has announced that he will step down in september .
-lrb- 18.01.2007 -rrb- top german politician facing pressure to resign as state premier the chair of long-time german powerbroker edmund stoiber is wobbling .
pressure is growing on the conservative bavarian premier to step down and the repercussions could be felt in the german capital as well .
-lrb- 16.01.2007 -rrb- conservative snooping scandal gains traction edmund stoiber , a powerful leader in angela merkel 's conservative camp accepted his chief of staff 's resignation friday after charges the aide snooped on a critic 's private life .
stoiber denies he knew of the snooping .

it 's about time , writes deutsche welle 's ralf bosen . that was some political poker in bavaria !
at the very last minute , the head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- literally hit the emergency brake in order to prevent further damage to the party . the unresolved leadership questions in stoiber 's party hurt voter support for both the csu and its sister partner , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
nevertheless , things may not turn out to be all that bad after all .
with günther beckstein as the new bavarian premier and erwin huber as new head of the csu , stoiber 's successors already have a large part of the party and the voters behind them . another advantage of this personnel decision is that the csu chair and the post of the premier will be divided among two individuals - a move that many party members have been advocating for a long time already .
for them , stoiber was too powerful in his double role . stoiber dug his own political grave the political damage stoiber caused in this role is sizeable .
now the csu has to put its money where its mouth is and support a new team of leaders . for the past few weeks , bavaria has been witness to an unusual political drama , full of schmooze and hypocrisy , with edmund stoiber in the starring role - not just as the the victim but also mainly as the villain . it hardly bothered him that bavaria suffered as a result of the power struggle and that he led the csu into one of its worst crises to date . but he 's responsible for getting himself into this situation in the first place . and in the end , he stumbled on account of one of his critics , a councilwoman in his own party . the gabriele pauli affair , which involved allegations that stoiber was aware his top aide was snooping in her private life , was just the latest trigger . his downfall began much earlier , in the fall of 2005 .
at that time he aspired - enthusiastically at first - to the post of a super-minister in the new federal government led by merkel , only to abruptly reject it once he was offered it . his flip-flopping annoyed all of his potential successors and hurt his credibility .
since then , discontent has been simmering behind the csu 's sanitized facade despite stoiber 's many successes in bavaria 's economy and education sector . stoiber was never the sovereign that the bavarians wanted him to be . instead , the bland bavarian premier was more interested in paperwork than in winning the hearts of the citizens . nevertheless , if stoiber had thrown in the towel before the csu convention this week in the town of wildbad kreuth , he would have come away from the affair with a liitle more dignity . political weariness once again citizens have had to observe incredulously just how easily politics can be defined by power struggles and personalities . and they have experienced yet another top politician who just ca n't let go of power .
those who wonder why germany is talking about political jadedness just need to look at bavaria . as for stoiber , he has been the bavarian premier for 14 years and the head of the csu for 8 years .
he was even the conservatives ' candidate for chancellor once . these are all accomplishments that wo n't count for much after his act of self-destruction so far removed from reality . ralf bosen is an expert on german politics at dw-radio -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian premier stoiber says he will step down following a major debate in his christian social union party over his leadership , bavarian premier edmund stoiber has announced that he will step down in september .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 18.01.2007 weather expert predicts more storms in coming winters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the storm already flipped trailer trucks in northern parts of germany as a severe storm lashed northwestern europe and gathered pace in germany , a weather expert talked to dw-world.de about the causes behind the inclement climate . andreas friedrich is a member of the german weather service 's prediction department . dw-world.de : the extreme low-pressure system " kryill " will reach germany 's north sea coast thursday afternoon .
what do you expect the consequences will be in the country ? andreas friedrich : we expect there will be winds that reach storm levels across the entire country , which is something that sets this low-pressure system apart .
" storm level " means wind strength 11 , which is over 100 kilometer per hour -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- .
they are expected across germany this afternoon -lrb- thursday -rrb- , when the first storm warnings go into effect .
in some areas , especially in the mountains , they will reach speeds much faster than hurricane strength . do you expect heavy precipitation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites have tracked " kryill " for days yes , that is the second element that stormy weather can take on .
there will be heavy rainfall , especially in the low mountain ranges and the west , where as much as 40 liters per square meter -lrb- about 10 gallons per 10 square feet -rrb- could fall within 24 hours .
that would be enough to cross the storm threshold so that people should expect floods in small and mid-sized river encatchment areas . the german weather service has been under criticism for incorrect weather predictions since the 1999 storm " lothar , " which caused $ 6.4 billion worth of damage -lrb- 5 billion euros -rrb- across europe .
has the service become more careful about issuing warnings and how does that affect the current situation ? no , we have not changed our tactics or threshold levels .
with this low-pressure system , we could give a very early warning .
that is a result that was clearly forecast by weather prediction models a few days ago .
there are other weather situations , particularly in the summer , when this is simply impossible .
then you can not predict if a storm that appears to be local will spread and hit certain areas in the future or not . are weather phenomena like " lothar " and other " storms of the century " a sign of climate change ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the storm can alredy been seen in blackpool , england an individual event can not be connected to climate change .
in order to do that you need observations that span decades .
but the climate models predict that if these trends are confirmed and the increase in temperature continues , winters will have heavier precipitation .
this precipitation is connected to intense low-pressure situations .
one could expect that these weather conditions will appear more often in the winter . is the " kryill " low-pressure system nothing but hot air when compared to the hurricanes and typhoons that occur in other regions of the world ? tropical cyclones naturally have stronger winds than this kind of non-tropical , low-pressure system .
hurricane winds can reach a speed of up to 300 kph .
but what we are experiencing now is an unusual development that only occurs in central europe every few years . christoph j. heuer interviewed andreas friedrich -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de heavy storms batter northern europe winds gusting up to 130 kilometers an hour -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- lashed parts of europe thursday , sinking two irish trawlers and leaving seven fishermen missing , while causing widespread disruption to sea and air traffic .

it turned out to be germany 's warmest year since 1901 , according to a report from the german weather service .

" this is a very critical time for the international community and for the middle east , " rice said , adding that the united states continued to support a two-state solution for israel and the palestinians " in peace , democracy and freedom . " germany , in its capacity as the current eu president , has pushed for a revitalized role for the quartet at what it considers to be an auspicious time to bring an end to the bloodshed . " a solution to that problem is more urgent today than ever , " steinmeier said .
" we are both of the opinion that the time is ripe for a meeting of the quartet . " its last full meeting was in september . six-country tour rice arrived for her two-day visit in germany on wednesday from kuwait after completing a six-country tour of the middle east during which she announced she would hold a three-way summit with israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas within a month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice met egyptian president hosni mubarak on monday she said in berlin it would take " a few weeks " to organize the three-way summit . " i think it will be useful to have the meeting with the quartet in advance of that , " rice said . rice said sunday washington wanted to build on what she called " the momentum that is currently in palestinian-israeli relations . " steinmeier said he believed the stalled roadmap - the peace plan drawn up in 2003 by the members of the quartet with the aim of establishing a viable palestinian state living peacefully alongside israel - remained the best option for progress . in berlin , rice also met christopher hill , the top us envoy to six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear weapons program , who is holding discussions with the north 's negotiator in the german capital . rice 's trip to the middle east had the dual aims of breathing new life into the palestinian-israeli peace process and winning support for the bush administration 's plan to deploy more than 20,000 additional us troops in iraq . after talks with rice in kuwait city tuesday , the six members of the pro-us gulf cooperation council along with egypt and jordan gave the plan a cautious welcome and issued a call for iraq 's neighbors not to meddle in the strife-torn country . skeptical middle east many arab countries are concerned about iran 's growing power in the region . kuwaiti foreign minister sheikh mohammad al-sabah told a joint news conference with rice : " with respect to us policy towards iran ... the us and the gulf -lrb- states -rrb- expressed in -lrb- a -rrb- joint communiqué that we call to all countries to refrain from interfering in iraqi internal affairs . " the gulf states and the us said they wanted to prevent iraq " becoming a battleground for regional and international powers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syrian president assad is accused by the us of meddling in iraq this could also refer to syria which has been repeatedly accused by washington of fueling the iraqi insurgency . " we expressed our desire to see the president 's plan to reinforce the american military presence in baghdad as a vehicle ... to stabilize baghdad and to prevent iraq from sliding into this ugly war , " the kuwaiti foreign minister said . rice admitted that iraq 's predominantly sunni arab neighbors were skeptical about the ability of iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki 's shiite government to halt the sectarian violence that has pitted sunni arabs against shiites . " there are concerns about whether the maliki government is prepared to take an even-handed , non-sectarian path ... but everybody wants to give this a chance .
that is the position of the people in the region and there is in fact a burden on the iraqi government to perform , " she said in kuwait . she will continue on to london , the last stop of her tour , thursday . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us and north korea pursue nuclear talks in berlin the top us envoy to unprecedented six-way talks on north korea 's nuclear arms said in berlin he was having " useful discussions " with his pyongyang counterpart and hoped negotiations would resume this month .

" this is a very critical time for the international community and for the middle east , " rice said , adding that the united states continued to support a two-state solution for israel and the palestinians " in peace , democracy and freedom . " germany , in its capacity as the current eu president , has pushed for a revitalized role for the quartet at what it considers to be an auspicious time to bring an end to the bloodshed . " a solution to that problem is more urgent today than ever , " steinmeier said .
" we are both of the opinion that the time is ripe for a meeting of the quartet . " its last full meeting was in september . six-country tour rice arrived for her two-day visit in germany on wednesday from kuwait after completing a six-country tour of the middle east during which she announced she would hold a three-way summit with israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas within a month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice met egyptian president hosni mubarak on monday she said in berlin it would take " a few weeks " to organize the three-way summit . " i think it will be useful to have the meeting with the quartet in advance of that , " rice said . rice said sunday washington wanted to build on what she called " the momentum that is currently in palestinian-israeli relations . " steinmeier said he believed the stalled roadmap - the peace plan drawn up in 2003 by the members of the quartet with the aim of establishing a viable palestinian state living peacefully alongside israel - remained the best option for progress . in berlin , rice also met christopher hill , the top us envoy to six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear weapons program , who is holding discussions with the north 's negotiator in the german capital . rice 's trip to the middle east had the dual aims of breathing new life into the palestinian-israeli peace process and winning support for the bush administration 's plan to deploy more than 20,000 additional us troops in iraq . after talks with rice in kuwait city tuesday , the six members of the pro-us gulf cooperation council along with egypt and jordan gave the plan a cautious welcome and issued a call for iraq 's neighbors not to meddle in the strife-torn country . skeptical middle east many arab countries are concerned about iran 's growing power in the region . kuwaiti foreign minister sheikh mohammad al-sabah told a joint news conference with rice : " with respect to us policy towards iran ... the us and the gulf -lrb- states -rrb- expressed in -lrb- a -rrb- joint communiqué that we call to all countries to refrain from interfering in iraqi internal affairs . " the gulf states and the us said they wanted to prevent iraq " becoming a battleground for regional and international powers .

it 's about time , writes deutsche welle 's ralf bosen . that was some political poker in bavaria !
at the very last minute , the head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- literally hit the emergency brake in order to prevent further damage to the party . the unresolved leadership questions in stoiber 's party hurt voter support for both the csu and its sister partner , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
nevertheless , things may not turn out to be all that bad after all .
with günther beckstein as the new bavarian premier and erwin huber as new head of the csu , stoiber 's successors already have a large part of the party and the voters behind them . another advantage of this personnel decision is that the csu chair and the post of the premier will be divided among two individuals - a move that many party members have been advocating for a long time already .
for them , stoiber was too powerful in his double role . stoiber dug his own political grave the political damage stoiber caused in this role is sizeable .
now the csu has to put its money where its mouth is and support a new team of leaders . for the past few weeks , bavaria has been witness to an unusual political drama , full of schmooze and hypocrisy , with edmund stoiber in the starring role - not just as the the victim but also mainly as the villain . it hardly bothered him that bavaria suffered as a result of the power struggle and that he led the csu into one of its worst crises to date . but he 's responsible for getting himself into this situation in the first place . and in the end , he stumbled on account of one of his critics , a councilwoman in his own party . the gabriele pauli affair , which involved allegations that stoiber was aware his top aide was snooping in her private life , was just the latest trigger . his downfall began much earlier , in the fall of 2005 .
at that time he aspired - enthusiastically at first - to the post of a super-minister in the new federal government led by merkel , only to abruptly reject it once he was offered it . his flip-flopping annoyed all of his potential successors and hurt his credibility .
since then , discontent has been simmering behind the csu 's sanitized facade despite stoiber 's many successes in bavaria 's economy and education sector . stoiber was never the sovereign that the bavarians wanted him to be . instead , the bland bavarian premier was more interested in paperwork than in winning the hearts of the citizens . nevertheless , if stoiber had thrown in the towel before the csu convention this week in the town of wildbad kreuth , he would have come away from the affair with a liitle more dignity . political weariness once again citizens have had to observe incredulously just how easily politics can be defined by power struggles and personalities . and they have experienced yet another top politician who just ca n't let go of power .
those who wonder why germany is talking about political jadedness just need to look at bavaria . as for stoiber , he has been the bavarian premier for 14 years and the head of the csu for 8 years .
he was even the conservatives ' candidate for chancellor once . these are all accomplishments that wo n't count for much after his act of self-destruction so far removed from reality . ralf bosen is an expert on german politics at dw-radio -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian premier stoiber says he will step down following a major debate in his christian social union party over his leadership , bavarian premier edmund stoiber has announced that he will step down in september .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.01.2007 opinion : stoiber finally hits the emergency brakes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : following stormy debate in his christian social union party over his leadership , embattled bavarian premier stoiber has announced he will step down in september .
it 's about time , writes deutsche welle 's ralf bosen . that was some political poker in bavaria !
at the very last minute , the head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- literally hit the emergency brake in order to prevent further damage to the party . the unresolved leadership questions in stoiber 's party hurt voter support for both the csu and its sister partner , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
nevertheless , things may not turn out to be all that bad after all .
with günther beckstein as the new bavarian premier and erwin huber as new head of the csu , stoiber 's successors already have a large part of the party and the voters behind them . another advantage of this personnel decision is that the csu chair and the post of the premier will be divided among two individuals - a move that many party members have been advocating for a long time already .
for them , stoiber was too powerful in his double role . stoiber dug his own political grave the political damage stoiber caused in this role is sizeable .
now the csu has to put its money where its mouth is and support a new team of leaders . for the past few weeks , bavaria has been witness to an unusual political drama , full of schmooze and hypocrisy , with edmund stoiber in the starring role - not just as the the victim but also mainly as the villain . it hardly bothered him that bavaria suffered as a result of the power struggle and that he led the csu into one of its worst crises to date . but he 's responsible for getting himself into this situation in the first place . and in the end , he stumbled on account of one of his critics , a councilwoman in his own party . the gabriele pauli affair , which involved allegations that stoiber was aware his top aide was snooping in her private life , was just the latest trigger . his downfall began much earlier , in the fall of 2005 .
at that time he aspired - enthusiastically at first - to the post of a super-minister in the new federal government led by merkel , only to abruptly reject it once he was offered it . his flip-flopping annoyed all of his potential successors and hurt his credibility .
since then , discontent has been simmering behind the csu 's sanitized facade despite stoiber 's many successes in bavaria 's economy and education sector . stoiber was never the sovereign that the bavarians wanted him to be . instead , the bland bavarian premier was more interested in paperwork than in winning the hearts of the citizens . nevertheless , if stoiber had thrown in the towel before the csu convention this week in the town of wildbad kreuth , he would have come away from the affair with a liitle more dignity . political weariness once again citizens have had to observe incredulously just how easily politics can be defined by power struggles and personalities . and they have experienced yet another top politician who just ca n't let go of power .
those who wonder why germany is talking about political jadedness just need to look at bavaria . as for stoiber , he has been the bavarian premier for 14 years and the head of the csu for 8 years .
he was even the conservatives ' candidate for chancellor once . these are all accomplishments that wo n't count for much after his act of self-destruction so far removed from reality . ralf bosen is an expert on german politics at dw-radio -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian premier stoiber says he will step down following a major debate in his christian social union party over his leadership , bavarian premier edmund stoiber has announced that he will step down in september .
-lrb- 18.01.2007 -rrb- top german politician facing pressure to resign as state premier the chair of long-time german powerbroker edmund stoiber is wobbling .
pressure is growing on the conservative bavarian premier to step down and the repercussions could be felt in the german capital as well .
-lrb- 16.01.2007 -rrb- conservative snooping scandal gains traction edmund stoiber , a powerful leader in angela merkel 's conservative camp accepted his chief of staff 's resignation friday after charges the aide snooped on a critic 's private life .
stoiber denies he knew of the snooping .

what do you expect the consequences will be in the country ? andreas friedrich : we expect there will be winds that reach storm levels across the entire country , which is something that sets this low-pressure system apart .
" storm level " means wind strength 11 , which is over 100 kilometer per hour -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- .
they are expected across germany this afternoon -lrb- thursday -rrb- , when the first storm warnings go into effect .
in some areas , especially in the mountains , they will reach speeds much faster than hurricane strength . do you expect heavy precipitation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites have tracked " kryill " for days yes , that is the second element that stormy weather can take on .
there will be heavy rainfall , especially in the low mountain ranges and the west , where as much as 40 liters per square meter -lrb- about 10 gallons per 10 square feet -rrb- could fall within 24 hours .
that would be enough to cross the storm threshold so that people should expect floods in small and mid-sized river encatchment areas . the german weather service has been under criticism for incorrect weather predictions since the 1999 storm " lothar , " which caused $ 6.4 billion worth of damage -lrb- 5 billion euros -rrb- across europe .
has the service become more careful about issuing warnings and how does that affect the current situation ? no , we have not changed our tactics or threshold levels .
with this low-pressure system , we could give a very early warning .
that is a result that was clearly forecast by weather prediction models a few days ago .
there are other weather situations , particularly in the summer , when this is simply impossible .
then you can not predict if a storm that appears to be local will spread and hit certain areas in the future or not . are weather phenomena like " lothar " and other " storms of the century " a sign of climate change ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the storm can alredy been seen in blackpool , england an individual event can not be connected to climate change .
in order to do that you need observations that span decades .
but the climate models predict that if these trends are confirmed and the increase in temperature continues , winters will have heavier precipitation .
this precipitation is connected to intense low-pressure situations .
one could expect that these weather conditions will appear more often in the winter . is the " kryill " low-pressure system nothing but hot air when compared to the hurricanes and typhoons that occur in other regions of the world ? tropical cyclones naturally have stronger winds than this kind of non-tropical , low-pressure system .
hurricane winds can reach a speed of up to 300 kph .

" ' they tortured us with cold in solitary confinement or airlessness often to the point where i fell unconscious , " the now 24-year-old kurnaz told a german parliamentary committee investigating his case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz has made some serious accusations " sometimes , for example we would be punished with a month of cold or the air conditioners would be turned completely off for several weeks . " unhygienic conditions , sleep deprivation and lack of food were also common , he added . " they would hit you , tie you up and then leave you laying there for about 12 hours , " kurnaz said , describing a punishment for talking between prisoners . former government complicit ? on thursday , deputies from opposition parties and the conservative bloc of chancellor angela merkel serving on the parliamentary committee investigating the case demanded to know why former chancellor schröder 's government apparently failed to take action on murat kurnaz 's behalf . kurnaz , who was taken prisoner in pakistan in 2001 , was handed over to american troops and held as an enemy combatant until august 2006 .
he has also testified that he was abused by german intelligence agents while being held in guantanamo in 2002 . shown pictures of three men , bremen-born kurnaz was able to identify one of the germans who allegedly interrogated him in cuba and said it was " highly likely " he had seen a second and was unsure about the identity of the third . kurnaz ' lawyer bernhard docke , who also spoke in front of the parliamentary committee thursday , said the former coalition of social democrats and greens was complicit in the crime committed against kurnaz because it did not work to free him from american custody . " if kurnaz was german , he would have been freed in autumn 2002 , " docke said , adding that at the beginning of 2002 , former foreign minster joschka fischer told kurnaz ' mother germany could not help her son because of his turkish citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another committee is looking into whether german special forces interrogated kurnaz siegfried kauder , head of the parliamentary investigation into the matter , said the way kurnaz was treated in guantanamo was " unfathomable " and added that the committee would continue looking into whether such an offer was actually made . members of the then-governing coalition of social democrats and greens , however , said fischer , a green party member , did try to make the case for kurnaz ' release to then us secretary of state colin powell . two ongoing investigations docke said there was no reason for germany to refuse an alleged american offer to release kurnaz into german custody in 2002 as german and us officials were at that time aware he did not pose a terror threat . wolfgang neskovic , a committee member from the opposition left party , said if the government turned down a us release offer it would have been a " deeply inhumane decision that should have criminal , not just political consequences . " the german defense ministry is also investigating kurnaz ' claims of abuse at a kandahar prison after admitting that german special forces had been " in contact " with him . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anger simmers among europe 's ex-guantanamo inmates european former inmates of the us-run guantanamo bay prison , most of whom returned home after long , harsh detentions without ever being convicted of a crime , remain angry about what happened to them there .

" there is no doubt that there could be a very important effect on the entire region if we are able to make progress on middle east peace , " said rice , who later left for london to brief british prime minister tony blair . rice and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier announced late wednesday that representatives from the united nations , the united states , russia and the european union would meet in washington next month to discuss ways to end the middle east conflict . rice said thursday that the meeting would probably take place feb .
2 . the chief us diplomat came to berlin after a six-country middle east tour during which she announced she would hold a summit with israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas within a month . rice touts mid-east peace summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said israel and the palestinians were ready to talk rice said it would take " a few weeks " to organize the summit but added thursday that both the israelis and palestinians were ready to work toward a lasting solution . " i did find the parties to be very desirous of accelerating progress on the road map , of extending the momentum that has been achieved in the meeting between prime minister olmert and president abbas , " rice said , referring to preliminary talks held last month . " i believe that the whole region is looking for a way to accelerate progress and to drag toward the establishment of a palestinian state and so this is a very important time . " germany , as the current eu president , has made revitalizing the quartet one of its priorities .
it held its last full meeting in september . merkel pleased with us movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel welcomed us moves to kick-start peace talks merkel made the appeal this month in washington to us president george w. bush , who agreed to send rice to the middle east . " we have the impression that there is movement on the issue of the israeli-palestinian conflict , " merkel said thursday . " we have a common political interest in finding a solution to this conflict and the european union would like to make a contribution within the framework of the quartet , " the chancellor added .
" we know that resolving this conflict or at least making progress would also have an effect on all the other regional conflicts . " rice said late wednesday that she hoped the international partners would help both sides to move forward on the stalled roadmap , the peace plan that the quartet drew up in 2003 with the aim of establishing a viable palestinian state living peacefully alongside israel . " it has the backing of israelis and palestinians , but it also has the backing of the entire international system , " rice said .
" i would expect that as we try to accelerate progress on the roadmap , the quartet would try and lend assistance to the parties as they try to do it . " north korea , iran also on berlin agenda in berlin , rice also met assistant secretary of state christopher hill , the top us envoy to six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear weapons , who held discussions with the north 's negotiator kim kye-gwan in the german capital . she said she hoped the six-way negotiations would resume soon and that hill 's talks in germany would pave the way for " a more favorable atmosphere " in the full discussions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will not talk with ahmadinejad 's iran rice also briefed merkel on iran 's nuclear ambitions , although wednesday she bluntly reiterated the us administration 's refusal to engage in bilateral talks with tehran until it stops enriching uranium . " this is not the time to break a longstanding american policy of not engaging with the iranians bilaterally , " she said .
" it 's just not the time .

30 . " i have decided that i will not stand in the regional elections next year " and therefore will make way for a new candidate to lead the party , he told journalists in munich . stoiber , a strategic ally of chancellor angela merkel , has faced strong pressure to resign since opinion polls showed last weekend that support for the party has plummeted . " my aim is to ensure that bavaria remains the most successful state in germany , " he said , explaining his decision .
rifts with berlin start the slide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel 's relationship nose-dived stoiber has been a thorn in the side of chancellor angela merkel and her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , sister party of the csu , since abruptly dropping plans to join her cabinet soon after the 2005 general election . he was proposed as the new economy minister but rejected the post just weeks before her coalition was formed . the incident only strengthened the beliefs of many in berlin that stoiber was reluctant to leave the comfort of his home state for bigger challenges . adding further weight to that argument , he retreated to his bavarian fiefdom but continued to haunt the conservatives from his southern base by criticizing the government and attempting to block merkel 's reform plans , most publicly the much-maligned health care reform , losing friends and allies as a result . an attack dog in german politics , stoiber often chipped away at berlin 's authority over the country 's 16 states .
he also led the german center-right to overtly oppose turkish entry into the " christian " european union . kurt beck , the head of the social democratic party , with which merkel shares power , said having a lame duck premier in bavaria would complicate national negotiations , though he said it would not affect cooperation within the ruling grand coalition . rival 's allegations stick like mud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber never recovered from pauli 's allegations the slide in his popularity dropped into freefall after it was revealed last month that one of stoiber 's top aides pried into the private life of a rival . stoiber vehemently rejected the allegations made by party rival gabriele pauli that he knew about the efforts by his office to gather compromising information on pauli 's private life . but despite the denials , stoiber 's reputation as a political troublemaker was only enhanced .
the unrest the scandal caused almost certainly contributed to stoiber 's position becoming untenable . seen as one of the driving forces behind stoiber 's decision , pauli tried to play down her role in the week-long power struggle within the csu . " i only said what many others in the party thought , " she said .
" something can only get rolling when the stones are loose . " however , despite the growing unrest , stoiber was considered a sure thing for another shot at re-election as recently as a month ago . any new leader could bring peace , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein is being touted as the new premier his decision to stand down before next year 's state elections is being seen as a boost to the chancellor . " this could be good for merkel , " oskar niedermayer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , told reuters .
" just about any successor to stoiber would improve the relationship between the cdu and the csu in the government and in parliament . " according to sources within the csu , bavarian interior minister günther beckstein would replace stoiber as premier of the rich southern state stoiber has headed since 1993 . both german agriculture minister horst seehofer and the bavarian economy minister erwin huber have express interest in becoming become head of the csu , of which stoiber has been leader since 1999 . seehofer , who this week was exposed to of had an extramarital affair , had previously said he would only consider taking the position if stoiber willingly left the office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will stoiber turn his back on politics for good ?
stoiber 's announcement signals the potential end of a political career which very nearly hit the heights . he was denied becoming german chancellor in 2002 by just a few thousand votes , losing ground to eventual winner gerhard schröder on issues such as the flooding in eastern germany and the iraq war . however , despite never having the top job , stoiber has enjoyed great status . as premier of bavaria , he has not only ruled one of germany 's most prosperous regions but has also wielded unique power on the national stage , running a party that is outside merkel 's control , enjoying the use of royal palaces , dominating every aspect of administration and basking in the acclaim of the mainly catholic population . however , with his career seemingly reeling from one blow too many , stoiber faces leaving the podium for the last time with the words of the f rankfurter allgemeine zeitung inscribed on his political tombstone : " stoiber has shrunk from being a feared provincial ruler and politician of federal stature to a national joke : a toothless lion , a blunt guillotine .

once heralded as the next great german soccer star , deisler carried the weight of a nation 's expectation with him onto the pitch . the sad sight of sebastian deisler announcing his retirement on tuesday brought to an end the career of a player not only tipped for greatness but one touted as a potential german legend .
while injuries and bouts of depression were certainly the main contributors to deisler 's retirement , could it be that the weight of such expectation also added to the premature end of such a promising career ? deisler , known in the german game as " das supertalent , " was lauded by everyone from coaches to journalists when he began his rise through the ranks at borussia mönchengladbach as an 18-year-old right winger blessed with acceleration , vision and a blistering shot . franz beckenbauer said that deisler was " physically and technically the best in germany " , while rudi völler said at the time that the youngster would be " influential for germany for another ten years . "
the mass-circulation bild newspaper famously exclaimed : " basti fantasti is magical ! " no fewer than 26 clubs were vying for his signature in 1999 when gladbach were relegated .
deisler chose hertha berlin and prompted further exhortations of a legend in the making ; the transfer seen by many as the next step of a journey which would see him eventually fulfil his potential at one of europe 's biggest clubs . after inspiring hertha to champions league qualification from a new right-sided midfield berth and then victories in that competition against the likes of ac milan and chelsea , the widely held belief that his destiny lay among the greats gathered credence when deisler moved to bayern munich . munich dream turns to nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler never hit the heights others expected of him it was in munich that it was all supposed to happen .

it 'll be great for him to be able to show everybody , " he said at the time . his performances in a bayern shirt at times suggested that his elevation to the pantheon of german greats was on schedule .

deisler 's knee problems and the subsequent mental fragility born from the uncertainty and insecurities surrounding his future eventually wrecked his league and international career . twice injury ruled him out of world cups that were his for the taking .

once heralded as the next great german soccer star , deisler carried the weight of a nation 's expectation with him onto the pitch . the sad sight of sebastian deisler announcing his retirement on tuesday brought to an end the career of a player not only tipped for greatness but one touted as a potential german legend .
while injuries and bouts of depression were certainly the main contributors to deisler 's retirement , could it be that the weight of such expectation also added to the premature end of such a promising career ? deisler , known in the german game as " das supertalent , " was lauded by everyone from coaches to journalists when he began his rise through the ranks at borussia mönchengladbach as an 18-year-old right winger blessed with acceleration , vision and a blistering shot . franz beckenbauer said that deisler was " physically and technically the best in germany " , while rudi völler said at the time that the youngster would be " influential for germany for another ten years . "
the mass-circulation bild newspaper famously exclaimed : " basti fantasti is magical ! " no fewer than 26 clubs were vying for his signature in 1999 when gladbach were relegated .
deisler chose hertha berlin and prompted further exhortations of a legend in the making ; the transfer seen by many as the next step of a journey which would see him eventually fulfil his potential at one of europe 's biggest clubs . after inspiring hertha to champions league qualification from a new right-sided midfield berth and then victories in that competition against the likes of ac milan and chelsea , the widely held belief that his destiny lay among the greats gathered credence when deisler moved to bayern munich . munich dream turns to nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler never hit the heights others expected of him it was in munich that it was all supposed to happen .
if germany has its own theater of dreams akin to manchester united 's old trafford , bayern 's former home at the olympiastadion was it .
under the watchful eye of german icons such as oli hoeness , karl-heinz rummenigge and der kaiser himself , and with first ottmar hitzfeld and then felix magath as his coach , deisler could only prosper in such luminous company . hoeness himself joined the ever-rising chorus of approval on deisler 's arrival : " he 's got unbelievable potential .
it 'll be great for him to be able to show everybody , " he said at the time . his performances in a bayern shirt at times suggested that his elevation to the pantheon of german greats was on schedule .
deisler in full flow was an awesome sight ; determination , quick feet and pin-point crosses combining with a controlled aggression and a will to win . but it was n't to be .
deisler 's knee problems and the subsequent mental fragility born from the uncertainty and insecurities surrounding his future eventually wrecked his league and international career . twice injury ruled him out of world cups that were his for the taking .
who can say how germany would have played with a fully fit deisler in the team in the 2002 final against brazil ?
maybe there would have been no need for the heart-breaking extra-time which brought defeat in the 2006 semi-final against italy had " basti fantasti " been on the pitch in dortmund . an unachievable level of greatness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are all new stars expected to eclipse der kaiser ?
" das supertalent " leaves these and many other questions unanswered , his body and mind no longer equipped for the rigors of the game he graced .
could he ever have reached the heights others expected of him ?
what constitutes a german legend anyway ?
is it a player who can eclipse possibly the greatest of all , franz beckenbauer ?
if so , the bar is set incredibly high . many have tried and have been found wanting .
michael ballack , currently germany 's one true world star , was another to show great potential and make good on his promise within the bundesliga .
but even he has tripped in making his next step ; the mercurial midfielder is now seen as an industrious rather than skilful player in chelsea 's diamond-studded team , toiling in an english premiership hardly short of star names . young stars shouldering the burden bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski 's form for germany has gone missing at bayern the likes of benjamin lauth and benny auer were also been saddled with the " next big thing " tags early in their careers and both fell by the wayside .

30 . " i have decided that i will not stand in the regional elections next year " and therefore will make way for a new candidate to lead the party , he told journalists in munich . stoiber , a strategic ally of chancellor angela merkel , has faced strong pressure to resign since opinion polls showed last weekend that support for the party has plummeted . " my aim is to ensure that bavaria remains the most successful state in germany , " he said , explaining his decision .

he also led the german center-right to overtly oppose turkish entry into the " christian " european union . kurt beck , the head of the social democratic party , with which merkel shares power , said having a lame duck premier in bavaria would complicate national negotiations , though he said it would not affect cooperation within the ruling grand coalition . rival 's allegations stick like mud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber never recovered from pauli 's allegations the slide in his popularity dropped into freefall after it was revealed last month that one of stoiber 's top aides pried into the private life of a rival . stoiber vehemently rejected the allegations made by party rival gabriele pauli that he knew about the efforts by his office to gather compromising information on pauli 's private life . but despite the denials , stoiber 's reputation as a political troublemaker was only enhanced .
the unrest the scandal caused almost certainly contributed to stoiber 's position becoming untenable . seen as one of the driving forces behind stoiber 's decision , pauli tried to play down her role in the week-long power struggle within the csu . " i only said what many others in the party thought , " she said .

" just about any successor to stoiber would improve the relationship between the cdu and the csu in the government and in parliament . " according to sources within the csu , bavarian interior minister günther beckstein would replace stoiber as premier of the rich southern state stoiber has headed since 1993 . both german agriculture minister horst seehofer and the bavarian economy minister erwin huber have express interest in becoming become head of the csu , of which stoiber has been leader since 1999 . seehofer , who this week was exposed to of had an extramarital affair , had previously said he would only consider taking the position if stoiber willingly left the office .

deisler in full flow was an awesome sight ; determination , quick feet and pin-point crosses combining with a controlled aggression and a will to win . but it was n't to be .
deisler 's knee problems and the subsequent mental fragility born from the uncertainty and insecurities surrounding his future eventually wrecked his league and international career . twice injury ruled him out of world cups that were his for the taking .
who can say how germany would have played with a fully fit deisler in the team in the 2002 final against brazil ?
maybe there would have been no need for the heart-breaking extra-time which brought defeat in the 2006 semi-final against italy had " basti fantasti " been on the pitch in dortmund . an unachievable level of greatness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are all new stars expected to eclipse der kaiser ?
" das supertalent " leaves these and many other questions unanswered , his body and mind no longer equipped for the rigors of the game he graced .
could he ever have reached the heights others expected of him ?
what constitutes a german legend anyway ?
is it a player who can eclipse possibly the greatest of all , franz beckenbauer ?
if so , the bar is set incredibly high . many have tried and have been found wanting .
michael ballack , currently germany 's one true world star , was another to show great potential and make good on his promise within the bundesliga .
but even he has tripped in making his next step ; the mercurial midfielder is now seen as an industrious rather than skilful player in chelsea 's diamond-studded team , toiling in an english premiership hardly short of star names . young stars shouldering the burden bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski 's form for germany has gone missing at bayern the likes of benjamin lauth and benny auer were also been saddled with the " next big thing " tags early in their careers and both fell by the wayside .
currently , bayern teammates lukas podolski , bastian schweinsteiger and philipp lahm all share the burden of a country 's high expectations .
their own performances and the current erratic form of their team suggest that their own journeys may have stalled on the autobahn to greatness . living up to one 's own expectations is often hard enough , but trying to achieve those of others is particularly difficult , especially when that expectation is one as relative as greatness .
sebastian deisler is unlikely to spend much time pondering this but those who continue to add such pressures onto the shoulders of already burdened young stars maybe should . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de injury convinces gifted deisler to end career injury finally took its toll on bayern munich 's german international sebastian deisler , who quit professional soccer on tuesday after battling for years against a succession of serious knee problems .

it 's the first city to be shown in detailed 3-d on google earth . the construction workers and craftsmen who erected hamburg 's opera house in the 1670s or its national theater in the 1760s never could have imagined that , several centuries later , internet users in san francisco , sydney or new delhi would be able to view their handiwork from the comfort of their homes and offices . thanks to a cooperative project between google and hamburg @ work , an initiative that networks public and private members of the media , information technology and telecommunications branches , visitors to the google earth web site will soon be able to take a virtual three-dimensional tour of the northern germany city . up close and per sonal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's city hall from the sky - or your living room so far , only american cities have been available in 3-d format at google earth .
not only is hamburg the first european city to be added to the website in 3-d , its virtual map also represents a technical advancement . " by showing the texture on the buildings ' facades , hamburg is worldwide the first city to be available in such great detail , " google spokesman stefan keuchel told reporters wednesday in hamburg . in the existing 3-d models , only notable landmarks have been shown in detail , while the other buildings appear on the screen as white blocks .
hamburg will be different . " the internet user can view buildings from a virtual distance of up to 30 centimeters -lrb- one foot -rrb- , " stefan klein from hamburg @ work told reporters wednesday .
due to the added dimension , the buildings can be circled and seen from every angle . angled photos allow for detailed facades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cybercity and the state geological office paid for the project - not google the swiss-based company cybercity , which was responsible for the technical aspects of the project , took 500 aerial photographs taken at an angle from 1,000 meters -lrb- 3,280 feet -rrb- .
these were then used to digitally extrapolate the building facade in detail . cybercity developed the software that is capable of undoing the distortion inherent to the diagonal aerial photos and transferring the images to the 3-d model , michael schulze-horsel from cybercity told dw-world.de. no one has disclosed exactly when the 3-d tour of hamburg will be accessible online .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.01.2007 bavarian premier stoiber says he will step down großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of an era following a major debate in his christian social union party over his leadership , bavarian premier edmund stoiber has announced that he will step down in september . the embattled leader of bavaria 's ruling party , stoiber said he would step down as chairman of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and premier of the german state on sept .
30 . " i have decided that i will not stand in the regional elections next year " and therefore will make way for a new candidate to lead the party , he told journalists in munich . stoiber , a strategic ally of chancellor angela merkel , has faced strong pressure to resign since opinion polls showed last weekend that support for the party has plummeted . " my aim is to ensure that bavaria remains the most successful state in germany , " he said , explaining his decision .
rifts with berlin start the slide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel 's relationship nose-dived stoiber has been a thorn in the side of chancellor angela merkel and her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , sister party of the csu , since abruptly dropping plans to join her cabinet soon after the 2005 general election . he was proposed as the new economy minister but rejected the post just weeks before her coalition was formed . the incident only strengthened the beliefs of many in berlin that stoiber was reluctant to leave the comfort of his home state for bigger challenges . adding further weight to that argument , he retreated to his bavarian fiefdom but continued to haunt the conservatives from his southern base by criticizing the government and attempting to block merkel 's reform plans , most publicly the much-maligned health care reform , losing friends and allies as a result . an attack dog in german politics , stoiber often chipped away at berlin 's authority over the country 's 16 states .
he also led the german center-right to overtly oppose turkish entry into the " christian " european union . kurt beck , the head of the social democratic party , with which merkel shares power , said having a lame duck premier in bavaria would complicate national negotiations , though he said it would not affect cooperation within the ruling grand coalition . rival 's allegations stick like mud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber never recovered from pauli 's allegations the slide in his popularity dropped into freefall after it was revealed last month that one of stoiber 's top aides pried into the private life of a rival . stoiber vehemently rejected the allegations made by party rival gabriele pauli that he knew about the efforts by his office to gather compromising information on pauli 's private life . but despite the denials , stoiber 's reputation as a political troublemaker was only enhanced .
the unrest the scandal caused almost certainly contributed to stoiber 's position becoming untenable . seen as one of the driving forces behind stoiber 's decision , pauli tried to play down her role in the week-long power struggle within the csu . " i only said what many others in the party thought , " she said .
" something can only get rolling when the stones are loose . " however , despite the growing unrest , stoiber was considered a sure thing for another shot at re-election as recently as a month ago . any new leader could bring peace , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein is being touted as the new premier his decision to stand down before next year 's state elections is being seen as a boost to the chancellor . " this could be good for merkel , " oskar niedermayer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , told reuters .
" just about any successor to stoiber would improve the relationship between the cdu and the csu in the government and in parliament . " according to sources within the csu , bavarian interior minister günther beckstein would replace stoiber as premier of the rich southern state stoiber has headed since 1993 . both german agriculture minister horst seehofer and the bavarian economy minister erwin huber have express interest in becoming become head of the csu , of which stoiber has been leader since 1999 . seehofer , who this week was exposed to of had an extramarital affair , had previously said he would only consider taking the position if stoiber willingly left the office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will stoiber turn his back on politics for good ?

he also led the german center-right to overtly oppose turkish entry into the " christian " european union . kurt beck , the head of the social democratic party , with which merkel shares power , said having a lame duck premier in bavaria would complicate national negotiations , though he said it would not affect cooperation within the ruling grand coalition . rival 's allegations stick like mud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber never recovered from pauli 's allegations the slide in his popularity dropped into freefall after it was revealed last month that one of stoiber 's top aides pried into the private life of a rival . stoiber vehemently rejected the allegations made by party rival gabriele pauli that he knew about the efforts by his office to gather compromising information on pauli 's private life . but despite the denials , stoiber 's reputation as a political troublemaker was only enhanced .
the unrest the scandal caused almost certainly contributed to stoiber 's position becoming untenable . seen as one of the driving forces behind stoiber 's decision , pauli tried to play down her role in the week-long power struggle within the csu . " i only said what many others in the party thought , " she said .
" something can only get rolling when the stones are loose .

" just about any successor to stoiber would improve the relationship between the cdu and the csu in the government and in parliament .

the two countries ' development aid ministers vowed to better coordinate and extend their policies during berlin 's g8 and eu presidencies . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul and britain 's international development secretary hilary benn recalled the success of germany 's debt cancellation initiative which has freed enormous resources in many of the world 's poorest nations . both ministers agreed that everything must be done to preserve the spirit of the previous g8 meeting in gleneagles , scotland , and see to it that promises of financial aid for africa must be fulfilled without any if or buts .
benn welcomed announcements made in berlin that development policies would remain a top priority throughout germany 's current g8 and eu presidencies . benn welcomes german emphasis on development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benn , center right , urged support for g8 policies on africa " if we care about the future of this small and fragile planet of ours , we must be moved by the conditions of fellow human beings , children who ca n't yet go to primary school at the beginning of the 21st century , children who die of diseases that our children do n't die of in the rich world , " benn said .
" and we have both a moral and a practical responsibility to play a part . " that 's why we welcome enormously the focus which germany and its g8 and eu presidencies is putting on development , on education , the fight against hiv and aids , good governance and honoring the promises which we have made . " wieczorek-zeul warned that climate change could have a devastating impact on africa , wiping out all benefits from earlier and current measures to help the continent .
she reiterated her call on the industrialized world and threshold nations to heed the writings on the wall . wieczorek-zeul highlights importance of renewables bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wieczorek-zeul fears climate change could wreck efforts " we 'll have to spend 20 times as much on curbing climate change effects in future if we do n't act now , " the german minister said .
" this is why the promotion of renewable energy and energy efficiency are central planks of our policies during our g8 and eu presidencies .
it 's clear that increased cooperation in this area among our countries is to gain currency . " wieczorek-zeul 's british counterpart added that efforts had to be increased to arrive at a fair international trade order . " we have to be determined not to give up the fight to get a trade deal that allows developing countries to earn their way out of poverty , " benn said .
" because in the end they do n't want charity .
they do n't to be patted on the head by the rest of the world .
they want a chance to do it for themselves . " the trouble is we 're stuck , " he continued .
" we 've got three big blocs .
we have europe , we have the us , we have the big developing countries china , india and brazil , and each is saying to the other we think we 've made a good offer - it 's up to you to move .
but we must not lose this most important opportunity . wieczorek-zeul and benn also indicated that the g8 summit at heiligendamm in june this year would have something special in store for the developing world .

he said the decision to expel him was a result of critical articles he published about the cdu 's electoral performance and the fact that he stood against wansner in a leadership election . besides that , to paraphrase a more senior ex-politician , maassen claims he did not have sexual relations with that woman or any women despite appearing in the film 's sexually explicit scenes .

" ' they tortured us with cold in solitary confinement or airlessness often to the point where i fell unconscious , " the now 24-year-old kurnaz told a german parliamentary committee investigating his case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz has made some serious accusations " sometimes , for example we would be punished with a month of cold or the air conditioners would be turned completely off for several weeks . " unhygienic conditions , sleep deprivation and lack of food were also common , he added . " they would hit you , tie you up and then leave you laying there for about 12 hours , " kurnaz said , describing a punishment for talking between prisoners . former government complicit ? on thursday , deputies from opposition parties and the conservative bloc of chancellor angela merkel serving on the parliamentary committee investigating the case demanded to know why former chancellor schröder 's government apparently failed to take action on murat kurnaz 's behalf . kurnaz , who was taken prisoner in pakistan in 2001 , was handed over to american troops and held as an enemy combatant until august 2006 .

it 's clear that increased cooperation in this area among our countries is to gain currency .

" we have to be determined not to give up the fight to get a trade deal that allows developing countries to earn their way out of poverty , " benn said .
" because in the end they do n't want charity .
they do n't to be patted on the head by the rest of the world .
they want a chance to do it for themselves . " the trouble is we 're stuck , " he continued .
" we 've got three big blocs .
we have europe , we have the us , we have the big developing countries china , india and brazil , and each is saying to the other we think we 've made a good offer - it 's up to you to move .
but we must not lose this most important opportunity . wieczorek-zeul and benn also indicated that the g8 summit at heiligendamm in june this year would have something special in store for the developing world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.01.2007 opinion : stoiber finally hits the emergency brakes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : following stormy debate in his christian social union party over his leadership , embattled bavarian premier stoiber has announced he will step down in september .
it 's about time , writes deutsche welle 's ralf bosen . that was some political poker in bavaria !
at the very last minute , the head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- literally hit the emergency brake in order to prevent further damage to the party . the unresolved leadership questions in stoiber 's party hurt voter support for both the csu and its sister partner , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
nevertheless , things may not turn out to be all that bad after all .
with günther beckstein as the new bavarian premier and erwin huber as new head of the csu , stoiber 's successors already have a large part of the party and the voters behind them . another advantage of this personnel decision is that the csu chair and the post of the premier will be divided among two individuals - a move that many party members have been advocating for a long time already .
for them , stoiber was too powerful in his double role . stoiber dug his own political grave the political damage stoiber caused in this role is sizeable .
now the csu has to put its money where its mouth is and support a new team of leaders . for the past few weeks , bavaria has been witness to an unusual political drama , full of schmooze and hypocrisy , with edmund stoiber in the starring role - not just as the the victim but also mainly as the villain . it hardly bothered him that bavaria suffered as a result of the power struggle and that he led the csu into one of its worst crises to date . but he 's responsible for getting himself into this situation in the first place . and in the end , he stumbled on account of one of his critics , a councilwoman in his own party . the gabriele pauli affair , which involved allegations that stoiber was aware his top aide was snooping in her private life , was just the latest trigger . his downfall began much earlier , in the fall of 2005 .
at that time he aspired - enthusiastically at first - to the post of a super-minister in the new federal government led by merkel , only to abruptly reject it once he was offered it . his flip-flopping annoyed all of his potential successors and hurt his credibility .
since then , discontent has been simmering behind the csu 's sanitized facade despite stoiber 's many successes in bavaria 's economy and education sector . stoiber was never the sovereign that the bavarians wanted him to be . instead , the bland bavarian premier was more interested in paperwork than in winning the hearts of the citizens . nevertheless , if stoiber had thrown in the towel before the csu convention this week in the town of wildbad kreuth , he would have come away from the affair with a liitle more dignity . political weariness once again citizens have had to observe incredulously just how easily politics can be defined by power struggles and personalities . and they have experienced yet another top politician who just ca n't let go of power .
those who wonder why germany is talking about political jadedness just need to look at bavaria . as for stoiber , he has been the bavarian premier for 14 years and the head of the csu for 8 years .
he was even the conservatives ' candidate for chancellor once . these are all accomplishments that wo n't count for much after his act of self-destruction so far removed from reality . ralf bosen is an expert on german politics at dw-radio -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian premier stoiber says he will step down following a major debate in his christian social union party over his leadership , bavarian premier edmund stoiber has announced that he will step down in september .

pressure is growing on the conservative bavarian premier to step down and the repercussions could be felt in the german capital as well .

" this is a very critical time for the international community and for the middle east , " rice said , adding that the united states continued to support a two-state solution for israel and the palestinians " in peace , democracy and freedom . " germany , in its capacity as the current eu president , has pushed for a revitalized role for the quartet at what it considers to be an auspicious time to bring an end to the bloodshed . " a solution to that problem is more urgent today than ever , " steinmeier said .
" we are both of the opinion that the time is ripe for a meeting of the quartet . " its last full meeting was in september . six-country tour rice arrived for her two-day visit in germany on wednesday from kuwait after completing a six-country tour of the middle east during which she announced she would hold a three-way summit with israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas within a month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice met egyptian president hosni mubarak on monday she said in berlin it would take " a few weeks " to organize the three-way summit . " i think it will be useful to have the meeting with the quartet in advance of that , " rice said . rice said sunday washington wanted to build on what she called " the momentum that is currently in palestinian-israeli relations . " steinmeier said he believed the stalled roadmap - the peace plan drawn up in 2003 by the members of the quartet with the aim of establishing a viable palestinian state living peacefully alongside israel - remained the best option for progress . in berlin , rice also met christopher hill , the top us envoy to six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear weapons program , who is holding discussions with the north 's negotiator in the german capital . rice 's trip to the middle east had the dual aims of breathing new life into the palestinian-israeli peace process and winning support for the bush administration 's plan to deploy more than 20,000 additional us troops in iraq . after talks with rice in kuwait city tuesday , the six members of the pro-us gulf cooperation council along with egypt and jordan gave the plan a cautious welcome and issued a call for iraq 's neighbors not to meddle in the strife-torn country . skeptical middle east many arab countries are concerned about iran 's growing power in the region . kuwaiti foreign minister sheikh mohammad al-sabah told a joint news conference with rice : " with respect to us policy towards iran ... the us and the gulf -lrb- states -rrb- expressed in -lrb- a -rrb- joint communiqué that we call to all countries to refrain from interfering in iraqi internal affairs .

" we expressed our desire to see the president 's plan to reinforce the american military presence in baghdad as a vehicle ... to stabilize baghdad and to prevent iraq from sliding into this ugly war , " the kuwaiti foreign minister said . rice admitted that iraq 's predominantly sunni arab neighbors were skeptical about the ability of iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki 's shiite government to halt the sectarian violence that has pitted sunni arabs against shiites . " there are concerns about whether the maliki government is prepared to take an even-handed , non-sectarian path ... but everybody wants to give this a chance .

" ' they tortured us with cold in solitary confinement or airlessness often to the point where i fell unconscious , " the now 24-year-old kurnaz told a german parliamentary committee investigating his case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz has made some serious accusations " sometimes , for example we would be punished with a month of cold or the air conditioners would be turned completely off for several weeks . " unhygienic conditions , sleep deprivation and lack of food were also common , he added . " they would hit you , tie you up and then leave you laying there for about 12 hours , " kurnaz said , describing a punishment for talking between prisoners . former government complicit ? on thursday , deputies from opposition parties and the conservative bloc of chancellor angela merkel serving on the parliamentary committee investigating the case demanded to know why former chancellor schröder 's government apparently failed to take action on murat kurnaz 's behalf . kurnaz , who was taken prisoner in pakistan in 2001 , was handed over to american troops and held as an enemy combatant until august 2006 .
he has also testified that he was abused by german intelligence agents while being held in guantanamo in 2002 . shown pictures of three men , bremen-born kurnaz was able to identify one of the germans who allegedly interrogated him in cuba and said it was " highly likely " he had seen a second and was unsure about the identity of the third . kurnaz ' lawyer bernhard docke , who also spoke in front of the parliamentary committee thursday , said the former coalition of social democrats and greens was complicit in the crime committed against kurnaz because it did not work to free him from american custody . " if kurnaz was german , he would have been freed in autumn 2002 , " docke said , adding that at the beginning of 2002 , former foreign minster joschka fischer told kurnaz ' mother germany could not help her son because of his turkish citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another committee is looking into whether german special forces interrogated kurnaz siegfried kauder , head of the parliamentary investigation into the matter , said the way kurnaz was treated in guantanamo was " unfathomable " and added that the committee would continue looking into whether such an offer was actually made . members of the then-governing coalition of social democrats and greens , however , said fischer , a green party member , did try to make the case for kurnaz ' release to then us secretary of state colin powell . two ongoing investigations docke said there was no reason for germany to refuse an alleged american offer to release kurnaz into german custody in 2002 as german and us officials were at that time aware he did not pose a terror threat . wolfgang neskovic , a committee member from the opposition left party , said if the government turned down a us release offer it would have been a " deeply inhumane decision that should have criminal , not just political consequences .

it 's about time , writes deutsche welle 's ralf bosen . that was some political poker in bavaria !
at the very last minute , the head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- literally hit the emergency brake in order to prevent further damage to the party . the unresolved leadership questions in stoiber 's party hurt voter support for both the csu and its sister partner , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
nevertheless , things may not turn out to be all that bad after all .
with günther beckstein as the new bavarian premier and erwin huber as new head of the csu , stoiber 's successors already have a large part of the party and the voters behind them . another advantage of this personnel decision is that the csu chair and the post of the premier will be divided among two individuals - a move that many party members have been advocating for a long time already .
for them , stoiber was too powerful in his double role . stoiber dug his own political grave the political damage stoiber caused in this role is sizeable .
now the csu has to put its money where its mouth is and support a new team of leaders . for the past few weeks , bavaria has been witness to an unusual political drama , full of schmooze and hypocrisy , with edmund stoiber in the starring role - not just as the the victim but also mainly as the villain . it hardly bothered him that bavaria suffered as a result of the power struggle and that he led the csu into one of its worst crises to date . but he 's responsible for getting himself into this situation in the first place . and in the end , he stumbled on account of one of his critics , a councilwoman in his own party . the gabriele pauli affair , which involved allegations that stoiber was aware his top aide was snooping in her private life , was just the latest trigger . his downfall began much earlier , in the fall of 2005 .
at that time he aspired - enthusiastically at first - to the post of a super-minister in the new federal government led by merkel , only to abruptly reject it once he was offered it . his flip-flopping annoyed all of his potential successors and hurt his credibility .
since then , discontent has been simmering behind the csu 's sanitized facade despite stoiber 's many successes in bavaria 's economy and education sector . stoiber was never the sovereign that the bavarians wanted him to be . instead , the bland bavarian premier was more interested in paperwork than in winning the hearts of the citizens . nevertheless , if stoiber had thrown in the towel before the csu convention this week in the town of wildbad kreuth , he would have come away from the affair with a liitle more dignity . political weariness once again citizens have had to observe incredulously just how easily politics can be defined by power struggles and personalities . and they have experienced yet another top politician who just ca n't let go of power .
those who wonder why germany is talking about political jadedness just need to look at bavaria . as for stoiber , he has been the bavarian premier for 14 years and the head of the csu for 8 years .

what do you expect the consequences will be in the country ? andreas friedrich : we expect there will be winds that reach storm levels across the entire country , which is something that sets this low-pressure system apart .
" storm level " means wind strength 11 , which is over 100 kilometer per hour -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- .
they are expected across germany this afternoon -lrb- thursday -rrb- , when the first storm warnings go into effect .
in some areas , especially in the mountains , they will reach speeds much faster than hurricane strength . do you expect heavy precipitation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites have tracked " kryill " for days yes , that is the second element that stormy weather can take on .
there will be heavy rainfall , especially in the low mountain ranges and the west , where as much as 40 liters per square meter -lrb- about 10 gallons per 10 square feet -rrb- could fall within 24 hours .
that would be enough to cross the storm threshold so that people should expect floods in small and mid-sized river encatchment areas . the german weather service has been under criticism for incorrect weather predictions since the 1999 storm " lothar , " which caused $ 6.4 billion worth of damage -lrb- 5 billion euros -rrb- across europe .
has the service become more careful about issuing warnings and how does that affect the current situation ? no , we have not changed our tactics or threshold levels .
with this low-pressure system , we could give a very early warning .
that is a result that was clearly forecast by weather prediction models a few days ago .
there are other weather situations , particularly in the summer , when this is simply impossible .
then you can not predict if a storm that appears to be local will spread and hit certain areas in the future or not . are weather phenomena like " lothar " and other " storms of the century " a sign of climate change ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the storm can alredy been seen in blackpool , england an individual event can not be connected to climate change .
in order to do that you need observations that span decades .
but the climate models predict that if these trends are confirmed and the increase in temperature continues , winters will have heavier precipitation .
this precipitation is connected to intense low-pressure situations .
one could expect that these weather conditions will appear more often in the winter . is the " kryill " low-pressure system nothing but hot air when compared to the hurricanes and typhoons that occur in other regions of the world ? tropical cyclones naturally have stronger winds than this kind of non-tropical , low-pressure system .
hurricane winds can reach a speed of up to 300 kph .
but what we are experiencing now is an unusual development that only occurs in central europe every few years . christoph j. heuer interviewed andreas friedrich -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de heavy storms batter northern europe winds gusting up to 130 kilometers an hour -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- lashed parts of europe thursday , sinking two irish trawlers and leaving seven fishermen missing , while causing widespread disruption to sea and air traffic .

what do you expect the consequences will be in the country ? andreas friedrich : we expect there will be winds that reach storm levels across the entire country , which is something that sets this low-pressure system apart .
" storm level " means wind strength 11 , which is over 100 kilometer per hour -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- .
they are expected across germany this afternoon -lrb- thursday -rrb- , when the first storm warnings go into effect .
in some areas , especially in the mountains , they will reach speeds much faster than hurricane strength . do you expect heavy precipitation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites have tracked " kryill " for days yes , that is the second element that stormy weather can take on .
there will be heavy rainfall , especially in the low mountain ranges and the west , where as much as 40 liters per square meter -lrb- about 10 gallons per 10 square feet -rrb- could fall within 24 hours .
that would be enough to cross the storm threshold so that people should expect floods in small and mid-sized river encatchment areas . the german weather service has been under criticism for incorrect weather predictions since the 1999 storm " lothar , " which caused $ 6.4 billion worth of damage -lrb- 5 billion euros -rrb- across europe .
has the service become more careful about issuing warnings and how does that affect the current situation ? no , we have not changed our tactics or threshold levels .
with this low-pressure system , we could give a very early warning .
that is a result that was clearly forecast by weather prediction models a few days ago .
there are other weather situations , particularly in the summer , when this is simply impossible .
then you can not predict if a storm that appears to be local will spread and hit certain areas in the future or not . are weather phenomena like " lothar " and other " storms of the century " a sign of climate change ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the storm can alredy been seen in blackpool , england an individual event can not be connected to climate change .
in order to do that you need observations that span decades .
but the climate models predict that if these trends are confirmed and the increase in temperature continues , winters will have heavier precipitation .
this precipitation is connected to intense low-pressure situations .
one could expect that these weather conditions will appear more often in the winter . is the " kryill " low-pressure system nothing but hot air when compared to the hurricanes and typhoons that occur in other regions of the world ? tropical cyclones naturally have stronger winds than this kind of non-tropical , low-pressure system .
hurricane winds can reach a speed of up to 300 kph .

30 . " i have decided that i will not stand in the regional elections next year " and therefore will make way for a new candidate to lead the party , he told journalists in munich . stoiber , a strategic ally of chancellor angela merkel , has faced strong pressure to resign since opinion polls showed last weekend that support for the party has plummeted . " my aim is to ensure that bavaria remains the most successful state in germany , " he said , explaining his decision .
rifts with berlin start the slide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel 's relationship nose-dived stoiber has been a thorn in the side of chancellor angela merkel and her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , sister party of the csu , since abruptly dropping plans to join her cabinet soon after the 2005 general election . he was proposed as the new economy minister but rejected the post just weeks before her coalition was formed . the incident only strengthened the beliefs of many in berlin that stoiber was reluctant to leave the comfort of his home state for bigger challenges . adding further weight to that argument , he retreated to his bavarian fiefdom but continued to haunt the conservatives from his southern base by criticizing the government and attempting to block merkel 's reform plans , most publicly the much-maligned health care reform , losing friends and allies as a result . an attack dog in german politics , stoiber often chipped away at berlin 's authority over the country 's 16 states .
he also led the german center-right to overtly oppose turkish entry into the " christian " european union . kurt beck , the head of the social democratic party , with which merkel shares power , said having a lame duck premier in bavaria would complicate national negotiations , though he said it would not affect cooperation within the ruling grand coalition . rival 's allegations stick like mud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber never recovered from pauli 's allegations the slide in his popularity dropped into freefall after it was revealed last month that one of stoiber 's top aides pried into the private life of a rival . stoiber vehemently rejected the allegations made by party rival gabriele pauli that he knew about the efforts by his office to gather compromising information on pauli 's private life . but despite the denials , stoiber 's reputation as a political troublemaker was only enhanced .
the unrest the scandal caused almost certainly contributed to stoiber 's position becoming untenable . seen as one of the driving forces behind stoiber 's decision , pauli tried to play down her role in the week-long power struggle within the csu . " i only said what many others in the party thought , " she said .
" something can only get rolling when the stones are loose . " however , despite the growing unrest , stoiber was considered a sure thing for another shot at re-election as recently as a month ago . any new leader could bring peace , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein is being touted as the new premier his decision to stand down before next year 's state elections is being seen as a boost to the chancellor . " this could be good for merkel , " oskar niedermayer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , told reuters .
" just about any successor to stoiber would improve the relationship between the cdu and the csu in the government and in parliament . " according to sources within the csu , bavarian interior minister günther beckstein would replace stoiber as premier of the rich southern state stoiber has headed since 1993 . both german agriculture minister horst seehofer and the bavarian economy minister erwin huber have express interest in becoming become head of the csu , of which stoiber has been leader since 1999 . seehofer , who this week was exposed to of had an extramarital affair , had previously said he would only consider taking the position if stoiber willingly left the office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will stoiber turn his back on politics for good ?
stoiber 's announcement signals the potential end of a political career which very nearly hit the heights . he was denied becoming german chancellor in 2002 by just a few thousand votes , losing ground to eventual winner gerhard schröder on issues such as the flooding in eastern germany and the iraq war . however , despite never having the top job , stoiber has enjoyed great status . as premier of bavaria , he has not only ruled one of germany 's most prosperous regions but has also wielded unique power on the national stage , running a party that is outside merkel 's control , enjoying the use of royal palaces , dominating every aspect of administration and basking in the acclaim of the mainly catholic population . however , with his career seemingly reeling from one blow too many , stoiber faces leaving the podium for the last time with the words of the f rankfurter allgemeine zeitung inscribed on his political tombstone : " stoiber has shrunk from being a feared provincial ruler and politician of federal stature to a national joke : a toothless lion , a blunt guillotine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.01.2007 bavarian premier stoiber says he will step down großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of an era following a major debate in his christian social union party over his leadership , bavarian premier edmund stoiber has announced that he will step down in september . the embattled leader of bavaria 's ruling party , stoiber said he would step down as chairman of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and premier of the german state on sept .
30 . " i have decided that i will not stand in the regional elections next year " and therefore will make way for a new candidate to lead the party , he told journalists in munich . stoiber , a strategic ally of chancellor angela merkel , has faced strong pressure to resign since opinion polls showed last weekend that support for the party has plummeted . " my aim is to ensure that bavaria remains the most successful state in germany , " he said , explaining his decision .
rifts with berlin start the slide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel 's relationship nose-dived stoiber has been a thorn in the side of chancellor angela merkel and her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , sister party of the csu , since abruptly dropping plans to join her cabinet soon after the 2005 general election . he was proposed as the new economy minister but rejected the post just weeks before her coalition was formed . the incident only strengthened the beliefs of many in berlin that stoiber was reluctant to leave the comfort of his home state for bigger challenges . adding further weight to that argument , he retreated to his bavarian fiefdom but continued to haunt the conservatives from his southern base by criticizing the government and attempting to block merkel 's reform plans , most publicly the much-maligned health care reform , losing friends and allies as a result . an attack dog in german politics , stoiber often chipped away at berlin 's authority over the country 's 16 states .
he also led the german center-right to overtly oppose turkish entry into the " christian " european union . kurt beck , the head of the social democratic party , with which merkel shares power , said having a lame duck premier in bavaria would complicate national negotiations , though he said it would not affect cooperation within the ruling grand coalition . rival 's allegations stick like mud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber never recovered from pauli 's allegations the slide in his popularity dropped into freefall after it was revealed last month that one of stoiber 's top aides pried into the private life of a rival . stoiber vehemently rejected the allegations made by party rival gabriele pauli that he knew about the efforts by his office to gather compromising information on pauli 's private life . but despite the denials , stoiber 's reputation as a political troublemaker was only enhanced .
the unrest the scandal caused almost certainly contributed to stoiber 's position becoming untenable . seen as one of the driving forces behind stoiber 's decision , pauli tried to play down her role in the week-long power struggle within the csu . " i only said what many others in the party thought , " she said .
" something can only get rolling when the stones are loose . " however , despite the growing unrest , stoiber was considered a sure thing for another shot at re-election as recently as a month ago . any new leader could bring peace , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein is being touted as the new premier his decision to stand down before next year 's state elections is being seen as a boost to the chancellor . " this could be good for merkel , " oskar niedermayer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , told reuters .
" just about any successor to stoiber would improve the relationship between the cdu and the csu in the government and in parliament . " according to sources within the csu , bavarian interior minister günther beckstein would replace stoiber as premier of the rich southern state stoiber has headed since 1993 . both german agriculture minister horst seehofer and the bavarian economy minister erwin huber have express interest in becoming become head of the csu , of which stoiber has been leader since 1999 . seehofer , who this week was exposed to of had an extramarital affair , had previously said he would only consider taking the position if stoiber willingly left the office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will stoiber turn his back on politics for good ?
stoiber 's announcement signals the potential end of a political career which very nearly hit the heights . he was denied becoming german chancellor in 2002 by just a few thousand votes , losing ground to eventual winner gerhard schröder on issues such as the flooding in eastern germany and the iraq war . however , despite never having the top job , stoiber has enjoyed great status . as premier of bavaria , he has not only ruled one of germany 's most prosperous regions but has also wielded unique power on the national stage , running a party that is outside merkel 's control , enjoying the use of royal palaces , dominating every aspect of administration and basking in the acclaim of the mainly catholic population . however , with his career seemingly reeling from one blow too many , stoiber faces leaving the podium for the last time with the words of the f rankfurter allgemeine zeitung inscribed on his political tombstone : " stoiber has shrunk from being a feared provincial ruler and politician of federal stature to a national joke : a toothless lion , a blunt guillotine .

a bird 's eye - and google earth - view of downtown hamburg soon you 'll be able to visit hamburg 's quaint streets and get within a foot of its grandiose baroque buildings without leaving your home .
it 's the first city to be shown in detailed 3-d on google earth . the construction workers and craftsmen who erected hamburg 's opera house in the 1670s or its national theater in the 1760s never could have imagined that , several centuries later , internet users in san francisco , sydney or new delhi would be able to view their handiwork from the comfort of their homes and offices . thanks to a cooperative project between google and hamburg @ work , an initiative that networks public and private members of the media , information technology and telecommunications branches , visitors to the google earth web site will soon be able to take a virtual three-dimensional tour of the northern germany city . up close and per sonal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's city hall from the sky - or your living room so far , only american cities have been available in 3-d format at google earth .
not only is hamburg the first european city to be added to the website in 3-d , its virtual map also represents a technical advancement . " by showing the texture on the buildings ' facades , hamburg is worldwide the first city to be available in such great detail , " google spokesman stefan keuchel told reporters wednesday in hamburg . in the existing 3-d models , only notable landmarks have been shown in detail , while the other buildings appear on the screen as white blocks .
hamburg will be different . " the internet user can view buildings from a virtual distance of up to 30 centimeters -lrb- one foot -rrb- , " stefan klein from hamburg @ work told reporters wednesday .
due to the added dimension , the buildings can be circled and seen from every angle . angled photos allow for detailed facades bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cybercity and the state geological office paid for the project - not google the swiss-based company cybercity , which was responsible for the technical aspects of the project , took 500 aerial photographs taken at an angle from 1,000 meters -lrb- 3,280 feet -rrb- .

" we are both of the opinion that the time is ripe for a meeting of the quartet . " its last full meeting was in september . six-country tour rice arrived for her two-day visit in germany on wednesday from kuwait after completing a six-country tour of the middle east during which she announced she would hold a three-way summit with israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas within a month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice met egyptian president hosni mubarak on monday she said in berlin it would take " a few weeks " to organize the three-way summit .

" there are concerns about whether the maliki government is prepared to take an even-handed , non-sectarian path ... but everybody wants to give this a chance .

" we are both of the opinion that the time is ripe for a meeting of the quartet . " its last full meeting was in september . six-country tour rice arrived for her two-day visit in germany on wednesday from kuwait after completing a six-country tour of the middle east during which she announced she would hold a three-way summit with israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas within a month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice met egyptian president hosni mubarak on monday she said in berlin it would take " a few weeks " to organize the three-way summit .

" there are concerns about whether the maliki government is prepared to take an even-handed , non-sectarian path ... but everybody wants to give this a chance .
that is the position of the people in the region and there is in fact a burden on the iraqi government to perform , " she said in kuwait . she will continue on to london , the last stop of her tour , thursday . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us and north korea pursue nuclear talks in berlin the top us envoy to unprecedented six-way talks on north korea 's nuclear arms said in berlin he was having " useful discussions " with his pyongyang counterpart and hoped negotiations would resume this month .

" germany , in its capacity as the current eu president , has pushed for a revitalized role for the quartet at what it considers to be an auspicious time to bring an end to the bloodshed . " a solution to that problem is more urgent today than ever , " steinmeier said .
" we are both of the opinion that the time is ripe for a meeting of the quartet . " its last full meeting was in september . six-country tour rice arrived for her two-day visit in germany on wednesday from kuwait after completing a six-country tour of the middle east during which she announced she would hold a three-way summit with israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas within a month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice met egyptian president hosni mubarak on monday she said in berlin it would take " a few weeks " to organize the three-way summit .

" there are concerns about whether the maliki government is prepared to take an even-handed , non-sectarian path ... but everybody wants to give this a chance .

it 's about time , writes deutsche welle 's ralf bosen . that was some political poker in bavaria !
at the very last minute , the head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- literally hit the emergency brake in order to prevent further damage to the party . the unresolved leadership questions in stoiber 's party hurt voter support for both the csu and its sister partner , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
nevertheless , things may not turn out to be all that bad after all .
with günther beckstein as the new bavarian premier and erwin huber as new head of the csu , stoiber 's successors already have a large part of the party and the voters behind them . another advantage of this personnel decision is that the csu chair and the post of the premier will be divided among two individuals - a move that many party members have been advocating for a long time already .
for them , stoiber was too powerful in his double role . stoiber dug his own political grave the political damage stoiber caused in this role is sizeable .
now the csu has to put its money where its mouth is and support a new team of leaders . for the past few weeks , bavaria has been witness to an unusual political drama , full of schmooze and hypocrisy , with edmund stoiber in the starring role - not just as the the victim but also mainly as the villain . it hardly bothered him that bavaria suffered as a result of the power struggle and that he led the csu into one of its worst crises to date . but he 's responsible for getting himself into this situation in the first place . and in the end , he stumbled on account of one of his critics , a councilwoman in his own party . the gabriele pauli affair , which involved allegations that stoiber was aware his top aide was snooping in her private life , was just the latest trigger . his downfall began much earlier , in the fall of 2005 .
at that time he aspired - enthusiastically at first - to the post of a super-minister in the new federal government led by merkel , only to abruptly reject it once he was offered it . his flip-flopping annoyed all of his potential successors and hurt his credibility .
since then , discontent has been simmering behind the csu 's sanitized facade despite stoiber 's many successes in bavaria 's economy and education sector . stoiber was never the sovereign that the bavarians wanted him to be . instead , the bland bavarian premier was more interested in paperwork than in winning the hearts of the citizens . nevertheless , if stoiber had thrown in the towel before the csu convention this week in the town of wildbad kreuth , he would have come away from the affair with a liitle more dignity . political weariness once again citizens have had to observe incredulously just how easily politics can be defined by power struggles and personalities . and they have experienced yet another top politician who just ca n't let go of power .
those who wonder why germany is talking about political jadedness just need to look at bavaria . as for stoiber , he has been the bavarian premier for 14 years and the head of the csu for 8 years .
he was even the conservatives ' candidate for chancellor once . these are all accomplishments that wo n't count for much after his act of self-destruction so far removed from reality . ralf bosen is an expert on german politics at dw-radio -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian premier stoiber says he will step down following a major debate in his christian social union party over his leadership , bavarian premier edmund stoiber has announced that he will step down in september .

once heralded as the next great german soccer star , deisler carried the weight of a nation 's expectation with him onto the pitch . the sad sight of sebastian deisler announcing his retirement on tuesday brought to an end the career of a player not only tipped for greatness but one touted as a potential german legend .
while injuries and bouts of depression were certainly the main contributors to deisler 's retirement , could it be that the weight of such expectation also added to the premature end of such a promising career ? deisler , known in the german game as " das supertalent , " was lauded by everyone from coaches to journalists when he began his rise through the ranks at borussia mönchengladbach as an 18-year-old right winger blessed with acceleration , vision and a blistering shot . franz beckenbauer said that deisler was " physically and technically the best in germany " , while rudi völler said at the time that the youngster would be " influential for germany for another ten years . "
the mass-circulation bild newspaper famously exclaimed : " basti fantasti is magical ! " no fewer than 26 clubs were vying for his signature in 1999 when gladbach were relegated .
deisler chose hertha berlin and prompted further exhortations of a legend in the making ; the transfer seen by many as the next step of a journey which would see him eventually fulfil his potential at one of europe 's biggest clubs . after inspiring hertha to champions league qualification from a new right-sided midfield berth and then victories in that competition against the likes of ac milan and chelsea , the widely held belief that his destiny lay among the greats gathered credence when deisler moved to bayern munich . munich dream turns to nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler never hit the heights others expected of him it was in munich that it was all supposed to happen .
if germany has its own theater of dreams akin to manchester united 's old trafford , bayern 's former home at the olympiastadion was it .
under the watchful eye of german icons such as oli hoeness , karl-heinz rummenigge and der kaiser himself , and with first ottmar hitzfeld and then felix magath as his coach , deisler could only prosper in such luminous company . hoeness himself joined the ever-rising chorus of approval on deisler 's arrival : " he 's got unbelievable potential .
it 'll be great for him to be able to show everybody , " he said at the time . his performances in a bayern shirt at times suggested that his elevation to the pantheon of german greats was on schedule .
deisler in full flow was an awesome sight ; determination , quick feet and pin-point crosses combining with a controlled aggression and a will to win . but it was n't to be .
deisler 's knee problems and the subsequent mental fragility born from the uncertainty and insecurities surrounding his future eventually wrecked his league and international career . twice injury ruled him out of world cups that were his for the taking .
who can say how germany would have played with a fully fit deisler in the team in the 2002 final against brazil ?
maybe there would have been no need for the heart-breaking extra-time which brought defeat in the 2006 semi-final against italy had " basti fantasti " been on the pitch in dortmund . an unachievable level of greatness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are all new stars expected to eclipse der kaiser ?
" das supertalent " leaves these and many other questions unanswered , his body and mind no longer equipped for the rigors of the game he graced .
could he ever have reached the heights others expected of him ?
what constitutes a german legend anyway ?
is it a player who can eclipse possibly the greatest of all , franz beckenbauer ?
if so , the bar is set incredibly high . many have tried and have been found wanting .
michael ballack , currently germany 's one true world star , was another to show great potential and make good on his promise within the bundesliga .
but even he has tripped in making his next step ; the mercurial midfielder is now seen as an industrious rather than skilful player in chelsea 's diamond-studded team , toiling in an english premiership hardly short of star names . young stars shouldering the burden bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski 's form for germany has gone missing at bayern the likes of benjamin lauth and benny auer were also been saddled with the " next big thing " tags early in their careers and both fell by the wayside .
currently , bayern teammates lukas podolski , bastian schweinsteiger and philipp lahm all share the burden of a country 's high expectations .
their own performances and the current erratic form of their team suggest that their own journeys may have stalled on the autobahn to greatness . living up to one 's own expectations is often hard enough , but trying to achieve those of others is particularly difficult , especially when that expectation is one as relative as greatness .
sebastian deisler is unlikely to spend much time pondering this but those who continue to add such pressures onto the shoulders of already burdened young stars maybe should . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de injury convinces gifted deisler to end career injury finally took its toll on bayern munich 's german international sebastian deisler , who quit professional soccer on tuesday after battling for years against a succession of serious knee problems .

once heralded as the next great german soccer star , deisler carried the weight of a nation 's expectation with him onto the pitch . the sad sight of sebastian deisler announcing his retirement on tuesday brought to an end the career of a player not only tipped for greatness but one touted as a potential german legend .
while injuries and bouts of depression were certainly the main contributors to deisler 's retirement , could it be that the weight of such expectation also added to the premature end of such a promising career ? deisler , known in the german game as " das supertalent , " was lauded by everyone from coaches to journalists when he began his rise through the ranks at borussia mönchengladbach as an 18-year-old right winger blessed with acceleration , vision and a blistering shot . franz beckenbauer said that deisler was " physically and technically the best in germany " , while rudi völler said at the time that the youngster would be " influential for germany for another ten years . "
the mass-circulation bild newspaper famously exclaimed : " basti fantasti is magical ! " no fewer than 26 clubs were vying for his signature in 1999 when gladbach were relegated .
deisler chose hertha berlin and prompted further exhortations of a legend in the making ; the transfer seen by many as the next step of a journey which would see him eventually fulfil his potential at one of europe 's biggest clubs . after inspiring hertha to champions league qualification from a new right-sided midfield berth and then victories in that competition against the likes of ac milan and chelsea , the widely held belief that his destiny lay among the greats gathered credence when deisler moved to bayern munich . munich dream turns to nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler never hit the heights others expected of him it was in munich that it was all supposed to happen .
if germany has its own theater of dreams akin to manchester united 's old trafford , bayern 's former home at the olympiastadion was it .
under the watchful eye of german icons such as oli hoeness , karl-heinz rummenigge and der kaiser himself , and with first ottmar hitzfeld and then felix magath as his coach , deisler could only prosper in such luminous company . hoeness himself joined the ever-rising chorus of approval on deisler 's arrival : " he 's got unbelievable potential .
it 'll be great for him to be able to show everybody , " he said at the time . his performances in a bayern shirt at times suggested that his elevation to the pantheon of german greats was on schedule .
deisler in full flow was an awesome sight ; determination , quick feet and pin-point crosses combining with a controlled aggression and a will to win . but it was n't to be .
deisler 's knee problems and the subsequent mental fragility born from the uncertainty and insecurities surrounding his future eventually wrecked his league and international career . twice injury ruled him out of world cups that were his for the taking .
who can say how germany would have played with a fully fit deisler in the team in the 2002 final against brazil ?

once heralded as the next great german soccer star , deisler carried the weight of a nation 's expectation with him onto the pitch . the sad sight of sebastian deisler announcing his retirement on tuesday brought to an end the career of a player not only tipped for greatness but one touted as a potential german legend .
while injuries and bouts of depression were certainly the main contributors to deisler 's retirement , could it be that the weight of such expectation also added to the premature end of such a promising career ? deisler , known in the german game as " das supertalent , " was lauded by everyone from coaches to journalists when he began his rise through the ranks at borussia mönchengladbach as an 18-year-old right winger blessed with acceleration , vision and a blistering shot . franz beckenbauer said that deisler was " physically and technically the best in germany " , while rudi völler said at the time that the youngster would be " influential for germany for another ten years . "
the mass-circulation bild newspaper famously exclaimed : " basti fantasti is magical ! " no fewer than 26 clubs were vying for his signature in 1999 when gladbach were relegated .
deisler chose hertha berlin and prompted further exhortations of a legend in the making ; the transfer seen by many as the next step of a journey which would see him eventually fulfil his potential at one of europe 's biggest clubs . after inspiring hertha to champions league qualification from a new right-sided midfield berth and then victories in that competition against the likes of ac milan and chelsea , the widely held belief that his destiny lay among the greats gathered credence when deisler moved to bayern munich . munich dream turns to nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler never hit the heights others expected of him it was in munich that it was all supposed to happen .

under the watchful eye of german icons such as oli hoeness , karl-heinz rummenigge and der kaiser himself , and with first ottmar hitzfeld and then felix magath as his coach , deisler could only prosper in such luminous company . hoeness himself joined the ever-rising chorus of approval on deisler 's arrival : " he 's got unbelievable potential .
it 'll be great for him to be able to show everybody , " he said at the time . his performances in a bayern shirt at times suggested that his elevation to the pantheon of german greats was on schedule .
deisler in full flow was an awesome sight ; determination , quick feet and pin-point crosses combining with a controlled aggression and a will to win . but it was n't to be .
deisler 's knee problems and the subsequent mental fragility born from the uncertainty and insecurities surrounding his future eventually wrecked his league and international career . twice injury ruled him out of world cups that were his for the taking .

it 's about time , writes deutsche welle 's ralf bosen . that was some political poker in bavaria !
at the very last minute , the head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- literally hit the emergency brake in order to prevent further damage to the party . the unresolved leadership questions in stoiber 's party hurt voter support for both the csu and its sister partner , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
nevertheless , things may not turn out to be all that bad after all .
with günther beckstein as the new bavarian premier and erwin huber as new head of the csu , stoiber 's successors already have a large part of the party and the voters behind them . another advantage of this personnel decision is that the csu chair and the post of the premier will be divided among two individuals - a move that many party members have been advocating for a long time already .
for them , stoiber was too powerful in his double role . stoiber dug his own political grave the political damage stoiber caused in this role is sizeable .
now the csu has to put its money where its mouth is and support a new team of leaders . for the past few weeks , bavaria has been witness to an unusual political drama , full of schmooze and hypocrisy , with edmund stoiber in the starring role - not just as the the victim but also mainly as the villain . it hardly bothered him that bavaria suffered as a result of the power struggle and that he led the csu into one of its worst crises to date . but he 's responsible for getting himself into this situation in the first place . and in the end , he stumbled on account of one of his critics , a councilwoman in his own party . the gabriele pauli affair , which involved allegations that stoiber was aware his top aide was snooping in her private life , was just the latest trigger . his downfall began much earlier , in the fall of 2005 .
at that time he aspired - enthusiastically at first - to the post of a super-minister in the new federal government led by merkel , only to abruptly reject it once he was offered it . his flip-flopping annoyed all of his potential successors and hurt his credibility .
since then , discontent has been simmering behind the csu 's sanitized facade despite stoiber 's many successes in bavaria 's economy and education sector . stoiber was never the sovereign that the bavarians wanted him to be . instead , the bland bavarian premier was more interested in paperwork than in winning the hearts of the citizens . nevertheless , if stoiber had thrown in the towel before the csu convention this week in the town of wildbad kreuth , he would have come away from the affair with a liitle more dignity . political weariness once again citizens have had to observe incredulously just how easily politics can be defined by power struggles and personalities . and they have experienced yet another top politician who just ca n't let go of power .
those who wonder why germany is talking about political jadedness just need to look at bavaria . as for stoiber , he has been the bavarian premier for 14 years and the head of the csu for 8 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 18.01.2007 weather expert predicts more storms in coming winters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the storm already flipped trailer trucks in northern parts of germany as a severe storm lashed northwestern europe and gathered pace in germany , a weather expert talked to dw-world.de about the causes behind the inclement climate . andreas friedrich is a member of the german weather service 's prediction department . dw-world.de : the extreme low-pressure system " kryill " will reach germany 's north sea coast thursday afternoon .
what do you expect the consequences will be in the country ? andreas friedrich : we expect there will be winds that reach storm levels across the entire country , which is something that sets this low-pressure system apart .
" storm level " means wind strength 11 , which is over 100 kilometer per hour -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- .
they are expected across germany this afternoon -lrb- thursday -rrb- , when the first storm warnings go into effect .
in some areas , especially in the mountains , they will reach speeds much faster than hurricane strength . do you expect heavy precipitation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites have tracked " kryill " for days yes , that is the second element that stormy weather can take on .
there will be heavy rainfall , especially in the low mountain ranges and the west , where as much as 40 liters per square meter -lrb- about 10 gallons per 10 square feet -rrb- could fall within 24 hours .

" there are concerns about whether the maliki government is prepared to take an even-handed , non-sectarian path ... but everybody wants to give this a chance .

" ' they tortured us with cold in solitary confinement or airlessness often to the point where i fell unconscious , " the now 24-year-old kurnaz told a german parliamentary committee investigating his case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz has made some serious accusations " sometimes , for example we would be punished with a month of cold or the air conditioners would be turned completely off for several weeks . " unhygienic conditions , sleep deprivation and lack of food were also common , he added . " they would hit you , tie you up and then leave you laying there for about 12 hours , " kurnaz said , describing a punishment for talking between prisoners . former government complicit ? on thursday , deputies from opposition parties and the conservative bloc of chancellor angela merkel serving on the parliamentary committee investigating the case demanded to know why former chancellor schröder 's government apparently failed to take action on murat kurnaz 's behalf . kurnaz , who was taken prisoner in pakistan in 2001 , was handed over to american troops and held as an enemy combatant until august 2006 .
he has also testified that he was abused by german intelligence agents while being held in guantanamo in 2002 . shown pictures of three men , bremen-born kurnaz was able to identify one of the germans who allegedly interrogated him in cuba and said it was " highly likely " he had seen a second and was unsure about the identity of the third . kurnaz ' lawyer bernhard docke , who also spoke in front of the parliamentary committee thursday , said the former coalition of social democrats and greens was complicit in the crime committed against kurnaz because it did not work to free him from american custody . " if kurnaz was german , he would have been freed in autumn 2002 , " docke said , adding that at the beginning of 2002 , former foreign minster joschka fischer told kurnaz ' mother germany could not help her son because of his turkish citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another committee is looking into whether german special forces interrogated kurnaz siegfried kauder , head of the parliamentary investigation into the matter , said the way kurnaz was treated in guantanamo was " unfathomable " and added that the committee would continue looking into whether such an offer was actually made . members of the then-governing coalition of social democrats and greens , however , said fischer , a green party member , did try to make the case for kurnaz ' release to then us secretary of state colin powell . two ongoing investigations docke said there was no reason for germany to refuse an alleged american offer to release kurnaz into german custody in 2002 as german and us officials were at that time aware he did not pose a terror threat . wolfgang neskovic , a committee member from the opposition left party , said if the government turned down a us release offer it would have been a " deeply inhumane decision that should have criminal , not just political consequences . " the german defense ministry is also investigating kurnaz ' claims of abuse at a kandahar prison after admitting that german special forces had been " in contact " with him . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anger simmers among europe 's ex-guantanamo inmates european former inmates of the us-run guantanamo bay prison , most of whom returned home after long , harsh detentions without ever being convicted of a crime , remain angry about what happened to them there .

" this is a very critical time for the international community and for the middle east , " rice said , adding that the united states continued to support a two-state solution for israel and the palestinians " in peace , democracy and freedom . " germany , in its capacity as the current eu president , has pushed for a revitalized role for the quartet at what it considers to be an auspicious time to bring an end to the bloodshed . " a solution to that problem is more urgent today than ever , " steinmeier said .
" we are both of the opinion that the time is ripe for a meeting of the quartet . " its last full meeting was in september . six-country tour rice arrived for her two-day visit in germany on wednesday from kuwait after completing a six-country tour of the middle east during which she announced she would hold a three-way summit with israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas within a month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice met egyptian president hosni mubarak on monday she said in berlin it would take " a few weeks " to organize the three-way summit . " i think it will be useful to have the meeting with the quartet in advance of that , " rice said . rice said sunday washington wanted to build on what she called " the momentum that is currently in palestinian-israeli relations . " steinmeier said he believed the stalled roadmap - the peace plan drawn up in 2003 by the members of the quartet with the aim of establishing a viable palestinian state living peacefully alongside israel - remained the best option for progress . in berlin , rice also met christopher hill , the top us envoy to six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear weapons program , who is holding discussions with the north 's negotiator in the german capital . rice 's trip to the middle east had the dual aims of breathing new life into the palestinian-israeli peace process and winning support for the bush administration 's plan to deploy more than 20,000 additional us troops in iraq . after talks with rice in kuwait city tuesday , the six members of the pro-us gulf cooperation council along with egypt and jordan gave the plan a cautious welcome and issued a call for iraq 's neighbors not to meddle in the strife-torn country . skeptical middle east many arab countries are concerned about iran 's growing power in the region . kuwaiti foreign minister sheikh mohammad al-sabah told a joint news conference with rice : " with respect to us policy towards iran ... the us and the gulf -lrb- states -rrb- expressed in -lrb- a -rrb- joint communiqué that we call to all countries to refrain from interfering in iraqi internal affairs .

" we expressed our desire to see the president 's plan to reinforce the american military presence in baghdad as a vehicle ... to stabilize baghdad and to prevent iraq from sliding into this ugly war , " the kuwaiti foreign minister said . rice admitted that iraq 's predominantly sunni arab neighbors were skeptical about the ability of iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki 's shiite government to halt the sectarian violence that has pitted sunni arabs against shiites . " there are concerns about whether the maliki government is prepared to take an even-handed , non-sectarian path ... but everybody wants to give this a chance .

it 's about time , writes deutsche welle 's ralf bosen . that was some political poker in bavaria !
at the very last minute , the head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- literally hit the emergency brake in order to prevent further damage to the party . the unresolved leadership questions in stoiber 's party hurt voter support for both the csu and its sister partner , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
nevertheless , things may not turn out to be all that bad after all .
with günther beckstein as the new bavarian premier and erwin huber as new head of the csu , stoiber 's successors already have a large part of the party and the voters behind them . another advantage of this personnel decision is that the csu chair and the post of the premier will be divided among two individuals - a move that many party members have been advocating for a long time already .
for them , stoiber was too powerful in his double role . stoiber dug his own political grave the political damage stoiber caused in this role is sizeable .
now the csu has to put its money where its mouth is and support a new team of leaders . for the past few weeks , bavaria has been witness to an unusual political drama , full of schmooze and hypocrisy , with edmund stoiber in the starring role - not just as the the victim but also mainly as the villain . it hardly bothered him that bavaria suffered as a result of the power struggle and that he led the csu into one of its worst crises to date . but he 's responsible for getting himself into this situation in the first place . and in the end , he stumbled on account of one of his critics , a councilwoman in his own party . the gabriele pauli affair , which involved allegations that stoiber was aware his top aide was snooping in her private life , was just the latest trigger . his downfall began much earlier , in the fall of 2005 .
at that time he aspired - enthusiastically at first - to the post of a super-minister in the new federal government led by merkel , only to abruptly reject it once he was offered it . his flip-flopping annoyed all of his potential successors and hurt his credibility .
since then , discontent has been simmering behind the csu 's sanitized facade despite stoiber 's many successes in bavaria 's economy and education sector . stoiber was never the sovereign that the bavarians wanted him to be . instead , the bland bavarian premier was more interested in paperwork than in winning the hearts of the citizens . nevertheless , if stoiber had thrown in the towel before the csu convention this week in the town of wildbad kreuth , he would have come away from the affair with a liitle more dignity . political weariness once again citizens have had to observe incredulously just how easily politics can be defined by power struggles and personalities . and they have experienced yet another top politician who just ca n't let go of power .
those who wonder why germany is talking about political jadedness just need to look at bavaria . as for stoiber , he has been the bavarian premier for 14 years and the head of the csu for 8 years .
he was even the conservatives ' candidate for chancellor once . these are all accomplishments that wo n't count for much after his act of self-destruction so far removed from reality . ralf bosen is an expert on german politics at dw-radio -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian premier stoiber says he will step down following a major debate in his christian social union party over his leadership , bavarian premier edmund stoiber has announced that he will step down in september .
-lrb- 18.01.2007 -rrb- top german politician facing pressure to resign as state premier the chair of long-time german powerbroker edmund stoiber is wobbling .
pressure is growing on the conservative bavarian premier to step down and the repercussions could be felt in the german capital as well .
-lrb- 16.01.2007 -rrb- conservative snooping scandal gains traction edmund stoiber , a powerful leader in angela merkel 's conservative camp accepted his chief of staff 's resignation friday after charges the aide snooped on a critic 's private life .

with günther beckstein as the new bavarian premier and erwin huber as new head of the csu , stoiber 's successors already have a large part of the party and the voters behind them . another advantage of this personnel decision is that the csu chair and the post of the premier will be divided among two individuals - a move that many party members have been advocating for a long time already .
for them , stoiber was too powerful in his double role . stoiber dug his own political grave the political damage stoiber caused in this role is sizeable .
now the csu has to put its money where its mouth is and support a new team of leaders . for the past few weeks , bavaria has been witness to an unusual political drama , full of schmooze and hypocrisy , with edmund stoiber in the starring role - not just as the the victim but also mainly as the villain . it hardly bothered him that bavaria suffered as a result of the power struggle and that he led the csu into one of its worst crises to date . but he 's responsible for getting himself into this situation in the first place . and in the end , he stumbled on account of one of his critics , a councilwoman in his own party . the gabriele pauli affair , which involved allegations that stoiber was aware his top aide was snooping in her private life , was just the latest trigger . his downfall began much earlier , in the fall of 2005 .
at that time he aspired - enthusiastically at first - to the post of a super-minister in the new federal government led by merkel , only to abruptly reject it once he was offered it . his flip-flopping annoyed all of his potential successors and hurt his credibility .
since then , discontent has been simmering behind the csu 's sanitized facade despite stoiber 's many successes in bavaria 's economy and education sector . stoiber was never the sovereign that the bavarians wanted him to be . instead , the bland bavarian premier was more interested in paperwork than in winning the hearts of the citizens . nevertheless , if stoiber had thrown in the towel before the csu convention this week in the town of wildbad kreuth , he would have come away from the affair with a liitle more dignity . political weariness once again citizens have had to observe incredulously just how easily politics can be defined by power struggles and personalities . and they have experienced yet another top politician who just ca n't let go of power .
those who wonder why germany is talking about political jadedness just need to look at bavaria . as for stoiber , he has been the bavarian premier for 14 years and the head of the csu for 8 years .
he was even the conservatives ' candidate for chancellor once . these are all accomplishments that wo n't count for much after his act of self-destruction so far removed from reality . ralf bosen is an expert on german politics at dw-radio -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian premier stoiber says he will step down following a major debate in his christian social union party over his leadership , bavarian premier edmund stoiber has announced that he will step down in september .
-lrb- 18.01.2007 -rrb- top german politician facing pressure to resign as state premier the chair of long-time german powerbroker edmund stoiber is wobbling .
pressure is growing on the conservative bavarian premier to step down and the repercussions could be felt in the german capital as well .
-lrb- 16.01.2007 -rrb- conservative snooping scandal gains traction edmund stoiber , a powerful leader in angela merkel 's conservative camp accepted his chief of staff 's resignation friday after charges the aide snooped on a critic 's private life .
stoiber denies he knew of the snooping .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.01.2007 opinion : stoiber finally hits the emergency brakes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : following stormy debate in his christian social union party over his leadership , embattled bavarian premier stoiber has announced he will step down in september .
it 's about time , writes deutsche welle 's ralf bosen . that was some political poker in bavaria !
at the very last minute , the head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- literally hit the emergency brake in order to prevent further damage to the party . the unresolved leadership questions in stoiber 's party hurt voter support for both the csu and its sister partner , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
nevertheless , things may not turn out to be all that bad after all .
with günther beckstein as the new bavarian premier and erwin huber as new head of the csu , stoiber 's successors already have a large part of the party and the voters behind them . another advantage of this personnel decision is that the csu chair and the post of the premier will be divided among two individuals - a move that many party members have been advocating for a long time already .
for them , stoiber was too powerful in his double role . stoiber dug his own political grave the political damage stoiber caused in this role is sizeable .
now the csu has to put its money where its mouth is and support a new team of leaders . for the past few weeks , bavaria has been witness to an unusual political drama , full of schmooze and hypocrisy , with edmund stoiber in the starring role - not just as the the victim but also mainly as the villain . it hardly bothered him that bavaria suffered as a result of the power struggle and that he led the csu into one of its worst crises to date . but he 's responsible for getting himself into this situation in the first place . and in the end , he stumbled on account of one of his critics , a councilwoman in his own party . the gabriele pauli affair , which involved allegations that stoiber was aware his top aide was snooping in her private life , was just the latest trigger . his downfall began much earlier , in the fall of 2005 .
at that time he aspired - enthusiastically at first - to the post of a super-minister in the new federal government led by merkel , only to abruptly reject it once he was offered it . his flip-flopping annoyed all of his potential successors and hurt his credibility .
since then , discontent has been simmering behind the csu 's sanitized facade despite stoiber 's many successes in bavaria 's economy and education sector . stoiber was never the sovereign that the bavarians wanted him to be . instead , the bland bavarian premier was more interested in paperwork than in winning the hearts of the citizens . nevertheless , if stoiber had thrown in the towel before the csu convention this week in the town of wildbad kreuth , he would have come away from the affair with a liitle more dignity . political weariness once again citizens have had to observe incredulously just how easily politics can be defined by power struggles and personalities . and they have experienced yet another top politician who just ca n't let go of power .
those who wonder why germany is talking about political jadedness just need to look at bavaria . as for stoiber , he has been the bavarian premier for 14 years and the head of the csu for 8 years .
he was even the conservatives ' candidate for chancellor once . these are all accomplishments that wo n't count for much after his act of self-destruction so far removed from reality . ralf bosen is an expert on german politics at dw-radio -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian premier stoiber says he will step down following a major debate in his christian social union party over his leadership , bavarian premier edmund stoiber has announced that he will step down in september .
-lrb- 18.01.2007 -rrb- top german politician facing pressure to resign as state premier the chair of long-time german powerbroker edmund stoiber is wobbling .
pressure is growing on the conservative bavarian premier to step down and the repercussions could be felt in the german capital as well .
-lrb- 16.01.2007 -rrb- conservative snooping scandal gains traction edmund stoiber , a powerful leader in angela merkel 's conservative camp accepted his chief of staff 's resignation friday after charges the aide snooped on a critic 's private life .
stoiber denies he knew of the snooping .

nevertheless , things may not turn out to be all that bad after all .
with günther beckstein as the new bavarian premier and erwin huber as new head of the csu , stoiber 's successors already have a large part of the party and the voters behind them . another advantage of this personnel decision is that the csu chair and the post of the premier will be divided among two individuals - a move that many party members have been advocating for a long time already .
for them , stoiber was too powerful in his double role . stoiber dug his own political grave the political damage stoiber caused in this role is sizeable .
now the csu has to put its money where its mouth is and support a new team of leaders . for the past few weeks , bavaria has been witness to an unusual political drama , full of schmooze and hypocrisy , with edmund stoiber in the starring role - not just as the the victim but also mainly as the villain . it hardly bothered him that bavaria suffered as a result of the power struggle and that he led the csu into one of its worst crises to date . but he 's responsible for getting himself into this situation in the first place . and in the end , he stumbled on account of one of his critics , a councilwoman in his own party . the gabriele pauli affair , which involved allegations that stoiber was aware his top aide was snooping in her private life , was just the latest trigger . his downfall began much earlier , in the fall of 2005 .
at that time he aspired - enthusiastically at first - to the post of a super-minister in the new federal government led by merkel , only to abruptly reject it once he was offered it . his flip-flopping annoyed all of his potential successors and hurt his credibility .
since then , discontent has been simmering behind the csu 's sanitized facade despite stoiber 's many successes in bavaria 's economy and education sector . stoiber was never the sovereign that the bavarians wanted him to be . instead , the bland bavarian premier was more interested in paperwork than in winning the hearts of the citizens . nevertheless , if stoiber had thrown in the towel before the csu convention this week in the town of wildbad kreuth , he would have come away from the affair with a liitle more dignity . political weariness once again citizens have had to observe incredulously just how easily politics can be defined by power struggles and personalities . and they have experienced yet another top politician who just ca n't let go of power .
those who wonder why germany is talking about political jadedness just need to look at bavaria . as for stoiber , he has been the bavarian premier for 14 years and the head of the csu for 8 years .
he was even the conservatives ' candidate for chancellor once . these are all accomplishments that wo n't count for much after his act of self-destruction so far removed from reality . ralf bosen is an expert on german politics at dw-radio -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian premier stoiber says he will step down following a major debate in his christian social union party over his leadership , bavarian premier edmund stoiber has announced that he will step down in september .
-lrb- 18.01.2007 -rrb- top german politician facing pressure to resign as state premier the chair of long-time german powerbroker edmund stoiber is wobbling .
pressure is growing on the conservative bavarian premier to step down and the repercussions could be felt in the german capital as well .
-lrb- 16.01.2007 -rrb- conservative snooping scandal gains traction edmund stoiber , a powerful leader in angela merkel 's conservative camp accepted his chief of staff 's resignation friday after charges the aide snooped on a critic 's private life .

these were then used to digitally extrapolate the building facade in detail . cybercity developed the software that is capable of undoing the distortion inherent to the diagonal aerial photos and transferring the images to the 3-d model , michael schulze-horsel from cybercity told dw-world.de. no one has disclosed exactly when the 3-d tour of hamburg will be accessible online .

he also led the german center-right to overtly oppose turkish entry into the " christian " european union . kurt beck , the head of the social democratic party , with which merkel shares power , said having a lame duck premier in bavaria would complicate national negotiations , though he said it would not affect cooperation within the ruling grand coalition . rival 's allegations stick like mud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber never recovered from pauli 's allegations the slide in his popularity dropped into freefall after it was revealed last month that one of stoiber 's top aides pried into the private life of a rival . stoiber vehemently rejected the allegations made by party rival gabriele pauli that he knew about the efforts by his office to gather compromising information on pauli 's private life . but despite the denials , stoiber 's reputation as a political troublemaker was only enhanced .
the unrest the scandal caused almost certainly contributed to stoiber 's position becoming untenable . seen as one of the driving forces behind stoiber 's decision , pauli tried to play down her role in the week-long power struggle within the csu .

" we have to be determined not to give up the fight to get a trade deal that allows developing countries to earn their way out of poverty , " benn said .
" because in the end they do n't want charity .
they do n't to be patted on the head by the rest of the world .
they want a chance to do it for themselves . " the trouble is we 're stuck , " he continued .
" we 've got three big blocs .
we have europe , we have the us , we have the big developing countries china , india and brazil , and each is saying to the other we think we 've made a good offer - it 's up to you to move .
but we must not lose this most important opportunity . wieczorek-zeul and benn also indicated that the g8 summit at heiligendamm in june this year would have something special in store for the developing world .

" ' they tortured us with cold in solitary confinement or airlessness often to the point where i fell unconscious , " the now 24-year-old kurnaz told a german parliamentary committee investigating his case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz has made some serious accusations " sometimes , for example we would be punished with a month of cold or the air conditioners would be turned completely off for several weeks . " unhygienic conditions , sleep deprivation and lack of food were also common , he added . " they would hit you , tie you up and then leave you laying there for about 12 hours , " kurnaz said , describing a punishment for talking between prisoners . former government complicit ? on thursday , deputies from opposition parties and the conservative bloc of chancellor angela merkel serving on the parliamentary committee investigating the case demanded to know why former chancellor schröder 's government apparently failed to take action on murat kurnaz 's behalf . kurnaz , who was taken prisoner in pakistan in 2001 , was handed over to american troops and held as an enemy combatant until august 2006 .
he has also testified that he was abused by german intelligence agents while being held in guantanamo in 2002 . shown pictures of three men , bremen-born kurnaz was able to identify one of the germans who allegedly interrogated him in cuba and said it was " highly likely " he had seen a second and was unsure about the identity of the third . kurnaz ' lawyer bernhard docke , who also spoke in front of the parliamentary committee thursday , said the former coalition of social democrats and greens was complicit in the crime committed against kurnaz because it did not work to free him from american custody . " if kurnaz was german , he would have been freed in autumn 2002 , " docke said , adding that at the beginning of 2002 , former foreign minster joschka fischer told kurnaz ' mother germany could not help her son because of his turkish citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another committee is looking into whether german special forces interrogated kurnaz siegfried kauder , head of the parliamentary investigation into the matter , said the way kurnaz was treated in guantanamo was " unfathomable " and added that the committee would continue looking into whether such an offer was actually made . members of the then-governing coalition of social democrats and greens , however , said fischer , a green party member , did try to make the case for kurnaz ' release to then us secretary of state colin powell . two ongoing investigations docke said there was no reason for germany to refuse an alleged american offer to release kurnaz into german custody in 2002 as german and us officials were at that time aware he did not pose a terror threat . wolfgang neskovic , a committee member from the opposition left party , said if the government turned down a us release offer it would have been a " deeply inhumane decision that should have criminal , not just political consequences .

" they would hit you , tie you up and then leave you laying there for about 12 hours , " kurnaz said , describing a punishment for talking between prisoners . former government complicit ? on thursday , deputies from opposition parties and the conservative bloc of chancellor angela merkel serving on the parliamentary committee investigating the case demanded to know why former chancellor schröder 's government apparently failed to take action on murat kurnaz 's behalf . kurnaz , who was taken prisoner in pakistan in 2001 , was handed over to american troops and held as an enemy combatant until august 2006 .
he has also testified that he was abused by german intelligence agents while being held in guantanamo in 2002 . shown pictures of three men , bremen-born kurnaz was able to identify one of the germans who allegedly interrogated him in cuba and said it was " highly likely " he had seen a second and was unsure about the identity of the third . kurnaz ' lawyer bernhard docke , who also spoke in front of the parliamentary committee thursday , said the former coalition of social democrats and greens was complicit in the crime committed against kurnaz because it did not work to free him from american custody . " if kurnaz was german , he would have been freed in autumn 2002 , " docke said , adding that at the beginning of 2002 , former foreign minster joschka fischer told kurnaz ' mother germany could not help her son because of his turkish citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another committee is looking into whether german special forces interrogated kurnaz siegfried kauder , head of the parliamentary investigation into the matter , said the way kurnaz was treated in guantanamo was " unfathomable " and added that the committee would continue looking into whether such an offer was actually made . members of the then-governing coalition of social democrats and greens , however , said fischer , a green party member , did try to make the case for kurnaz ' release to then us secretary of state colin powell . two ongoing investigations docke said there was no reason for germany to refuse an alleged american offer to release kurnaz into german custody in 2002 as german and us officials were at that time aware he did not pose a terror threat . wolfgang neskovic , a committee member from the opposition left party , said if the government turned down a us release offer it would have been a " deeply inhumane decision that should have criminal , not just political consequences .

" there is no doubt that there could be a very important effect on the entire region if we are able to make progress on middle east peace , " said rice , who later left for london to brief british prime minister tony blair . rice and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier announced late wednesday that representatives from the united nations , the united states , russia and the european union would meet in washington next month to discuss ways to end the middle east conflict . rice said thursday that the meeting would probably take place feb .
2 . the chief us diplomat came to berlin after a six-country middle east tour during which she announced she would hold a summit with israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas within a month . rice touts mid-east peace summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said israel and the palestinians were ready to talk rice said it would take " a few weeks " to organize the summit but added thursday that both the israelis and palestinians were ready to work toward a lasting solution . " i did find the parties to be very desirous of accelerating progress on the road map , of extending the momentum that has been achieved in the meeting between prime minister olmert and president abbas , " rice said , referring to preliminary talks held last month . " i believe that the whole region is looking for a way to accelerate progress and to drag toward the establishment of a palestinian state and so this is a very important time . " germany , as the current eu president , has made revitalizing the quartet one of its priorities .
it held its last full meeting in september . merkel pleased with us movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel welcomed us moves to kick-start peace talks merkel made the appeal this month in washington to us president george w. bush , who agreed to send rice to the middle east . " we have the impression that there is movement on the issue of the israeli-palestinian conflict , " merkel said thursday .

once heralded as the next great german soccer star , deisler carried the weight of a nation 's expectation with him onto the pitch . the sad sight of sebastian deisler announcing his retirement on tuesday brought to an end the career of a player not only tipped for greatness but one touted as a potential german legend .
while injuries and bouts of depression were certainly the main contributors to deisler 's retirement , could it be that the weight of such expectation also added to the premature end of such a promising career ? deisler , known in the german game as " das supertalent , " was lauded by everyone from coaches to journalists when he began his rise through the ranks at borussia mönchengladbach as an 18-year-old right winger blessed with acceleration , vision and a blistering shot . franz beckenbauer said that deisler was " physically and technically the best in germany " , while rudi völler said at the time that the youngster would be " influential for germany for another ten years .

he said the decision to expel him was a result of critical articles he published about the cdu 's electoral performance and the fact that he stood against wansner in a leadership election . besides that , to paraphrase a more senior ex-politician , maassen claims he did not have sexual relations with that woman or any women despite appearing in the film 's sexually explicit scenes .

which is why the revelation that a local party member had appeared in an adult movie in his past led to his expulsion . according to the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- official web site , the german conservtive party 's philosophy is to " unite catholics and protestants , conservatives and liberals , proponents of christian social ideals , and men and women from various regions , social classes , and democratic traditions . " with this in mind , the expulsion tuesday of cdu member alexander maassen from his local party branch could be seen as being slightly hypocritical .
taking part of the philosophy literally - the part about uniting " men and women from various regions , social classes , and democratic traditions " - maassen did just that .

he was informed of the cdu 's decision in a letter from the branch chairman , kurt wansner . " i wrote to maassen at the end of last month asking him to resign and for me the matter is now completely closed , " wansner told reuters , adding maassen 's behavior was against cdu values . however , maassen believes that his involvement with " beauty gang " is a smokescreen for wansner 's ulterior motives .
he said the decision to expel him was a result of critical articles he published about the cdu 's electoral performance and the fact that he stood against wansner in a leadership election . besides that , to paraphrase a more senior ex-politician , maassen claims he did not have sexual relations with that woman or any women despite appearing in the film 's sexually explicit scenes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.01.2007 bavarian premier stoiber says he will step down großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of an era following a major debate in his christian social union party over his leadership , bavarian premier edmund stoiber has announced that he will step down in september . the embattled leader of bavaria 's ruling party , stoiber said he would step down as chairman of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and premier of the german state on sept .
30 . " i have decided that i will not stand in the regional elections next year " and therefore will make way for a new candidate to lead the party , he told journalists in munich . stoiber , a strategic ally of chancellor angela merkel , has faced strong pressure to resign since opinion polls showed last weekend that support for the party has plummeted . " my aim is to ensure that bavaria remains the most successful state in germany , " he said , explaining his decision .

30 . " i have decided that i will not stand in the regional elections next year " and therefore will make way for a new candidate to lead the party , he told journalists in munich . stoiber , a strategic ally of chancellor angela merkel , has faced strong pressure to resign since opinion polls showed last weekend that support for the party has plummeted . " my aim is to ensure that bavaria remains the most successful state in germany , " he said , explaining his decision .
rifts with berlin start the slide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel 's relationship nose-dived stoiber has been a thorn in the side of chancellor angela merkel and her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , sister party of the csu , since abruptly dropping plans to join her cabinet soon after the 2005 general election . he was proposed as the new economy minister but rejected the post just weeks before her coalition was formed . the incident only strengthened the beliefs of many in berlin that stoiber was reluctant to leave the comfort of his home state for bigger challenges . adding further weight to that argument , he retreated to his bavarian fiefdom but continued to haunt the conservatives from his southern base by criticizing the government and attempting to block merkel 's reform plans , most publicly the much-maligned health care reform , losing friends and allies as a result . an attack dog in german politics , stoiber often chipped away at berlin 's authority over the country 's 16 states .
he also led the german center-right to overtly oppose turkish entry into the " christian " european union . kurt beck , the head of the social democratic party , with which merkel shares power , said having a lame duck premier in bavaria would complicate national negotiations , though he said it would not affect cooperation within the ruling grand coalition . rival 's allegations stick like mud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber never recovered from pauli 's allegations the slide in his popularity dropped into freefall after it was revealed last month that one of stoiber 's top aides pried into the private life of a rival . stoiber vehemently rejected the allegations made by party rival gabriele pauli that he knew about the efforts by his office to gather compromising information on pauli 's private life . but despite the denials , stoiber 's reputation as a political troublemaker was only enhanced .
the unrest the scandal caused almost certainly contributed to stoiber 's position becoming untenable . seen as one of the driving forces behind stoiber 's decision , pauli tried to play down her role in the week-long power struggle within the csu . " i only said what many others in the party thought , " she said .
" something can only get rolling when the stones are loose . " however , despite the growing unrest , stoiber was considered a sure thing for another shot at re-election as recently as a month ago . any new leader could bring peace , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein is being touted as the new premier his decision to stand down before next year 's state elections is being seen as a boost to the chancellor . " this could be good for merkel , " oskar niedermayer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , told reuters .
" just about any successor to stoiber would improve the relationship between the cdu and the csu in the government and in parliament . " according to sources within the csu , bavarian interior minister günther beckstein would replace stoiber as premier of the rich southern state stoiber has headed since 1993 . both german agriculture minister horst seehofer and the bavarian economy minister erwin huber have express interest in becoming become head of the csu , of which stoiber has been leader since 1999 . seehofer , who this week was exposed to of had an extramarital affair , had previously said he would only consider taking the position if stoiber willingly left the office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will stoiber turn his back on politics for good ?
stoiber 's announcement signals the potential end of a political career which very nearly hit the heights . he was denied becoming german chancellor in 2002 by just a few thousand votes , losing ground to eventual winner gerhard schröder on issues such as the flooding in eastern germany and the iraq war . however , despite never having the top job , stoiber has enjoyed great status . as premier of bavaria , he has not only ruled one of germany 's most prosperous regions but has also wielded unique power on the national stage , running a party that is outside merkel 's control , enjoying the use of royal palaces , dominating every aspect of administration and basking in the acclaim of the mainly catholic population . however , with his career seemingly reeling from one blow too many , stoiber faces leaving the podium for the last time with the words of the f rankfurter allgemeine zeitung inscribed on his political tombstone : " stoiber has shrunk from being a feared provincial ruler and politician of federal stature to a national joke : a toothless lion , a blunt guillotine .

what do you expect the consequences will be in the country ? andreas friedrich : we expect there will be winds that reach storm levels across the entire country , which is something that sets this low-pressure system apart .
" storm level " means wind strength 11 , which is over 100 kilometer per hour -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- .
they are expected across germany this afternoon -lrb- thursday -rrb- , when the first storm warnings go into effect .
in some areas , especially in the mountains , they will reach speeds much faster than hurricane strength . do you expect heavy precipitation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites have tracked " kryill " for days yes , that is the second element that stormy weather can take on .
there will be heavy rainfall , especially in the low mountain ranges and the west , where as much as 40 liters per square meter -lrb- about 10 gallons per 10 square feet -rrb- could fall within 24 hours .
that would be enough to cross the storm threshold so that people should expect floods in small and mid-sized river encatchment areas . the german weather service has been under criticism for incorrect weather predictions since the 1999 storm " lothar , " which caused $ 6.4 billion worth of damage -lrb- 5 billion euros -rrb- across europe .
has the service become more careful about issuing warnings and how does that affect the current situation ? no , we have not changed our tactics or threshold levels .
with this low-pressure system , we could give a very early warning .
that is a result that was clearly forecast by weather prediction models a few days ago .
there are other weather situations , particularly in the summer , when this is simply impossible .
then you can not predict if a storm that appears to be local will spread and hit certain areas in the future or not . are weather phenomena like " lothar " and other " storms of the century " a sign of climate change ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the storm can alredy been seen in blackpool , england an individual event can not be connected to climate change .
in order to do that you need observations that span decades .
but the climate models predict that if these trends are confirmed and the increase in temperature continues , winters will have heavier precipitation .
this precipitation is connected to intense low-pressure situations .
one could expect that these weather conditions will appear more often in the winter . is the " kryill " low-pressure system nothing but hot air when compared to the hurricanes and typhoons that occur in other regions of the world ? tropical cyclones naturally have stronger winds than this kind of non-tropical , low-pressure system .
hurricane winds can reach a speed of up to 300 kph .
but what we are experiencing now is an unusual development that only occurs in central europe every few years . christoph j. heuer interviewed andreas friedrich -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de heavy storms batter northern europe winds gusting up to 130 kilometers an hour -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- lashed parts of europe thursday , sinking two irish trawlers and leaving seven fishermen missing , while causing widespread disruption to sea and air traffic .

what do you expect the consequences will be in the country ? andreas friedrich : we expect there will be winds that reach storm levels across the entire country , which is something that sets this low-pressure system apart .
" storm level " means wind strength 11 , which is over 100 kilometer per hour -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- .
they are expected across germany this afternoon -lrb- thursday -rrb- , when the first storm warnings go into effect .
in some areas , especially in the mountains , they will reach speeds much faster than hurricane strength . do you expect heavy precipitation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites have tracked " kryill " for days yes , that is the second element that stormy weather can take on .
there will be heavy rainfall , especially in the low mountain ranges and the west , where as much as 40 liters per square meter -lrb- about 10 gallons per 10 square feet -rrb- could fall within 24 hours .
that would be enough to cross the storm threshold so that people should expect floods in small and mid-sized river encatchment areas . the german weather service has been under criticism for incorrect weather predictions since the 1999 storm " lothar , " which caused $ 6.4 billion worth of damage -lrb- 5 billion euros -rrb- across europe .
has the service become more careful about issuing warnings and how does that affect the current situation ? no , we have not changed our tactics or threshold levels .
with this low-pressure system , we could give a very early warning .
that is a result that was clearly forecast by weather prediction models a few days ago .
there are other weather situations , particularly in the summer , when this is simply impossible .
then you can not predict if a storm that appears to be local will spread and hit certain areas in the future or not . are weather phenomena like " lothar " and other " storms of the century " a sign of climate change ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the storm can alredy been seen in blackpool , england an individual event can not be connected to climate change .
in order to do that you need observations that span decades .

once heralded as the next great german soccer star , deisler carried the weight of a nation 's expectation with him onto the pitch . the sad sight of sebastian deisler announcing his retirement on tuesday brought to an end the career of a player not only tipped for greatness but one touted as a potential german legend .
while injuries and bouts of depression were certainly the main contributors to deisler 's retirement , could it be that the weight of such expectation also added to the premature end of such a promising career ? deisler , known in the german game as " das supertalent , " was lauded by everyone from coaches to journalists when he began his rise through the ranks at borussia mönchengladbach as an 18-year-old right winger blessed with acceleration , vision and a blistering shot . franz beckenbauer said that deisler was " physically and technically the best in germany " , while rudi völler said at the time that the youngster would be " influential for germany for another ten years . "
the mass-circulation bild newspaper famously exclaimed : " basti fantasti is magical ! " no fewer than 26 clubs were vying for his signature in 1999 when gladbach were relegated .
deisler chose hertha berlin and prompted further exhortations of a legend in the making ; the transfer seen by many as the next step of a journey which would see him eventually fulfil his potential at one of europe 's biggest clubs . after inspiring hertha to champions league qualification from a new right-sided midfield berth and then victories in that competition against the likes of ac milan and chelsea , the widely held belief that his destiny lay among the greats gathered credence when deisler moved to bayern munich . munich dream turns to nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler never hit the heights others expected of him it was in munich that it was all supposed to happen .
if germany has its own theater of dreams akin to manchester united 's old trafford , bayern 's former home at the olympiastadion was it .
under the watchful eye of german icons such as oli hoeness , karl-heinz rummenigge and der kaiser himself , and with first ottmar hitzfeld and then felix magath as his coach , deisler could only prosper in such luminous company . hoeness himself joined the ever-rising chorus of approval on deisler 's arrival : " he 's got unbelievable potential .
it 'll be great for him to be able to show everybody , " he said at the time . his performances in a bayern shirt at times suggested that his elevation to the pantheon of german greats was on schedule .
deisler in full flow was an awesome sight ; determination , quick feet and pin-point crosses combining with a controlled aggression and a will to win . but it was n't to be .
deisler 's knee problems and the subsequent mental fragility born from the uncertainty and insecurities surrounding his future eventually wrecked his league and international career . twice injury ruled him out of world cups that were his for the taking .
who can say how germany would have played with a fully fit deisler in the team in the 2002 final against brazil ?
maybe there would have been no need for the heart-breaking extra-time which brought defeat in the 2006 semi-final against italy had " basti fantasti " been on the pitch in dortmund . an unachievable level of greatness ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are all new stars expected to eclipse der kaiser ?
" das supertalent " leaves these and many other questions unanswered , his body and mind no longer equipped for the rigors of the game he graced .
could he ever have reached the heights others expected of him ?
what constitutes a german legend anyway ?
is it a player who can eclipse possibly the greatest of all , franz beckenbauer ?
if so , the bar is set incredibly high . many have tried and have been found wanting .
michael ballack , currently germany 's one true world star , was another to show great potential and make good on his promise within the bundesliga .
but even he has tripped in making his next step ; the mercurial midfielder is now seen as an industrious rather than skilful player in chelsea 's diamond-studded team , toiling in an english premiership hardly short of star names . young stars shouldering the burden bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski 's form for germany has gone missing at bayern the likes of benjamin lauth and benny auer were also been saddled with the " next big thing " tags early in their careers and both fell by the wayside .
currently , bayern teammates lukas podolski , bastian schweinsteiger and philipp lahm all share the burden of a country 's high expectations .
their own performances and the current erratic form of their team suggest that their own journeys may have stalled on the autobahn to greatness . living up to one 's own expectations is often hard enough , but trying to achieve those of others is particularly difficult , especially when that expectation is one as relative as greatness .
sebastian deisler is unlikely to spend much time pondering this but those who continue to add such pressures onto the shoulders of already burdened young stars maybe should . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de injury convinces gifted deisler to end career injury finally took its toll on bayern munich 's german international sebastian deisler , who quit professional soccer on tuesday after battling for years against a succession of serious knee problems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.01.2007 opinion : stoiber finally hits the emergency brakes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : following stormy debate in his christian social union party over his leadership , embattled bavarian premier stoiber has announced he will step down in september .
it 's about time , writes deutsche welle 's ralf bosen . that was some political poker in bavaria !
at the very last minute , the head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- literally hit the emergency brake in order to prevent further damage to the party . the unresolved leadership questions in stoiber 's party hurt voter support for both the csu and its sister partner , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
nevertheless , things may not turn out to be all that bad after all .
with günther beckstein as the new bavarian premier and erwin huber as new head of the csu , stoiber 's successors already have a large part of the party and the voters behind them . another advantage of this personnel decision is that the csu chair and the post of the premier will be divided among two individuals - a move that many party members have been advocating for a long time already .
for them , stoiber was too powerful in his double role . stoiber dug his own political grave the political damage stoiber caused in this role is sizeable .
now the csu has to put its money where its mouth is and support a new team of leaders . for the past few weeks , bavaria has been witness to an unusual political drama , full of schmooze and hypocrisy , with edmund stoiber in the starring role - not just as the the victim but also mainly as the villain . it hardly bothered him that bavaria suffered as a result of the power struggle and that he led the csu into one of its worst crises to date . but he 's responsible for getting himself into this situation in the first place . and in the end , he stumbled on account of one of his critics , a councilwoman in his own party . the gabriele pauli affair , which involved allegations that stoiber was aware his top aide was snooping in her private life , was just the latest trigger . his downfall began much earlier , in the fall of 2005 .
at that time he aspired - enthusiastically at first - to the post of a super-minister in the new federal government led by merkel , only to abruptly reject it once he was offered it . his flip-flopping annoyed all of his potential successors and hurt his credibility .
since then , discontent has been simmering behind the csu 's sanitized facade despite stoiber 's many successes in bavaria 's economy and education sector . stoiber was never the sovereign that the bavarians wanted him to be . instead , the bland bavarian premier was more interested in paperwork than in winning the hearts of the citizens . nevertheless , if stoiber had thrown in the towel before the csu convention this week in the town of wildbad kreuth , he would have come away from the affair with a liitle more dignity . political weariness once again citizens have had to observe incredulously just how easily politics can be defined by power struggles and personalities . and they have experienced yet another top politician who just ca n't let go of power .
those who wonder why germany is talking about political jadedness just need to look at bavaria . as for stoiber , he has been the bavarian premier for 14 years and the head of the csu for 8 years .
he was even the conservatives ' candidate for chancellor once . these are all accomplishments that wo n't count for much after his act of self-destruction so far removed from reality . ralf bosen is an expert on german politics at dw-radio -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian premier stoiber says he will step down following a major debate in his christian social union party over his leadership , bavarian premier edmund stoiber has announced that he will step down in september .

" this is a very critical time for the international community and for the middle east , " rice said , adding that the united states continued to support a two-state solution for israel and the palestinians " in peace , democracy and freedom . " germany , in its capacity as the current eu president , has pushed for a revitalized role for the quartet at what it considers to be an auspicious time to bring an end to the bloodshed . " a solution to that problem is more urgent today than ever , " steinmeier said .
" we are both of the opinion that the time is ripe for a meeting of the quartet . " its last full meeting was in september . six-country tour rice arrived for her two-day visit in germany on wednesday from kuwait after completing a six-country tour of the middle east during which she announced she would hold a three-way summit with israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas within a month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice met egyptian president hosni mubarak on monday she said in berlin it would take " a few weeks " to organize the three-way summit . " i think it will be useful to have the meeting with the quartet in advance of that , " rice said . rice said sunday washington wanted to build on what she called " the momentum that is currently in palestinian-israeli relations . " steinmeier said he believed the stalled roadmap - the peace plan drawn up in 2003 by the members of the quartet with the aim of establishing a viable palestinian state living peacefully alongside israel - remained the best option for progress . in berlin , rice also met christopher hill , the top us envoy to six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear weapons program , who is holding discussions with the north 's negotiator in the german capital . rice 's trip to the middle east had the dual aims of breathing new life into the palestinian-israeli peace process and winning support for the bush administration 's plan to deploy more than 20,000 additional us troops in iraq . after talks with rice in kuwait city tuesday , the six members of the pro-us gulf cooperation council along with egypt and jordan gave the plan a cautious welcome and issued a call for iraq 's neighbors not to meddle in the strife-torn country . skeptical middle east many arab countries are concerned about iran 's growing power in the region . kuwaiti foreign minister sheikh mohammad al-sabah told a joint news conference with rice : " with respect to us policy towards iran ... the us and the gulf -lrb- states -rrb- expressed in -lrb- a -rrb- joint communiqué that we call to all countries to refrain from interfering in iraqi internal affairs . " the gulf states and the us said they wanted to prevent iraq " becoming a battleground for regional and international powers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syrian president assad is accused by the us of meddling in iraq this could also refer to syria which has been repeatedly accused by washington of fueling the iraqi insurgency . " we expressed our desire to see the president 's plan to reinforce the american military presence in baghdad as a vehicle ... to stabilize baghdad and to prevent iraq from sliding into this ugly war , " the kuwaiti foreign minister said . rice admitted that iraq 's predominantly sunni arab neighbors were skeptical about the ability of iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki 's shiite government to halt the sectarian violence that has pitted sunni arabs against shiites . " there are concerns about whether the maliki government is prepared to take an even-handed , non-sectarian path ... but everybody wants to give this a chance .
that is the position of the people in the region and there is in fact a burden on the iraqi government to perform , " she said in kuwait . she will continue on to london , the last stop of her tour , thursday . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us and north korea pursue nuclear talks in berlin the top us envoy to unprecedented six-way talks on north korea 's nuclear arms said in berlin he was having " useful discussions " with his pyongyang counterpart and hoped negotiations would resume this month .

it 's about time , writes deutsche welle 's ralf bosen . that was some political poker in bavaria !
at the very last minute , the head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- literally hit the emergency brake in order to prevent further damage to the party . the unresolved leadership questions in stoiber 's party hurt voter support for both the csu and its sister partner , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
nevertheless , things may not turn out to be all that bad after all .
with günther beckstein as the new bavarian premier and erwin huber as new head of the csu , stoiber 's successors already have a large part of the party and the voters behind them . another advantage of this personnel decision is that the csu chair and the post of the premier will be divided among two individuals - a move that many party members have been advocating for a long time already .
for them , stoiber was too powerful in his double role . stoiber dug his own political grave the political damage stoiber caused in this role is sizeable .
now the csu has to put its money where its mouth is and support a new team of leaders . for the past few weeks , bavaria has been witness to an unusual political drama , full of schmooze and hypocrisy , with edmund stoiber in the starring role - not just as the the victim but also mainly as the villain . it hardly bothered him that bavaria suffered as a result of the power struggle and that he led the csu into one of its worst crises to date . but he 's responsible for getting himself into this situation in the first place . and in the end , he stumbled on account of one of his critics , a councilwoman in his own party . the gabriele pauli affair , which involved allegations that stoiber was aware his top aide was snooping in her private life , was just the latest trigger . his downfall began much earlier , in the fall of 2005 .
at that time he aspired - enthusiastically at first - to the post of a super-minister in the new federal government led by merkel , only to abruptly reject it once he was offered it . his flip-flopping annoyed all of his potential successors and hurt his credibility .
since then , discontent has been simmering behind the csu 's sanitized facade despite stoiber 's many successes in bavaria 's economy and education sector . stoiber was never the sovereign that the bavarians wanted him to be . instead , the bland bavarian premier was more interested in paperwork than in winning the hearts of the citizens . nevertheless , if stoiber had thrown in the towel before the csu convention this week in the town of wildbad kreuth , he would have come away from the affair with a liitle more dignity . political weariness once again citizens have had to observe incredulously just how easily politics can be defined by power struggles and personalities . and they have experienced yet another top politician who just ca n't let go of power .
those who wonder why germany is talking about political jadedness just need to look at bavaria . as for stoiber , he has been the bavarian premier for 14 years and the head of the csu for 8 years .
he was even the conservatives ' candidate for chancellor once . these are all accomplishments that wo n't count for much after his act of self-destruction so far removed from reality . ralf bosen is an expert on german politics at dw-radio -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian premier stoiber says he will step down following a major debate in his christian social union party over his leadership , bavarian premier edmund stoiber has announced that he will step down in september .

it 's about time , writes deutsche welle 's ralf bosen . that was some political poker in bavaria !
at the very last minute , the head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- literally hit the emergency brake in order to prevent further damage to the party . the unresolved leadership questions in stoiber 's party hurt voter support for both the csu and its sister partner , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
nevertheless , things may not turn out to be all that bad after all .
with günther beckstein as the new bavarian premier and erwin huber as new head of the csu , stoiber 's successors already have a large part of the party and the voters behind them . another advantage of this personnel decision is that the csu chair and the post of the premier will be divided among two individuals - a move that many party members have been advocating for a long time already .
for them , stoiber was too powerful in his double role . stoiber dug his own political grave the political damage stoiber caused in this role is sizeable .
now the csu has to put its money where its mouth is and support a new team of leaders . for the past few weeks , bavaria has been witness to an unusual political drama , full of schmooze and hypocrisy , with edmund stoiber in the starring role - not just as the the victim but also mainly as the villain . it hardly bothered him that bavaria suffered as a result of the power struggle and that he led the csu into one of its worst crises to date . but he 's responsible for getting himself into this situation in the first place . and in the end , he stumbled on account of one of his critics , a councilwoman in his own party . the gabriele pauli affair , which involved allegations that stoiber was aware his top aide was snooping in her private life , was just the latest trigger . his downfall began much earlier , in the fall of 2005 .
at that time he aspired - enthusiastically at first - to the post of a super-minister in the new federal government led by merkel , only to abruptly reject it once he was offered it . his flip-flopping annoyed all of his potential successors and hurt his credibility .
since then , discontent has been simmering behind the csu 's sanitized facade despite stoiber 's many successes in bavaria 's economy and education sector . stoiber was never the sovereign that the bavarians wanted him to be . instead , the bland bavarian premier was more interested in paperwork than in winning the hearts of the citizens . nevertheless , if stoiber had thrown in the towel before the csu convention this week in the town of wildbad kreuth , he would have come away from the affair with a liitle more dignity . political weariness once again citizens have had to observe incredulously just how easily politics can be defined by power struggles and personalities . and they have experienced yet another top politician who just ca n't let go of power .
those who wonder why germany is talking about political jadedness just need to look at bavaria . as for stoiber , he has been the bavarian premier for 14 years and the head of the csu for 8 years .

" ' they tortured us with cold in solitary confinement or airlessness often to the point where i fell unconscious , " the now 24-year-old kurnaz told a german parliamentary committee investigating his case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz has made some serious accusations " sometimes , for example we would be punished with a month of cold or the air conditioners would be turned completely off for several weeks . " unhygienic conditions , sleep deprivation and lack of food were also common , he added . " they would hit you , tie you up and then leave you laying there for about 12 hours , " kurnaz said , describing a punishment for talking between prisoners . former government complicit ? on thursday , deputies from opposition parties and the conservative bloc of chancellor angela merkel serving on the parliamentary committee investigating the case demanded to know why former chancellor schröder 's government apparently failed to take action on murat kurnaz 's behalf . kurnaz , who was taken prisoner in pakistan in 2001 , was handed over to american troops and held as an enemy combatant until august 2006 .
he has also testified that he was abused by german intelligence agents while being held in guantanamo in 2002 . shown pictures of three men , bremen-born kurnaz was able to identify one of the germans who allegedly interrogated him in cuba and said it was " highly likely " he had seen a second and was unsure about the identity of the third . kurnaz ' lawyer bernhard docke , who also spoke in front of the parliamentary committee thursday , said the former coalition of social democrats and greens was complicit in the crime committed against kurnaz because it did not work to free him from american custody . " if kurnaz was german , he would have been freed in autumn 2002 , " docke said , adding that at the beginning of 2002 , former foreign minster joschka fischer told kurnaz ' mother germany could not help her son because of his turkish citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another committee is looking into whether german special forces interrogated kurnaz siegfried kauder , head of the parliamentary investigation into the matter , said the way kurnaz was treated in guantanamo was " unfathomable " and added that the committee would continue looking into whether such an offer was actually made . members of the then-governing coalition of social democrats and greens , however , said fischer , a green party member , did try to make the case for kurnaz ' release to then us secretary of state colin powell . two ongoing investigations docke said there was no reason for germany to refuse an alleged american offer to release kurnaz into german custody in 2002 as german and us officials were at that time aware he did not pose a terror threat . wolfgang neskovic , a committee member from the opposition left party , said if the government turned down a us release offer it would have been a " deeply inhumane decision that should have criminal , not just political consequences .

" this is a very critical time for the international community and for the middle east , " rice said , adding that the united states continued to support a two-state solution for israel and the palestinians " in peace , democracy and freedom . " germany , in its capacity as the current eu president , has pushed for a revitalized role for the quartet at what it considers to be an auspicious time to bring an end to the bloodshed . " a solution to that problem is more urgent today than ever , " steinmeier said .
" we are both of the opinion that the time is ripe for a meeting of the quartet . " its last full meeting was in september . six-country tour rice arrived for her two-day visit in germany on wednesday from kuwait after completing a six-country tour of the middle east during which she announced she would hold a three-way summit with israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas within a month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice met egyptian president hosni mubarak on monday she said in berlin it would take " a few weeks " to organize the three-way summit .

" steinmeier said he believed the stalled roadmap - the peace plan drawn up in 2003 by the members of the quartet with the aim of establishing a viable palestinian state living peacefully alongside israel - remained the best option for progress . in berlin , rice also met christopher hill , the top us envoy to six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear weapons program , who is holding discussions with the north 's negotiator in the german capital . rice 's trip to the middle east had the dual aims of breathing new life into the palestinian-israeli peace process and winning support for the bush administration 's plan to deploy more than 20,000 additional us troops in iraq . after talks with rice in kuwait city tuesday , the six members of the pro-us gulf cooperation council along with egypt and jordan gave the plan a cautious welcome and issued a call for iraq 's neighbors not to meddle in the strife-torn country . skeptical middle east many arab countries are concerned about iran 's growing power in the region . kuwaiti foreign minister sheikh mohammad al-sabah told a joint news conference with rice : " with respect to us policy towards iran ... the us and the gulf -lrb- states -rrb- expressed in -lrb- a -rrb- joint communiqué that we call to all countries to refrain from interfering in iraqi internal affairs .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syrian president assad is accused by the us of meddling in iraq this could also refer to syria which has been repeatedly accused by washington of fueling the iraqi insurgency . " we expressed our desire to see the president 's plan to reinforce the american military presence in baghdad as a vehicle ... to stabilize baghdad and to prevent iraq from sliding into this ugly war , " the kuwaiti foreign minister said . rice admitted that iraq 's predominantly sunni arab neighbors were skeptical about the ability of iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki 's shiite government to halt the sectarian violence that has pitted sunni arabs against shiites . " there are concerns about whether the maliki government is prepared to take an even-handed , non-sectarian path ... but everybody wants to give this a chance .
that is the position of the people in the region and there is in fact a burden on the iraqi government to perform , " she said in kuwait . she will continue on to london , the last stop of her tour , thursday . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us and north korea pursue nuclear talks in berlin the top us envoy to unprecedented six-way talks on north korea 's nuclear arms said in berlin he was having " useful discussions " with his pyongyang counterpart and hoped negotiations would resume this month .

" germany , in its capacity as the current eu president , has pushed for a revitalized role for the quartet at what it considers to be an auspicious time to bring an end to the bloodshed . " a solution to that problem is more urgent today than ever , " steinmeier said .
" we are both of the opinion that the time is ripe for a meeting of the quartet . " its last full meeting was in september . six-country tour rice arrived for her two-day visit in germany on wednesday from kuwait after completing a six-country tour of the middle east during which she announced she would hold a three-way summit with israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmud abbas within a month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice met egyptian president hosni mubarak on monday she said in berlin it would take " a few weeks " to organize the three-way summit .

" there are concerns about whether the maliki government is prepared to take an even-handed , non-sectarian path ... but everybody wants to give this a chance .

30 . " i have decided that i will not stand in the regional elections next year " and therefore will make way for a new candidate to lead the party , he told journalists in munich . stoiber , a strategic ally of chancellor angela merkel , has faced strong pressure to resign since opinion polls showed last weekend that support for the party has plummeted . " my aim is to ensure that bavaria remains the most successful state in germany , " he said , explaining his decision .
rifts with berlin start the slide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel 's relationship nose-dived stoiber has been a thorn in the side of chancellor angela merkel and her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , sister party of the csu , since abruptly dropping plans to join her cabinet soon after the 2005 general election . he was proposed as the new economy minister but rejected the post just weeks before her coalition was formed . the incident only strengthened the beliefs of many in berlin that stoiber was reluctant to leave the comfort of his home state for bigger challenges . adding further weight to that argument , he retreated to his bavarian fiefdom but continued to haunt the conservatives from his southern base by criticizing the government and attempting to block merkel 's reform plans , most publicly the much-maligned health care reform , losing friends and allies as a result . an attack dog in german politics , stoiber often chipped away at berlin 's authority over the country 's 16 states .
he also led the german center-right to overtly oppose turkish entry into the " christian " european union . kurt beck , the head of the social democratic party , with which merkel shares power , said having a lame duck premier in bavaria would complicate national negotiations , though he said it would not affect cooperation within the ruling grand coalition . rival 's allegations stick like mud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber never recovered from pauli 's allegations the slide in his popularity dropped into freefall after it was revealed last month that one of stoiber 's top aides pried into the private life of a rival . stoiber vehemently rejected the allegations made by party rival gabriele pauli that he knew about the efforts by his office to gather compromising information on pauli 's private life . but despite the denials , stoiber 's reputation as a political troublemaker was only enhanced .
the unrest the scandal caused almost certainly contributed to stoiber 's position becoming untenable . seen as one of the driving forces behind stoiber 's decision , pauli tried to play down her role in the week-long power struggle within the csu . " i only said what many others in the party thought , " she said .
" something can only get rolling when the stones are loose . " however , despite the growing unrest , stoiber was considered a sure thing for another shot at re-election as recently as a month ago . any new leader could bring peace , says expert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein is being touted as the new premier his decision to stand down before next year 's state elections is being seen as a boost to the chancellor .

" there are concerns about whether the maliki government is prepared to take an even-handed , non-sectarian path ... but everybody wants to give this a chance .

it 's about time , writes deutsche welle 's ralf bosen . that was some political poker in bavaria !
at the very last minute , the head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- literally hit the emergency brake in order to prevent further damage to the party . the unresolved leadership questions in stoiber 's party hurt voter support for both the csu and its sister partner , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
nevertheless , things may not turn out to be all that bad after all .
with günther beckstein as the new bavarian premier and erwin huber as new head of the csu , stoiber 's successors already have a large part of the party and the voters behind them . another advantage of this personnel decision is that the csu chair and the post of the premier will be divided among two individuals - a move that many party members have been advocating for a long time already .
for them , stoiber was too powerful in his double role . stoiber dug his own political grave the political damage stoiber caused in this role is sizeable .
now the csu has to put its money where its mouth is and support a new team of leaders . for the past few weeks , bavaria has been witness to an unusual political drama , full of schmooze and hypocrisy , with edmund stoiber in the starring role - not just as the the victim but also mainly as the villain . it hardly bothered him that bavaria suffered as a result of the power struggle and that he led the csu into one of its worst crises to date . but he 's responsible for getting himself into this situation in the first place . and in the end , he stumbled on account of one of his critics , a councilwoman in his own party . the gabriele pauli affair , which involved allegations that stoiber was aware his top aide was snooping in her private life , was just the latest trigger . his downfall began much earlier , in the fall of 2005 .
at that time he aspired - enthusiastically at first - to the post of a super-minister in the new federal government led by merkel , only to abruptly reject it once he was offered it . his flip-flopping annoyed all of his potential successors and hurt his credibility .
since then , discontent has been simmering behind the csu 's sanitized facade despite stoiber 's many successes in bavaria 's economy and education sector . stoiber was never the sovereign that the bavarians wanted him to be . instead , the bland bavarian premier was more interested in paperwork than in winning the hearts of the citizens . nevertheless , if stoiber had thrown in the towel before the csu convention this week in the town of wildbad kreuth , he would have come away from the affair with a liitle more dignity . political weariness once again citizens have had to observe incredulously just how easily politics can be defined by power struggles and personalities . and they have experienced yet another top politician who just ca n't let go of power .
those who wonder why germany is talking about political jadedness just need to look at bavaria . as for stoiber , he has been the bavarian premier for 14 years and the head of the csu for 8 years .
he was even the conservatives ' candidate for chancellor once . these are all accomplishments that wo n't count for much after his act of self-destruction so far removed from reality . ralf bosen is an expert on german politics at dw-radio -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian premier stoiber says he will step down following a major debate in his christian social union party over his leadership , bavarian premier edmund stoiber has announced that he will step down in september .

what do you expect the consequences will be in the country ? andreas friedrich : we expect there will be winds that reach storm levels across the entire country , which is something that sets this low-pressure system apart .
" storm level " means wind strength 11 , which is over 100 kilometer per hour -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- .
they are expected across germany this afternoon -lrb- thursday -rrb- , when the first storm warnings go into effect .
in some areas , especially in the mountains , they will reach speeds much faster than hurricane strength . do you expect heavy precipitation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites have tracked " kryill " for days yes , that is the second element that stormy weather can take on .
there will be heavy rainfall , especially in the low mountain ranges and the west , where as much as 40 liters per square meter -lrb- about 10 gallons per 10 square feet -rrb- could fall within 24 hours .
that would be enough to cross the storm threshold so that people should expect floods in small and mid-sized river encatchment areas . the german weather service has been under criticism for incorrect weather predictions since the 1999 storm " lothar , " which caused $ 6.4 billion worth of damage -lrb- 5 billion euros -rrb- across europe .
has the service become more careful about issuing warnings and how does that affect the current situation ? no , we have not changed our tactics or threshold levels .
with this low-pressure system , we could give a very early warning .
that is a result that was clearly forecast by weather prediction models a few days ago .
there are other weather situations , particularly in the summer , when this is simply impossible .
then you can not predict if a storm that appears to be local will spread and hit certain areas in the future or not . are weather phenomena like " lothar " and other " storms of the century " a sign of climate change ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the storm can alredy been seen in blackpool , england an individual event can not be connected to climate change .
in order to do that you need observations that span decades .
but the climate models predict that if these trends are confirmed and the increase in temperature continues , winters will have heavier precipitation .
this precipitation is connected to intense low-pressure situations .
one could expect that these weather conditions will appear more often in the winter . is the " kryill " low-pressure system nothing but hot air when compared to the hurricanes and typhoons that occur in other regions of the world ? tropical cyclones naturally have stronger winds than this kind of non-tropical , low-pressure system .
hurricane winds can reach a speed of up to 300 kph .
but what we are experiencing now is an unusual development that only occurs in central europe every few years . christoph j. heuer interviewed andreas friedrich -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de heavy storms batter northern europe winds gusting up to 130 kilometers an hour -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- lashed parts of europe thursday , sinking two irish trawlers and leaving seven fishermen missing , while causing widespread disruption to sea and air traffic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 18.01.2007 weather expert predicts more storms in coming winters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the storm already flipped trailer trucks in northern parts of germany as a severe storm lashed northwestern europe and gathered pace in germany , a weather expert talked to dw-world.de about the causes behind the inclement climate . andreas friedrich is a member of the german weather service 's prediction department . dw-world.de : the extreme low-pressure system " kryill " will reach germany 's north sea coast thursday afternoon .
what do you expect the consequences will be in the country ? andreas friedrich : we expect there will be winds that reach storm levels across the entire country , which is something that sets this low-pressure system apart .
" storm level " means wind strength 11 , which is over 100 kilometer per hour -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- .
they are expected across germany this afternoon -lrb- thursday -rrb- , when the first storm warnings go into effect .
in some areas , especially in the mountains , they will reach speeds much faster than hurricane strength . do you expect heavy precipitation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites have tracked " kryill " for days yes , that is the second element that stormy weather can take on .
there will be heavy rainfall , especially in the low mountain ranges and the west , where as much as 40 liters per square meter -lrb- about 10 gallons per 10 square feet -rrb- could fall within 24 hours .
that would be enough to cross the storm threshold so that people should expect floods in small and mid-sized river encatchment areas . the german weather service has been under criticism for incorrect weather predictions since the 1999 storm " lothar , " which caused $ 6.4 billion worth of damage -lrb- 5 billion euros -rrb- across europe .
has the service become more careful about issuing warnings and how does that affect the current situation ? no , we have not changed our tactics or threshold levels .
with this low-pressure system , we could give a very early warning .
that is a result that was clearly forecast by weather prediction models a few days ago .
there are other weather situations , particularly in the summer , when this is simply impossible .
then you can not predict if a storm that appears to be local will spread and hit certain areas in the future or not . are weather phenomena like " lothar " and other " storms of the century " a sign of climate change ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the storm can alredy been seen in blackpool , england an individual event can not be connected to climate change .
in order to do that you need observations that span decades .
but the climate models predict that if these trends are confirmed and the increase in temperature continues , winters will have heavier precipitation .
this precipitation is connected to intense low-pressure situations .
one could expect that these weather conditions will appear more often in the winter . is the " kryill " low-pressure system nothing but hot air when compared to the hurricanes and typhoons that occur in other regions of the world ? tropical cyclones naturally have stronger winds than this kind of non-tropical , low-pressure system .
hurricane winds can reach a speed of up to 300 kph .
but what we are experiencing now is an unusual development that only occurs in central europe every few years . christoph j. heuer interviewed andreas friedrich -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de heavy storms batter northern europe winds gusting up to 130 kilometers an hour -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- lashed parts of europe thursday , sinking two irish trawlers and leaving seven fishermen missing , while causing widespread disruption to sea and air traffic .
-lrb- 12.01.2007 -rrb- 2006 : germany 's warmest year in more than a century cold , icy temperatures early in the year gave way to sweltering summer heat in 2006 .
it turned out to be germany 's warmest year since 1901 , according to a report from the german weather service .
-lrb- 29.12.2006 -rrb- report : global warming could devastate ski resorts after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies .

it 's about time , writes deutsche welle 's ralf bosen . that was some political poker in bavaria !
at the very last minute , the head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- literally hit the emergency brake in order to prevent further damage to the party . the unresolved leadership questions in stoiber 's party hurt voter support for both the csu and its sister partner , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
nevertheless , things may not turn out to be all that bad after all .
with günther beckstein as the new bavarian premier and erwin huber as new head of the csu , stoiber 's successors already have a large part of the party and the voters behind them . another advantage of this personnel decision is that the csu chair and the post of the premier will be divided among two individuals - a move that many party members have been advocating for a long time already .
for them , stoiber was too powerful in his double role . stoiber dug his own political grave the political damage stoiber caused in this role is sizeable .
now the csu has to put its money where its mouth is and support a new team of leaders . for the past few weeks , bavaria has been witness to an unusual political drama , full of schmooze and hypocrisy , with edmund stoiber in the starring role - not just as the the victim but also mainly as the villain . it hardly bothered him that bavaria suffered as a result of the power struggle and that he led the csu into one of its worst crises to date . but he 's responsible for getting himself into this situation in the first place . and in the end , he stumbled on account of one of his critics , a councilwoman in his own party . the gabriele pauli affair , which involved allegations that stoiber was aware his top aide was snooping in her private life , was just the latest trigger . his downfall began much earlier , in the fall of 2005 .
at that time he aspired - enthusiastically at first - to the post of a super-minister in the new federal government led by merkel , only to abruptly reject it once he was offered it . his flip-flopping annoyed all of his potential successors and hurt his credibility .
since then , discontent has been simmering behind the csu 's sanitized facade despite stoiber 's many successes in bavaria 's economy and education sector . stoiber was never the sovereign that the bavarians wanted him to be . instead , the bland bavarian premier was more interested in paperwork than in winning the hearts of the citizens . nevertheless , if stoiber had thrown in the towel before the csu convention this week in the town of wildbad kreuth , he would have come away from the affair with a liitle more dignity . political weariness once again citizens have had to observe incredulously just how easily politics can be defined by power struggles and personalities . and they have experienced yet another top politician who just ca n't let go of power .
those who wonder why germany is talking about political jadedness just need to look at bavaria . as for stoiber , he has been the bavarian premier for 14 years and the head of the csu for 8 years .
he was even the conservatives ' candidate for chancellor once . these are all accomplishments that wo n't count for much after his act of self-destruction so far removed from reality . ralf bosen is an expert on german politics at dw-radio -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian premier stoiber says he will step down following a major debate in his christian social union party over his leadership , bavarian premier edmund stoiber has announced that he will step down in september .

it 's about time , writes deutsche welle 's ralf bosen . that was some political poker in bavaria !
at the very last minute , the head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- literally hit the emergency brake in order to prevent further damage to the party . the unresolved leadership questions in stoiber 's party hurt voter support for both the csu and its sister partner , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
nevertheless , things may not turn out to be all that bad after all .
with günther beckstein as the new bavarian premier and erwin huber as new head of the csu , stoiber 's successors already have a large part of the party and the voters behind them . another advantage of this personnel decision is that the csu chair and the post of the premier will be divided among two individuals - a move that many party members have been advocating for a long time already .
for them , stoiber was too powerful in his double role . stoiber dug his own political grave the political damage stoiber caused in this role is sizeable .
now the csu has to put its money where its mouth is and support a new team of leaders . for the past few weeks , bavaria has been witness to an unusual political drama , full of schmooze and hypocrisy , with edmund stoiber in the starring role - not just as the the victim but also mainly as the villain . it hardly bothered him that bavaria suffered as a result of the power struggle and that he led the csu into one of its worst crises to date . but he 's responsible for getting himself into this situation in the first place . and in the end , he stumbled on account of one of his critics , a councilwoman in his own party . the gabriele pauli affair , which involved allegations that stoiber was aware his top aide was snooping in her private life , was just the latest trigger . his downfall began much earlier , in the fall of 2005 .
at that time he aspired - enthusiastically at first - to the post of a super-minister in the new federal government led by merkel , only to abruptly reject it once he was offered it . his flip-flopping annoyed all of his potential successors and hurt his credibility .
since then , discontent has been simmering behind the csu 's sanitized facade despite stoiber 's many successes in bavaria 's economy and education sector . stoiber was never the sovereign that the bavarians wanted him to be . instead , the bland bavarian premier was more interested in paperwork than in winning the hearts of the citizens . nevertheless , if stoiber had thrown in the towel before the csu convention this week in the town of wildbad kreuth , he would have come away from the affair with a liitle more dignity . political weariness once again citizens have had to observe incredulously just how easily politics can be defined by power struggles and personalities . and they have experienced yet another top politician who just ca n't let go of power .
those who wonder why germany is talking about political jadedness just need to look at bavaria . as for stoiber , he has been the bavarian premier for 14 years and the head of the csu for 8 years .

" ' they tortured us with cold in solitary confinement or airlessness often to the point where i fell unconscious , " the now 24-year-old kurnaz told a german parliamentary committee investigating his case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz has made some serious accusations " sometimes , for example we would be punished with a month of cold or the air conditioners would be turned completely off for several weeks . " unhygienic conditions , sleep deprivation and lack of food were also common , he added . " they would hit you , tie you up and then leave you laying there for about 12 hours , " kurnaz said , describing a punishment for talking between prisoners . former government complicit ? on thursday , deputies from opposition parties and the conservative bloc of chancellor angela merkel serving on the parliamentary committee investigating the case demanded to know why former chancellor schröder 's government apparently failed to take action on murat kurnaz 's behalf . kurnaz , who was taken prisoner in pakistan in 2001 , was handed over to american troops and held as an enemy combatant until august 2006 .
he has also testified that he was abused by german intelligence agents while being held in guantanamo in 2002 . shown pictures of three men , bremen-born kurnaz was able to identify one of the germans who allegedly interrogated him in cuba and said it was " highly likely " he had seen a second and was unsure about the identity of the third . kurnaz ' lawyer bernhard docke , who also spoke in front of the parliamentary committee thursday , said the former coalition of social democrats and greens was complicit in the crime committed against kurnaz because it did not work to free him from american custody . " if kurnaz was german , he would have been freed in autumn 2002 , " docke said , adding that at the beginning of 2002 , former foreign minster joschka fischer told kurnaz ' mother germany could not help her son because of his turkish citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another committee is looking into whether german special forces interrogated kurnaz siegfried kauder , head of the parliamentary investigation into the matter , said the way kurnaz was treated in guantanamo was " unfathomable " and added that the committee would continue looking into whether such an offer was actually made . members of the then-governing coalition of social democrats and greens , however , said fischer , a green party member , did try to make the case for kurnaz ' release to then us secretary of state colin powell . two ongoing investigations docke said there was no reason for germany to refuse an alleged american offer to release kurnaz into german custody in 2002 as german and us officials were at that time aware he did not pose a terror threat . wolfgang neskovic , a committee member from the opposition left party , said if the government turned down a us release offer it would have been a " deeply inhumane decision that should have criminal , not just political consequences .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 18.01.2007 weather expert predicts more storms in coming winters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the storm already flipped trailer trucks in northern parts of germany as a severe storm lashed northwestern europe and gathered pace in germany , a weather expert talked to dw-world.de about the causes behind the inclement climate . andreas friedrich is a member of the german weather service 's prediction department . dw-world.de : the extreme low-pressure system " kryill " will reach germany 's north sea coast thursday afternoon .
what do you expect the consequences will be in the country ? andreas friedrich : we expect there will be winds that reach storm levels across the entire country , which is something that sets this low-pressure system apart .
" storm level " means wind strength 11 , which is over 100 kilometer per hour -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- .
they are expected across germany this afternoon -lrb- thursday -rrb- , when the first storm warnings go into effect .
in some areas , especially in the mountains , they will reach speeds much faster than hurricane strength . do you expect heavy precipitation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites have tracked " kryill " for days yes , that is the second element that stormy weather can take on .
there will be heavy rainfall , especially in the low mountain ranges and the west , where as much as 40 liters per square meter -lrb- about 10 gallons per 10 square feet -rrb- could fall within 24 hours .
that would be enough to cross the storm threshold so that people should expect floods in small and mid-sized river encatchment areas . the german weather service has been under criticism for incorrect weather predictions since the 1999 storm " lothar , " which caused $ 6.4 billion worth of damage -lrb- 5 billion euros -rrb- across europe .
has the service become more careful about issuing warnings and how does that affect the current situation ? no , we have not changed our tactics or threshold levels .
with this low-pressure system , we could give a very early warning .
that is a result that was clearly forecast by weather prediction models a few days ago .
there are other weather situations , particularly in the summer , when this is simply impossible .
then you can not predict if a storm that appears to be local will spread and hit certain areas in the future or not . are weather phenomena like " lothar " and other " storms of the century " a sign of climate change ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the storm can alredy been seen in blackpool , england an individual event can not be connected to climate change .
in order to do that you need observations that span decades .
but the climate models predict that if these trends are confirmed and the increase in temperature continues , winters will have heavier precipitation .
this precipitation is connected to intense low-pressure situations .
one could expect that these weather conditions will appear more often in the winter . is the " kryill " low-pressure system nothing but hot air when compared to the hurricanes and typhoons that occur in other regions of the world ? tropical cyclones naturally have stronger winds than this kind of non-tropical , low-pressure system .
hurricane winds can reach a speed of up to 300 kph .
but what we are experiencing now is an unusual development that only occurs in central europe every few years . christoph j. heuer interviewed andreas friedrich -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de heavy storms batter northern europe winds gusting up to 130 kilometers an hour -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- lashed parts of europe thursday , sinking two irish trawlers and leaving seven fishermen missing , while causing widespread disruption to sea and air traffic .
-lrb- 12.01.2007 -rrb- 2006 : germany 's warmest year in more than a century cold , icy temperatures early in the year gave way to sweltering summer heat in 2006 .
it turned out to be germany 's warmest year since 1901 , according to a report from the german weather service .
-lrb- 29.12.2006 -rrb- report : global warming could devastate ski resorts after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies .

what do you expect the consequences will be in the country ? andreas friedrich : we expect there will be winds that reach storm levels across the entire country , which is something that sets this low-pressure system apart .
" storm level " means wind strength 11 , which is over 100 kilometer per hour -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- .
they are expected across germany this afternoon -lrb- thursday -rrb- , when the first storm warnings go into effect .
in some areas , especially in the mountains , they will reach speeds much faster than hurricane strength . do you expect heavy precipitation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites have tracked " kryill " for days yes , that is the second element that stormy weather can take on .
there will be heavy rainfall , especially in the low mountain ranges and the west , where as much as 40 liters per square meter -lrb- about 10 gallons per 10 square feet -rrb- could fall within 24 hours .
that would be enough to cross the storm threshold so that people should expect floods in small and mid-sized river encatchment areas . the german weather service has been under criticism for incorrect weather predictions since the 1999 storm " lothar , " which caused $ 6.4 billion worth of damage -lrb- 5 billion euros -rrb- across europe .
has the service become more careful about issuing warnings and how does that affect the current situation ? no , we have not changed our tactics or threshold levels .
with this low-pressure system , we could give a very early warning .
that is a result that was clearly forecast by weather prediction models a few days ago .
there are other weather situations , particularly in the summer , when this is simply impossible .
then you can not predict if a storm that appears to be local will spread and hit certain areas in the future or not . are weather phenomena like " lothar " and other " storms of the century " a sign of climate change ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the storm can alredy been seen in blackpool , england an individual event can not be connected to climate change .
in order to do that you need observations that span decades .
but the climate models predict that if these trends are confirmed and the increase in temperature continues , winters will have heavier precipitation .
this precipitation is connected to intense low-pressure situations .
one could expect that these weather conditions will appear more often in the winter . is the " kryill " low-pressure system nothing but hot air when compared to the hurricanes and typhoons that occur in other regions of the world ? tropical cyclones naturally have stronger winds than this kind of non-tropical , low-pressure system .
hurricane winds can reach a speed of up to 300 kph .
but what we are experiencing now is an unusual development that only occurs in central europe every few years . christoph j. heuer interviewed andreas friedrich -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de heavy storms batter northern europe winds gusting up to 130 kilometers an hour -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- lashed parts of europe thursday , sinking two irish trawlers and leaving seven fishermen missing , while causing widespread disruption to sea and air traffic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.01.2007 opinion : stoiber finally hits the emergency brakes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : following stormy debate in his christian social union party over his leadership , embattled bavarian premier stoiber has announced he will step down in september .
it 's about time , writes deutsche welle 's ralf bosen . that was some political poker in bavaria !
at the very last minute , the head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- literally hit the emergency brake in order to prevent further damage to the party . the unresolved leadership questions in stoiber 's party hurt voter support for both the csu and its sister partner , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
nevertheless , things may not turn out to be all that bad after all .
with günther beckstein as the new bavarian premier and erwin huber as new head of the csu , stoiber 's successors already have a large part of the party and the voters behind them . another advantage of this personnel decision is that the csu chair and the post of the premier will be divided among two individuals - a move that many party members have been advocating for a long time already .
for them , stoiber was too powerful in his double role . stoiber dug his own political grave the political damage stoiber caused in this role is sizeable .
now the csu has to put its money where its mouth is and support a new team of leaders . for the past few weeks , bavaria has been witness to an unusual political drama , full of schmooze and hypocrisy , with edmund stoiber in the starring role - not just as the the victim but also mainly as the villain . it hardly bothered him that bavaria suffered as a result of the power struggle and that he led the csu into one of its worst crises to date . but he 's responsible for getting himself into this situation in the first place . and in the end , he stumbled on account of one of his critics , a councilwoman in his own party . the gabriele pauli affair , which involved allegations that stoiber was aware his top aide was snooping in her private life , was just the latest trigger . his downfall began much earlier , in the fall of 2005 .
at that time he aspired - enthusiastically at first - to the post of a super-minister in the new federal government led by merkel , only to abruptly reject it once he was offered it . his flip-flopping annoyed all of his potential successors and hurt his credibility .
since then , discontent has been simmering behind the csu 's sanitized facade despite stoiber 's many successes in bavaria 's economy and education sector . stoiber was never the sovereign that the bavarians wanted him to be . instead , the bland bavarian premier was more interested in paperwork than in winning the hearts of the citizens . nevertheless , if stoiber had thrown in the towel before the csu convention this week in the town of wildbad kreuth , he would have come away from the affair with a liitle more dignity . political weariness once again citizens have had to observe incredulously just how easily politics can be defined by power struggles and personalities . and they have experienced yet another top politician who just ca n't let go of power .
those who wonder why germany is talking about political jadedness just need to look at bavaria . as for stoiber , he has been the bavarian premier for 14 years and the head of the csu for 8 years .
he was even the conservatives ' candidate for chancellor once . these are all accomplishments that wo n't count for much after his act of self-destruction so far removed from reality . ralf bosen is an expert on german politics at dw-radio -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian premier stoiber says he will step down following a major debate in his christian social union party over his leadership , bavarian premier edmund stoiber has announced that he will step down in september .
-lrb- 18.01.2007 -rrb- top german politician facing pressure to resign as state premier the chair of long-time german powerbroker edmund stoiber is wobbling .
pressure is growing on the conservative bavarian premier to step down and the repercussions could be felt in the german capital as well .
-lrb- 16.01.2007 -rrb- conservative snooping scandal gains traction edmund stoiber , a powerful leader in angela merkel 's conservative camp accepted his chief of staff 's resignation friday after charges the aide snooped on a critic 's private life .
stoiber denies he knew of the snooping .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 18.01.2007 weather expert predicts more storms in coming winters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the storm already flipped trailer trucks in northern parts of germany as a severe storm lashed northwestern europe and gathered pace in germany , a weather expert talked to dw-world.de about the causes behind the inclement climate . andreas friedrich is a member of the german weather service 's prediction department . dw-world.de : the extreme low-pressure system " kryill " will reach germany 's north sea coast thursday afternoon .
what do you expect the consequences will be in the country ? andreas friedrich : we expect there will be winds that reach storm levels across the entire country , which is something that sets this low-pressure system apart .
" storm level " means wind strength 11 , which is over 100 kilometer per hour -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- .
they are expected across germany this afternoon -lrb- thursday -rrb- , when the first storm warnings go into effect .
in some areas , especially in the mountains , they will reach speeds much faster than hurricane strength . do you expect heavy precipitation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellites have tracked " kryill " for days yes , that is the second element that stormy weather can take on .
there will be heavy rainfall , especially in the low mountain ranges and the west , where as much as 40 liters per square meter -lrb- about 10 gallons per 10 square feet -rrb- could fall within 24 hours .
that would be enough to cross the storm threshold so that people should expect floods in small and mid-sized river encatchment areas . the german weather service has been under criticism for incorrect weather predictions since the 1999 storm " lothar , " which caused $ 6.4 billion worth of damage -lrb- 5 billion euros -rrb- across europe .
has the service become more careful about issuing warnings and how does that affect the current situation ? no , we have not changed our tactics or threshold levels .
with this low-pressure system , we could give a very early warning .
that is a result that was clearly forecast by weather prediction models a few days ago .
there are other weather situations , particularly in the summer , when this is simply impossible .
then you can not predict if a storm that appears to be local will spread and hit certain areas in the future or not . are weather phenomena like " lothar " and other " storms of the century " a sign of climate change ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the storm can alredy been seen in blackpool , england an individual event can not be connected to climate change .
in order to do that you need observations that span decades .
but the climate models predict that if these trends are confirmed and the increase in temperature continues , winters will have heavier precipitation .
this precipitation is connected to intense low-pressure situations .
one could expect that these weather conditions will appear more often in the winter . is the " kryill " low-pressure system nothing but hot air when compared to the hurricanes and typhoons that occur in other regions of the world ? tropical cyclones naturally have stronger winds than this kind of non-tropical , low-pressure system .
hurricane winds can reach a speed of up to 300 kph .
but what we are experiencing now is an unusual development that only occurs in central europe every few years . christoph j. heuer interviewed andreas friedrich -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de heavy storms batter northern europe winds gusting up to 130 kilometers an hour -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- lashed parts of europe thursday , sinking two irish trawlers and leaving seven fishermen missing , while causing widespread disruption to sea and air traffic .
-lrb- 12.01.2007 -rrb- 2006 : germany 's warmest year in more than a century cold , icy temperatures early in the year gave way to sweltering summer heat in 2006 .
it turned out to be germany 's warmest year since 1901 , according to a report from the german weather service .
-lrb- 29.12.2006 -rrb- report : global warming could devastate ski resorts after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies .

it 's about time , writes deutsche welle 's ralf bosen . that was some political poker in bavaria !
at the very last minute , the head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- literally hit the emergency brake in order to prevent further damage to the party . the unresolved leadership questions in stoiber 's party hurt voter support for both the csu and its sister partner , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
nevertheless , things may not turn out to be all that bad after all .
with günther beckstein as the new bavarian premier and erwin huber as new head of the csu , stoiber 's successors already have a large part of the party and the voters behind them . another advantage of this personnel decision is that the csu chair and the post of the premier will be divided among two individuals - a move that many party members have been advocating for a long time already .
for them , stoiber was too powerful in his double role . stoiber dug his own political grave the political damage stoiber caused in this role is sizeable .
now the csu has to put its money where its mouth is and support a new team of leaders . for the past few weeks , bavaria has been witness to an unusual political drama , full of schmooze and hypocrisy , with edmund stoiber in the starring role - not just as the the victim but also mainly as the villain . it hardly bothered him that bavaria suffered as a result of the power struggle and that he led the csu into one of its worst crises to date . but he 's responsible for getting himself into this situation in the first place . and in the end , he stumbled on account of one of his critics , a councilwoman in his own party . the gabriele pauli affair , which involved allegations that stoiber was aware his top aide was snooping in her private life , was just the latest trigger . his downfall began much earlier , in the fall of 2005 .
at that time he aspired - enthusiastically at first - to the post of a super-minister in the new federal government led by merkel , only to abruptly reject it once he was offered it . his flip-flopping annoyed all of his potential successors and hurt his credibility .
since then , discontent has been simmering behind the csu 's sanitized facade despite stoiber 's many successes in bavaria 's economy and education sector . stoiber was never the sovereign that the bavarians wanted him to be . instead , the bland bavarian premier was more interested in paperwork than in winning the hearts of the citizens . nevertheless , if stoiber had thrown in the towel before the csu convention this week in the town of wildbad kreuth , he would have come away from the affair with a liitle more dignity . political weariness once again citizens have had to observe incredulously just how easily politics can be defined by power struggles and personalities . and they have experienced yet another top politician who just ca n't let go of power .
those who wonder why germany is talking about political jadedness just need to look at bavaria . as for stoiber , he has been the bavarian premier for 14 years and the head of the csu for 8 years .
he was even the conservatives ' candidate for chancellor once . these are all accomplishments that wo n't count for much after his act of self-destruction so far removed from reality . ralf bosen is an expert on german politics at dw-radio -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian premier stoiber says he will step down following a major debate in his christian social union party over his leadership , bavarian premier edmund stoiber has announced that he will step down in september .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.01.2007 opinion : stoiber finally hits the emergency brakes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : following stormy debate in his christian social union party over his leadership , embattled bavarian premier stoiber has announced he will step down in september .
it 's about time , writes deutsche welle 's ralf bosen . that was some political poker in bavaria !
at the very last minute , the head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- literally hit the emergency brake in order to prevent further damage to the party . the unresolved leadership questions in stoiber 's party hurt voter support for both the csu and its sister partner , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
nevertheless , things may not turn out to be all that bad after all .
with günther beckstein as the new bavarian premier and erwin huber as new head of the csu , stoiber 's successors already have a large part of the party and the voters behind them . another advantage of this personnel decision is that the csu chair and the post of the premier will be divided among two individuals - a move that many party members have been advocating for a long time already .
for them , stoiber was too powerful in his double role . stoiber dug his own political grave the political damage stoiber caused in this role is sizeable .
now the csu has to put its money where its mouth is and support a new team of leaders . for the past few weeks , bavaria has been witness to an unusual political drama , full of schmooze and hypocrisy , with edmund stoiber in the starring role - not just as the the victim but also mainly as the villain . it hardly bothered him that bavaria suffered as a result of the power struggle and that he led the csu into one of its worst crises to date . but he 's responsible for getting himself into this situation in the first place . and in the end , he stumbled on account of one of his critics , a councilwoman in his own party . the gabriele pauli affair , which involved allegations that stoiber was aware his top aide was snooping in her private life , was just the latest trigger . his downfall began much earlier , in the fall of 2005 .
at that time he aspired - enthusiastically at first - to the post of a super-minister in the new federal government led by merkel , only to abruptly reject it once he was offered it . his flip-flopping annoyed all of his potential successors and hurt his credibility .
since then , discontent has been simmering behind the csu 's sanitized facade despite stoiber 's many successes in bavaria 's economy and education sector . stoiber was never the sovereign that the bavarians wanted him to be . instead , the bland bavarian premier was more interested in paperwork than in winning the hearts of the citizens . nevertheless , if stoiber had thrown in the towel before the csu convention this week in the town of wildbad kreuth , he would have come away from the affair with a liitle more dignity . political weariness once again citizens have had to observe incredulously just how easily politics can be defined by power struggles and personalities . and they have experienced yet another top politician who just ca n't let go of power .
those who wonder why germany is talking about political jadedness just need to look at bavaria . as for stoiber , he has been the bavarian premier for 14 years and the head of the csu for 8 years .
he was even the conservatives ' candidate for chancellor once . these are all accomplishments that wo n't count for much after his act of self-destruction so far removed from reality . ralf bosen is an expert on german politics at dw-radio -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian premier stoiber says he will step down following a major debate in his christian social union party over his leadership , bavarian premier edmund stoiber has announced that he will step down in september .
-lrb- 18.01.2007 -rrb- top german politician facing pressure to resign as state premier the chair of long-time german powerbroker edmund stoiber is wobbling .
pressure is growing on the conservative bavarian premier to step down and the repercussions could be felt in the german capital as well .
-lrb- 16.01.2007 -rrb- conservative snooping scandal gains traction edmund stoiber , a powerful leader in angela merkel 's conservative camp accepted his chief of staff 's resignation friday after charges the aide snooped on a critic 's private life .
stoiber denies he knew of the snooping .

thousands of litres of water escaped on wednesday along 1.5 miles of the monmouthshire and brecon canal near the village of llangynidr near brecon .
british waterways said its engineers were investigating what caused the culvert to collapse , and were also assessing the scale of the damage .
officials said no canal boats were affected by the problem .
british waterways said it had put up waterside notices to inform boaters about the closure , and was also contacting canal-side businesses .
a spokeswoman said : " british waterways , which cares for the canal , was notified during the morning of 17 january that a culvert beneath the bed of the waterway had collapsed , allowing water to escape from the canal channel and run into the adjacent river usk . "
she added that the canal and its tow path was closed between bridge 122 , two miles west of llangattock , and bridge 129 , near the village of llangynidr .
the stretch of waterway re-opened for the first time in 60 years following a three-year restoration project in 2005 .
a small army of volunteers , many from across europe , helped return it to a working canal route .

thousands of litres of water escaped on wednesday along 1.5 miles of the monmouthshire and brecon canal near the village of llangynidr near brecon .
british waterways said its engineers were investigating what caused the culvert to collapse , and were also assessing the scale of the damage .
officials said no canal boats were affected by the problem .
british waterways said it had put up waterside notices to inform boaters about the closure , and was also contacting canal-side businesses .
a spokeswoman said : " british waterways , which cares for the canal , was notified during the morning of 17 january that a culvert beneath the bed of the waterway had collapsed , allowing water to escape from the canal channel and run into the adjacent river usk . "
a three-year restoration project ended in 2005 she added that the canal and its tow path was closed between bridge 122 , two miles west of llangattock , and bridge 129 , near the village of llangynidr .
the stretch of waterway re-opened for the first time in 60 years following a three-year restoration project in 2005 .
a small army of volunteers , many from across europe , helped return it to a working canal route .

by neil smith entertainment reporter , bbc news the 2007 sundance film festival begins this week .
but is robert redford 's annual showcase of independent cinema the force it once was ?
for the movie industry 's movers and shakers , there is only one place to be come the third week of january .
that place is park city , the small utah resort that plays host each year to the largest independent film festival in the us .
beginning thursday , for 10 days the city 's streets swarm with distributors , critics and movie fans hoping to find the next reservoir dogs or blair witch project .
in recent years , however , the festival 's stated aim of nurturing fresh talent has faced unwelcome competition from stars , studios and corporate brands keen to exploit the event for their own ends .
in 2006 a visit by heiress paris hilton generated more media interest than most of the competition entries put together .
redford himself , meanwhile , has been accused of letting the event 's independent vision be hijacked by studio representatives and big business interests .
" once the festival achieved a certain level of notoriety , people began to come here with agendas that were not the same as ours , " the actor conceded last year .
" sometimes it blurred what we are doing . "
but the actor and director insisted the festival 's focus remained " artists who embody the independent spirit " .
controversial in its earlier incarnation as the utah / us film festival , sundance struggled to find an identity or break even .
indeed , it was only after the event came under the domain of redford 's sundance institute in 1985 that it began to make its mark .
by cultivating young talent and original , often controversial films , the event consciously set itself apart from its larger , more established rivals .
yet with visitors now close to 40,000 each year , sundance can no longer claim to be the brash young upstart on the film festival calendar .
moreover , while it can hardly rival the glamour - or indeed weather - of cannes or venice , it has no trouble attracting a similar calibre of celebrities .
this year 's programme features films directed by antonio banderas , steve buscemi and sir anthony hopkins .
and audiences lucky enough to secure the highly sought-after tickets can sample movies starring such hollywood staples as michael douglas , gwyneth paltrow and samuel l jackson .
such has been the demand for tickets that organisers have had to take steps to prevent them being resold on auction website ebay .
' balancing act ' it is fair to say , however , that few of this decade 's sundance titles have gone on to enjoy the sort of global success experienced by their 1990s counterparts .
" it has n't had so many big-name break-out hits recently , " agrees journalist james mottram , whose book the sundance kids charts the careers of some of the film-makers who got their first break in park city .
" there is a tremendous pressure to find those hits , and you do n't get them every year .
" but that does n't mean they 're not trying to unearth new talent all the time . "
mr mottram agrees that corporate branding is now integral to the event but regards it as a necessary evil .
" in order to survive in the current marketplace it has to bring in sponsors , " he told the bbc news website .
" it 's a very difficult balancing act they have to pull off . "
before people dismiss sundance as a spent force , however , he suggests they consider the golden globe-nominated comedy little miss sunshine .
it was the hugely positive response to its sundance screenings last year , says mr mottram , that persuaded fox searchlight to pay $ 10m -lrb- £ 5.1m -rrb- for its distribution rights - one of the biggest deals in the festival 's history .
with its worldwide box office takings currently standing at more than $ 86.5m -lrb- £ 44.1m -rrb- , it sounds like a bargain .

the report from the pew internet and american life project also found that more people are contributing to political debate via their own blogs .
while it stops short of claiming the net has politicised americans , the report sees a growing online influence on how people think about civic issues .
the prevalence of broadband in us homes is one reason for the growth .
nearly half of us homes now have a broadband connection and the internet is playing an increasing role in daily lives .
" turbo-charged " activism " broadband is now part of the rhythm of people 's lives , including the civic rhythm , " said report author lee rainie .
some 15 % of americans said that the internet was the place they got most of their news during the mid-term election campaign , up from 7 % for the last mid-term election .
" people see the internet as providing more information than other news channels .
it offers a variety of perspectives , " said mr rainie .
increasingly americans are turning to international online news sources to get a perspective on how domestic political life is played out on the wider stage .
" the bbc news website is among the most popular , " said mr rainie .
the survey could find no direct evidence that the internet is drawing previously uninvolved people into the political debate but it did find that the internet has allowed activists to become " turbo-charged " .
" the vanguard of youtubers and bloggers has become influential in politics .
those who wish to engage voters around a particular issue or candidate have many more tools at their disposal , " said mr rainie .
it is not just citizens who are finding the net a useful tool in untangling thorny political issues , politicians themselves are keen to embrace new technology .
barack obama , a popular us senator , chose to announce himself in the race to be the next democrat president via a video on his website last week .

a licence currently costs £ 131.50 per household each year in the uk and according to the museum of broadcast communications in chicago , half of countries in africa and asia also fund public broadcasting in this way .
as the uk government sets the level of the bbc 's licence fee , here is how it compares with other countries around the world .
ireland the republic of ireland operates a similar system to that of the uk , with a tv licence costing 158 euros -lrb- £ 106 -rrb- per year .
people who do not purchase a licence can be prosecuted and fined more than 1000 euros -lrb- £ 670 -rrb- .
the total sum generated is given to rte but is only sufficient to cover half of the cost of providing its television , radio and online services .
country profile : republic of ireland so , the broadcaster is allowed to seek the other half of its budget as income from advertisers .
almost half of the revenue is spent on mainstream tv network rte one .
but there are areas of the company 's business which do not receive any public funding , most notably its commercial music radio station , rte 2fm .
the netherlands the licence fee itself was abolished in the netherlands in 2000 because it was costing too much money - about 27m -lrb- £ 18m -rrb- euros that year - to collect .
now , people pay for public tv and radio " indirectly " through their income tax .
broadcasters receive about 500m -lrb- £ 335m -rrb- euros in this way each year , a spokesman for the dutch culture department confirmed .
however , broadcasters also generate revenue from advertising , and are allowed to transmit commercials between programmes .
country profile : the netherlands in addition to public television , the netherlands has one of the highest penetrations of cable services in the world , with about 95 % of all households connected to a cable provider .
subscribers pay an additional fee , usually between seven and 14 euros -lrb- £ 4.70 to £ 9.40 -rrb- per month , for the extra channels offered to them .
the range of services varies from region to region , with channel line-ups agreed by committees in about 60 different areas of the country .
pakistan the law was changed in pakistan three years ago to enable a licence fee to be collected through utility bills .
approximately 14m households each pay rs300 -lrb- £ 2.50 -rrb- per year , taken in monthly instalments by their electricity provider .
country profile : pakistan the money funds the pakistan television corporation -lrb- known as ptv -rrb- , and is taken regardless of whether a homeowner actually possesses a tv .
ptv 's national channels offer entertainment , news and films , and it has regional output in different languages .
the tactic of using electricity bills to collect licence fees is also employed in other countries , including greece , macedonia and mauritius .
ghana the tv licence in ghana costs 3,000 cedis -lrb- 17p -rrb- per year in a country where there are about five times as many radios as television sets .
and while about 14m people have access to radio broadcasts , the potential tv audience only reaches approximately 11m , figures from the ghana broadcasting corporation -lrb- gbc -rrb- suggest .
country profile : ghana " although it is called a tv licence , the money goes to the state broadcaster and it covers radio as well , " yaw owusu addo , the acting director-general , told the bbc news website .
the company operates 11 radio stations , two shortwave radio networks and one tv channel .
japan a " receiving fee " is collected from every home in japan with a tv set to guarantee " the financial independence " of public broadcaster nhk .
there are various payment schemes , with discounts to those who pay the annual amount in full in advance , or who sign up through direct debits to their bank account or credit cards .
country profile : japan but viewers with terrestrial channels pay between y14,910 -lrb- £ 64.27 -rrb- and y16,740 -lrb- £ 72.16 -rrb- per year .
and there is an additional fee for anybody owning a satellite dish , increasing the total for those households to between y25,520 -lrb- £ 110 -rrb- and y28,080 -lrb- £ 121 -rrb- .
a rise in the number of people refusing to pay the licence fee in japan in recent years has been attributed to decreasing public confidence in nhk following a series of corporate scandals .

almost half of the revenue is spent on mainstream tv network rte one .
but there are areas of the company 's business which do not receive any public funding , most notably its commercial music radio station , rte 2fm .

now , people pay for public tv and radio " indirectly " through their income tax .
broadcasters receive about 500m -lrb- £ 335m -rrb- euros in this way each year , a spokesman for the dutch culture department confirmed .

bbc arabic.com asked four somalis about conditions in the city , how they viewed ethiopian intervention in their country , and their hopes for the future .
safia , mogadishu , researcher " life is harsh here because of recent events ; and it 's been made worse by ethiopian interference .
prices are rocketing , unemployment is rising and chaos prevails .
we feel afraid because there is a rampant lack of security .
we see more assassinations and we hear more bombings ; shops especially are being targeted .
the government has stepped up its campaign to restrict our freedom of expression .
i think they want to prevent the outside world knowing what has happened in somalia .
of course there were big disagreements before -lsb- under the rule of the union of islamic courts -rsb- , but at least that came within the context of freedom of expression .
it is really terrifying here .
everyone believes ethiopia is only after its own interests in somalia .
i do n't see any popular support for the new government .
with the worsening security and economic situation , khat -lsb- a mild stimulant -rsb- is once again openly on sale in the markets .
i think the ethiopian forces should withdraw and new negotiations should be launched between the disputing parties .
if not , the government and the ethiopian forces will suffer heavily , as the resistance is growing day by day .
members of the government are afraid for their lives .
they are aware that they are not popular .
they should pack up and leave .
it is in everyone 's best interests . "
mahmoud abdullah , mogadishu , charity chairman " i hope ethiopia 's interference will help solve our problems - even though no-one here wants or accepts ethiopia 's involvement .
the ethiopian forces should focus on helping the transitional government build infrastructure , achieve peace and generally create a state .
the islamic courts radically changed things in somalia .
there was safety , peace and commerce .
in other words , they brought mogadishu back to life .
however , the islamic courts did not really create a state or its institutions .
they created a tribal regime instead .
the ethiopian presence is a reality we just have to accept .
what really matters is that we get peace and security .
the islamic courts should be allowed to return only as part of the institutions of a new government , and not on the basis of the tribal regime they adopted before they collapsed .
i think life will go on , and the somalis will manage .
we have survived more than 15 years of worse conditions than this . "
mustafa el-somali , sudan , student it is a very precarious situation there in mogadishu .
humanitarian conditions are getting worse , as somalis suffer from ethiopian interference and american bombings .
violence breaks out and we do n't know when it will finish .
i think the dispute between the somali government and the islamic courts is ideological , not based on power-sharing ambitions .
foreign interference is not new in somalia .
it 's been there for a while .
the road to peace in somalia should start by ending ethiopian , us and kenyan interference in somali affairs .
somalis should take power .
the arab league and european union should be the ones who help the reconciliation effort .
zakiya abdullah , mogadishu , student " when the islamic courts were in charge , we had peace .
i could go and visit people easily , and move around without being afraid .
it 's true they banned cinemas , but people did n't complain about that .
there are no such restrictions on cinemas now .
however , we need to wait and see what the new interim government and ethiopian forces will do .
i do n't mind foreign intervention if it improves the situation here .
otherwise , the intervention should stop .
life is difficult , but not as bad as it was before .
we do have a problem with freedom of movement .
i hope this improves . "

bbc arabic.com asked four somalis about conditions in the city , how they viewed ethiopian intervention in their country , and their hopes for the future .
safia , mogadishu , researcher life is harsh here because of recent events ; and it 's been made worse by ethiopian interference .
prices are rocketing , unemployment is rising and chaos prevails .
we feel afraid because there is a rampant lack of security .
we see more assassinations and we hear more bombings ; shops especially are being targeted .
the government has stepped up its campaign to restrict our freedom of expression .
i think they want to prevent the outside world knowing what has happened in somalia .

mahmoud abdullah , mogadishu , charity chairman i hope ethiopia 's interference will help solve our problems - even though no-one here wants or accepts ethiopia 's involvement .
the ethiopian forces should focus on helping the transitional government build infrastructure , achieve peace and generally create a state .
the islamic courts radically changed things in somalia .
there was safety , peace and commerce .
in other words , they brought mogadishu back to life .

bbc arabic.com asked four somalis about conditions in the city , how they viewed ethiopian intervention in their country , and their hopes for the future .
safia , mogadishu , researcher life is harsh here because of recent events ; and it 's been made worse by ethiopian interference .
prices are rocketing , unemployment is rising and chaos prevails .
we feel afraid because there is a rampant lack of security .
we see more assassinations and we hear more bombings ; shops especially are being targeted .
the government has stepped up its campaign to restrict our freedom of expression .
i think they want to prevent the outside world knowing what has happened in somalia .
of course there were big disagreements before -lsb- under the rule of the union of islamic courts -rsb- , but at least that came within the context of freedom of expression .
it is really terrifying here .
everyone believes ethiopia is only after its own interests in somalia .
i do n't see any popular support for the new government .
with the worsening security and economic situation , khat -lsb- a mild stimulant -rsb- is once again openly on sale in the markets .
i think the ethiopian forces should withdraw and new negotiations should be launched between the disputing parties .
if not , the government and the ethiopian forces will suffer heavily , as the resistance is growing day by day .
members of the government are afraid for their lives .
they are aware that they are not popular .
they should pack up and leave .
it is in everyone 's best interests .
mahmoud abdullah , mogadishu , charity chairman i hope ethiopia 's interference will help solve our problems - even though no-one here wants or accepts ethiopia 's involvement .
the ethiopian forces should focus on helping the transitional government build infrastructure , achieve peace and generally create a state .
the islamic courts radically changed things in somalia .
there was safety , peace and commerce .
in other words , they brought mogadishu back to life .
however , the islamic courts did not really create a state or its institutions .
they created a tribal regime instead .
the ethiopian presence is a reality we just have to accept .
what really matters is that we get peace and security .
the islamic courts should be allowed to return only as part of the institutions of a new government , and not on the basis of the tribal regime they adopted before they collapsed .
i think life will go on , and the somalis will manage .
we have survived more than 15 years of worse conditions than this .
mustafa el-somali , sudan , student it is a very precarious situation there in mogadishu .
humanitarian conditions are getting worse , as somalis suffer from ethiopian interference and american bombings .
violence breaks out and we do n't know when it will finish .
i think the dispute between the somali government and the islamic courts is ideological , not based on power-sharing ambitions .
foreign interference is not new in somalia .
it 's been there for a while .
the road to peace in somalia should start by ending ethiopian , us and kenyan interference in somali affairs .
somalis should take power .
the arab league and european union should be the ones who help the reconciliation effort .
zakiya abdullah , mogadishu , student when the islamic courts were in charge , we had peace .
i could go and visit people easily , and move around without being afraid .
it 's true they banned cinemas , but people did n't complain about that .
there are no such restrictions on cinemas now .
however , we need to wait and see what the new interim government and ethiopian forces will do .
i do n't mind foreign intervention if it improves the situation here .
otherwise , the intervention should stop .
life is difficult , but not as bad as it was before .
we do have a problem with freedom of movement .
i hope this improves .
