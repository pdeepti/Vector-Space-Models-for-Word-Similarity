" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the latest kosovo resolution of the serbian parliament will complicate its relations with the eu in her article , which was both a look back at 2007 and a view to the upcoming new year , the chancellor stressed europe 's role in helping to decide the fate of the serbian breakaway province of kosovo . " europe has a responsibility to find a solution , " she wrote .
" the solution must offer clarity for the entire region and provide the opportunity for stability and security , thereby creating the foundation for a positive future . " she cautioned against further hesitation by the european union , noting that all past attempts at resolving negotiations between serbia and kosovo 's albanian majority had failed . both the united states and a number of eu countries have indicated they will recognize an expected unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo albanians , after the failure of almost two years of un-sponsored negotiations on the southern serbian province 's status . serbia , in turn , has threatened to reject any offer of membership in the european union if the 27-member block recognized the secessionist province as an independent state tense relations with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an up-and-down political relationship : merkel with russian president vladimir putin the chancellor also referred to nato 's tense relations with russia and spoke of the need to avoid opening up more rifts between the two sides . she appealed to both parties to use the time between now at the nato summit in romania in april 2008 to move closer to resolving the most important issues , including those of special interest to russia . these include the planned us missile shield in poland and the czech republic as well as well as russia 's decision to suspend compliance with the conventional forces in europe arms control treaty . " nato and the united states in particular have gone a far way to towards addressing moscow 's concerns in the past few months , " merkel said . the chancellor said she saw russia as a partner as well as a neighbour and hoped that relations would become closer and grow in importance , stressing , however , the need for a society based on law and justice . " the development of stable constitutional and democratic structures remains essential , " she wrote , noting that she would also discuss the issue with the new russian president . iran and the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel traveled to greenland in august to learn more about global warming on a broader scale , merkel said heading off the prospect of a nuclear-armed iran remained a " vital interest " for the world community . she wrote that iran 's nuclear program is still " one of our biggest security policy concerns , " and said iran 's refusal to suspend its uranium enrichment activities - as demanded by the united nations security council and the nuclear watchdog agency iaea - was dangerous . " the unbearable rabble-rousing of the iranian president -lrb- mahmoud ahmadinejad -rrb- against israel also speaks volumes , " she said in the article . focusing on climate change , merkel urged german citizens and the industry to do everything in their power to protect the environment .
she noted that the new energy and climate package passed by the german government at the beginning of december was the " most comprehensive scheme to reduce greenhouse gases in the world . " merkel said it was now up to consumers and the industry to put the measures into action , and pointed out that the demand for climate-protecting innovations would further anchor germany 's role as a technology leader . in domestic matters , she said more economic reforms were on the way for the country in 2008 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

following a brutal attack on a pensioner by two foreign youths on the munich underground , germany 's conservative politicians want tougher laws or even deportation for perpetrators . the 76-year-old retired school director was assaulted last week after asking two youths , one turkish and one greek , not to smoke in the underground .
it was a request which left the pensioner seriously injured and has sparked furious debate among politicians on how germany should best deal with its wayward youth .
several politicians from germany 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- say the attack shows that the time has come to re-evaluate the treatment of young offenders and moreover , agressive young foreigners living in germany .
in an interview with the mass-circulation bild newspaper , the state premier for hesse , roland koch said young foreigners were too quick to use violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse state premier roland koch " zero tolerance of violence should be an integral part of our integration policy , " he said adding that germany had , up until now , shown a " strange sociological understanding " for violent members of ethnic minority groups .
" people who live in germany should behave in a decent manner and refrain from violence , " koch said .
" those who ca n't live according to our rules , are in the wrong place . "
suitable punishment wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the christian democratic union 's parliamentary group is also in favor of tougher measures against young offenders .
he told the online version of der spiegel news magazine was time for germany to stop thinking it could prevent recidivism with " social-therapeutic " measures .
he said offenders with " serious criminal energy " should be suitably punished rather than packed off on " sailing trips around the aegean . "
bosbach argues that young foreign criminals should be faced with more than just time behind bars .
" the most frightening prospect for young offenders is deportation , " he said , adding that a sentence of one year imprisonment without probation should be enough for a deportation .
he criticized the current system for making expulsion unnecessarily difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges decide which version of the law to use both koch and bosbach said it was time to remove the kid gloves when dealing with criminals aged between 18 and 21 .
under current german law , a judge can decide on a case-by-case basis whether an offender should be tried according to adult or juvenile law .
bosbach said the use of the latter for felons in that age group should be " the absolute exception " .
koch told the bild newspaper that young offenders should not be treated with understanding .
" prison has to be felt to have the desired effect . "
sentencing youths is a balancing act but social democrat domestic policy expert dieter wiefelspütz has warned against a rash tightening of juvenile criminal law .
in an interview with the web site , he said the fact that the culprits behind last week 's tragic and brutal incident had already been caught and were now looking at weighty sentences , was proof enough that the law did not need to be overhauled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does being behind bars solve the problem ?
however , wiefelspütz said dealing with juvenile criminals is always a balancing act which requires making a choice between locking an offender away or offering them the chance of re-socialization .
he said it would be wrong to impose tough sentences across the board for youth violence .
" the constitutional state has the appropriate instruments and it knows how to use them , " the politician concluded . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime german plan to criminalize teen sex put on back burner crime -pipe- 28.12.2007 politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how tough should germany be on its young offenders ?
following a brutal attack on a pensioner by two foreign youths on the munich underground , germany 's conservative politicians want tougher laws or even deportation for perpetrators . the 76-year-old retired school director was assaulted last week after asking two youths , one turkish and one greek , not to smoke in the underground .
it was a request which left the pensioner seriously injured and has sparked furious debate among politicians on how germany should best deal with its wayward youth .
several politicians from germany 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- say the attack shows that the time has come to re-evaluate the treatment of young offenders and moreover , agressive young foreigners living in germany .
in an interview with the mass-circulation bild newspaper , the state premier for hesse , roland koch said young foreigners were too quick to use violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse state premier roland koch " zero tolerance of violence should be an integral part of our integration policy , " he said adding that germany had , up until now , shown a " strange sociological understanding " for violent members of ethnic minority groups .
" people who live in germany should behave in a decent manner and refrain from violence , " koch said .
" those who ca n't live according to our rules , are in the wrong place . "
suitable punishment wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the christian democratic union 's parliamentary group is also in favor of tougher measures against young offenders .
he told the online version of der spiegel news magazine was time for germany to stop thinking it could prevent recidivism with " social-therapeutic " measures .
he said offenders with " serious criminal energy " should be suitably punished rather than packed off on " sailing trips around the aegean . "
bosbach argues that young foreign criminals should be faced with more than just time behind bars .
" the most frightening prospect for young offenders is deportation , " he said , adding that a sentence of one year imprisonment without probation should be enough for a deportation .
he criticized the current system for making expulsion unnecessarily difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges decide which version of the law to use both koch and bosbach said it was time to remove the kid gloves when dealing with criminals aged between 18 and 21 .
under current german law , a judge can decide on a case-by-case basis whether an offender should be tried according to adult or juvenile law .
bosbach said the use of the latter for felons in that age group should be " the absolute exception " .

following a brutal attack on a pensioner by two foreign youths on the munich underground , germany 's conservative politicians want tougher laws or even deportation for perpetrators . the 76-year-old retired school director was assaulted last week after asking two youths , one turkish and one greek , not to smoke in the underground .
it was a request which left the pensioner seriously injured and has sparked furious debate among politicians on how germany should best deal with its wayward youth .
several politicians from germany 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- say the attack shows that the time has come to re-evaluate the treatment of young offenders and moreover , agressive young foreigners living in germany .
in an interview with the mass-circulation bild newspaper , the state premier for hesse , roland koch said young foreigners were too quick to use violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse state premier roland koch " zero tolerance of violence should be an integral part of our integration policy , " he said adding that germany had , up until now , shown a " strange sociological understanding " for violent members of ethnic minority groups .
" people who live in germany should behave in a decent manner and refrain from violence , " koch said .
" those who ca n't live according to our rules , are in the wrong place . "
suitable punishment wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the christian democratic union 's parliamentary group is also in favor of tougher measures against young offenders .
he told the online version of der spiegel news magazine was time for germany to stop thinking it could prevent recidivism with " social-therapeutic " measures .
he said offenders with " serious criminal energy " should be suitably punished rather than packed off on " sailing trips around the aegean . "
bosbach argues that young foreign criminals should be faced with more than just time behind bars .
" the most frightening prospect for young offenders is deportation , " he said , adding that a sentence of one year imprisonment without probation should be enough for a deportation .
he criticized the current system for making expulsion unnecessarily difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges decide which version of the law to use both koch and bosbach said it was time to remove the kid gloves when dealing with criminals aged between 18 and 21 .
under current german law , a judge can decide on a case-by-case basis whether an offender should be tried according to adult or juvenile law .
bosbach said the use of the latter for felons in that age group should be " the absolute exception " .

1 .
while legislators see the ban as a pillar of consumer protection , critics say the accord only serves to protect the state monopoly on lotteries . all 16 german state legislatures voted by mid-december to approve the new law which seeks to prevent any form of web-based gambling or brokering of games over the internet . the law also encompasses placing bets from germany to a gaming company abroad .
the new legislation grants states the power to demand internet service providers to block web sites that promote betting .
banks may also be ordered to stop money transfers for gambling transactions . internet betting companies and lottery brokers like bwin interactive entertainment , fluxx and tipp24 have criticized the new regulations and claimed that the ban is contrary to law . tipp24 has said it will pursue a lawsuit if necessary , while bwin already sued four german states in october seeking to continue offering online bets after the rules come into effect .
the cases are pending . legal loophole ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these men merely enjoy card games with the computer bwin operates a betting site under a license issued by the former communist east german government before unification and another portal under a gibraltar license . the company has said that both of those licenses prevail over the new online-betting ban and stressed that it would continue to operate its sites . the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , has called on germany to reconsider the complete ban on online betting .
in april , germany rejected the demand , claiming that citizens must be protected from the dangers of gambling . the commission has the power to sue any eu member state to force them to comply with eu law . until now , 13 of germany 's 16 states have submitted the ratification documents for the ban to take effect , creating the required majority .
the other three states are expected to submit their papers by new year 's eve . the new law will also prohibit the advertising of gambling over the internet and on television ; specifically , advertising in print and other media may only " inform " people about betting possibilities , and may no longer " directly invite , incite or prompt " customers to play . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

following a brutal attack on a pensioner by two foreign youths on the munich underground , germany 's conservative politicians want tougher laws or even deportation for perpetrators . the 76-year-old retired school director was assaulted last week after asking two youths , one turkish and one greek , not to smoke in the underground .
it was a request which left the pensioner seriously injured and has sparked furious debate among politicians on how germany should best deal with its wayward youth .
several politicians from germany 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- say the attack shows that the time has come to re-evaluate the treatment of young offenders and moreover , agressive young foreigners living in germany .
in an interview with the mass-circulation bild newspaper , the state premier for hesse , roland koch said young foreigners were too quick to use violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse state premier roland koch " zero tolerance of violence should be an integral part of our integration policy , " he said adding that germany had , up until now , shown a " strange sociological understanding " for violent members of ethnic minority groups .
" people who live in germany should behave in a decent manner and refrain from violence , " koch said .
" those who ca n't live according to our rules , are in the wrong place . "
suitable punishment wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the christian democratic union 's parliamentary group is also in favor of tougher measures against young offenders .
he told the online version of der spiegel news magazine was time for germany to stop thinking it could prevent recidivism with " social-therapeutic " measures .
he said offenders with " serious criminal energy " should be suitably punished rather than packed off on " sailing trips around the aegean . "
bosbach argues that young foreign criminals should be faced with more than just time behind bars .
" the most frightening prospect for young offenders is deportation , " he said , adding that a sentence of one year imprisonment without probation should be enough for a deportation .
he criticized the current system for making expulsion unnecessarily difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges decide which version of the law to use both koch and bosbach said it was time to remove the kid gloves when dealing with criminals aged between 18 and 21 .
under current german law , a judge can decide on a case-by-case basis whether an offender should be tried according to adult or juvenile law .
bosbach said the use of the latter for felons in that age group should be " the absolute exception " .
koch told the bild newspaper that young offenders should not be treated with understanding .
" prison has to be felt to have the desired effect . "
sentencing youths is a balancing act but social democrat domestic policy expert dieter wiefelspütz has warned against a rash tightening of juvenile criminal law .
in an interview with the web site , he said the fact that the culprits behind last week 's tragic and brutal incident had already been caught and were now looking at weighty sentences , was proof enough that the law did not need to be overhauled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does being behind bars solve the problem ?
however , wiefelspütz said dealing with juvenile criminals is always a balancing act which requires making a choice between locking an offender away or offering them the chance of re-socialization .
he said it would be wrong to impose tough sentences across the board for youth violence .
" the constitutional state has the appropriate instruments and it knows how to use them , " the politician concluded . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the unbearable rabble-rousing of the iranian president -lrb- mahmoud ahmadinejad -rrb- against israel also speaks volumes , " she said in the article . focusing on climate change , merkel urged german citizens and the industry to do everything in their power to protect the environment .
she noted that the new energy and climate package passed by the german government at the beginning of december was the " most comprehensive scheme to reduce greenhouse gases in the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime german plan to criminalize teen sex put on back burner crime -pipe- 28.12.2007 politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how tough should germany be on its young offenders ?
following a brutal attack on a pensioner by two foreign youths on the munich underground , germany 's conservative politicians want tougher laws or even deportation for perpetrators . the 76-year-old retired school director was assaulted last week after asking two youths , one turkish and one greek , not to smoke in the underground .
it was a request which left the pensioner seriously injured and has sparked furious debate among politicians on how germany should best deal with its wayward youth .
several politicians from germany 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- say the attack shows that the time has come to re-evaluate the treatment of young offenders and moreover , agressive young foreigners living in germany .
in an interview with the mass-circulation bild newspaper , the state premier for hesse , roland koch said young foreigners were too quick to use violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse state premier roland koch " zero tolerance of violence should be an integral part of our integration policy , " he said adding that germany had , up until now , shown a " strange sociological understanding " for violent members of ethnic minority groups .
" people who live in germany should behave in a decent manner and refrain from violence , " koch said .
" those who ca n't live according to our rules , are in the wrong place . "
suitable punishment wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the christian democratic union 's parliamentary group is also in favor of tougher measures against young offenders .
he told the online version of der spiegel news magazine was time for germany to stop thinking it could prevent recidivism with " social-therapeutic " measures .
he said offenders with " serious criminal energy " should be suitably punished rather than packed off on " sailing trips around the aegean . "
bosbach argues that young foreign criminals should be faced with more than just time behind bars .
" the most frightening prospect for young offenders is deportation , " he said , adding that a sentence of one year imprisonment without probation should be enough for a deportation .
he criticized the current system for making expulsion unnecessarily difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges decide which version of the law to use both koch and bosbach said it was time to remove the kid gloves when dealing with criminals aged between 18 and 21 .
under current german law , a judge can decide on a case-by-case basis whether an offender should be tried according to adult or juvenile law .
bosbach said the use of the latter for felons in that age group should be " the absolute exception " .
koch told the bild newspaper that young offenders should not be treated with understanding .
" prison has to be felt to have the desired effect . "
sentencing youths is a balancing act but social democrat domestic policy expert dieter wiefelspütz has warned against a rash tightening of juvenile criminal law .
in an interview with the web site , he said the fact that the culprits behind last week 's tragic and brutal incident had already been caught and were now looking at weighty sentences , was proof enough that the law did not need to be overhauled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does being behind bars solve the problem ?
however , wiefelspütz said dealing with juvenile criminals is always a balancing act which requires making a choice between locking an offender away or offering them the chance of re-socialization .
he said it would be wrong to impose tough sentences across the board for youth violence .
" the constitutional state has the appropriate instruments and it knows how to use them , " the politician concluded . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 .
while legislators see the ban as a pillar of consumer protection , critics say the accord only serves to protect the state monopoly on lotteries . all 16 german state legislatures voted by mid-december to approve the new law which seeks to prevent any form of web-based gambling or brokering of games over the internet . the law also encompasses placing bets from germany to a gaming company abroad .
the new legislation grants states the power to demand internet service providers to block web sites that promote betting .
banks may also be ordered to stop money transfers for gambling transactions . internet betting companies and lottery brokers like bwin interactive entertainment , fluxx and tipp24 have criticized the new regulations and claimed that the ban is contrary to law . tipp24 has said it will pursue a lawsuit if necessary , while bwin already sued four german states in october seeking to continue offering online bets after the rules come into effect .
the cases are pending . legal loophole ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these men merely enjoy card games with the computer bwin operates a betting site under a license issued by the former communist east german government before unification and another portal under a gibraltar license . the company has said that both of those licenses prevail over the new online-betting ban and stressed that it would continue to operate its sites . the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , has called on germany to reconsider the complete ban on online betting .
in april , germany rejected the demand , claiming that citizens must be protected from the dangers of gambling . the commission has the power to sue any eu member state to force them to comply with eu law . until now , 13 of germany 's 16 states have submitted the ratification documents for the ban to take effect , creating the required majority .
the other three states are expected to submit their papers by new year 's eve . the new law will also prohibit the advertising of gambling over the internet and on television ; specifically , advertising in print and other media may only " inform " people about betting possibilities , and may no longer " directly invite , incite or prompt " customers to play . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime german plan to criminalize teen sex put on back burner crime -pipe- 28.12.2007 politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how tough should germany be on its young offenders ?
following a brutal attack on a pensioner by two foreign youths on the munich underground , germany 's conservative politicians want tougher laws or even deportation for perpetrators . the 76-year-old retired school director was assaulted last week after asking two youths , one turkish and one greek , not to smoke in the underground .
it was a request which left the pensioner seriously injured and has sparked furious debate among politicians on how germany should best deal with its wayward youth .
several politicians from germany 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- say the attack shows that the time has come to re-evaluate the treatment of young offenders and moreover , agressive young foreigners living in germany .
in an interview with the mass-circulation bild newspaper , the state premier for hesse , roland koch said young foreigners were too quick to use violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse state premier roland koch " zero tolerance of violence should be an integral part of our integration policy , " he said adding that germany had , up until now , shown a " strange sociological understanding " for violent members of ethnic minority groups .
" people who live in germany should behave in a decent manner and refrain from violence , " koch said .
" those who ca n't live according to our rules , are in the wrong place . "
suitable punishment wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the christian democratic union 's parliamentary group is also in favor of tougher measures against young offenders .
he told the online version of der spiegel news magazine was time for germany to stop thinking it could prevent recidivism with " social-therapeutic " measures .
he said offenders with " serious criminal energy " should be suitably punished rather than packed off on " sailing trips around the aegean . "
bosbach argues that young foreign criminals should be faced with more than just time behind bars .
" the most frightening prospect for young offenders is deportation , " he said , adding that a sentence of one year imprisonment without probation should be enough for a deportation .
he criticized the current system for making expulsion unnecessarily difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges decide which version of the law to use both koch and bosbach said it was time to remove the kid gloves when dealing with criminals aged between 18 and 21 .
under current german law , a judge can decide on a case-by-case basis whether an offender should be tried according to adult or juvenile law .
bosbach said the use of the latter for felons in that age group should be " the absolute exception " .
koch told the bild newspaper that young offenders should not be treated with understanding .
" prison has to be felt to have the desired effect . "
sentencing youths is a balancing act but social democrat domestic policy expert dieter wiefelspütz has warned against a rash tightening of juvenile criminal law .
in an interview with the web site , he said the fact that the culprits behind last week 's tragic and brutal incident had already been caught and were now looking at weighty sentences , was proof enough that the law did not need to be overhauled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does being behind bars solve the problem ?
however , wiefelspütz said dealing with juvenile criminals is always a balancing act which requires making a choice between locking an offender away or offering them the chance of re-socialization .
he said it would be wrong to impose tough sentences across the board for youth violence .
" the constitutional state has the appropriate instruments and it knows how to use them , " the politician concluded . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the classical division between inner and foreign policy is outdated , " wrote angela merkel in an op-ed piece , published in the german business daily handelsblatt on firday , dec .
28 . " we must make sure that we - as european and atlantic partners - show solidarity for each other and that we do n't let anybody drive a wedge between us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the latest kosovo resolution of the serbian parliament will complicate its relations with the eu in her article , which was both a look back at 2007 and a view to the upcoming new year , the chancellor stressed europe 's role in helping to decide the fate of the serbian breakaway province of kosovo . " europe has a responsibility to find a solution , " she wrote .
" the solution must offer clarity for the entire region and provide the opportunity for stability and security , thereby creating the foundation for a positive future . " she cautioned against further hesitation by the european union , noting that all past attempts at resolving negotiations between serbia and kosovo 's albanian majority had failed . both the united states and a number of eu countries have indicated they will recognize an expected unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo albanians , after the failure of almost two years of un-sponsored negotiations on the southern serbian province 's status . serbia , in turn , has threatened to reject any offer of membership in the european union if the 27-member block recognized the secessionist province as an independent state tense relations with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an up-and-down political relationship : merkel with russian president vladimir putin the chancellor also referred to nato 's tense relations with russia and spoke of the need to avoid opening up more rifts between the two sides . she appealed to both parties to use the time between now at the nato summit in romania in april 2008 to move closer to resolving the most important issues , including those of special interest to russia . these include the planned us missile shield in poland and the czech republic as well as well as russia 's decision to suspend compliance with the conventional forces in europe arms control treaty . " nato and the united states in particular have gone a far way to towards addressing moscow 's concerns in the past few months , " merkel said . the chancellor said she saw russia as a partner as well as a neighbour and hoped that relations would become closer and grow in importance , stressing , however , the need for a society based on law and justice .

" the classical division between inner and foreign policy is outdated , " wrote angela merkel in an op-ed piece , published in the german business daily handelsblatt on firday , dec .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the latest kosovo resolution of the serbian parliament will complicate its relations with the eu in her article , which was both a look back at 2007 and a view to the upcoming new year , the chancellor stressed europe 's role in helping to decide the fate of the serbian breakaway province of kosovo . " europe has a responsibility to find a solution , " she wrote .
" the solution must offer clarity for the entire region and provide the opportunity for stability and security , thereby creating the foundation for a positive future . " she cautioned against further hesitation by the european union , noting that all past attempts at resolving negotiations between serbia and kosovo 's albanian majority had failed . both the united states and a number of eu countries have indicated they will recognize an expected unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo albanians , after the failure of almost two years of un-sponsored negotiations on the southern serbian province 's status . serbia , in turn , has threatened to reject any offer of membership in the european union if the 27-member block recognized the secessionist province as an independent state tense relations with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an up-and-down political relationship : merkel with russian president vladimir putin the chancellor also referred to nato 's tense relations with russia and spoke of the need to avoid opening up more rifts between the two sides . she appealed to both parties to use the time between now at the nato summit in romania in april 2008 to move closer to resolving the most important issues , including those of special interest to russia . these include the planned us missile shield in poland and the czech republic as well as well as russia 's decision to suspend compliance with the conventional forces in europe arms control treaty . " nato and the united states in particular have gone a far way to towards addressing moscow 's concerns in the past few months , " merkel said . the chancellor said she saw russia as a partner as well as a neighbour and hoped that relations would become closer and grow in importance , stressing , however , the need for a society based on law and justice .

while legislators see the ban as a pillar of consumer protection , critics say the accord only serves to protect the state monopoly on lotteries . all 16 german state legislatures voted by mid-december to approve the new law which seeks to prevent any form of web-based gambling or brokering of games over the internet . the law also encompasses placing bets from germany to a gaming company abroad .
the new legislation grants states the power to demand internet service providers to block web sites that promote betting .
banks may also be ordered to stop money transfers for gambling transactions . internet betting companies and lottery brokers like bwin interactive entertainment , fluxx and tipp24 have criticized the new regulations and claimed that the ban is contrary to law . tipp24 has said it will pursue a lawsuit if necessary , while bwin already sued four german states in october seeking to continue offering online bets after the rules come into effect .

in april , germany rejected the demand , claiming that citizens must be protected from the dangers of gambling . the commission has the power to sue any eu member state to force them to comply with eu law . until now , 13 of germany 's 16 states have submitted the ratification documents for the ban to take effect , creating the required majority .
the other three states are expected to submit their papers by new year 's eve . the new law will also prohibit the advertising of gambling over the internet and on television ; specifically , advertising in print and other media may only " inform " people about betting possibilities , and may no longer " directly invite , incite or prompt " customers to play . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

following a brutal attack on a pensioner by two foreign youths on the munich underground , germany 's conservative politicians want tougher laws or even deportation for perpetrators . the 76-year-old retired school director was assaulted last week after asking two youths , one turkish and one greek , not to smoke in the underground .
it was a request which left the pensioner seriously injured and has sparked furious debate among politicians on how germany should best deal with its wayward youth .
several politicians from germany 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- say the attack shows that the time has come to re-evaluate the treatment of young offenders and moreover , agressive young foreigners living in germany .
in an interview with the mass-circulation bild newspaper , the state premier for hesse , roland koch said young foreigners were too quick to use violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse state premier roland koch " zero tolerance of violence should be an integral part of our integration policy , " he said adding that germany had , up until now , shown a " strange sociological understanding " for violent members of ethnic minority groups .
" people who live in germany should behave in a decent manner and refrain from violence , " koch said .
" those who ca n't live according to our rules , are in the wrong place . "
suitable punishment wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the christian democratic union 's parliamentary group is also in favor of tougher measures against young offenders .
he told the online version of der spiegel news magazine was time for germany to stop thinking it could prevent recidivism with " social-therapeutic " measures .
he said offenders with " serious criminal energy " should be suitably punished rather than packed off on " sailing trips around the aegean . "
bosbach argues that young foreign criminals should be faced with more than just time behind bars .
" the most frightening prospect for young offenders is deportation , " he said , adding that a sentence of one year imprisonment without probation should be enough for a deportation .
he criticized the current system for making expulsion unnecessarily difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges decide which version of the law to use both koch and bosbach said it was time to remove the kid gloves when dealing with criminals aged between 18 and 21 .
under current german law , a judge can decide on a case-by-case basis whether an offender should be tried according to adult or juvenile law .
bosbach said the use of the latter for felons in that age group should be " the absolute exception " .
koch told the bild newspaper that young offenders should not be treated with understanding .
" prison has to be felt to have the desired effect . "
sentencing youths is a balancing act but social democrat domestic policy expert dieter wiefelspütz has warned against a rash tightening of juvenile criminal law .
in an interview with the web site , he said the fact that the culprits behind last week 's tragic and brutal incident had already been caught and were now looking at weighty sentences , was proof enough that the law did not need to be overhauled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does being behind bars solve the problem ?
however , wiefelspütz said dealing with juvenile criminals is always a balancing act which requires making a choice between locking an offender away or offering them the chance of re-socialization .
he said it would be wrong to impose tough sentences across the board for youth violence .

following a brutal attack on a pensioner by two foreign youths on the munich underground , germany 's conservative politicians want tougher laws or even deportation for perpetrators . the 76-year-old retired school director was assaulted last week after asking two youths , one turkish and one greek , not to smoke in the underground .
it was a request which left the pensioner seriously injured and has sparked furious debate among politicians on how germany should best deal with its wayward youth .
several politicians from germany 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- say the attack shows that the time has come to re-evaluate the treatment of young offenders and moreover , agressive young foreigners living in germany .
in an interview with the mass-circulation bild newspaper , the state premier for hesse , roland koch said young foreigners were too quick to use violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse state premier roland koch " zero tolerance of violence should be an integral part of our integration policy , " he said adding that germany had , up until now , shown a " strange sociological understanding " for violent members of ethnic minority groups .
" people who live in germany should behave in a decent manner and refrain from violence , " koch said .
" those who ca n't live according to our rules , are in the wrong place . "
suitable punishment wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the christian democratic union 's parliamentary group is also in favor of tougher measures against young offenders .
he told the online version of der spiegel news magazine was time for germany to stop thinking it could prevent recidivism with " social-therapeutic " measures .
he said offenders with " serious criminal energy " should be suitably punished rather than packed off on " sailing trips around the aegean . "
bosbach argues that young foreign criminals should be faced with more than just time behind bars .
" the most frightening prospect for young offenders is deportation , " he said , adding that a sentence of one year imprisonment without probation should be enough for a deportation .
he criticized the current system for making expulsion unnecessarily difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges decide which version of the law to use both koch and bosbach said it was time to remove the kid gloves when dealing with criminals aged between 18 and 21 .
under current german law , a judge can decide on a case-by-case basis whether an offender should be tried according to adult or juvenile law .
bosbach said the use of the latter for felons in that age group should be " the absolute exception " .
koch told the bild newspaper that young offenders should not be treated with understanding .
" prison has to be felt to have the desired effect . "
sentencing youths is a balancing act but social democrat domestic policy expert dieter wiefelspütz has warned against a rash tightening of juvenile criminal law .
in an interview with the web site , he said the fact that the culprits behind last week 's tragic and brutal incident had already been caught and were now looking at weighty sentences , was proof enough that the law did not need to be overhauled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does being behind bars solve the problem ?
however , wiefelspütz said dealing with juvenile criminals is always a balancing act which requires making a choice between locking an offender away or offering them the chance of re-socialization .
he said it would be wrong to impose tough sentences across the board for youth violence .

" the solution must offer clarity for the entire region and provide the opportunity for stability and security , thereby creating the foundation for a positive future .

following a brutal attack on a pensioner by two foreign youths on the munich underground , germany 's conservative politicians want tougher laws or even deportation for perpetrators . the 76-year-old retired school director was assaulted last week after asking two youths , one turkish and one greek , not to smoke in the underground .
it was a request which left the pensioner seriously injured and has sparked furious debate among politicians on how germany should best deal with its wayward youth .
several politicians from germany 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- say the attack shows that the time has come to re-evaluate the treatment of young offenders and moreover , agressive young foreigners living in germany .
in an interview with the mass-circulation bild newspaper , the state premier for hesse , roland koch said young foreigners were too quick to use violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse state premier roland koch " zero tolerance of violence should be an integral part of our integration policy , " he said adding that germany had , up until now , shown a " strange sociological understanding " for violent members of ethnic minority groups .
" people who live in germany should behave in a decent manner and refrain from violence , " koch said .
" those who ca n't live according to our rules , are in the wrong place . "
suitable punishment wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the christian democratic union 's parliamentary group is also in favor of tougher measures against young offenders .
he told the online version of der spiegel news magazine was time for germany to stop thinking it could prevent recidivism with " social-therapeutic " measures .
he said offenders with " serious criminal energy " should be suitably punished rather than packed off on " sailing trips around the aegean . "
bosbach argues that young foreign criminals should be faced with more than just time behind bars .
" the most frightening prospect for young offenders is deportation , " he said , adding that a sentence of one year imprisonment without probation should be enough for a deportation .
he criticized the current system for making expulsion unnecessarily difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges decide which version of the law to use both koch and bosbach said it was time to remove the kid gloves when dealing with criminals aged between 18 and 21 .
under current german law , a judge can decide on a case-by-case basis whether an offender should be tried according to adult or juvenile law .
bosbach said the use of the latter for felons in that age group should be " the absolute exception " .
koch told the bild newspaper that young offenders should not be treated with understanding .
" prison has to be felt to have the desired effect . "
sentencing youths is a balancing act but social democrat domestic policy expert dieter wiefelspütz has warned against a rash tightening of juvenile criminal law .
in an interview with the web site , he said the fact that the culprits behind last week 's tragic and brutal incident had already been caught and were now looking at weighty sentences , was proof enough that the law did not need to be overhauled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does being behind bars solve the problem ?
however , wiefelspütz said dealing with juvenile criminals is always a balancing act which requires making a choice between locking an offender away or offering them the chance of re-socialization .
he said it would be wrong to impose tough sentences across the board for youth violence .
" the constitutional state has the appropriate instruments and it knows how to use them , " the politician concluded . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime german plan to criminalize teen sex put on back burner crime -pipe- 28.12.2007 politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how tough should germany be on its young offenders ?
following a brutal attack on a pensioner by two foreign youths on the munich underground , germany 's conservative politicians want tougher laws or even deportation for perpetrators . the 76-year-old retired school director was assaulted last week after asking two youths , one turkish and one greek , not to smoke in the underground .
it was a request which left the pensioner seriously injured and has sparked furious debate among politicians on how germany should best deal with its wayward youth .
several politicians from germany 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- say the attack shows that the time has come to re-evaluate the treatment of young offenders and moreover , agressive young foreigners living in germany .
in an interview with the mass-circulation bild newspaper , the state premier for hesse , roland koch said young foreigners were too quick to use violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse state premier roland koch " zero tolerance of violence should be an integral part of our integration policy , " he said adding that germany had , up until now , shown a " strange sociological understanding " for violent members of ethnic minority groups .
" people who live in germany should behave in a decent manner and refrain from violence , " koch said .
" those who ca n't live according to our rules , are in the wrong place . "
suitable punishment wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the christian democratic union 's parliamentary group is also in favor of tougher measures against young offenders .
he told the online version of der spiegel news magazine was time for germany to stop thinking it could prevent recidivism with " social-therapeutic " measures .
he said offenders with " serious criminal energy " should be suitably punished rather than packed off on " sailing trips around the aegean . "
bosbach argues that young foreign criminals should be faced with more than just time behind bars .
" the most frightening prospect for young offenders is deportation , " he said , adding that a sentence of one year imprisonment without probation should be enough for a deportation .
he criticized the current system for making expulsion unnecessarily difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges decide which version of the law to use both koch and bosbach said it was time to remove the kid gloves when dealing with criminals aged between 18 and 21 .
under current german law , a judge can decide on a case-by-case basis whether an offender should be tried according to adult or juvenile law .
bosbach said the use of the latter for felons in that age group should be " the absolute exception " .
koch told the bild newspaper that young offenders should not be treated with understanding .
" prison has to be felt to have the desired effect . "
sentencing youths is a balancing act but social democrat domestic policy expert dieter wiefelspütz has warned against a rash tightening of juvenile criminal law .
in an interview with the web site , he said the fact that the culprits behind last week 's tragic and brutal incident had already been caught and were now looking at weighty sentences , was proof enough that the law did not need to be overhauled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does being behind bars solve the problem ?
however , wiefelspütz said dealing with juvenile criminals is always a balancing act which requires making a choice between locking an offender away or offering them the chance of re-socialization .
he said it would be wrong to impose tough sentences across the board for youth violence .
" the constitutional state has the appropriate instruments and it knows how to use them , " the politician concluded . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

following a brutal attack on a pensioner by two foreign youths on the munich underground , germany 's conservative politicians want tougher laws or even deportation for perpetrators . the 76-year-old retired school director was assaulted last week after asking two youths , one turkish and one greek , not to smoke in the underground .
it was a request which left the pensioner seriously injured and has sparked furious debate among politicians on how germany should best deal with its wayward youth .
several politicians from germany 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- say the attack shows that the time has come to re-evaluate the treatment of young offenders and moreover , agressive young foreigners living in germany .
in an interview with the mass-circulation bild newspaper , the state premier for hesse , roland koch said young foreigners were too quick to use violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse state premier roland koch " zero tolerance of violence should be an integral part of our integration policy , " he said adding that germany had , up until now , shown a " strange sociological understanding " for violent members of ethnic minority groups .
" people who live in germany should behave in a decent manner and refrain from violence , " koch said .
" those who ca n't live according to our rules , are in the wrong place . "
suitable punishment wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the christian democratic union 's parliamentary group is also in favor of tougher measures against young offenders .
he told the online version of der spiegel news magazine was time for germany to stop thinking it could prevent recidivism with " social-therapeutic " measures .
he said offenders with " serious criminal energy " should be suitably punished rather than packed off on " sailing trips around the aegean . "
bosbach argues that young foreign criminals should be faced with more than just time behind bars .
" the most frightening prospect for young offenders is deportation , " he said , adding that a sentence of one year imprisonment without probation should be enough for a deportation .
he criticized the current system for making expulsion unnecessarily difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges decide which version of the law to use both koch and bosbach said it was time to remove the kid gloves when dealing with criminals aged between 18 and 21 .
under current german law , a judge can decide on a case-by-case basis whether an offender should be tried according to adult or juvenile law .
bosbach said the use of the latter for felons in that age group should be " the absolute exception " .
koch told the bild newspaper that young offenders should not be treated with understanding .
" prison has to be felt to have the desired effect . "
sentencing youths is a balancing act but social democrat domestic policy expert dieter wiefelspütz has warned against a rash tightening of juvenile criminal law .
in an interview with the web site , he said the fact that the culprits behind last week 's tragic and brutal incident had already been caught and were now looking at weighty sentences , was proof enough that the law did not need to be overhauled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does being behind bars solve the problem ?
however , wiefelspütz said dealing with juvenile criminals is always a balancing act which requires making a choice between locking an offender away or offering them the chance of re-socialization .
he said it would be wrong to impose tough sentences across the board for youth violence .
" the constitutional state has the appropriate instruments and it knows how to use them , " the politician concluded . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 .
while legislators see the ban as a pillar of consumer protection , critics say the accord only serves to protect the state monopoly on lotteries . all 16 german state legislatures voted by mid-december to approve the new law which seeks to prevent any form of web-based gambling or brokering of games over the internet . the law also encompasses placing bets from germany to a gaming company abroad .
the new legislation grants states the power to demand internet service providers to block web sites that promote betting .
banks may also be ordered to stop money transfers for gambling transactions . internet betting companies and lottery brokers like bwin interactive entertainment , fluxx and tipp24 have criticized the new regulations and claimed that the ban is contrary to law . tipp24 has said it will pursue a lawsuit if necessary , while bwin already sued four german states in october seeking to continue offering online bets after the rules come into effect .
the cases are pending . legal loophole ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these men merely enjoy card games with the computer bwin operates a betting site under a license issued by the former communist east german government before unification and another portal under a gibraltar license . the company has said that both of those licenses prevail over the new online-betting ban and stressed that it would continue to operate its sites . the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , has called on germany to reconsider the complete ban on online betting .
in april , germany rejected the demand , claiming that citizens must be protected from the dangers of gambling . the commission has the power to sue any eu member state to force them to comply with eu law . until now , 13 of germany 's 16 states have submitted the ratification documents for the ban to take effect , creating the required majority .
the other three states are expected to submit their papers by new year 's eve . the new law will also prohibit the advertising of gambling over the internet and on television ; specifically , advertising in print and other media may only " inform " people about betting possibilities , and may no longer " directly invite , incite or prompt " customers to play . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the solution must offer clarity for the entire region and provide the opportunity for stability and security , thereby creating the foundation for a positive future .

1 .
while legislators see the ban as a pillar of consumer protection , critics say the accord only serves to protect the state monopoly on lotteries . all 16 german state legislatures voted by mid-december to approve the new law which seeks to prevent any form of web-based gambling or brokering of games over the internet . the law also encompasses placing bets from germany to a gaming company abroad .
the new legislation grants states the power to demand internet service providers to block web sites that promote betting .
banks may also be ordered to stop money transfers for gambling transactions . internet betting companies and lottery brokers like bwin interactive entertainment , fluxx and tipp24 have criticized the new regulations and claimed that the ban is contrary to law . tipp24 has said it will pursue a lawsuit if necessary , while bwin already sued four german states in october seeking to continue offering online bets after the rules come into effect .
the cases are pending . legal loophole ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these men merely enjoy card games with the computer bwin operates a betting site under a license issued by the former communist east german government before unification and another portal under a gibraltar license . the company has said that both of those licenses prevail over the new online-betting ban and stressed that it would continue to operate its sites . the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , has called on germany to reconsider the complete ban on online betting .
in april , germany rejected the demand , claiming that citizens must be protected from the dangers of gambling . the commission has the power to sue any eu member state to force them to comply with eu law . until now , 13 of germany 's 16 states have submitted the ratification documents for the ban to take effect , creating the required majority .
the other three states are expected to submit their papers by new year 's eve . the new law will also prohibit the advertising of gambling over the internet and on television ; specifically , advertising in print and other media may only " inform " people about betting possibilities , and may no longer " directly invite , incite or prompt " customers to play . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 .
while legislators see the ban as a pillar of consumer protection , critics say the accord only serves to protect the state monopoly on lotteries . all 16 german state legislatures voted by mid-december to approve the new law which seeks to prevent any form of web-based gambling or brokering of games over the internet . the law also encompasses placing bets from germany to a gaming company abroad .
the new legislation grants states the power to demand internet service providers to block web sites that promote betting .
banks may also be ordered to stop money transfers for gambling transactions . internet betting companies and lottery brokers like bwin interactive entertainment , fluxx and tipp24 have criticized the new regulations and claimed that the ban is contrary to law . tipp24 has said it will pursue a lawsuit if necessary , while bwin already sued four german states in october seeking to continue offering online bets after the rules come into effect .
the cases are pending . legal loophole ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these men merely enjoy card games with the computer bwin operates a betting site under a license issued by the former communist east german government before unification and another portal under a gibraltar license . the company has said that both of those licenses prevail over the new online-betting ban and stressed that it would continue to operate its sites . the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , has called on germany to reconsider the complete ban on online betting .
in april , germany rejected the demand , claiming that citizens must be protected from the dangers of gambling . the commission has the power to sue any eu member state to force them to comply with eu law . until now , 13 of germany 's 16 states have submitted the ratification documents for the ban to take effect , creating the required majority .
the other three states are expected to submit their papers by new year 's eve . the new law will also prohibit the advertising of gambling over the internet and on television ; specifically , advertising in print and other media may only " inform " people about betting possibilities , and may no longer " directly invite , incite or prompt " customers to play . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime german plan to criminalize teen sex put on back burner crime -pipe- 28.12.2007 politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how tough should germany be on its young offenders ?
following a brutal attack on a pensioner by two foreign youths on the munich underground , germany 's conservative politicians want tougher laws or even deportation for perpetrators . the 76-year-old retired school director was assaulted last week after asking two youths , one turkish and one greek , not to smoke in the underground .
it was a request which left the pensioner seriously injured and has sparked furious debate among politicians on how germany should best deal with its wayward youth .
several politicians from germany 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- say the attack shows that the time has come to re-evaluate the treatment of young offenders and moreover , agressive young foreigners living in germany .
in an interview with the mass-circulation bild newspaper , the state premier for hesse , roland koch said young foreigners were too quick to use violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse state premier roland koch " zero tolerance of violence should be an integral part of our integration policy , " he said adding that germany had , up until now , shown a " strange sociological understanding " for violent members of ethnic minority groups .
" people who live in germany should behave in a decent manner and refrain from violence , " koch said .
" those who ca n't live according to our rules , are in the wrong place . "
suitable punishment wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the christian democratic union 's parliamentary group is also in favor of tougher measures against young offenders .
he told the online version of der spiegel news magazine was time for germany to stop thinking it could prevent recidivism with " social-therapeutic " measures .
he said offenders with " serious criminal energy " should be suitably punished rather than packed off on " sailing trips around the aegean . "
bosbach argues that young foreign criminals should be faced with more than just time behind bars .
" the most frightening prospect for young offenders is deportation , " he said , adding that a sentence of one year imprisonment without probation should be enough for a deportation .
he criticized the current system for making expulsion unnecessarily difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges decide which version of the law to use both koch and bosbach said it was time to remove the kid gloves when dealing with criminals aged between 18 and 21 .
under current german law , a judge can decide on a case-by-case basis whether an offender should be tried according to adult or juvenile law .
bosbach said the use of the latter for felons in that age group should be " the absolute exception " .
koch told the bild newspaper that young offenders should not be treated with understanding .
" prison has to be felt to have the desired effect . "
sentencing youths is a balancing act but social democrat domestic policy expert dieter wiefelspütz has warned against a rash tightening of juvenile criminal law .
in an interview with the web site , he said the fact that the culprits behind last week 's tragic and brutal incident had already been caught and were now looking at weighty sentences , was proof enough that the law did not need to be overhauled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does being behind bars solve the problem ?
however , wiefelspütz said dealing with juvenile criminals is always a balancing act which requires making a choice between locking an offender away or offering them the chance of re-socialization .
he said it would be wrong to impose tough sentences across the board for youth violence .
" the constitutional state has the appropriate instruments and it knows how to use them , " the politician concluded . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime german plan to criminalize teen sex put on back burner crime -pipe- 28.12.2007 politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how tough should germany be on its young offenders ?
following a brutal attack on a pensioner by two foreign youths on the munich underground , germany 's conservative politicians want tougher laws or even deportation for perpetrators . the 76-year-old retired school director was assaulted last week after asking two youths , one turkish and one greek , not to smoke in the underground .
it was a request which left the pensioner seriously injured and has sparked furious debate among politicians on how germany should best deal with its wayward youth .
several politicians from germany 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- say the attack shows that the time has come to re-evaluate the treatment of young offenders and moreover , agressive young foreigners living in germany .
in an interview with the mass-circulation bild newspaper , the state premier for hesse , roland koch said young foreigners were too quick to use violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse state premier roland koch " zero tolerance of violence should be an integral part of our integration policy , " he said adding that germany had , up until now , shown a " strange sociological understanding " for violent members of ethnic minority groups .
" people who live in germany should behave in a decent manner and refrain from violence , " koch said .
" those who ca n't live according to our rules , are in the wrong place . "
suitable punishment wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the christian democratic union 's parliamentary group is also in favor of tougher measures against young offenders .
he told the online version of der spiegel news magazine was time for germany to stop thinking it could prevent recidivism with " social-therapeutic " measures .
he said offenders with " serious criminal energy " should be suitably punished rather than packed off on " sailing trips around the aegean . "
bosbach argues that young foreign criminals should be faced with more than just time behind bars .
" the most frightening prospect for young offenders is deportation , " he said , adding that a sentence of one year imprisonment without probation should be enough for a deportation .
he criticized the current system for making expulsion unnecessarily difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges decide which version of the law to use both koch and bosbach said it was time to remove the kid gloves when dealing with criminals aged between 18 and 21 .
under current german law , a judge can decide on a case-by-case basis whether an offender should be tried according to adult or juvenile law .
bosbach said the use of the latter for felons in that age group should be " the absolute exception " .
koch told the bild newspaper that young offenders should not be treated with understanding .
" prison has to be felt to have the desired effect . "
sentencing youths is a balancing act but social democrat domestic policy expert dieter wiefelspütz has warned against a rash tightening of juvenile criminal law .
in an interview with the web site , he said the fact that the culprits behind last week 's tragic and brutal incident had already been caught and were now looking at weighty sentences , was proof enough that the law did not need to be overhauled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does being behind bars solve the problem ?
however , wiefelspütz said dealing with juvenile criminals is always a balancing act which requires making a choice between locking an offender away or offering them the chance of re-socialization .
he said it would be wrong to impose tough sentences across the board for youth violence .

following a brutal attack on a pensioner by two foreign youths on the munich underground , germany 's conservative politicians want tougher laws or even deportation for perpetrators . the 76-year-old retired school director was assaulted last week after asking two youths , one turkish and one greek , not to smoke in the underground .
it was a request which left the pensioner seriously injured and has sparked furious debate among politicians on how germany should best deal with its wayward youth .
several politicians from germany 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- say the attack shows that the time has come to re-evaluate the treatment of young offenders and moreover , agressive young foreigners living in germany .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse state premier roland koch " zero tolerance of violence should be an integral part of our integration policy , " he said adding that germany had , up until now , shown a " strange sociological understanding " for violent members of ethnic minority groups .

" those who ca n't live according to our rules , are in the wrong place . "

he told the online version of der spiegel news magazine was time for germany to stop thinking it could prevent recidivism with " social-therapeutic " measures .
he said offenders with " serious criminal energy " should be suitably punished rather than packed off on " sailing trips around the aegean . "
bosbach argues that young foreign criminals should be faced with more than just time behind bars .
" the most frightening prospect for young offenders is deportation , " he said , adding that a sentence of one year imprisonment without probation should be enough for a deportation .
he criticized the current system for making expulsion unnecessarily difficult .

" the classical division between inner and foreign policy is outdated , " wrote angela merkel in an op-ed piece , published in the german business daily handelsblatt on firday , dec .
28 . " we must make sure that we - as european and atlantic partners - show solidarity for each other and that we do n't let anybody drive a wedge between us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the latest kosovo resolution of the serbian parliament will complicate its relations with the eu in her article , which was both a look back at 2007 and a view to the upcoming new year , the chancellor stressed europe 's role in helping to decide the fate of the serbian breakaway province of kosovo . " europe has a responsibility to find a solution , " she wrote .
" the solution must offer clarity for the entire region and provide the opportunity for stability and security , thereby creating the foundation for a positive future . " she cautioned against further hesitation by the european union , noting that all past attempts at resolving negotiations between serbia and kosovo 's albanian majority had failed . both the united states and a number of eu countries have indicated they will recognize an expected unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo albanians , after the failure of almost two years of un-sponsored negotiations on the southern serbian province 's status . serbia , in turn , has threatened to reject any offer of membership in the european union if the 27-member block recognized the secessionist province as an independent state tense relations with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an up-and-down political relationship : merkel with russian president vladimir putin the chancellor also referred to nato 's tense relations with russia and spoke of the need to avoid opening up more rifts between the two sides . she appealed to both parties to use the time between now at the nato summit in romania in april 2008 to move closer to resolving the most important issues , including those of special interest to russia . these include the planned us missile shield in poland and the czech republic as well as well as russia 's decision to suspend compliance with the conventional forces in europe arms control treaty . " nato and the united states in particular have gone a far way to towards addressing moscow 's concerns in the past few months , " merkel said . the chancellor said she saw russia as a partner as well as a neighbour and hoped that relations would become closer and grow in importance , stressing , however , the need for a society based on law and justice . " the development of stable constitutional and democratic structures remains essential , " she wrote , noting that she would also discuss the issue with the new russian president . iran and the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel traveled to greenland in august to learn more about global warming on a broader scale , merkel said heading off the prospect of a nuclear-armed iran remained a " vital interest " for the world community . she wrote that iran 's nuclear program is still " one of our biggest security policy concerns , " and said iran 's refusal to suspend its uranium enrichment activities - as demanded by the united nations security council and the nuclear watchdog agency iaea - was dangerous . " the unbearable rabble-rousing of the iranian president -lrb- mahmoud ahmadinejad -rrb- against israel also speaks volumes , " she said in the article . focusing on climate change , merkel urged german citizens and the industry to do everything in their power to protect the environment .
she noted that the new energy and climate package passed by the german government at the beginning of december was the " most comprehensive scheme to reduce greenhouse gases in the world . " merkel said it was now up to consumers and the industry to put the measures into action , and pointed out that the demand for climate-protecting innovations would further anchor germany 's role as a technology leader . in domestic matters , she said more economic reforms were on the way for the country in 2008 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the classical division between inner and foreign policy is outdated , " wrote angela merkel in an op-ed piece , published in the german business daily handelsblatt on firday , dec .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the latest kosovo resolution of the serbian parliament will complicate its relations with the eu in her article , which was both a look back at 2007 and a view to the upcoming new year , the chancellor stressed europe 's role in helping to decide the fate of the serbian breakaway province of kosovo . " europe has a responsibility to find a solution , " she wrote .
" the solution must offer clarity for the entire region and provide the opportunity for stability and security , thereby creating the foundation for a positive future . " she cautioned against further hesitation by the european union , noting that all past attempts at resolving negotiations between serbia and kosovo 's albanian majority had failed . both the united states and a number of eu countries have indicated they will recognize an expected unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo albanians , after the failure of almost two years of un-sponsored negotiations on the southern serbian province 's status . serbia , in turn , has threatened to reject any offer of membership in the european union if the 27-member block recognized the secessionist province as an independent state tense relations with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an up-and-down political relationship : merkel with russian president vladimir putin the chancellor also referred to nato 's tense relations with russia and spoke of the need to avoid opening up more rifts between the two sides . she appealed to both parties to use the time between now at the nato summit in romania in april 2008 to move closer to resolving the most important issues , including those of special interest to russia . these include the planned us missile shield in poland and the czech republic as well as well as russia 's decision to suspend compliance with the conventional forces in europe arms control treaty . " nato and the united states in particular have gone a far way to towards addressing moscow 's concerns in the past few months , " merkel said . the chancellor said she saw russia as a partner as well as a neighbour and hoped that relations would become closer and grow in importance , stressing , however , the need for a society based on law and justice . " the development of stable constitutional and democratic structures remains essential , " she wrote , noting that she would also discuss the issue with the new russian president . iran and the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel traveled to greenland in august to learn more about global warming on a broader scale , merkel said heading off the prospect of a nuclear-armed iran remained a " vital interest " for the world community . she wrote that iran 's nuclear program is still " one of our biggest security policy concerns , " and said iran 's refusal to suspend its uranium enrichment activities - as demanded by the united nations security council and the nuclear watchdog agency iaea - was dangerous . " the unbearable rabble-rousing of the iranian president -lrb- mahmoud ahmadinejad -rrb- against israel also speaks volumes , " she said in the article . focusing on climate change , merkel urged german citizens and the industry to do everything in their power to protect the environment .
she noted that the new energy and climate package passed by the german government at the beginning of december was the " most comprehensive scheme to reduce greenhouse gases in the world . " merkel said it was now up to consumers and the industry to put the measures into action , and pointed out that the demand for climate-protecting innovations would further anchor germany 's role as a technology leader . in domestic matters , she said more economic reforms were on the way for the country in 2008 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime german plan to criminalize teen sex put on back burner crime -pipe- 28.12.2007 politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how tough should germany be on its young offenders ?
following a brutal attack on a pensioner by two foreign youths on the munich underground , germany 's conservative politicians want tougher laws or even deportation for perpetrators . the 76-year-old retired school director was assaulted last week after asking two youths , one turkish and one greek , not to smoke in the underground .
it was a request which left the pensioner seriously injured and has sparked furious debate among politicians on how germany should best deal with its wayward youth .
several politicians from germany 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- say the attack shows that the time has come to re-evaluate the treatment of young offenders and moreover , agressive young foreigners living in germany .
in an interview with the mass-circulation bild newspaper , the state premier for hesse , roland koch said young foreigners were too quick to use violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse state premier roland koch " zero tolerance of violence should be an integral part of our integration policy , " he said adding that germany had , up until now , shown a " strange sociological understanding " for violent members of ethnic minority groups .
" people who live in germany should behave in a decent manner and refrain from violence , " koch said .
" those who ca n't live according to our rules , are in the wrong place . "
suitable punishment wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the christian democratic union 's parliamentary group is also in favor of tougher measures against young offenders .
he told the online version of der spiegel news magazine was time for germany to stop thinking it could prevent recidivism with " social-therapeutic " measures .
he said offenders with " serious criminal energy " should be suitably punished rather than packed off on " sailing trips around the aegean . "
bosbach argues that young foreign criminals should be faced with more than just time behind bars .
" the most frightening prospect for young offenders is deportation , " he said , adding that a sentence of one year imprisonment without probation should be enough for a deportation .
he criticized the current system for making expulsion unnecessarily difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges decide which version of the law to use both koch and bosbach said it was time to remove the kid gloves when dealing with criminals aged between 18 and 21 .
under current german law , a judge can decide on a case-by-case basis whether an offender should be tried according to adult or juvenile law .
bosbach said the use of the latter for felons in that age group should be " the absolute exception " .
koch told the bild newspaper that young offenders should not be treated with understanding .
" prison has to be felt to have the desired effect . "
sentencing youths is a balancing act but social democrat domestic policy expert dieter wiefelspütz has warned against a rash tightening of juvenile criminal law .
in an interview with the web site , he said the fact that the culprits behind last week 's tragic and brutal incident had already been caught and were now looking at weighty sentences , was proof enough that the law did not need to be overhauled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does being behind bars solve the problem ?
however , wiefelspütz said dealing with juvenile criminals is always a balancing act which requires making a choice between locking an offender away or offering them the chance of re-socialization .
he said it would be wrong to impose tough sentences across the board for youth violence .
" the constitutional state has the appropriate instruments and it knows how to use them , " the politician concluded . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the classical division between inner and foreign policy is outdated , " wrote angela merkel in an op-ed piece , published in the german business daily handelsblatt on firday , dec .
28 . " we must make sure that we - as european and atlantic partners - show solidarity for each other and that we do n't let anybody drive a wedge between us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the latest kosovo resolution of the serbian parliament will complicate its relations with the eu in her article , which was both a look back at 2007 and a view to the upcoming new year , the chancellor stressed europe 's role in helping to decide the fate of the serbian breakaway province of kosovo . " europe has a responsibility to find a solution , " she wrote .
" the solution must offer clarity for the entire region and provide the opportunity for stability and security , thereby creating the foundation for a positive future . " she cautioned against further hesitation by the european union , noting that all past attempts at resolving negotiations between serbia and kosovo 's albanian majority had failed . both the united states and a number of eu countries have indicated they will recognize an expected unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo albanians , after the failure of almost two years of un-sponsored negotiations on the southern serbian province 's status . serbia , in turn , has threatened to reject any offer of membership in the european union if the 27-member block recognized the secessionist province as an independent state tense relations with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an up-and-down political relationship : merkel with russian president vladimir putin the chancellor also referred to nato 's tense relations with russia and spoke of the need to avoid opening up more rifts between the two sides . she appealed to both parties to use the time between now at the nato summit in romania in april 2008 to move closer to resolving the most important issues , including those of special interest to russia . these include the planned us missile shield in poland and the czech republic as well as well as russia 's decision to suspend compliance with the conventional forces in europe arms control treaty . " nato and the united states in particular have gone a far way to towards addressing moscow 's concerns in the past few months , " merkel said . the chancellor said she saw russia as a partner as well as a neighbour and hoped that relations would become closer and grow in importance , stressing , however , the need for a society based on law and justice . " the development of stable constitutional and democratic structures remains essential , " she wrote , noting that she would also discuss the issue with the new russian president . iran and the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel traveled to greenland in august to learn more about global warming on a broader scale , merkel said heading off the prospect of a nuclear-armed iran remained a " vital interest " for the world community . she wrote that iran 's nuclear program is still " one of our biggest security policy concerns , " and said iran 's refusal to suspend its uranium enrichment activities - as demanded by the united nations security council and the nuclear watchdog agency iaea - was dangerous . " the unbearable rabble-rousing of the iranian president -lrb- mahmoud ahmadinejad -rrb- against israel also speaks volumes , " she said in the article . focusing on climate change , merkel urged german citizens and the industry to do everything in their power to protect the environment .
she noted that the new energy and climate package passed by the german government at the beginning of december was the " most comprehensive scheme to reduce greenhouse gases in the world . " merkel said it was now up to consumers and the industry to put the measures into action , and pointed out that the demand for climate-protecting innovations would further anchor germany 's role as a technology leader . in domestic matters , she said more economic reforms were on the way for the country in 2008 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

following a brutal attack on a pensioner by two foreign youths on the munich underground , germany 's conservative politicians want tougher laws or even deportation for perpetrators . the 76-year-old retired school director was assaulted last week after asking two youths , one turkish and one greek , not to smoke in the underground .
it was a request which left the pensioner seriously injured and has sparked furious debate among politicians on how germany should best deal with its wayward youth .
several politicians from germany 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- say the attack shows that the time has come to re-evaluate the treatment of young offenders and moreover , agressive young foreigners living in germany .
in an interview with the mass-circulation bild newspaper , the state premier for hesse , roland koch said young foreigners were too quick to use violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse state premier roland koch " zero tolerance of violence should be an integral part of our integration policy , " he said adding that germany had , up until now , shown a " strange sociological understanding " for violent members of ethnic minority groups .
" people who live in germany should behave in a decent manner and refrain from violence , " koch said .
" those who ca n't live according to our rules , are in the wrong place . "
suitable punishment wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the christian democratic union 's parliamentary group is also in favor of tougher measures against young offenders .
he told the online version of der spiegel news magazine was time for germany to stop thinking it could prevent recidivism with " social-therapeutic " measures .
he said offenders with " serious criminal energy " should be suitably punished rather than packed off on " sailing trips around the aegean . "
bosbach argues that young foreign criminals should be faced with more than just time behind bars .
" the most frightening prospect for young offenders is deportation , " he said , adding that a sentence of one year imprisonment without probation should be enough for a deportation .
he criticized the current system for making expulsion unnecessarily difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judges decide which version of the law to use both koch and bosbach said it was time to remove the kid gloves when dealing with criminals aged between 18 and 21 .
under current german law , a judge can decide on a case-by-case basis whether an offender should be tried according to adult or juvenile law .
bosbach said the use of the latter for felons in that age group should be " the absolute exception " .
koch told the bild newspaper that young offenders should not be treated with understanding .
" prison has to be felt to have the desired effect . "
sentencing youths is a balancing act but social democrat domestic policy expert dieter wiefelspütz has warned against a rash tightening of juvenile criminal law .
in an interview with the web site , he said the fact that the culprits behind last week 's tragic and brutal incident had already been caught and were now looking at weighty sentences , was proof enough that the law did not need to be overhauled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does being behind bars solve the problem ?
however , wiefelspütz said dealing with juvenile criminals is always a balancing act which requires making a choice between locking an offender away or offering them the chance of re-socialization .
he said it would be wrong to impose tough sentences across the board for youth violence .

1 .
while legislators see the ban as a pillar of consumer protection , critics say the accord only serves to protect the state monopoly on lotteries . all 16 german state legislatures voted by mid-december to approve the new law which seeks to prevent any form of web-based gambling or brokering of games over the internet . the law also encompasses placing bets from germany to a gaming company abroad .
the new legislation grants states the power to demand internet service providers to block web sites that promote betting .
banks may also be ordered to stop money transfers for gambling transactions . internet betting companies and lottery brokers like bwin interactive entertainment , fluxx and tipp24 have criticized the new regulations and claimed that the ban is contrary to law . tipp24 has said it will pursue a lawsuit if necessary , while bwin already sued four german states in october seeking to continue offering online bets after the rules come into effect .
the cases are pending . legal loophole ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these men merely enjoy card games with the computer bwin operates a betting site under a license issued by the former communist east german government before unification and another portal under a gibraltar license . the company has said that both of those licenses prevail over the new online-betting ban and stressed that it would continue to operate its sites . the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , has called on germany to reconsider the complete ban on online betting .
in april , germany rejected the demand , claiming that citizens must be protected from the dangers of gambling . the commission has the power to sue any eu member state to force them to comply with eu law . until now , 13 of germany 's 16 states have submitted the ratification documents for the ban to take effect , creating the required majority .
the other three states are expected to submit their papers by new year 's eve . the new law will also prohibit the advertising of gambling over the internet and on television ; specifically , advertising in print and other media may only " inform " people about betting possibilities , and may no longer " directly invite , incite or prompt " customers to play . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

adrian lort-phillips , from pembrokeshire , entered the plymouth-banjul challenge despite his wife rachel hicks expressing concern .
but he later learned she had secretly also signed up for the charity rally securing an old range rover , formerly used as a chicken coop , for her ride .
the rally to banjul , the gambian capital , may take up to 24 days .
when they reach their destination , the vehicles will be auctioned off to raise money for local causes such as businesses and schools .
the cars will also be donated for use by local people and the competitors will fly home .
the couple are starting their journey from their home in lawrenny before driving to plymouth , where they will take the ferry to france .
if he gets in any scrapes he 'll probably call for help like he usually does !
rachel hicks after driving to spain , they will continue on to morocco and places including mauretania and senegal and across the sahara desert before reaching gambia .
when mr lort-phillips , 35 , who is driving a jeep cherokee wagon , entered the rally in the summer he believed he was doing so against his wife 's wishes .
but weeks later he discovered she had also secretly bought a wreck and entered the challenge herself .
he recalled : " i had a call from my co-driver .
he said he thought there was a mistake on the lists and that somehow my name had been entered twice .
" but when i saw the name and the listed co-driver i realised i 'd been out-manoeuvred . "
fierce rivalry mr lort-phillips then found photographs of an old range rover on his computer and his wife admitted she and a friend had been plotting for weeks .
one of the rules of the rally is that the cars must cost less than £ 100 .
ms hicks , 36 , also roped in some extra help from the motor vehicle students at pembrokeshire college , who have been preparing the range rover for its epic journey .
she said : " they dragged it out of the barn where it was being used as a chicken coop .
for three months , they 've been doing it up . "
rivalry between the couple has become fierce and both have kept their preparations a closely guarded secret , including the route they plan to take .
among the potential challenges they face are inhospitable desert and even minefields .
ms hicks , who is chief executive of pembrokeshire tourism , said : " adrian wanted to have the adventure for himself , so why should n't i be able to do it ? "
" if he gets in any scrapes he 'll probably call for help like he usually does ! "
more than 200 vehicles from around the world will take part in this year 's challenge and more than £ 100,000 is expected to be raised for charity .

meanwhile , powys council has written to the firm asking for a meeting to discuss the plans to close the shop on 12 january .
the laura ashley company has been asked for a comment .

llanidloes mayor david jones and town county councillor gareth morgan said the firm had tried to close the shop in the past .
the fight is not over yet : llanidloes does n't give up easily mayor david jones the great oak street premises in llanidloes are expected to shut for the last time on 12 january .
it was the first laura ashley store to open in wales in 1976 .
mr morgan said : " a letter has gone from powys county council and from the welsh assembly government asking them to meet representatives from the county to discuss the situation and to reconsider .
" preferably they could come down and meet us , but we are happy to meet them anywhere to discuss it .
" and i hope this time we can persuade them that they should change their minds , as we did on a previous occasion .
" on no account are we going to cave in .
we are going to fight this very very hard because it 's a vitally important retail outfit for the town . "
town mayor mr jones said the news had been a " real blow " to laura ashley staff in llanidloes .
he added : " the fight is not over yet : llanidloes does n't give up easily . "
by 1981 , when the firm moved into home furnishings , it had 5,000 retail outlets worldwide .

rickets is a bone disease mainly caused by a lack of the vitamin .
it can lead to deformities , stunted growth and general ill-health .
some minority ethnic groups in the uk , including asians , are particularly at risk , says the department of health .
doctors want pregnant women to take more vitamin d during winter months .
it is made by the skin in response to sunlight , but can also be found in certain foods .
officials are urging women to check if they are eligible for free supplements from their gp or health visitor under the government 's healthy start scheme .
it provides vitamin d-rich milk and fresh fruit and vegetables as well as supplements for those on benefits or women who are under the age of 18 years old and pregnant .
ultraviolet light common at the start of the last century , rickets was thought to be eradicated in the 1950s because of better nutrition .
but research suggests the incidence of rickets could be as high as one in 100 children among asian , afro-caribbean and middle eastern ethnic minority groups .
dark-skinned people do not absorb as much sunlight through the skin and may also wear clothing that limits exposure to the sun for cultural reasons . "
mothers and babies are simply not getting enough of this important vitamin " paediatrician dr colin michie most people in the uk should get enough vitamin d from sunlight - it only takes 15 minutes of sun exposure to the arms , head and shoulders each day during the summer months to make enough vitamin d for good health .
but in winter months at latitudes of 52 degrees north -lrb- above birmingham -rrb- , there is no ultraviolet light of the appropriate wavelength for the body to make vitamin d in the skin , research shows .
there have been several reports of a " resurgence " of rickets in recent years .
in june 2007 , doctors in dundee said they had seen several cases and warned that guidelines on vitamin d for pregnant women were being ignored .
free supplements health minister dawn primarolo said the healthy start scheme was designed to improve the health of the most vulnerable families .
" we encourage people who are eligible to take advantage of the free vitamins , to minimise the risk of developing vitamin d deficiency and other conditions .
" we particularly encourage women who are pregnant or breastfeeding to take vitamin d , to protect the health and wellbeing of their baby and help them get the best possible start in life . "
she added that children under the age of four may also benefit from a supplement containing 10 micrograms of vitamin d. dr colin michie , a paediatrician at ealing hospital , says the biggest problem is maternal shortage of vitamin d.
" mothers and babies are simply not getting enough of this important vitamin .
" if a pregnant or breastfeeding woman is lacking in vitamin d , the baby will also have low vitamin d and calcium levels which can lead babies to develop seizures in the first months of life . "

rickets is a bone disease mainly caused by a lack of the vitamin .
it can lead to deformities , stunted growth and general ill-health .
some minority ethnic groups in the uk , including asians , are particularly at risk , says the department of health .
doctors want pregnant women to take more vitamin d during winter months .
it is made by the skin in response to sunlight , but can also be found in certain foods .
officials are urging women to check if they are eligible for free supplements from their gp or health visitor under the government 's healthy start scheme .
it provides vitamin d-rich milk and fresh fruit and vegetables as well as supplements for those on benefits or women who are under the age of 18 years old and pregnant .
ultraviolet light common at the start of the last century , rickets was thought to be eradicated in the 1950s because of better nutrition .
but research suggests the incidence of rickets could be as high as one in 100 children among asian , afro-caribbean and middle eastern ethnic minority groups .
dark-skinned people do not absorb as much sunlight through the skin and may also wear clothing that limits exposure to the sun for cultural reasons .
mothers and babies are simply not getting enough of this important vitamin paediatrician dr colin michie most people in the uk should get enough vitamin d from sunlight - it only takes 15 minutes of sun exposure to the arms , head and shoulders each day during the summer months to make enough vitamin d for good health .
but in winter months at latitudes of 52 degrees north -lrb- above birmingham -rrb- , there is no ultraviolet light of the appropriate wavelength for the body to make vitamin d in the skin , research shows .
there have been several reports of a " resurgence " of rickets in recent years .
in june 2007 , doctors in dundee said they had seen several cases and warned that guidelines on vitamin d for pregnant women were being ignored .
free supplements health minister dawn primarolo said the healthy start scheme was designed to improve the health of the most vulnerable families .
" we encourage people who are eligible to take advantage of the free vitamins , to minimise the risk of developing vitamin d deficiency and other conditions .
" we particularly encourage women who are pregnant or breastfeeding to take vitamin d , to protect the health and wellbeing of their baby and help them get the best possible start in life . "
she added that children under the age of four may also benefit from a supplement containing 10 micrograms of vitamin d. dr colin michie , a paediatrician at ealing hospital , says the biggest problem is maternal shortage of vitamin d.
" mothers and babies are simply not getting enough of this important vitamin .
" if a pregnant or breastfeeding woman is lacking in vitamin d , the baby will also have low vitamin d and calcium levels which can lead babies to develop seizures in the first months of life . "

it has been called by dick penny , who is expected to succeed rupert rhymes as chairman of the theatre 's trustees .
mr rhymes resigned earlier this month .
the theatre was temporarily closed in august for a £ 7m refit , despite bosses still needing £ 2m to pay for the work .
fundraisers said the public open forum on 10 january would clarify the cash crisis and construct a recovery plan .
theatre bosses admitted earlier this year that finances were at the " brink of failure " .
in june , a £ 2m fundraising campaign began to make up the shortfall for the upgrade .
later , a host of britain 's best-known actors , writers and directors signed a letter of support to help save the old vic .
concerns were raised that the company could " fade away " during the 15-month refit .
we can stop this assault on our heritage and safeguard its future if we stand up and be counted juliette taylor january 's meeting will be attended by representatives of the actor 's union , equity , local mps and councillors .
juliette taylor , from the royal shakespeare company , who was a former stage manager at the old vic , said : " i would encourage the people of bristol and the south west to attend if at all possible .
" this is our opportunity to demonstrate an interest and support in saving this historic building and the future of our world famous bristol old vic theatre company .

repairing the space shuttle 's faulty fuel sensor system will probably postpone columbus ' arrival at the orbital outpost to late january or february .
but space station programme manager mike suffredini said on thursday that nasa would still like to see europe 's automated transfer vehicle , known as the jules verne , lift off as planned in mid-to-late february .
nasa had hoped to launch atlantis and a joint us-european crew on a mission to deliver and install columbus earlier this month .
but problems with fuel sensors forced the us space agency to cancel two launch attempts . "
this is a big challenge for all of us " leopold eyharts , atlantis crewmember the sensors are part of a backup emergency system to cut off the shuttle 's three main engines if they run out of hydrogen fuel before the ship reaches orbit .
running the engines without fuel could trigger a catastrophic explosion .
' launch and loiter ' fixing what is suspected to be a faulty electrical plug in the sensor system is likely to delay atlantis ' launch by several days or weeks , the shuttle programme manager said .
nevertheless , the jules verne can launch and , if necessary , remain idle in orbit for two weeks before docking at the space station .
" we can launch and loiter if we need to , " mr suffredini said .
programme managers are looking at docking the jules verne to the station between 15 and 23 march , or between 27 march and 2 april .
the capsule will haul about seven tones of cargo to the outpost .
jules verne 's launch and docking will be integrated into the timelines of the next two planned shuttle missions - the upcoming flight of atlantis with columbus , and endeavour 's flight , originally targeted for 14 february , with part of japan 's kibo laboratory complex .
speaking about the atv jules verne , european astronaut leopold eyharts said : " this is the first time a module built in europe , launched by europe , will make a rendezvous and docking in space ; so this is a big challenge for all of us . "
eyharts himself is scheduled for what may be an abbreviated stay on the station between the atlantis and endeavour flights .
launching with eyharts on atlantis will be germany 's hans schlegel , who will be making two spacewalks during the mission to install the columbus laboratory .

rail maritime and transport union -lrb- rmt -rrb- said the workers ' demand for a " london living wage " of £ 7.20 per hour has recieved support from 40 mps .
currently 500 cleaners , who are employed by contractor tube lines for london underground , are paid £ 5.52 .
last month 900 cleaners working for collapsed maintenance firm metronet were assured the " london living wage " .
the hourly pay of £ 7.20 for these workers is expected to come into effect in january when the firm is taken over by transport for london .
rmt said a motion supporting the demand for an increase was tabled in the commons by labour mp john mcdonnell -lrb- hayes and harlington -rrb- .
it was signed by at least 40 mps .
rmt general secreatry bob crow said : " now that cleaners working on metronet contracts are to get paid £ 7.20 an hour , it is time that tube lines started paying a living wage . "
mr crow added the pay rise would cost tube lines less than £ 2m a year .

the 24-year-old star spent the night in police cells in bergen in october , but she was released after she paid 500 euros -lrb- £ 350 ; $ 714 -rrb- .
winehouse 's father , mitch , has said a conviction would affect her chances of getting a us visa , harming her career .
the singer will challenge the charges in the city on 29 february , according to the afp news agency .
" i can confirm that she must appear in court , " said bergen police spokeswoman liv karlsen .
" if one appeals -lsb- against -rsb- a conviction , it 's the rule that one has to appear in person , so this is not surprising . "
' tricked ' winehouse , her husband blake fielder-civil and a third person were arrested at a hotel after being found with 7g -lrb- 0.25oz -rrb- of cannabis .
she was held overnight and , according to her spokesman , was released without charge after paying the fine .
speaking on itv 's this morning programme later that month , mitch winehouse claimed the drugs did not belong to his daughter .
he also said she had been duped into signing a confession , which she believed was a release form .
police in norway insisted they were sure she knew what she was signing , and that fluent english speakers had helped her .
the singer , who wrote a hit song about her refusal to enter rehab , has endured a battle with drugs and alcohol under the scrutiny of the tabloid press .
her 25-year-old husband is currently being held on remand in london on charges of attempting to pervert the course of justice .

the eco-deco plant takes household waste and breaks it down into five re-usable components .
the plant shreds and dries household waste and puts it through a complex system of sieves , fans and magnets to separate out reusable material .
it isolates ferrous and non-ferrous metals , glass and stone for use as aggregate and gathers compost material .
the plant is run under contract for dumfries and galloway council by shanks waste management .
the council said it has already trebled the amount of waste being diverted from landfill .
