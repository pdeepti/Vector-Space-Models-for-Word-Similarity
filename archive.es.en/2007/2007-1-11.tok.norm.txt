europeans responded with skepticism about his priorities . the new strategy announced late wednesday provides for an increase in the number of troops fighting in iraq , from the current level of 132,000 , in a push to quell sectarian violence . berlin 's coordinator for german-us relations , karsten voigt , said he hoped bush 's " new way forward " would prove effective but doubted he would achieve his goal of securing a stable democracy in iraq . " we 've seen that the president tends to be over-optimistic , " he said . conspicuously absent from the new approach was any call for greater diplomacy with neighbors such as syria - an omission that drew criticism from foreign policy experts in germany who would have preferred to see the us actively include iraq 's neighbors in attempts to stabilize the region . " i would have welcomed an invitation to syria to involve itself constructively , " said conservative politician eckart von klaeden of chancellor merkel 's cdu on german radio . military aggression not the answer elmar brok , head of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee , said he doubted that extra troops could contain the country 's spiraling sectarian violence .
he also regretted the lack of focus on training local forces and that the new budget earmarked too little for economic development . " a key priority should be training iraqi soldiers and police and doing more for economic restructuring , " he said . " the situation can not be resolved by more military intervention , " agreed the social democrats ' foreign policy expert , gert weisskirchen .
" his strategy emphasizes an approach that can no longer help . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy also stressed that only a " political strategy " could restore stability to iraq . " the situation in iraq is getting heavily worse , day after day , " douste-blazy , whose country was one of the bitterest opponents of the us-led invasion in 2003 , told a press conference .
" it is through a global approach , a political strategy , that it will be possible to restore stability to iraq , and beyond iraq to the wider region , " he said . " beyond the proposals made by president george bush , we believe the only way for iraq to retrieve its stability , its sovereignty , its territorial integrity and its national unity is through the participation of all civilian , political and religious components of iraqi society . " european reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can more troops help stem the violence ?
swedish foreign minister carl bildt also criticized the new strategy for failing to tackle political issues in the violence-wracked country . " -lrb- the speech -rrb- was significantly lighter on the major political challenges -lrb- in iraq -rrb- .
they were mentioned only in passing or hardly at all , " bildt told swedish national radio sr . bildt stressed the importance of the distribution of iraq 's oil wealth , the inclusion of different groups of the population in the political process and the engagement of iraq 's neighbors to stabilize the country . " this is a more limited initiative than what i think was required , " bildt said . bildt was guarded on the us president 's plan to send additional troops into iraq . " that 's a tactical military decision that foreign ministers in distant countries have a very limited chance of judging , " bildt told swedish news agency tt . " bush is throwing oil on the fire " by sending 21,500 " new rambos " to iraq , wrote the socialist ethnos newspaper in greece . " the march of folly " meanwhile , britain 's the independent declared " the march of folly is to continue ... " on its frontpage .
" so into the graveyard of iraq , george bush , the commander-in-chief , is to send another 21,000 of his soldiers , " it wrote . more than 3,000 us soldiers have died in iraq since the march 2003 invasion . the strategy however won approval from the times of london as a valid , last-ditch attempt to put iraq on the path towards stability . " the new iraq strategy involves serious risks but is better than the alternative , " the times wrote .
while acknowledging that more americans will die in iraq as a result , the times added : " it is right , nevertheless , to make one more effort to create the sort of iraq that its people deserve and the vast majority of its citizens aspire to . " the left-leaning liberation daily in france asserted that " the dispatch of 20,000 additional soldiers to iraq will not correct the insurgency and fighting . " " since victory is not within reach , the aim has been reduced to the maximum , " wrote the right-wing figaro , adding that washington has now set its sights on securing control of the capital baghdad . italy 's corriere della sera noted that key regional players iran and syria were not invited to take part in the solution . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany offers to aid us in building ties to syria , iran germany has said it would like to support the us in creating a dialog with iran and syria and help it meet the recommendations in the newly released us baker commission 's report on iraq .

" open societies mean living and talking together and not being separated from each other .
and to that extent the burqa is an element that hinders communication . " " we are in favor of not having the burqa , " he added .
" we want the muslim community to be well and at ease in the european union , " he stressed , " but also accept the structures and legal setup in europe . " " enlightening " muslims his comments , to a group of brussels-based journalists , came days after germany assumed the rotating eu presidency and as he prepared to host an informal meeting of eu justice and interior ministers in dresden next week . " there are still parts of the muslim world where historical enlightenment still needs to be implemented , " he said .
" we all know what terrible centuries there were in europe before the enlightenment , " he added . he advocated training imams , saying that " imams should contribute to integration . "
" this may be a way to make a contribution to ensuring that given the whole diverse aspect of islam we strengthen those who can live with the european rule of law , universal rights and the achievements of the enlightenment , " he said . following in straw 's footsteps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw while saying that the question of headscarves was a personal one , he took up a similar position to former british foreign secretary jack straw against the burqa - who outraged british muslims last year by telling the bbc that he would prefer that muslim women not wear the nikab , or face veil . more than three million muslims live in germany , and schäuble said that now 20 percent of the german population had a " migratory background . " schäuble stressed the need to increase dialogue with muslims within the eu and admitted that there were still some " deficits " regarding integration in germany . " we understand that islam is part of germany with equal rights , " said the minister .
" but that also means they need to accept the fundamental rights and obligations of our society . " " anyone who can not accept the equality of men and women has not even come close to meeting one of the basic conditions for the 21st century , " he insisted . in europe in general " we do need to improve integration as a whole but we need to prevent parallel societies from emerging , " he added . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government launches dialogue with muslims the german muslim community embarked wednesday on its first collective talks with the government in berlin , with both sides saying there had been frank differences but they were keen to get down to detail .

the movie , which opens to nationwide release on thursday , has been criticized by many jewish leaders in germany and switzerland .

in his attempt to give germans " new images , " he lampoons the dictator as an impotent bed wetter who had a traumatic childhood .
meanwhile , shortly before the film opened , stephan j. kramer , the general secretary of the central council of jews in germany , roundly criticized the film and levy 's attempt to demystify hitler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler is portrayed as a pathetic oddball who plays with battleships in his bubble bath laughing over a hitler is " neither taboo nor forbidden , " he said .
but he pointed out that hitler satires by charlie chaplin , ernst lubitsch and mel brooks , with their " subtle , ironic and sarcastic humor , " had little to do with levy 's " broad , thigh-slapping " comedy style . anti-semitism warning more importantly , those films were not made in germany , " and probably for good reason , because germany is the home of the holocaust , " he said . " hitler was not just a humorous figure with a tragic childhood ... he does n't deserve any mitigating circumstances or pity .
the mass murder of millions of people in europe ca n't be separated from hitler 's own person , " kramer said . " given the growing anti-semitism in europe , the film ' mein führer ' is unnecessary and even dangerous , " he added . it is unclear whether german audiences are ready for , or even interested in the move .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 11.01.2007 jewish opinion divided over new hitler comedy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : courting controversy : director dani levy stands between the film 's stars at the premiere jewish groups are split on " mein führer , " germany 's first home-grown comedy film about the former dictator .
critics debated the wisdom of portraying hitler as a buffoon - and the difficulty of making him funny . is dani levy 's hitler comedy " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " just a further development in a long tradition of satirical ' jewish ' humor ?
or is it a tasteless , belittling , and ultimately dangerous attempt to approach a subject best left to historians ? the answers vary .
the movie , which opens to nationwide release on thursday , has been criticized by many jewish leaders in germany and switzerland .
many think he idea of a german film sending up hitler is unconscionable and breaks a taboo better left in place . but others , noting numerous trailblazing films from charlie chaplin 's " the great dictator " through roberto begnini 's " life is beautiful , " said there was no reason germans , too , could not look at the dictator , who , it can be argued , has many rather ridiculous qualities , through the lens of laughter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : levy : making a name as a voice of jewish film in germany " ' mein führer ' lies in a well-established tradition of jewish comedy , from mel brooks through ernst lubitsch through seinfeld , " said yves kugelmann , editor in chief of aufbau , a switzerland-based monthly german-language magazine about jewish culture . hitler as ' pop figure ' " the fact that a comedy about hitler can be made in germany can be seen as very positive , " kugelmann said .
" it is absolutely correct and absolutely important to make movies like this .
you could call it a sign of emancipation . " in theory , he said , a comedy about hitler is an improvement on the steady flow of gravely serious programs - often detailing specific aspects hitler 's life and those of his nazi cohorts - that regularly feature on german television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the sets for scenes on berlin streets sparked controversy during filming " those documentaries - on hitler 's dogs , his women , his impotency - they all serve to make him into a monumental pop figure , " he said .
" this is problematic because they lead to the cult of a person . " while noting that " anyone who sees this film and has n't read anne frank has a problem , " kugelmann said that depicting hitler in a comedy " could be the only way to come to terms with reality . " " it raises the question of hitler 's success in the greater society , " he said .
" it shows him in his surroundings , among those who followed him and those who simply did n't oppose him .
it asks them , ' how did you get there ? " ' missed opportunity indeed , kugelmann 's biggest cricitism of the movie was that it failed to make the most of the opportunity . " it was provocative , sure , but it did n't go far enough into satire .

11 , the white house has upheld the belief that when it comes to the war on terror , the end justifies the means .
apparently convinced that international terrorism can not be combated by legal means , the bush administration five years ago began flying suspects to this remote naval base camp in southeast cuba - located far from the world 's prying eyes , and equally far from the rule of law . in 2002 , the first detainees captured in the us-led war on terror were flown to guantanamo bay . in subsequent years , over 700 prisoners have been held here without being charged . but guantanamo - or camp delta as it is also known - is no normal prison . more like prisoners of war than prisoners , the inmates crucially lack this status in terms of international law .
instead , the us government classifies them as " illegal combatants , " which means that they do not have to be conferred the rights granted to pows under the geneva convention . lawless prison bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz in its early days , guantanamo bay was a sordid detention camp in which prisoners were kept in cages and routinely humiliated . today , conditions at camp x-ray and the recently opened camp 6 are no different to high-tech prisons in the western world .

europeans responded with skepticism about his priorities . the new strategy announced late wednesday provides for an increase in the number of troops fighting in iraq , from the current level of 132,000 , in a push to quell sectarian violence . berlin 's coordinator for german-us relations , karsten voigt , said he hoped bush 's " new way forward " would prove effective but doubted he would achieve his goal of securing a stable democracy in iraq . " we 've seen that the president tends to be over-optimistic , " he said . conspicuously absent from the new approach was any call for greater diplomacy with neighbors such as syria - an omission that drew criticism from foreign policy experts in germany who would have preferred to see the us actively include iraq 's neighbors in attempts to stabilize the region . " i would have welcomed an invitation to syria to involve itself constructively , " said conservative politician eckart von klaeden of chancellor merkel 's cdu on german radio . military aggression not the answer elmar brok , head of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee , said he doubted that extra troops could contain the country 's spiraling sectarian violence .
he also regretted the lack of focus on training local forces and that the new budget earmarked too little for economic development . " a key priority should be training iraqi soldiers and police and doing more for economic restructuring , " he said . " the situation can not be resolved by more military intervention , " agreed the social democrats ' foreign policy expert , gert weisskirchen .
" his strategy emphasizes an approach that can no longer help . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy also stressed that only a " political strategy " could restore stability to iraq . " the situation in iraq is getting heavily worse , day after day , " douste-blazy , whose country was one of the bitterest opponents of the us-led invasion in 2003 , told a press conference .
" it is through a global approach , a political strategy , that it will be possible to restore stability to iraq , and beyond iraq to the wider region , " he said . " beyond the proposals made by president george bush , we believe the only way for iraq to retrieve its stability , its sovereignty , its territorial integrity and its national unity is through the participation of all civilian , political and religious components of iraqi society . " european reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can more troops help stem the violence ?
swedish foreign minister carl bildt also criticized the new strategy for failing to tackle political issues in the violence-wracked country . " -lrb- the speech -rrb- was significantly lighter on the major political challenges -lrb- in iraq -rrb- .
they were mentioned only in passing or hardly at all , " bildt told swedish national radio sr . bildt stressed the importance of the distribution of iraq 's oil wealth , the inclusion of different groups of the population in the political process and the engagement of iraq 's neighbors to stabilize the country . " this is a more limited initiative than what i think was required , " bildt said . bildt was guarded on the us president 's plan to send additional troops into iraq . " that 's a tactical military decision that foreign ministers in distant countries have a very limited chance of judging , " bildt told swedish news agency tt . " bush is throwing oil on the fire " by sending 21,500 " new rambos " to iraq , wrote the socialist ethnos newspaper in greece . " the march of folly " meanwhile , britain 's the independent declared " the march of folly is to continue ... " on its frontpage .
" so into the graveyard of iraq , george bush , the commander-in-chief , is to send another 21,000 of his soldiers , " it wrote . more than 3,000 us soldiers have died in iraq since the march 2003 invasion . the strategy however won approval from the times of london as a valid , last-ditch attempt to put iraq on the path towards stability . " the new iraq strategy involves serious risks but is better than the alternative , " the times wrote .

europeans responded with skepticism about his priorities . the new strategy announced late wednesday provides for an increase in the number of troops fighting in iraq , from the current level of 132,000 , in a push to quell sectarian violence . berlin 's coordinator for german-us relations , karsten voigt , said he hoped bush 's " new way forward " would prove effective but doubted he would achieve his goal of securing a stable democracy in iraq . " we 've seen that the president tends to be over-optimistic , " he said . conspicuously absent from the new approach was any call for greater diplomacy with neighbors such as syria - an omission that drew criticism from foreign policy experts in germany who would have preferred to see the us actively include iraq 's neighbors in attempts to stabilize the region . " i would have welcomed an invitation to syria to involve itself constructively , " said conservative politician eckart von klaeden of chancellor merkel 's cdu on german radio . military aggression not the answer elmar brok , head of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee , said he doubted that extra troops could contain the country 's spiraling sectarian violence .
he also regretted the lack of focus on training local forces and that the new budget earmarked too little for economic development . " a key priority should be training iraqi soldiers and police and doing more for economic restructuring , " he said . " the situation can not be resolved by more military intervention , " agreed the social democrats ' foreign policy expert , gert weisskirchen .
" his strategy emphasizes an approach that can no longer help . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy also stressed that only a " political strategy " could restore stability to iraq . " the situation in iraq is getting heavily worse , day after day , " douste-blazy , whose country was one of the bitterest opponents of the us-led invasion in 2003 , told a press conference .
" it is through a global approach , a political strategy , that it will be possible to restore stability to iraq , and beyond iraq to the wider region , " he said . " beyond the proposals made by president george bush , we believe the only way for iraq to retrieve its stability , its sovereignty , its territorial integrity and its national unity is through the participation of all civilian , political and religious components of iraqi society . " european reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can more troops help stem the violence ?
swedish foreign minister carl bildt also criticized the new strategy for failing to tackle political issues in the violence-wracked country . " -lrb- the speech -rrb- was significantly lighter on the major political challenges -lrb- in iraq -rrb- .
they were mentioned only in passing or hardly at all , " bildt told swedish national radio sr . bildt stressed the importance of the distribution of iraq 's oil wealth , the inclusion of different groups of the population in the political process and the engagement of iraq 's neighbors to stabilize the country . " this is a more limited initiative than what i think was required , " bildt said . bildt was guarded on the us president 's plan to send additional troops into iraq . " that 's a tactical military decision that foreign ministers in distant countries have a very limited chance of judging , " bildt told swedish news agency tt . " bush is throwing oil on the fire " by sending 21,500 " new rambos " to iraq , wrote the socialist ethnos newspaper in greece .

the us trade representative meets wto director lamy in geneva friday . although often given up for dead , there are indications that the doha round of trade talks could be resuscitated as trade representatives from the eu , the us and japan say they are ready to go back to the table . on wednesday , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson and his japanese counterpart , akira amari , said they were committed to " an early and ambitious final agreement in the doha world trade talks " in a statement released by the eu commission , the european union 's executive arm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson amari 's visit to brussels was the latest in a series of meetings between top trade representatives to breathe life back into the trade talks aimed at lowering barriers on world trade .
the five-year talks all but collapsed last july . us stepping up us trade representative susan schwab will meet the director general of the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , pascal lamy , on friday amid speculation that a deal is close over the stalled trade negotiations . schwab will discuss the current impasse with lamy , the us mission in geneva has confirmed to the afp news agency , following talks in washington earlier this week with mandelson . her talks in geneva follow discussion with top trade officials from brazil , australia and india , as well as with german chancellor angela merkel , whose country holds the presidency of the eu and the group of eight leading industrialized nations . schwab is expected to continue her discussions with other trade officials at the world economic forum in the swiss ski resort of davos , which runs from jan .

the european union also wants the united states to cut subsidies to its own farmers , a move which washington has resisted . the us has called on the europeans and some big developing countries , such as brazil , to cut tariffs further on agricultural imports . the talks were launched with the aim of alleviating poverty and boosting the global economy .
but if agreement is not reached in the next few months , there is a risk of years of further delay .
experts say failure could hurt confidence in the global trading system and trigger a surge of disputes , particularly over agriculture , which has been the main sticking point . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wto trade talks fail amid accusations and recriminations the world trade organization was seeing the benefits of freer global farm trade for developing countries slip from its grasp after the collapse of the doha round trade talks on monday .

instead , the us government classifies them as " illegal combatants , " which means that they do not have to be conferred the rights granted to pows under the geneva convention . lawless prison bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz in its early days , guantanamo bay was a sordid detention camp in which prisoners were kept in cages and routinely humiliated . today , conditions at camp x-ray and the recently opened camp 6 are no different to high-tech prisons in the western world .
cooperative detainees can even earn certain privileges , such as leisurewear , books and videos as well as expensive medical care . but lawlessness is still rife in guantanamo .
incidents of torture and ill treatment are still commonplace , as a recent fbi report documented in detail .
prisoners have been denied access to the koran and menstrual blood has allegedly been smeared in to detainees ' faces , others are beaten and left to lie for hours in their own vomit or urine in rooms where the temperature is either freezing or stifling .
such reports have badly damaged washington 's reputation around the world and fanned the flames of anti-us sentiment among jihadists . both guantanamo and the abu ghraib prison in iraq have become symbols of the country 's lack of humanity and disrespect for international law - in the name of freedom and tolerance . condoning torture the decision to tackle terrorism with methods many see as illegal was taken in the confused aftermath of sept .
11 .
even torture was considered an acceptable and necessary weapon in a war that could only be won with hawkish , unorthodox policies - although the dirty work was done by private agents rather than the cia or the fbi .
according to president bush , the intelligence gathered helped prevent further terrorist attacks and led to the arrest of many a dangerous terrorist . but experts disagree .
a number of guantanamo 's inmates might well be terrorists planning attacks on the us and the free world - not least khalid shaikh mohammed , allegedly the principal architect of the sept .
11 attacks - but others are innocent .
and even if the end did justify the means , the last five years have seen a rise in international terrorism , not a drop . guantanamo is grist to the mill of muslim fundamentalists - and the military hearings that allow prisoners to challenge their detention are not enough to allay anyone 's concerns . the camp does considerably more harm than good to the security interests of the us and its allies - and it should be shut .
but for as long as george w. bush remains in the white house , this will never happen . daniel scheschkewitz is a correspondent for deutsche welle in washington , d.c. daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de amnesty international criticizes germany , eu on human rights human rights organization amnesty international has sharply criticized germany and the european union , saying they lack an interest in human rights .

it will focus on " defending christian values , the family , and european civilization , " eu french national front mep bruno gollnisch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french mep bruno gollnisch founded the new parliamentary group the coalition is made up of a number of extremists who have long sought the chance to forge a political group , which under eu rules must comprise 20 members from at least five different political parties .
the accession of romania and bulgaria to the eu on jan .
1 boosted the ranks of far-right meps in strasbourg , making such a coalition possible . while the 20-odd members represent the european political extreme , their actual power is expected to be very limited .
there are a total of 732 meps in the european parliament . " disturbing show of unity " still , the anti-bigotry activist group anti-defamation league -lrb- adl -rrb- released a statement calling the its 's formation " a disturbing show of unity among bigots . " " we are concerned that the far right is engaging in a show of strength at a time when there is a growing climate of intolerance toward foreigners and minorities on the continent , " adl national director abraham h. foxman said . hannes swoboda , vice president of the european parliament 's socialist group , said the creation of the its is " definitely bad news , " since it gives an essentially disparate group of people a common base .
" until now they were split against each other - they were not so visible and influential , " swoboda noted . " price of democracy " it also gives the group substantial financial , legal and logistical support in the parliament , he said . " de facto , it 's support for not only anti-european , but maybe even racist right-wing propaganda .
and that is of course very negative .
but that is the price of democracy , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alessandra mussolini has said the group is a marriage of necessity " i hope the other political groups , respective of their orientation , will stick together and have a common front against these political attitudes , " swoboda added .
" we should make it clear that their political activities have to be limited by the strong will of other political forces , to demonstrate that europe is for freedom , is for racial equality , and democracy . " mixed bag of politicians should it actually form - on wednesday they had just 17 official signatures in hand , with the promise of three more - the group will most likely be led by the national front 's gollnisch . other members will include six meps from france 's national front , including its leader , jean-marie le pen , and three politicians from flemish nationalist party vlaams belang .
other joiners are italian neo-fascist alessandra mussolini -lrb- benito 's granddaughter -rrb- , andreas mölzer of austria 's xenophobic freedom party , and the uk 's ashley mote . from bulgaria 's attack party came dimitar stoyanov , well known for his anti-semitism and racist baiting of the bulgarian roma community , and a handful of romanian meps from the greater romania party , whose overtly racist and anti-semitic leader , corneliu vadim tudor , had strong ties to nikolai ceausescu . yet , despite their polarizing politics , guillaume durand , a policy analyst at the european policy center think-tank in brussels , played down their actual political strength . the small size of the group " shows just how fragile they are going to be .
it will be enough for one person to leave the group to destroy it , " he said . political mirror indeed , he points out that there is nothing new about having far-right elements in parliament .
" until now their real influence has been close to zero , and frankly this is not going to change , " he asserted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas mölzer was once ejected from austria 's far-right freedom party for extremism " the main reason is that they have no positive agenda .
in the european parliament , if you do n't contribute positively in any way , you just do n't count .
the most you can do is vote against things , " he said . durand said he thought the increased financing " wo n't change much " for the group , but acknowledged that they now will be formally represented in some european parliament organs - such as the conference of presidents - where the extremists previously had no voice . durand denies that the formation of its reflects any serious change in european politics - he argues that extreme right-wingers have always been around . " the european parliament is a political mirror , " he said .
" the fact that we have strong nationalist parties in a number of countries is well known .
it 's just becoming apparent at the eu level in the current account .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 11.01.2007 jewish opinion divided over new hitler comedy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : courting controversy : director dani levy stands between the film 's stars at the premiere jewish groups are split on " mein führer , " germany 's first home-grown comedy film about the former dictator .
critics debated the wisdom of portraying hitler as a buffoon - and the difficulty of making him funny . is dani levy 's hitler comedy " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " just a further development in a long tradition of satirical ' jewish ' humor ?
or is it a tasteless , belittling , and ultimately dangerous attempt to approach a subject best left to historians ? the answers vary .
the movie , which opens to nationwide release on thursday , has been criticized by many jewish leaders in germany and switzerland .
many think he idea of a german film sending up hitler is unconscionable and breaks a taboo better left in place . but others , noting numerous trailblazing films from charlie chaplin 's " the great dictator " through roberto begnini 's " life is beautiful , " said there was no reason germans , too , could not look at the dictator , who , it can be argued , has many rather ridiculous qualities , through the lens of laughter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : levy : making a name as a voice of jewish film in germany " ' mein führer ' lies in a well-established tradition of jewish comedy , from mel brooks through ernst lubitsch through seinfeld , " said yves kugelmann , editor in chief of aufbau , a switzerland-based monthly german-language magazine about jewish culture . hitler as ' pop figure ' " the fact that a comedy about hitler can be made in germany can be seen as very positive , " kugelmann said .
" it is absolutely correct and absolutely important to make movies like this .
you could call it a sign of emancipation . " in theory , he said , a comedy about hitler is an improvement on the steady flow of gravely serious programs - often detailing specific aspects hitler 's life and those of his nazi cohorts - that regularly feature on german television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the sets for scenes on berlin streets sparked controversy during filming " those documentaries - on hitler 's dogs , his women , his impotency - they all serve to make him into a monumental pop figure , " he said .
" this is problematic because they lead to the cult of a person . " while noting that " anyone who sees this film and has n't read anne frank has a problem , " kugelmann said that depicting hitler in a comedy " could be the only way to come to terms with reality . " " it raises the question of hitler 's success in the greater society , " he said .
" it shows him in his surroundings , among those who followed him and those who simply did n't oppose him .
it asks them , ' how did you get there ? " ' missed opportunity indeed , kugelmann 's biggest cricitism of the movie was that it failed to make the most of the opportunity . " it was provocative , sure , but it did n't go far enough into satire .
i think levy lost his nerve and took a moralistic stance , " he said he noted that other films based on the same subject - like chaplin 's " the great dictator " and begnini 's " life is beautiful " - were more daring , and more successful . kugelmann was not the only person to compare the film to " the great dictator . "
lea rosh , the outspoken german publicist best known for her successful campaign to build a holocaust memorial in the center of berlin , told the lübecker nachrichten newspaper : " i don ’ t think it 's possible to make hitler a comic figure , unless you are a genius like charlie chaplin . " hitler : no thigh-slapper levy - whose jewish mother was smuggled from germany into switzerland at age 12 - has called his film " primal scream therapy . "
he has said he thinks germans are ready to laugh about the " pathetic , pitiable and ridiculous " figure of adolf hitler .
in his attempt to give germans " new images , " he lampoons the dictator as an impotent bed wetter who had a traumatic childhood .
meanwhile , shortly before the film opened , stephan j. kramer , the general secretary of the central council of jews in germany , roundly criticized the film and levy 's attempt to demystify hitler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler is portrayed as a pathetic oddball who plays with battleships in his bubble bath laughing over a hitler is " neither taboo nor forbidden , " he said .
but he pointed out that hitler satires by charlie chaplin , ernst lubitsch and mel brooks , with their " subtle , ironic and sarcastic humor , " had little to do with levy 's " broad , thigh-slapping " comedy style . anti-semitism warning more importantly , those films were not made in germany , " and probably for good reason , because germany is the home of the holocaust , " he said . " hitler was not just a humorous figure with a tragic childhood ... he does n't deserve any mitigating circumstances or pity .
the mass murder of millions of people in europe ca n't be separated from hitler 's own person , " kramer said . " given the growing anti-semitism in europe , the film ' mein führer ' is unnecessary and even dangerous , " he added . it is unclear whether german audiences are ready for , or even interested in the move .
a forsa research group for stern magazine showed 56 percent of those asked were opposed to the film , while 35 percent viewed it positively . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitler comedy breaks german taboos is it really all right for germans to laugh about hitler and nazi germany ?

he has said he thinks germans are ready to laugh about the " pathetic , pitiable and ridiculous " figure of adolf hitler .
in his attempt to give germans " new images , " he lampoons the dictator as an impotent bed wetter who had a traumatic childhood .
meanwhile , shortly before the film opened , stephan j. kramer , the general secretary of the central council of jews in germany , roundly criticized the film and levy 's attempt to demystify hitler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler is portrayed as a pathetic oddball who plays with battleships in his bubble bath laughing over a hitler is " neither taboo nor forbidden , " he said .

" hitler was not just a humorous figure with a tragic childhood ... he does n't deserve any mitigating circumstances or pity .

critics debated the wisdom of portraying hitler as a buffoon - and the difficulty of making him funny . is dani levy 's hitler comedy " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " just a further development in a long tradition of satirical ' jewish ' humor ?
or is it a tasteless , belittling , and ultimately dangerous attempt to approach a subject best left to historians ? the answers vary .
the movie , which opens to nationwide release on thursday , has been criticized by many jewish leaders in germany and switzerland .
many think he idea of a german film sending up hitler is unconscionable and breaks a taboo better left in place . but others , noting numerous trailblazing films from charlie chaplin 's " the great dictator " through roberto begnini 's " life is beautiful , " said there was no reason germans , too , could not look at the dictator , who , it can be argued , has many rather ridiculous qualities , through the lens of laughter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : levy : making a name as a voice of jewish film in germany " ' mein führer ' lies in a well-established tradition of jewish comedy , from mel brooks through ernst lubitsch through seinfeld , " said yves kugelmann , editor in chief of aufbau , a switzerland-based monthly german-language magazine about jewish culture . hitler as ' pop figure ' " the fact that a comedy about hitler can be made in germany can be seen as very positive , " kugelmann said .
" it is absolutely correct and absolutely important to make movies like this .
you could call it a sign of emancipation . " in theory , he said , a comedy about hitler is an improvement on the steady flow of gravely serious programs - often detailing specific aspects hitler 's life and those of his nazi cohorts - that regularly feature on german television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the sets for scenes on berlin streets sparked controversy during filming " those documentaries - on hitler 's dogs , his women , his impotency - they all serve to make him into a monumental pop figure , " he said .
" this is problematic because they lead to the cult of a person . " while noting that " anyone who sees this film and has n't read anne frank has a problem , " kugelmann said that depicting hitler in a comedy " could be the only way to come to terms with reality . " " it raises the question of hitler 's success in the greater society , " he said .
" it shows him in his surroundings , among those who followed him and those who simply did n't oppose him .
it asks them , ' how did you get there ? " ' missed opportunity indeed , kugelmann 's biggest cricitism of the movie was that it failed to make the most of the opportunity . " it was provocative , sure , but it did n't go far enough into satire .
i think levy lost his nerve and took a moralistic stance , " he said he noted that other films based on the same subject - like chaplin 's " the great dictator " and begnini 's " life is beautiful " - were more daring , and more successful . kugelmann was not the only person to compare the film to " the great dictator . "
lea rosh , the outspoken german publicist best known for her successful campaign to build a holocaust memorial in the center of berlin , told the lübecker nachrichten newspaper : " i don ’ t think it 's possible to make hitler a comic figure , unless you are a genius like charlie chaplin . " hitler : no thigh-slapper levy - whose jewish mother was smuggled from germany into switzerland at age 12 - has called his film " primal scream therapy . "
he has said he thinks germans are ready to laugh about the " pathetic , pitiable and ridiculous " figure of adolf hitler .
in his attempt to give germans " new images , " he lampoons the dictator as an impotent bed wetter who had a traumatic childhood .
meanwhile , shortly before the film opened , stephan j. kramer , the general secretary of the central council of jews in germany , roundly criticized the film and levy 's attempt to demystify hitler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler is portrayed as a pathetic oddball who plays with battleships in his bubble bath laughing over a hitler is " neither taboo nor forbidden , " he said .
but he pointed out that hitler satires by charlie chaplin , ernst lubitsch and mel brooks , with their " subtle , ironic and sarcastic humor , " had little to do with levy 's " broad , thigh-slapping " comedy style . anti-semitism warning more importantly , those films were not made in germany , " and probably for good reason , because germany is the home of the holocaust , " he said . " hitler was not just a humorous figure with a tragic childhood ... he does n't deserve any mitigating circumstances or pity .
the mass murder of millions of people in europe ca n't be separated from hitler 's own person , " kramer said . " given the growing anti-semitism in europe , the film ' mein führer ' is unnecessary and even dangerous , " he added . it is unclear whether german audiences are ready for , or even interested in the move .
a forsa research group for stern magazine showed 56 percent of those asked were opposed to the film , while 35 percent viewed it positively . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitler comedy breaks german taboos is it really all right for germans to laugh about hitler and nazi germany ?

europeans responded with skepticism about his priorities . the new strategy announced late wednesday provides for an increase in the number of troops fighting in iraq , from the current level of 132,000 , in a push to quell sectarian violence . berlin 's coordinator for german-us relations , karsten voigt , said he hoped bush 's " new way forward " would prove effective but doubted he would achieve his goal of securing a stable democracy in iraq . " we 've seen that the president tends to be over-optimistic , " he said . conspicuously absent from the new approach was any call for greater diplomacy with neighbors such as syria - an omission that drew criticism from foreign policy experts in germany who would have preferred to see the us actively include iraq 's neighbors in attempts to stabilize the region . " i would have welcomed an invitation to syria to involve itself constructively , " said conservative politician eckart von klaeden of chancellor merkel 's cdu on german radio . military aggression not the answer elmar brok , head of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee , said he doubted that extra troops could contain the country 's spiraling sectarian violence .
he also regretted the lack of focus on training local forces and that the new budget earmarked too little for economic development . " a key priority should be training iraqi soldiers and police and doing more for economic restructuring , " he said . " the situation can not be resolved by more military intervention , " agreed the social democrats ' foreign policy expert , gert weisskirchen .
" his strategy emphasizes an approach that can no longer help . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy also stressed that only a " political strategy " could restore stability to iraq . " the situation in iraq is getting heavily worse , day after day , " douste-blazy , whose country was one of the bitterest opponents of the us-led invasion in 2003 , told a press conference .
" it is through a global approach , a political strategy , that it will be possible to restore stability to iraq , and beyond iraq to the wider region , " he said . " beyond the proposals made by president george bush , we believe the only way for iraq to retrieve its stability , its sovereignty , its territorial integrity and its national unity is through the participation of all civilian , political and religious components of iraqi society . " european reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can more troops help stem the violence ?
swedish foreign minister carl bildt also criticized the new strategy for failing to tackle political issues in the violence-wracked country . " -lrb- the speech -rrb- was significantly lighter on the major political challenges -lrb- in iraq -rrb- .
they were mentioned only in passing or hardly at all , " bildt told swedish national radio sr . bildt stressed the importance of the distribution of iraq 's oil wealth , the inclusion of different groups of the population in the political process and the engagement of iraq 's neighbors to stabilize the country . " this is a more limited initiative than what i think was required , " bildt said . bildt was guarded on the us president 's plan to send additional troops into iraq . " that 's a tactical military decision that foreign ministers in distant countries have a very limited chance of judging , " bildt told swedish news agency tt . " bush is throwing oil on the fire " by sending 21,500 " new rambos " to iraq , wrote the socialist ethnos newspaper in greece . " the march of folly " meanwhile , britain 's the independent declared " the march of folly is to continue ... " on its frontpage .
" so into the graveyard of iraq , george bush , the commander-in-chief , is to send another 21,000 of his soldiers , " it wrote . more than 3,000 us soldiers have died in iraq since the march 2003 invasion . the strategy however won approval from the times of london as a valid , last-ditch attempt to put iraq on the path towards stability . " the new iraq strategy involves serious risks but is better than the alternative , " the times wrote .
while acknowledging that more americans will die in iraq as a result , the times added : " it is right , nevertheless , to make one more effort to create the sort of iraq that its people deserve and the vast majority of its citizens aspire to . " the left-leaning liberation daily in france asserted that " the dispatch of 20,000 additional soldiers to iraq will not correct the insurgency and fighting .

europeans responded with skepticism about his priorities . the new strategy announced late wednesday provides for an increase in the number of troops fighting in iraq , from the current level of 132,000 , in a push to quell sectarian violence . berlin 's coordinator for german-us relations , karsten voigt , said he hoped bush 's " new way forward " would prove effective but doubted he would achieve his goal of securing a stable democracy in iraq .

oil was once again reaching germany by thursday morning . the oil dispute between russia and neighboring belarus , which temporarily disrupted supplies headed to western europe and restarted debate over energy security in the european union , appears to be resolved after the presidents of the two countries reached a compromise wednesday to end the stoppage . russian oil begin flowing again to europe through belarusian pipelines on thursday , with oil from the druzhba pipeline reaching poland in the early hours of the morning and germany just hours later , according to the deputy chief executive of russian oil pipeline monopoly transneft , sergei grigoryev , quoted by ria novosti . european leaders said the dispute has undermined the eu 's confidence in russia , with the bloc 's leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel and jose manuel barroso saying the stoppage has made it harder to trust russia as an energy supplier .
russia and belarus have also been criticized for failing to consult key customers like germany before turning off the taps . " even if flow is there , it is important to keep -lrb- this -rrb- on the agenda because it is also very important to get assurance that it will not happen again , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to start talking about energy security with russia german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the time to talk with russia over energy security has come . " we would now like to open a dialogue with russia in order to establish our future energy relations on a reliable , enduring basis , " he said . barroso also said he plans to keep the issue a priority .
" the cut in oil supplies from russia is unacceptable , " he said .
" this raises a problem , a real problem of credibility - we would like to guarantee that this does not happen in the future . " power play one of the main arteries of energy flowing from east to west , the druzhba pipeline pumps some 1.5 million barrels a day and accounts for around a third of russian oil exports and some 12.5 percent of total eu oil consumption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the druzhba oil pipeline is also known as the friendship pipeline it was shut down unexpectedly as part of a power play between moscow and the former soviet republic over prices and control of fuel pipelines . supplies to several eu countries halted monday when russia refused to pay a new transit tax imposed by belarus , prompting sharp criticism of the way moscow was handling the crisis by merkel , the eu 's current president and also chair of the g8 leading economies . russia had insisted that before resuming supplies , belarus should first pump to european customers some 80,000 tons of crude oil it had taken from russia and stored in lieu of transit fee payments . finalizing solution belarusian prime minister sergei sidorsky was due in moscow later to finalize the resolution agreed in a telephone conversation wednesday by russian president vladimir putin and his belarusian counterpart alexander lukashenko . sidorsky 's spokesman alexander timoshenko said minsk had agreed moscow 's main demand for ending the crisis : that belarus cancel the $ 45-per-ton -lrb- 35.70 euros per ton -rrb- tax on oil transit through the druzhba pipeline . sidorsky said he " and russian counterpart mikhail fradkov must prepare all issues over the next two days , so that russia and belarus can resume trade relations without any exceptions and customs limitations . " new framework under the deal to be finalized , belarus and russia might agree a new framework for the oil trade underlying the dispute , in which belarus receives oil from russia , refines it and sells it on to european consumers , the vedomosti business daily said thursday . belarus had benefited from getting the oil cheaply from russia as part of an economic union between the two countries , until moscow imposed a tax on the exports to belarus on jan .
1 , prompting the retaliatory tax by belarus . to end the standoff the two countries may revert to an older arrangement that existed in the 1990s by which belarus paid russia part of the duties it received from exporting oil products to europe , said vedomosti , citing unnamed officials . diversifying bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin the resolution to the dispute averted a cut in oil output by russia , the world 's second largest oil exporter after saudi arabia , which putin had warned might be necessary . but russian newspapers said that moscow might still go ahead with imposing new tariffs on a range of belarusian products , undermining a longstanding plan by the two countries to form a joint state . in the light of the cut-off , russia will be looking at ways of diversifying routes for exporting oil to reduce dependence on belarus , the gazeta newspaper quoted deputy economic development minister andrei sharonov as saying . " russia will diversify the flow of oil supplies - the situation with belarus showed the vulnerability of russian contracts , " sharonov said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia , belarus sign last-minute gas deal russia and belarus signed a last-gasp agreement sunday on russian gas supplies in a deal that averts a threatened supply cut that would likely have hit deliveries to western europe .

it will focus on " defending christian values , the family , and european civilization , " eu french national front mep bruno gollnisch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french mep bruno gollnisch founded the new parliamentary group the coalition is made up of a number of extremists who have long sought the chance to forge a political group , which under eu rules must comprise 20 members from at least five different political parties .
the accession of romania and bulgaria to the eu on jan .
1 boosted the ranks of far-right meps in strasbourg , making such a coalition possible . while the 20-odd members represent the european political extreme , their actual power is expected to be very limited .
there are a total of 732 meps in the european parliament . " disturbing show of unity " still , the anti-bigotry activist group anti-defamation league -lrb- adl -rrb- released a statement calling the its 's formation " a disturbing show of unity among bigots . " " we are concerned that the far right is engaging in a show of strength at a time when there is a growing climate of intolerance toward foreigners and minorities on the continent , " adl national director abraham h. foxman said . hannes swoboda , vice president of the european parliament 's socialist group , said the creation of the its is " definitely bad news , " since it gives an essentially disparate group of people a common base .
" until now they were split against each other - they were not so visible and influential , " swoboda noted . " price of democracy " it also gives the group substantial financial , legal and logistical support in the parliament , he said . " de facto , it 's support for not only anti-european , but maybe even racist right-wing propaganda .
and that is of course very negative .
but that is the price of democracy , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alessandra mussolini has said the group is a marriage of necessity " i hope the other political groups , respective of their orientation , will stick together and have a common front against these political attitudes , " swoboda added .
" we should make it clear that their political activities have to be limited by the strong will of other political forces , to demonstrate that europe is for freedom , is for racial equality , and democracy . " mixed bag of politicians should it actually form - on wednesday they had just 17 official signatures in hand , with the promise of three more - the group will most likely be led by the national front 's gollnisch . other members will include six meps from france 's national front , including its leader , jean-marie le pen , and three politicians from flemish nationalist party vlaams belang .
other joiners are italian neo-fascist alessandra mussolini -lrb- benito 's granddaughter -rrb- , andreas mölzer of austria 's xenophobic freedom party , and the uk 's ashley mote . from bulgaria 's attack party came dimitar stoyanov , well known for his anti-semitism and racist baiting of the bulgarian roma community , and a handful of romanian meps from the greater romania party , whose overtly racist and anti-semitic leader , corneliu vadim tudor , had strong ties to nikolai ceausescu . yet , despite their polarizing politics , guillaume durand , a policy analyst at the european policy center think-tank in brussels , played down their actual political strength . the small size of the group " shows just how fragile they are going to be .
it will be enough for one person to leave the group to destroy it , " he said . political mirror indeed , he points out that there is nothing new about having far-right elements in parliament .
" until now their real influence has been close to zero , and frankly this is not going to change , " he asserted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas mölzer was once ejected from austria 's far-right freedom party for extremism " the main reason is that they have no positive agenda .
in the european parliament , if you do n't contribute positively in any way , you just do n't count .
the most you can do is vote against things , " he said . durand said he thought the increased financing " wo n't change much " for the group , but acknowledged that they now will be formally represented in some european parliament organs - such as the conference of presidents - where the extremists previously had no voice . durand denies that the formation of its reflects any serious change in european politics - he argues that extreme right-wingers have always been around .

oil was once again reaching germany by thursday morning . the oil dispute between russia and neighboring belarus , which temporarily disrupted supplies headed to western europe and restarted debate over energy security in the european union , appears to be resolved after the presidents of the two countries reached a compromise wednesday to end the stoppage . russian oil begin flowing again to europe through belarusian pipelines on thursday , with oil from the druzhba pipeline reaching poland in the early hours of the morning and germany just hours later , according to the deputy chief executive of russian oil pipeline monopoly transneft , sergei grigoryev , quoted by ria novosti . european leaders said the dispute has undermined the eu 's confidence in russia , with the bloc 's leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel and jose manuel barroso saying the stoppage has made it harder to trust russia as an energy supplier .
russia and belarus have also been criticized for failing to consult key customers like germany before turning off the taps . " even if flow is there , it is important to keep -lrb- this -rrb- on the agenda because it is also very important to get assurance that it will not happen again , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to start talking about energy security with russia german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the time to talk with russia over energy security has come . " we would now like to open a dialogue with russia in order to establish our future energy relations on a reliable , enduring basis , " he said . barroso also said he plans to keep the issue a priority .
" the cut in oil supplies from russia is unacceptable , " he said .
" this raises a problem , a real problem of credibility - we would like to guarantee that this does not happen in the future . " power play one of the main arteries of energy flowing from east to west , the druzhba pipeline pumps some 1.5 million barrels a day and accounts for around a third of russian oil exports and some 12.5 percent of total eu oil consumption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the druzhba oil pipeline is also known as the friendship pipeline it was shut down unexpectedly as part of a power play between moscow and the former soviet republic over prices and control of fuel pipelines . supplies to several eu countries halted monday when russia refused to pay a new transit tax imposed by belarus , prompting sharp criticism of the way moscow was handling the crisis by merkel , the eu 's current president and also chair of the g8 leading economies . russia had insisted that before resuming supplies , belarus should first pump to european customers some 80,000 tons of crude oil it had taken from russia and stored in lieu of transit fee payments . finalizing solution belarusian prime minister sergei sidorsky was due in moscow later to finalize the resolution agreed in a telephone conversation wednesday by russian president vladimir putin and his belarusian counterpart alexander lukashenko . sidorsky 's spokesman alexander timoshenko said minsk had agreed moscow 's main demand for ending the crisis : that belarus cancel the $ 45-per-ton -lrb- 35.70 euros per ton -rrb- tax on oil transit through the druzhba pipeline . sidorsky said he " and russian counterpart mikhail fradkov must prepare all issues over the next two days , so that russia and belarus can resume trade relations without any exceptions and customs limitations . " new framework under the deal to be finalized , belarus and russia might agree a new framework for the oil trade underlying the dispute , in which belarus receives oil from russia , refines it and sells it on to european consumers , the vedomosti business daily said thursday . belarus had benefited from getting the oil cheaply from russia as part of an economic union between the two countries , until moscow imposed a tax on the exports to belarus on jan .
1 , prompting the retaliatory tax by belarus . to end the standoff the two countries may revert to an older arrangement that existed in the 1990s by which belarus paid russia part of the duties it received from exporting oil products to europe , said vedomosti , citing unnamed officials . diversifying bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin the resolution to the dispute averted a cut in oil output by russia , the world 's second largest oil exporter after saudi arabia , which putin had warned might be necessary . but russian newspapers said that moscow might still go ahead with imposing new tariffs on a range of belarusian products , undermining a longstanding plan by the two countries to form a joint state . in the light of the cut-off , russia will be looking at ways of diversifying routes for exporting oil to reduce dependence on belarus , the gazeta newspaper quoted deputy economic development minister andrei sharonov as saying . " russia will diversify the flow of oil supplies - the situation with belarus showed the vulnerability of russian contracts , " sharonov said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia , belarus sign last-minute gas deal russia and belarus signed a last-gasp agreement sunday on russian gas supplies in a deal that averts a threatened supply cut that would likely have hit deliveries to western europe .

europeans responded with skepticism about his priorities . the new strategy announced late wednesday provides for an increase in the number of troops fighting in iraq , from the current level of 132,000 , in a push to quell sectarian violence . berlin 's coordinator for german-us relations , karsten voigt , said he hoped bush 's " new way forward " would prove effective but doubted he would achieve his goal of securing a stable democracy in iraq . " we 've seen that the president tends to be over-optimistic , " he said . conspicuously absent from the new approach was any call for greater diplomacy with neighbors such as syria - an omission that drew criticism from foreign policy experts in germany who would have preferred to see the us actively include iraq 's neighbors in attempts to stabilize the region . " i would have welcomed an invitation to syria to involve itself constructively , " said conservative politician eckart von klaeden of chancellor merkel 's cdu on german radio . military aggression not the answer elmar brok , head of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee , said he doubted that extra troops could contain the country 's spiraling sectarian violence .
he also regretted the lack of focus on training local forces and that the new budget earmarked too little for economic development . " a key priority should be training iraqi soldiers and police and doing more for economic restructuring , " he said .

11 , the white house has upheld the belief that when it comes to the war on terror , the end justifies the means .
apparently convinced that international terrorism can not be combated by legal means , the bush administration five years ago began flying suspects to this remote naval base camp in southeast cuba - located far from the world 's prying eyes , and equally far from the rule of law . in 2002 , the first detainees captured in the us-led war on terror were flown to guantanamo bay . in subsequent years , over 700 prisoners have been held here without being charged . but guantanamo - or camp delta as it is also known - is no normal prison . more like prisoners of war than prisoners , the inmates crucially lack this status in terms of international law .
instead , the us government classifies them as " illegal combatants , " which means that they do not have to be conferred the rights granted to pows under the geneva convention . lawless prison bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz in its early days , guantanamo bay was a sordid detention camp in which prisoners were kept in cages and routinely humiliated . today , conditions at camp x-ray and the recently opened camp 6 are no different to high-tech prisons in the western world .
cooperative detainees can even earn certain privileges , such as leisurewear , books and videos as well as expensive medical care . but lawlessness is still rife in guantanamo .
incidents of torture and ill treatment are still commonplace , as a recent fbi report documented in detail .
prisoners have been denied access to the koran and menstrual blood has allegedly been smeared in to detainees ' faces , others are beaten and left to lie for hours in their own vomit or urine in rooms where the temperature is either freezing or stifling .
such reports have badly damaged washington 's reputation around the world and fanned the flames of anti-us sentiment among jihadists . both guantanamo and the abu ghraib prison in iraq have become symbols of the country 's lack of humanity and disrespect for international law - in the name of freedom and tolerance . condoning torture the decision to tackle terrorism with methods many see as illegal was taken in the confused aftermath of sept .
11 .
even torture was considered an acceptable and necessary weapon in a war that could only be won with hawkish , unorthodox policies - although the dirty work was done by private agents rather than the cia or the fbi .
according to president bush , the intelligence gathered helped prevent further terrorist attacks and led to the arrest of many a dangerous terrorist . but experts disagree .
a number of guantanamo 's inmates might well be terrorists planning attacks on the us and the free world - not least khalid shaikh mohammed , allegedly the principal architect of the sept .
11 attacks - but others are innocent .
and even if the end did justify the means , the last five years have seen a rise in international terrorism , not a drop . guantanamo is grist to the mill of muslim fundamentalists - and the military hearings that allow prisoners to challenge their detention are not enough to allay anyone 's concerns . the camp does considerably more harm than good to the security interests of the us and its allies - and it should be shut .
but for as long as george w. bush remains in the white house , this will never happen . daniel scheschkewitz is a correspondent for deutsche welle in washington , d.c. daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de amnesty international criticizes germany , eu on human rights human rights organization amnesty international has sharply criticized germany and the european union , saying they lack an interest in human rights .

critics debated the wisdom of portraying hitler as a buffoon - and the difficulty of making him funny . is dani levy 's hitler comedy " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " just a further development in a long tradition of satirical ' jewish ' humor ?
or is it a tasteless , belittling , and ultimately dangerous attempt to approach a subject best left to historians ? the answers vary .
the movie , which opens to nationwide release on thursday , has been criticized by many jewish leaders in germany and switzerland .
many think he idea of a german film sending up hitler is unconscionable and breaks a taboo better left in place . but others , noting numerous trailblazing films from charlie chaplin 's " the great dictator " through roberto begnini 's " life is beautiful , " said there was no reason germans , too , could not look at the dictator , who , it can be argued , has many rather ridiculous qualities , through the lens of laughter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : levy : making a name as a voice of jewish film in germany " ' mein führer ' lies in a well-established tradition of jewish comedy , from mel brooks through ernst lubitsch through seinfeld , " said yves kugelmann , editor in chief of aufbau , a switzerland-based monthly german-language magazine about jewish culture . hitler as ' pop figure ' " the fact that a comedy about hitler can be made in germany can be seen as very positive , " kugelmann said .
" it is absolutely correct and absolutely important to make movies like this .
you could call it a sign of emancipation . " in theory , he said , a comedy about hitler is an improvement on the steady flow of gravely serious programs - often detailing specific aspects hitler 's life and those of his nazi cohorts - that regularly feature on german television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the sets for scenes on berlin streets sparked controversy during filming " those documentaries - on hitler 's dogs , his women , his impotency - they all serve to make him into a monumental pop figure , " he said .
" this is problematic because they lead to the cult of a person . " while noting that " anyone who sees this film and has n't read anne frank has a problem , " kugelmann said that depicting hitler in a comedy " could be the only way to come to terms with reality . " " it raises the question of hitler 's success in the greater society , " he said .
" it shows him in his surroundings , among those who followed him and those who simply did n't oppose him .
it asks them , ' how did you get there ? " ' missed opportunity indeed , kugelmann 's biggest cricitism of the movie was that it failed to make the most of the opportunity . " it was provocative , sure , but it did n't go far enough into satire .
i think levy lost his nerve and took a moralistic stance , " he said he noted that other films based on the same subject - like chaplin 's " the great dictator " and begnini 's " life is beautiful " - were more daring , and more successful . kugelmann was not the only person to compare the film to " the great dictator . "
lea rosh , the outspoken german publicist best known for her successful campaign to build a holocaust memorial in the center of berlin , told the lübecker nachrichten newspaper : " i don ’ t think it 's possible to make hitler a comic figure , unless you are a genius like charlie chaplin . " hitler : no thigh-slapper levy - whose jewish mother was smuggled from germany into switzerland at age 12 - has called his film " primal scream therapy . "
he has said he thinks germans are ready to laugh about the " pathetic , pitiable and ridiculous " figure of adolf hitler .
in his attempt to give germans " new images , " he lampoons the dictator as an impotent bed wetter who had a traumatic childhood .
meanwhile , shortly before the film opened , stephan j. kramer , the general secretary of the central council of jews in germany , roundly criticized the film and levy 's attempt to demystify hitler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler is portrayed as a pathetic oddball who plays with battleships in his bubble bath laughing over a hitler is " neither taboo nor forbidden , " he said .
but he pointed out that hitler satires by charlie chaplin , ernst lubitsch and mel brooks , with their " subtle , ironic and sarcastic humor , " had little to do with levy 's " broad , thigh-slapping " comedy style . anti-semitism warning more importantly , those films were not made in germany , " and probably for good reason , because germany is the home of the holocaust , " he said . " hitler was not just a humorous figure with a tragic childhood ... he does n't deserve any mitigating circumstances or pity .
the mass murder of millions of people in europe ca n't be separated from hitler 's own person , " kramer said . " given the growing anti-semitism in europe , the film ' mein führer ' is unnecessary and even dangerous , " he added . it is unclear whether german audiences are ready for , or even interested in the move .

in 2005 , the ratio had stood at 3.2 percent . european commission spokeswoman amelia torres said preliminary figures for germany released by eurostat , the european union statistical agency , confirmed the bloc 's decision to end deficit reprimand procedures against berlin . eu calls for corrective budgetary action by berlin would formally end in " the coming months , " torres said .
the commission , however , still expected berlin - and other countries in the bloc - to take further action to rein in their budget deficits to ensure " balanced " finances , she added . growth to continue in 2007 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts expect a positive 2007 the german government hailed the data as " impressive . " " 2006 was a successful year for germany , " economy minister michael glos said .
" the world 's champion exporter is now also an economic locomotive . " glos added that he thought germany would be able to maintain its upswing in 2007 . " we have every reason to be optimistic about the future , " he said .
" the favorable 2006 gdp data is a good basis for a continuation of the upturn in 2007 . " westlb economist jörg lüschow agreed . " we 're confident that the upturn will continue this year , " he said , forecasting full-year 2007 growth of around 1.8 percent . destatis chief walter radermacher was also convinced that the current economic boom in germany was no flash in the pan . the upturn was " strong and stable , " radermacher said at a news conference . " it 's no nine-day wonder , " he said .

only a few years ago , the country had been saddled with the lowest growth and one of the highest public deficits in the entire euro zone . now , however , germany was back in the league of " top performers " internationally , reaping the benefits of robust global growth and long and painful structural reforms , destatis said . germany 's 2006 performance was better than expected : the government 's official forecast had been for growth of 2.3 percent last year .
in contrast to previous years , when german growth was driven primarily by booming foreign trade , growth impulses also came from domestic economy last year , destatis found . domestic demand contributed much more - 1.7 percentage points - to growth than foreign demand , which accounted for 0.7 percentage point of growth . part of broad german upswing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even germany 's lagging construction industry has grown lately positive economic data out of germany appears never-ending at the moment , with unemployment falling to 10.8 percent in 2006 from 11.7 percent in 2005 and booming exports pushing the german trade surplus to a record high . there is every indication , too , that the economy 's robust health will continue . even the rise in value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent from jan .

" after a wrenching five-year adjustment crisis , germany is reaping the rewards of its strenuous efforts , " said bank of america economist holger schmieding . " with pronounced wage restraint , some structural reforms , as well as cuts in taxes and government expenditure , germany has finally become a better place to invest again , reversing its post-unification loss of competitiveness , " the analyst said , adding that the whole euro zone would benefit . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german automobile market ends 2006 with a bang the german car industry zoomed to record levels of exports and production last year .

critics debated the wisdom of portraying hitler as a buffoon - and the difficulty of making him funny . is dani levy 's hitler comedy " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " just a further development in a long tradition of satirical ' jewish ' humor ?
or is it a tasteless , belittling , and ultimately dangerous attempt to approach a subject best left to historians ? the answers vary .
the movie , which opens to nationwide release on thursday , has been criticized by many jewish leaders in germany and switzerland .
many think he idea of a german film sending up hitler is unconscionable and breaks a taboo better left in place . but others , noting numerous trailblazing films from charlie chaplin 's " the great dictator " through roberto begnini 's " life is beautiful , " said there was no reason germans , too , could not look at the dictator , who , it can be argued , has many rather ridiculous qualities , through the lens of laughter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : levy : making a name as a voice of jewish film in germany " ' mein führer ' lies in a well-established tradition of jewish comedy , from mel brooks through ernst lubitsch through seinfeld , " said yves kugelmann , editor in chief of aufbau , a switzerland-based monthly german-language magazine about jewish culture . hitler as ' pop figure ' " the fact that a comedy about hitler can be made in germany can be seen as very positive , " kugelmann said .
" it is absolutely correct and absolutely important to make movies like this .
you could call it a sign of emancipation . " in theory , he said , a comedy about hitler is an improvement on the steady flow of gravely serious programs - often detailing specific aspects hitler 's life and those of his nazi cohorts - that regularly feature on german television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the sets for scenes on berlin streets sparked controversy during filming " those documentaries - on hitler 's dogs , his women , his impotency - they all serve to make him into a monumental pop figure , " he said .
" this is problematic because they lead to the cult of a person . " while noting that " anyone who sees this film and has n't read anne frank has a problem , " kugelmann said that depicting hitler in a comedy " could be the only way to come to terms with reality . " " it raises the question of hitler 's success in the greater society , " he said .
" it shows him in his surroundings , among those who followed him and those who simply did n't oppose him .
it asks them , ' how did you get there ? " ' missed opportunity indeed , kugelmann 's biggest cricitism of the movie was that it failed to make the most of the opportunity . " it was provocative , sure , but it did n't go far enough into satire .
i think levy lost his nerve and took a moralistic stance , " he said he noted that other films based on the same subject - like chaplin 's " the great dictator " and begnini 's " life is beautiful " - were more daring , and more successful . kugelmann was not the only person to compare the film to " the great dictator . "
lea rosh , the outspoken german publicist best known for her successful campaign to build a holocaust memorial in the center of berlin , told the lübecker nachrichten newspaper : " i don ’ t think it 's possible to make hitler a comic figure , unless you are a genius like charlie chaplin . " hitler : no thigh-slapper levy - whose jewish mother was smuggled from germany into switzerland at age 12 - has called his film " primal scream therapy . "
he has said he thinks germans are ready to laugh about the " pathetic , pitiable and ridiculous " figure of adolf hitler .
in his attempt to give germans " new images , " he lampoons the dictator as an impotent bed wetter who had a traumatic childhood .
meanwhile , shortly before the film opened , stephan j. kramer , the general secretary of the central council of jews in germany , roundly criticized the film and levy 's attempt to demystify hitler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler is portrayed as a pathetic oddball who plays with battleships in his bubble bath laughing over a hitler is " neither taboo nor forbidden , " he said .
but he pointed out that hitler satires by charlie chaplin , ernst lubitsch and mel brooks , with their " subtle , ironic and sarcastic humor , " had little to do with levy 's " broad , thigh-slapping " comedy style . anti-semitism warning more importantly , those films were not made in germany , " and probably for good reason , because germany is the home of the holocaust , " he said . " hitler was not just a humorous figure with a tragic childhood ... he does n't deserve any mitigating circumstances or pity .
the mass murder of millions of people in europe ca n't be separated from hitler 's own person , " kramer said . " given the growing anti-semitism in europe , the film ' mein führer ' is unnecessary and even dangerous , " he added . it is unclear whether german audiences are ready for , or even interested in the move .

oil was once again reaching germany by thursday morning . the oil dispute between russia and neighboring belarus , which temporarily disrupted supplies headed to western europe and restarted debate over energy security in the european union , appears to be resolved after the presidents of the two countries reached a compromise wednesday to end the stoppage . russian oil begin flowing again to europe through belarusian pipelines on thursday , with oil from the druzhba pipeline reaching poland in the early hours of the morning and germany just hours later , according to the deputy chief executive of russian oil pipeline monopoly transneft , sergei grigoryev , quoted by ria novosti . european leaders said the dispute has undermined the eu 's confidence in russia , with the bloc 's leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel and jose manuel barroso saying the stoppage has made it harder to trust russia as an energy supplier .
russia and belarus have also been criticized for failing to consult key customers like germany before turning off the taps . " even if flow is there , it is important to keep -lrb- this -rrb- on the agenda because it is also very important to get assurance that it will not happen again , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to start talking about energy security with russia german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the time to talk with russia over energy security has come . " we would now like to open a dialogue with russia in order to establish our future energy relations on a reliable , enduring basis , " he said . barroso also said he plans to keep the issue a priority .
" the cut in oil supplies from russia is unacceptable , " he said .
" this raises a problem , a real problem of credibility - we would like to guarantee that this does not happen in the future . " power play one of the main arteries of energy flowing from east to west , the druzhba pipeline pumps some 1.5 million barrels a day and accounts for around a third of russian oil exports and some 12.5 percent of total eu oil consumption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the druzhba oil pipeline is also known as the friendship pipeline it was shut down unexpectedly as part of a power play between moscow and the former soviet republic over prices and control of fuel pipelines . supplies to several eu countries halted monday when russia refused to pay a new transit tax imposed by belarus , prompting sharp criticism of the way moscow was handling the crisis by merkel , the eu 's current president and also chair of the g8 leading economies . russia had insisted that before resuming supplies , belarus should first pump to european customers some 80,000 tons of crude oil it had taken from russia and stored in lieu of transit fee payments . finalizing solution belarusian prime minister sergei sidorsky was due in moscow later to finalize the resolution agreed in a telephone conversation wednesday by russian president vladimir putin and his belarusian counterpart alexander lukashenko . sidorsky 's spokesman alexander timoshenko said minsk had agreed moscow 's main demand for ending the crisis : that belarus cancel the $ 45-per-ton -lrb- 35.70 euros per ton -rrb- tax on oil transit through the druzhba pipeline . sidorsky said he " and russian counterpart mikhail fradkov must prepare all issues over the next two days , so that russia and belarus can resume trade relations without any exceptions and customs limitations . " new framework under the deal to be finalized , belarus and russia might agree a new framework for the oil trade underlying the dispute , in which belarus receives oil from russia , refines it and sells it on to european consumers , the vedomosti business daily said thursday . belarus had benefited from getting the oil cheaply from russia as part of an economic union between the two countries , until moscow imposed a tax on the exports to belarus on jan .
1 , prompting the retaliatory tax by belarus . to end the standoff the two countries may revert to an older arrangement that existed in the 1990s by which belarus paid russia part of the duties it received from exporting oil products to europe , said vedomosti , citing unnamed officials . diversifying bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin the resolution to the dispute averted a cut in oil output by russia , the world 's second largest oil exporter after saudi arabia , which putin had warned might be necessary . but russian newspapers said that moscow might still go ahead with imposing new tariffs on a range of belarusian products , undermining a longstanding plan by the two countries to form a joint state . in the light of the cut-off , russia will be looking at ways of diversifying routes for exporting oil to reduce dependence on belarus , the gazeta newspaper quoted deputy economic development minister andrei sharonov as saying . " russia will diversify the flow of oil supplies - the situation with belarus showed the vulnerability of russian contracts , " sharonov said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia , belarus sign last-minute gas deal russia and belarus signed a last-gasp agreement sunday on russian gas supplies in a deal that averts a threatened supply cut that would likely have hit deliveries to western europe .

he has said he thinks germans are ready to laugh about the " pathetic , pitiable and ridiculous " figure of adolf hitler .
in his attempt to give germans " new images , " he lampoons the dictator as an impotent bed wetter who had a traumatic childhood .
meanwhile , shortly before the film opened , stephan j. kramer , the general secretary of the central council of jews in germany , roundly criticized the film and levy 's attempt to demystify hitler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler is portrayed as a pathetic oddball who plays with battleships in his bubble bath laughing over a hitler is " neither taboo nor forbidden , " he said .
but he pointed out that hitler satires by charlie chaplin , ernst lubitsch and mel brooks , with their " subtle , ironic and sarcastic humor , " had little to do with levy 's " broad , thigh-slapping " comedy style . anti-semitism warning more importantly , those films were not made in germany , " and probably for good reason , because germany is the home of the holocaust , " he said . " hitler was not just a humorous figure with a tragic childhood ... he does n't deserve any mitigating circumstances or pity .
the mass murder of millions of people in europe ca n't be separated from hitler 's own person , " kramer said . " given the growing anti-semitism in europe , the film ' mein führer ' is unnecessary and even dangerous , " he added . it is unclear whether german audiences are ready for , or even interested in the move .

dw-world.de readers had their say on the matter as well . the attack on somalia is just another reason why the us foreign policy for the past 50 years has disgusted me .
we who believe in peace in the world must get behind a strong united nations to convince the us that their actions and foreign policies are destroying the world .
i have lost complete respect for their sanity .
i say this as a 61-year-old female nana of four from canada .
the suffering of women and children all over the world and their looks of pain are never far from my mind .
the backroom dealings with a bunch of rich , old men seem to be dictating the fate of so many innocent people who deserve to live their lives too . - sherry smith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks occurred near the somali-kenyan border the us is totally justified in carrying out air strikes in somalia , or any other country for that matter , that is harboring terrorists .
these people are responsible for killing american citizens , as well as many other people from all over the world .
we can not let these people get away with these crimes .
the entire world has to stand up to these animal terrorists , europe included .
if the world does not stand up now , we will have a much , much bigger problem in the years to come .
no one stood up to hitler until it was too late , we ca n't afford to do the same thing again . - richard mattis pre-emptive strikes that kill innocent civilians and destabilize economies only encourage more people to believe violence and terror are solutions .
many in the us find president bush 's foreign policy deplorable . - dorothea izzo while i am not confident of the overall wisdom of launching these attacks , i 've no doubt that those on the receiving end of the attacks richly deserve them . - tom the us gets criticized for actions taken to stem terrorism .
terrorists are killing defenseless men , women , children and our freedom .
how do you bring terrorists in for peace talks ?
let history speak for itself .
europe has harbored and produced terrorists over the centuries because they dealt with words and promises and the terrorists replied with tanks and guns , killing civilians indiscriminately .
we do not want to see history repeat itself , therefore we will stop them when and where ever we find them .
in doing so , we may succeed in saving lives here and abroad . - frank penna bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : readers disagreed on europe 's reaction to the attacks my friends in germany , wake up and smell the jihad .
just look around you and observe your beautiful yet sad country , reeling from a century of warfare , and understandably wishing for peace in this world , being assaulted from within by an evil religious and philosophical threat .
these are the very same people causing death and mayhem in the middle east , africa , the philippines , indonesia , england , spain , thailand , and virtually in every horrific hotspot on the entire planet .
eradicating these people , especially their fanatical and absolutely evil leaders , as was done in somalia just now , is the only way to achieve a true and lasting peace .
somalia will only have this chance by eliminating the radical islamic threat .
only a fool loves war , but only an extinct fool ignores those intent on killing and dominating him .
godspeed to the ethiopian army .
more civilized nations , especially the " blind mice " of europe , had better come on board before it 's too late .
germany : you have fought for all the wrong reasons in the 20th century ; now is the time to redeem yourself and fight for the right reason . - ron jendry i believe it was the islamist and warlords that destabilized somalia , not the usa , which killed a known terrorist , one that could have easily struck any of the eu embassies or nations .
i believe that the eu has lost perspective here and that it is easier for the eu to criticize than it is to take action or stand by a known ally . - j. becher compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe critical of us airstrikes in somalia european criticism of us military intervention in somalia mounted on wednesday amid reports of fresh american air strikes in the southern part of the country aimed at hunting down al qaeda suspects .

1 had an unexpected side effect : it allowed for the likely formation of a new , far-right european parliamentary group . a motley association of extreme-right wing members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- announced they will form a parliamentary group , enabling them to qualify for eu funding and support . the group , to be called " identity , tradition and sovereignty " -lrb- its -rrb- , will broadly oppose immigration , turkish accession to the eu , and the european constitution .
it will focus on " defending christian values , the family , and european civilization , " eu french national front mep bruno gollnisch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french mep bruno gollnisch founded the new parliamentary group the coalition is made up of a number of extremists who have long sought the chance to forge a political group , which under eu rules must comprise 20 members from at least five different political parties .
the accession of romania and bulgaria to the eu on jan .
1 boosted the ranks of far-right meps in strasbourg , making such a coalition possible . while the 20-odd members represent the european political extreme , their actual power is expected to be very limited .
there are a total of 732 meps in the european parliament . " disturbing show of unity " still , the anti-bigotry activist group anti-defamation league -lrb- adl -rrb- released a statement calling the its 's formation " a disturbing show of unity among bigots . " " we are concerned that the far right is engaging in a show of strength at a time when there is a growing climate of intolerance toward foreigners and minorities on the continent , " adl national director abraham h. foxman said . hannes swoboda , vice president of the european parliament 's socialist group , said the creation of the its is " definitely bad news , " since it gives an essentially disparate group of people a common base .
" until now they were split against each other - they were not so visible and influential , " swoboda noted . " price of democracy " it also gives the group substantial financial , legal and logistical support in the parliament , he said . " de facto , it 's support for not only anti-european , but maybe even racist right-wing propaganda .
and that is of course very negative .
but that is the price of democracy , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alessandra mussolini has said the group is a marriage of necessity " i hope the other political groups , respective of their orientation , will stick together and have a common front against these political attitudes , " swoboda added .

1 had an unexpected side effect : it allowed for the likely formation of a new , far-right european parliamentary group . a motley association of extreme-right wing members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- announced they will form a parliamentary group , enabling them to qualify for eu funding and support . the group , to be called " identity , tradition and sovereignty " -lrb- its -rrb- , will broadly oppose immigration , turkish accession to the eu , and the european constitution .
it will focus on " defending christian values , the family , and european civilization , " eu french national front mep bruno gollnisch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french mep bruno gollnisch founded the new parliamentary group the coalition is made up of a number of extremists who have long sought the chance to forge a political group , which under eu rules must comprise 20 members from at least five different political parties .
the accession of romania and bulgaria to the eu on jan .
1 boosted the ranks of far-right meps in strasbourg , making such a coalition possible . while the 20-odd members represent the european political extreme , their actual power is expected to be very limited .
there are a total of 732 meps in the european parliament . " disturbing show of unity " still , the anti-bigotry activist group anti-defamation league -lrb- adl -rrb- released a statement calling the its 's formation " a disturbing show of unity among bigots . " " we are concerned that the far right is engaging in a show of strength at a time when there is a growing climate of intolerance toward foreigners and minorities on the continent , " adl national director abraham h. foxman said . hannes swoboda , vice president of the european parliament 's socialist group , said the creation of the its is " definitely bad news , " since it gives an essentially disparate group of people a common base .
" until now they were split against each other - they were not so visible and influential , " swoboda noted . " price of democracy " it also gives the group substantial financial , legal and logistical support in the parliament , he said . " de facto , it 's support for not only anti-european , but maybe even racist right-wing propaganda .
and that is of course very negative .
but that is the price of democracy , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alessandra mussolini has said the group is a marriage of necessity " i hope the other political groups , respective of their orientation , will stick together and have a common front against these political attitudes , " swoboda added .
" we should make it clear that their political activities have to be limited by the strong will of other political forces , to demonstrate that europe is for freedom , is for racial equality , and democracy . " mixed bag of politicians should it actually form - on wednesday they had just 17 official signatures in hand , with the promise of three more - the group will most likely be led by the national front 's gollnisch . other members will include six meps from france 's national front , including its leader , jean-marie le pen , and three politicians from flemish nationalist party vlaams belang .

" open societies mean living and talking together and not being separated from each other .
and to that extent the burqa is an element that hinders communication . " " we are in favor of not having the burqa , " he added .
" we want the muslim community to be well and at ease in the european union , " he stressed , " but also accept the structures and legal setup in europe .

dw-world.de readers had their say on the matter as well . the attack on somalia is just another reason why the us foreign policy for the past 50 years has disgusted me .
we who believe in peace in the world must get behind a strong united nations to convince the us that their actions and foreign policies are destroying the world .
i have lost complete respect for their sanity .
i say this as a 61-year-old female nana of four from canada .
the suffering of women and children all over the world and their looks of pain are never far from my mind .
the backroom dealings with a bunch of rich , old men seem to be dictating the fate of so many innocent people who deserve to live their lives too . - sherry smith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks occurred near the somali-kenyan border the us is totally justified in carrying out air strikes in somalia , or any other country for that matter , that is harboring terrorists .
these people are responsible for killing american citizens , as well as many other people from all over the world .
we can not let these people get away with these crimes .
the entire world has to stand up to these animal terrorists , europe included .
if the world does not stand up now , we will have a much , much bigger problem in the years to come .
no one stood up to hitler until it was too late , we ca n't afford to do the same thing again . - richard mattis pre-emptive strikes that kill innocent civilians and destabilize economies only encourage more people to believe violence and terror are solutions .
many in the us find president bush 's foreign policy deplorable . - dorothea izzo while i am not confident of the overall wisdom of launching these attacks , i 've no doubt that those on the receiving end of the attacks richly deserve them . - tom the us gets criticized for actions taken to stem terrorism .
terrorists are killing defenseless men , women , children and our freedom .
how do you bring terrorists in for peace talks ?
let history speak for itself .
europe has harbored and produced terrorists over the centuries because they dealt with words and promises and the terrorists replied with tanks and guns , killing civilians indiscriminately .
we do not want to see history repeat itself , therefore we will stop them when and where ever we find them .
in doing so , we may succeed in saving lives here and abroad . - frank penna bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : readers disagreed on europe 's reaction to the attacks my friends in germany , wake up and smell the jihad .
just look around you and observe your beautiful yet sad country , reeling from a century of warfare , and understandably wishing for peace in this world , being assaulted from within by an evil religious and philosophical threat .
these are the very same people causing death and mayhem in the middle east , africa , the philippines , indonesia , england , spain , thailand , and virtually in every horrific hotspot on the entire planet .
eradicating these people , especially their fanatical and absolutely evil leaders , as was done in somalia just now , is the only way to achieve a true and lasting peace .
somalia will only have this chance by eliminating the radical islamic threat .
only a fool loves war , but only an extinct fool ignores those intent on killing and dominating him .
godspeed to the ethiopian army .
more civilized nations , especially the " blind mice " of europe , had better come on board before it 's too late .
germany : you have fought for all the wrong reasons in the 20th century ; now is the time to redeem yourself and fight for the right reason . - ron jendry i believe it was the islamist and warlords that destabilized somalia , not the usa , which killed a known terrorist , one that could have easily struck any of the eu embassies or nations .
i believe that the eu has lost perspective here and that it is easier for the eu to criticize than it is to take action or stand by a known ally . - j. becher compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe critical of us airstrikes in somalia european criticism of us military intervention in somalia mounted on wednesday amid reports of fresh american air strikes in the southern part of the country aimed at hunting down al qaeda suspects .

the us trade representative meets wto director lamy in geneva friday . although often given up for dead , there are indications that the doha round of trade talks could be resuscitated as trade representatives from the eu , the us and japan say they are ready to go back to the table . on wednesday , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson and his japanese counterpart , akira amari , said they were committed to " an early and ambitious final agreement in the doha world trade talks " in a statement released by the eu commission , the european union 's executive arm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson amari 's visit to brussels was the latest in a series of meetings between top trade representatives to breathe life back into the trade talks aimed at lowering barriers on world trade .

28 . five years of failure the wto suspended the doha round last year in july after negotiators from six major countries , including the united states , eu , brazil and india , failed to reach agreement after five years of talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding an agreement has been impossible for five years the round , launched in the capital of qatar in november 2001 , is at an impasse as western and developing countries remain split on issues such as agricultural subsidies and market access . developing countries want lower tariffs on their agricultural exports to us and european markets while industrialized nations seek greater access to developing and emerging nations for their industrial services and goods .
the european union also wants the united states to cut subsidies to its own farmers , a move which washington has resisted . the us has called on the europeans and some big developing countries , such as brazil , to cut tariffs further on agricultural imports . the talks were launched with the aim of alleviating poverty and boosting the global economy .
but if agreement is not reached in the next few months , there is a risk of years of further delay .

oil was once again reaching germany by thursday morning . the oil dispute between russia and neighboring belarus , which temporarily disrupted supplies headed to western europe and restarted debate over energy security in the european union , appears to be resolved after the presidents of the two countries reached a compromise wednesday to end the stoppage . russian oil begin flowing again to europe through belarusian pipelines on thursday , with oil from the druzhba pipeline reaching poland in the early hours of the morning and germany just hours later , according to the deputy chief executive of russian oil pipeline monopoly transneft , sergei grigoryev , quoted by ria novosti . european leaders said the dispute has undermined the eu 's confidence in russia , with the bloc 's leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel and jose manuel barroso saying the stoppage has made it harder to trust russia as an energy supplier .
russia and belarus have also been criticized for failing to consult key customers like germany before turning off the taps . " even if flow is there , it is important to keep -lrb- this -rrb- on the agenda because it is also very important to get assurance that it will not happen again , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to start talking about energy security with russia german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the time to talk with russia over energy security has come . " we would now like to open a dialogue with russia in order to establish our future energy relations on a reliable , enduring basis , " he said . barroso also said he plans to keep the issue a priority .
" the cut in oil supplies from russia is unacceptable , " he said .
" this raises a problem , a real problem of credibility - we would like to guarantee that this does not happen in the future . " power play one of the main arteries of energy flowing from east to west , the druzhba pipeline pumps some 1.5 million barrels a day and accounts for around a third of russian oil exports and some 12.5 percent of total eu oil consumption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the druzhba oil pipeline is also known as the friendship pipeline it was shut down unexpectedly as part of a power play between moscow and the former soviet republic over prices and control of fuel pipelines . supplies to several eu countries halted monday when russia refused to pay a new transit tax imposed by belarus , prompting sharp criticism of the way moscow was handling the crisis by merkel , the eu 's current president and also chair of the g8 leading economies . russia had insisted that before resuming supplies , belarus should first pump to european customers some 80,000 tons of crude oil it had taken from russia and stored in lieu of transit fee payments . finalizing solution belarusian prime minister sergei sidorsky was due in moscow later to finalize the resolution agreed in a telephone conversation wednesday by russian president vladimir putin and his belarusian counterpart alexander lukashenko . sidorsky 's spokesman alexander timoshenko said minsk had agreed moscow 's main demand for ending the crisis : that belarus cancel the $ 45-per-ton -lrb- 35.70 euros per ton -rrb- tax on oil transit through the druzhba pipeline . sidorsky said he " and russian counterpart mikhail fradkov must prepare all issues over the next two days , so that russia and belarus can resume trade relations without any exceptions and customs limitations . " new framework under the deal to be finalized , belarus and russia might agree a new framework for the oil trade underlying the dispute , in which belarus receives oil from russia , refines it and sells it on to european consumers , the vedomosti business daily said thursday . belarus had benefited from getting the oil cheaply from russia as part of an economic union between the two countries , until moscow imposed a tax on the exports to belarus on jan .
1 , prompting the retaliatory tax by belarus . to end the standoff the two countries may revert to an older arrangement that existed in the 1990s by which belarus paid russia part of the duties it received from exporting oil products to europe , said vedomosti , citing unnamed officials . diversifying bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin the resolution to the dispute averted a cut in oil output by russia , the world 's second largest oil exporter after saudi arabia , which putin had warned might be necessary . but russian newspapers said that moscow might still go ahead with imposing new tariffs on a range of belarusian products , undermining a longstanding plan by the two countries to form a joint state . in the light of the cut-off , russia will be looking at ways of diversifying routes for exporting oil to reduce dependence on belarus , the gazeta newspaper quoted deputy economic development minister andrei sharonov as saying . " russia will diversify the flow of oil supplies - the situation with belarus showed the vulnerability of russian contracts , " sharonov said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia , belarus sign last-minute gas deal russia and belarus signed a last-gasp agreement sunday on russian gas supplies in a deal that averts a threatened supply cut that would likely have hit deliveries to western europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 11.01.2007 jewish opinion divided over new hitler comedy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : courting controversy : director dani levy stands between the film 's stars at the premiere jewish groups are split on " mein führer , " germany 's first home-grown comedy film about the former dictator .
critics debated the wisdom of portraying hitler as a buffoon - and the difficulty of making him funny . is dani levy 's hitler comedy " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " just a further development in a long tradition of satirical ' jewish ' humor ?
or is it a tasteless , belittling , and ultimately dangerous attempt to approach a subject best left to historians ? the answers vary .
the movie , which opens to nationwide release on thursday , has been criticized by many jewish leaders in germany and switzerland .
many think he idea of a german film sending up hitler is unconscionable and breaks a taboo better left in place . but others , noting numerous trailblazing films from charlie chaplin 's " the great dictator " through roberto begnini 's " life is beautiful , " said there was no reason germans , too , could not look at the dictator , who , it can be argued , has many rather ridiculous qualities , through the lens of laughter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : levy : making a name as a voice of jewish film in germany " ' mein führer ' lies in a well-established tradition of jewish comedy , from mel brooks through ernst lubitsch through seinfeld , " said yves kugelmann , editor in chief of aufbau , a switzerland-based monthly german-language magazine about jewish culture . hitler as ' pop figure ' " the fact that a comedy about hitler can be made in germany can be seen as very positive , " kugelmann said .
" it is absolutely correct and absolutely important to make movies like this .
you could call it a sign of emancipation . " in theory , he said , a comedy about hitler is an improvement on the steady flow of gravely serious programs - often detailing specific aspects hitler 's life and those of his nazi cohorts - that regularly feature on german television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the sets for scenes on berlin streets sparked controversy during filming " those documentaries - on hitler 's dogs , his women , his impotency - they all serve to make him into a monumental pop figure , " he said .
" this is problematic because they lead to the cult of a person . " while noting that " anyone who sees this film and has n't read anne frank has a problem , " kugelmann said that depicting hitler in a comedy " could be the only way to come to terms with reality . " " it raises the question of hitler 's success in the greater society , " he said .
" it shows him in his surroundings , among those who followed him and those who simply did n't oppose him .
it asks them , ' how did you get there ? " ' missed opportunity indeed , kugelmann 's biggest cricitism of the movie was that it failed to make the most of the opportunity . " it was provocative , sure , but it did n't go far enough into satire .
i think levy lost his nerve and took a moralistic stance , " he said he noted that other films based on the same subject - like chaplin 's " the great dictator " and begnini 's " life is beautiful " - were more daring , and more successful . kugelmann was not the only person to compare the film to " the great dictator . "
lea rosh , the outspoken german publicist best known for her successful campaign to build a holocaust memorial in the center of berlin , told the lübecker nachrichten newspaper : " i don ’ t think it 's possible to make hitler a comic figure , unless you are a genius like charlie chaplin . " hitler : no thigh-slapper levy - whose jewish mother was smuggled from germany into switzerland at age 12 - has called his film " primal scream therapy . "
he has said he thinks germans are ready to laugh about the " pathetic , pitiable and ridiculous " figure of adolf hitler .
in his attempt to give germans " new images , " he lampoons the dictator as an impotent bed wetter who had a traumatic childhood .
meanwhile , shortly before the film opened , stephan j. kramer , the general secretary of the central council of jews in germany , roundly criticized the film and levy 's attempt to demystify hitler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler is portrayed as a pathetic oddball who plays with battleships in his bubble bath laughing over a hitler is " neither taboo nor forbidden , " he said .
but he pointed out that hitler satires by charlie chaplin , ernst lubitsch and mel brooks , with their " subtle , ironic and sarcastic humor , " had little to do with levy 's " broad , thigh-slapping " comedy style . anti-semitism warning more importantly , those films were not made in germany , " and probably for good reason , because germany is the home of the holocaust , " he said . " hitler was not just a humorous figure with a tragic childhood ... he does n't deserve any mitigating circumstances or pity .
the mass murder of millions of people in europe ca n't be separated from hitler 's own person , " kramer said . " given the growing anti-semitism in europe , the film ' mein führer ' is unnecessary and even dangerous , " he added . it is unclear whether german audiences are ready for , or even interested in the move .
a forsa research group for stern magazine showed 56 percent of those asked were opposed to the film , while 35 percent viewed it positively . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitler comedy breaks german taboos is it really all right for germans to laugh about hitler and nazi germany ?

europeans responded with skepticism about his priorities . the new strategy announced late wednesday provides for an increase in the number of troops fighting in iraq , from the current level of 132,000 , in a push to quell sectarian violence . berlin 's coordinator for german-us relations , karsten voigt , said he hoped bush 's " new way forward " would prove effective but doubted he would achieve his goal of securing a stable democracy in iraq . " we 've seen that the president tends to be over-optimistic , " he said . conspicuously absent from the new approach was any call for greater diplomacy with neighbors such as syria - an omission that drew criticism from foreign policy experts in germany who would have preferred to see the us actively include iraq 's neighbors in attempts to stabilize the region . " i would have welcomed an invitation to syria to involve itself constructively , " said conservative politician eckart von klaeden of chancellor merkel 's cdu on german radio . military aggression not the answer elmar brok , head of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee , said he doubted that extra troops could contain the country 's spiraling sectarian violence .
he also regretted the lack of focus on training local forces and that the new budget earmarked too little for economic development . " a key priority should be training iraqi soldiers and police and doing more for economic restructuring , " he said . " the situation can not be resolved by more military intervention , " agreed the social democrats ' foreign policy expert , gert weisskirchen .
" his strategy emphasizes an approach that can no longer help . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy also stressed that only a " political strategy " could restore stability to iraq . " the situation in iraq is getting heavily worse , day after day , " douste-blazy , whose country was one of the bitterest opponents of the us-led invasion in 2003 , told a press conference .
" it is through a global approach , a political strategy , that it will be possible to restore stability to iraq , and beyond iraq to the wider region , " he said . " beyond the proposals made by president george bush , we believe the only way for iraq to retrieve its stability , its sovereignty , its territorial integrity and its national unity is through the participation of all civilian , political and religious components of iraqi society . " european reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can more troops help stem the violence ?
swedish foreign minister carl bildt also criticized the new strategy for failing to tackle political issues in the violence-wracked country . " -lrb- the speech -rrb- was significantly lighter on the major political challenges -lrb- in iraq -rrb- .
they were mentioned only in passing or hardly at all , " bildt told swedish national radio sr . bildt stressed the importance of the distribution of iraq 's oil wealth , the inclusion of different groups of the population in the political process and the engagement of iraq 's neighbors to stabilize the country . " this is a more limited initiative than what i think was required , " bildt said . bildt was guarded on the us president 's plan to send additional troops into iraq . " that 's a tactical military decision that foreign ministers in distant countries have a very limited chance of judging , " bildt told swedish news agency tt . " bush is throwing oil on the fire " by sending 21,500 " new rambos " to iraq , wrote the socialist ethnos newspaper in greece . " the march of folly " meanwhile , britain 's the independent declared " the march of folly is to continue ... " on its frontpage .
" so into the graveyard of iraq , george bush , the commander-in-chief , is to send another 21,000 of his soldiers , " it wrote . more than 3,000 us soldiers have died in iraq since the march 2003 invasion . the strategy however won approval from the times of london as a valid , last-ditch attempt to put iraq on the path towards stability . " the new iraq strategy involves serious risks but is better than the alternative , " the times wrote .
while acknowledging that more americans will die in iraq as a result , the times added : " it is right , nevertheless , to make one more effort to create the sort of iraq that its people deserve and the vast majority of its citizens aspire to . " the left-leaning liberation daily in france asserted that " the dispatch of 20,000 additional soldiers to iraq will not correct the insurgency and fighting . " " since victory is not within reach , the aim has been reduced to the maximum , " wrote the right-wing figaro , adding that washington has now set its sights on securing control of the capital baghdad . italy 's corriere della sera noted that key regional players iran and syria were not invited to take part in the solution . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany offers to aid us in building ties to syria , iran germany has said it would like to support the us in creating a dialog with iran and syria and help it meet the recommendations in the newly released us baker commission 's report on iraq .

the us trade representative meets wto director lamy in geneva friday . although often given up for dead , there are indications that the doha round of trade talks could be resuscitated as trade representatives from the eu , the us and japan say they are ready to go back to the table . on wednesday , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson and his japanese counterpart , akira amari , said they were committed to " an early and ambitious final agreement in the doha world trade talks " in a statement released by the eu commission , the european union 's executive arm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson amari 's visit to brussels was the latest in a series of meetings between top trade representatives to breathe life back into the trade talks aimed at lowering barriers on world trade .
the five-year talks all but collapsed last july . us stepping up us trade representative susan schwab will meet the director general of the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , pascal lamy , on friday amid speculation that a deal is close over the stalled trade negotiations . schwab will discuss the current impasse with lamy , the us mission in geneva has confirmed to the afp news agency , following talks in washington earlier this week with mandelson . her talks in geneva follow discussion with top trade officials from brazil , australia and india , as well as with german chancellor angela merkel , whose country holds the presidency of the eu and the group of eight leading industrialized nations . schwab is expected to continue her discussions with other trade officials at the world economic forum in the swiss ski resort of davos , which runs from jan .
23 to jan .
28 . five years of failure the wto suspended the doha round last year in july after negotiators from six major countries , including the united states , eu , brazil and india , failed to reach agreement after five years of talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding an agreement has been impossible for five years the round , launched in the capital of qatar in november 2001 , is at an impasse as western and developing countries remain split on issues such as agricultural subsidies and market access . developing countries want lower tariffs on their agricultural exports to us and european markets while industrialized nations seek greater access to developing and emerging nations for their industrial services and goods .
the european union also wants the united states to cut subsidies to its own farmers , a move which washington has resisted . the us has called on the europeans and some big developing countries , such as brazil , to cut tariffs further on agricultural imports . the talks were launched with the aim of alleviating poverty and boosting the global economy .

11 , the white house has upheld the belief that when it comes to the war on terror , the end justifies the means .
apparently convinced that international terrorism can not be combated by legal means , the bush administration five years ago began flying suspects to this remote naval base camp in southeast cuba - located far from the world 's prying eyes , and equally far from the rule of law . in 2002 , the first detainees captured in the us-led war on terror were flown to guantanamo bay . in subsequent years , over 700 prisoners have been held here without being charged . but guantanamo - or camp delta as it is also known - is no normal prison . more like prisoners of war than prisoners , the inmates crucially lack this status in terms of international law .
instead , the us government classifies them as " illegal combatants , " which means that they do not have to be conferred the rights granted to pows under the geneva convention . lawless prison bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz in its early days , guantanamo bay was a sordid detention camp in which prisoners were kept in cages and routinely humiliated . today , conditions at camp x-ray and the recently opened camp 6 are no different to high-tech prisons in the western world .
cooperative detainees can even earn certain privileges , such as leisurewear , books and videos as well as expensive medical care . but lawlessness is still rife in guantanamo .
incidents of torture and ill treatment are still commonplace , as a recent fbi report documented in detail .
prisoners have been denied access to the koran and menstrual blood has allegedly been smeared in to detainees ' faces , others are beaten and left to lie for hours in their own vomit or urine in rooms where the temperature is either freezing or stifling .
such reports have badly damaged washington 's reputation around the world and fanned the flames of anti-us sentiment among jihadists . both guantanamo and the abu ghraib prison in iraq have become symbols of the country 's lack of humanity and disrespect for international law - in the name of freedom and tolerance . condoning torture the decision to tackle terrorism with methods many see as illegal was taken in the confused aftermath of sept .
11 .
even torture was considered an acceptable and necessary weapon in a war that could only be won with hawkish , unorthodox policies - although the dirty work was done by private agents rather than the cia or the fbi .
according to president bush , the intelligence gathered helped prevent further terrorist attacks and led to the arrest of many a dangerous terrorist . but experts disagree .
a number of guantanamo 's inmates might well be terrorists planning attacks on the us and the free world - not least khalid shaikh mohammed , allegedly the principal architect of the sept .
11 attacks - but others are innocent .
and even if the end did justify the means , the last five years have seen a rise in international terrorism , not a drop . guantanamo is grist to the mill of muslim fundamentalists - and the military hearings that allow prisoners to challenge their detention are not enough to allay anyone 's concerns . the camp does considerably more harm than good to the security interests of the us and its allies - and it should be shut .
but for as long as george w. bush remains in the white house , this will never happen . daniel scheschkewitz is a correspondent for deutsche welle in washington , d.c. daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de amnesty international criticizes germany , eu on human rights human rights organization amnesty international has sharply criticized germany and the european union , saying they lack an interest in human rights .

1 had an unexpected side effect : it allowed for the likely formation of a new , far-right european parliamentary group . a motley association of extreme-right wing members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- announced they will form a parliamentary group , enabling them to qualify for eu funding and support . the group , to be called " identity , tradition and sovereignty " -lrb- its -rrb- , will broadly oppose immigration , turkish accession to the eu , and the european constitution .
it will focus on " defending christian values , the family , and european civilization , " eu french national front mep bruno gollnisch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french mep bruno gollnisch founded the new parliamentary group the coalition is made up of a number of extremists who have long sought the chance to forge a political group , which under eu rules must comprise 20 members from at least five different political parties .
the accession of romania and bulgaria to the eu on jan .
1 boosted the ranks of far-right meps in strasbourg , making such a coalition possible . while the 20-odd members represent the european political extreme , their actual power is expected to be very limited .
there are a total of 732 meps in the european parliament . " disturbing show of unity " still , the anti-bigotry activist group anti-defamation league -lrb- adl -rrb- released a statement calling the its 's formation " a disturbing show of unity among bigots . " " we are concerned that the far right is engaging in a show of strength at a time when there is a growing climate of intolerance toward foreigners and minorities on the continent , " adl national director abraham h. foxman said . hannes swoboda , vice president of the european parliament 's socialist group , said the creation of the its is " definitely bad news , " since it gives an essentially disparate group of people a common base .
" until now they were split against each other - they were not so visible and influential , " swoboda noted . " price of democracy " it also gives the group substantial financial , legal and logistical support in the parliament , he said . " de facto , it 's support for not only anti-european , but maybe even racist right-wing propaganda .
and that is of course very negative .
but that is the price of democracy , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alessandra mussolini has said the group is a marriage of necessity " i hope the other political groups , respective of their orientation , will stick together and have a common front against these political attitudes , " swoboda added .
" we should make it clear that their political activities have to be limited by the strong will of other political forces , to demonstrate that europe is for freedom , is for racial equality , and democracy . " mixed bag of politicians should it actually form - on wednesday they had just 17 official signatures in hand , with the promise of three more - the group will most likely be led by the national front 's gollnisch . other members will include six meps from france 's national front , including its leader , jean-marie le pen , and three politicians from flemish nationalist party vlaams belang .
other joiners are italian neo-fascist alessandra mussolini -lrb- benito 's granddaughter -rrb- , andreas mölzer of austria 's xenophobic freedom party , and the uk 's ashley mote . from bulgaria 's attack party came dimitar stoyanov , well known for his anti-semitism and racist baiting of the bulgarian roma community , and a handful of romanian meps from the greater romania party , whose overtly racist and anti-semitic leader , corneliu vadim tudor , had strong ties to nikolai ceausescu . yet , despite their polarizing politics , guillaume durand , a policy analyst at the european policy center think-tank in brussels , played down their actual political strength . the small size of the group " shows just how fragile they are going to be .
it will be enough for one person to leave the group to destroy it , " he said . political mirror indeed , he points out that there is nothing new about having far-right elements in parliament .
" until now their real influence has been close to zero , and frankly this is not going to change , " he asserted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas mölzer was once ejected from austria 's far-right freedom party for extremism " the main reason is that they have no positive agenda .
in the european parliament , if you do n't contribute positively in any way , you just do n't count .
the most you can do is vote against things , " he said . durand said he thought the increased financing " wo n't change much " for the group , but acknowledged that they now will be formally represented in some european parliament organs - such as the conference of presidents - where the extremists previously had no voice . durand denies that the formation of its reflects any serious change in european politics - he argues that extreme right-wingers have always been around . " the european parliament is a political mirror , " he said .
" the fact that we have strong nationalist parties in a number of countries is well known .

11 , the white house has upheld the belief that when it comes to the war on terror , the end justifies the means .
apparently convinced that international terrorism can not be combated by legal means , the bush administration five years ago began flying suspects to this remote naval base camp in southeast cuba - located far from the world 's prying eyes , and equally far from the rule of law . in 2002 , the first detainees captured in the us-led war on terror were flown to guantanamo bay . in subsequent years , over 700 prisoners have been held here without being charged . but guantanamo - or camp delta as it is also known - is no normal prison . more like prisoners of war than prisoners , the inmates crucially lack this status in terms of international law .
instead , the us government classifies them as " illegal combatants , " which means that they do not have to be conferred the rights granted to pows under the geneva convention . lawless prison bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz in its early days , guantanamo bay was a sordid detention camp in which prisoners were kept in cages and routinely humiliated . today , conditions at camp x-ray and the recently opened camp 6 are no different to high-tech prisons in the western world .
cooperative detainees can even earn certain privileges , such as leisurewear , books and videos as well as expensive medical care . but lawlessness is still rife in guantanamo .
incidents of torture and ill treatment are still commonplace , as a recent fbi report documented in detail .
prisoners have been denied access to the koran and menstrual blood has allegedly been smeared in to detainees ' faces , others are beaten and left to lie for hours in their own vomit or urine in rooms where the temperature is either freezing or stifling .
such reports have badly damaged washington 's reputation around the world and fanned the flames of anti-us sentiment among jihadists . both guantanamo and the abu ghraib prison in iraq have become symbols of the country 's lack of humanity and disrespect for international law - in the name of freedom and tolerance . condoning torture the decision to tackle terrorism with methods many see as illegal was taken in the confused aftermath of sept .
11 .
even torture was considered an acceptable and necessary weapon in a war that could only be won with hawkish , unorthodox policies - although the dirty work was done by private agents rather than the cia or the fbi .
according to president bush , the intelligence gathered helped prevent further terrorist attacks and led to the arrest of many a dangerous terrorist . but experts disagree .
a number of guantanamo 's inmates might well be terrorists planning attacks on the us and the free world - not least khalid shaikh mohammed , allegedly the principal architect of the sept .
11 attacks - but others are innocent .
and even if the end did justify the means , the last five years have seen a rise in international terrorism , not a drop . guantanamo is grist to the mill of muslim fundamentalists - and the military hearings that allow prisoners to challenge their detention are not enough to allay anyone 's concerns . the camp does considerably more harm than good to the security interests of the us and its allies - and it should be shut .
but for as long as george w. bush remains in the white house , this will never happen . daniel scheschkewitz is a correspondent for deutsche welle in washington , d.c. daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de amnesty international criticizes germany , eu on human rights human rights organization amnesty international has sharply criticized germany and the european union , saying they lack an interest in human rights .

1 had an unexpected side effect : it allowed for the likely formation of a new , far-right european parliamentary group . a motley association of extreme-right wing members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- announced they will form a parliamentary group , enabling them to qualify for eu funding and support . the group , to be called " identity , tradition and sovereignty " -lrb- its -rrb- , will broadly oppose immigration , turkish accession to the eu , and the european constitution .
it will focus on " defending christian values , the family , and european civilization , " eu french national front mep bruno gollnisch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french mep bruno gollnisch founded the new parliamentary group the coalition is made up of a number of extremists who have long sought the chance to forge a political group , which under eu rules must comprise 20 members from at least five different political parties .
the accession of romania and bulgaria to the eu on jan .
1 boosted the ranks of far-right meps in strasbourg , making such a coalition possible . while the 20-odd members represent the european political extreme , their actual power is expected to be very limited .
there are a total of 732 meps in the european parliament . " disturbing show of unity " still , the anti-bigotry activist group anti-defamation league -lrb- adl -rrb- released a statement calling the its 's formation " a disturbing show of unity among bigots . " " we are concerned that the far right is engaging in a show of strength at a time when there is a growing climate of intolerance toward foreigners and minorities on the continent , " adl national director abraham h. foxman said . hannes swoboda , vice president of the european parliament 's socialist group , said the creation of the its is " definitely bad news , " since it gives an essentially disparate group of people a common base .
" until now they were split against each other - they were not so visible and influential , " swoboda noted . " price of democracy " it also gives the group substantial financial , legal and logistical support in the parliament , he said . " de facto , it 's support for not only anti-european , but maybe even racist right-wing propaganda .
and that is of course very negative .
but that is the price of democracy , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alessandra mussolini has said the group is a marriage of necessity " i hope the other political groups , respective of their orientation , will stick together and have a common front against these political attitudes , " swoboda added .
" we should make it clear that their political activities have to be limited by the strong will of other political forces , to demonstrate that europe is for freedom , is for racial equality , and democracy . " mixed bag of politicians should it actually form - on wednesday they had just 17 official signatures in hand , with the promise of three more - the group will most likely be led by the national front 's gollnisch . other members will include six meps from france 's national front , including its leader , jean-marie le pen , and three politicians from flemish nationalist party vlaams belang .
other joiners are italian neo-fascist alessandra mussolini -lrb- benito 's granddaughter -rrb- , andreas mölzer of austria 's xenophobic freedom party , and the uk 's ashley mote . from bulgaria 's attack party came dimitar stoyanov , well known for his anti-semitism and racist baiting of the bulgarian roma community , and a handful of romanian meps from the greater romania party , whose overtly racist and anti-semitic leader , corneliu vadim tudor , had strong ties to nikolai ceausescu . yet , despite their polarizing politics , guillaume durand , a policy analyst at the european policy center think-tank in brussels , played down their actual political strength . the small size of the group " shows just how fragile they are going to be .
it will be enough for one person to leave the group to destroy it , " he said . political mirror indeed , he points out that there is nothing new about having far-right elements in parliament .
" until now their real influence has been close to zero , and frankly this is not going to change , " he asserted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas mölzer was once ejected from austria 's far-right freedom party for extremism " the main reason is that they have no positive agenda .
in the european parliament , if you do n't contribute positively in any way , you just do n't count .
the most you can do is vote against things , " he said . durand said he thought the increased financing " wo n't change much " for the group , but acknowledged that they now will be formally represented in some european parliament organs - such as the conference of presidents - where the extremists previously had no voice . durand denies that the formation of its reflects any serious change in european politics - he argues that extreme right-wingers have always been around . " the european parliament is a political mirror , " he said .
" the fact that we have strong nationalist parties in a number of countries is well known .
it 's just becoming apparent at the eu level in the current account .

oil was once again reaching germany by thursday morning . the oil dispute between russia and neighboring belarus , which temporarily disrupted supplies headed to western europe and restarted debate over energy security in the european union , appears to be resolved after the presidents of the two countries reached a compromise wednesday to end the stoppage . russian oil begin flowing again to europe through belarusian pipelines on thursday , with oil from the druzhba pipeline reaching poland in the early hours of the morning and germany just hours later , according to the deputy chief executive of russian oil pipeline monopoly transneft , sergei grigoryev , quoted by ria novosti . european leaders said the dispute has undermined the eu 's confidence in russia , with the bloc 's leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel and jose manuel barroso saying the stoppage has made it harder to trust russia as an energy supplier .
russia and belarus have also been criticized for failing to consult key customers like germany before turning off the taps . " even if flow is there , it is important to keep -lrb- this -rrb- on the agenda because it is also very important to get assurance that it will not happen again , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to start talking about energy security with russia german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the time to talk with russia over energy security has come . " we would now like to open a dialogue with russia in order to establish our future energy relations on a reliable , enduring basis , " he said . barroso also said he plans to keep the issue a priority .
" the cut in oil supplies from russia is unacceptable , " he said .
" this raises a problem , a real problem of credibility - we would like to guarantee that this does not happen in the future . " power play one of the main arteries of energy flowing from east to west , the druzhba pipeline pumps some 1.5 million barrels a day and accounts for around a third of russian oil exports and some 12.5 percent of total eu oil consumption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the druzhba oil pipeline is also known as the friendship pipeline it was shut down unexpectedly as part of a power play between moscow and the former soviet republic over prices and control of fuel pipelines . supplies to several eu countries halted monday when russia refused to pay a new transit tax imposed by belarus , prompting sharp criticism of the way moscow was handling the crisis by merkel , the eu 's current president and also chair of the g8 leading economies . russia had insisted that before resuming supplies , belarus should first pump to european customers some 80,000 tons of crude oil it had taken from russia and stored in lieu of transit fee payments . finalizing solution belarusian prime minister sergei sidorsky was due in moscow later to finalize the resolution agreed in a telephone conversation wednesday by russian president vladimir putin and his belarusian counterpart alexander lukashenko . sidorsky 's spokesman alexander timoshenko said minsk had agreed moscow 's main demand for ending the crisis : that belarus cancel the $ 45-per-ton -lrb- 35.70 euros per ton -rrb- tax on oil transit through the druzhba pipeline . sidorsky said he " and russian counterpart mikhail fradkov must prepare all issues over the next two days , so that russia and belarus can resume trade relations without any exceptions and customs limitations .

in 2005 , the ratio had stood at 3.2 percent . european commission spokeswoman amelia torres said preliminary figures for germany released by eurostat , the european union statistical agency , confirmed the bloc 's decision to end deficit reprimand procedures against berlin . eu calls for corrective budgetary action by berlin would formally end in " the coming months , " torres said .
the commission , however , still expected berlin - and other countries in the bloc - to take further action to rein in their budget deficits to ensure " balanced " finances , she added . growth to continue in 2007 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts expect a positive 2007 the german government hailed the data as " impressive . " " 2006 was a successful year for germany , " economy minister michael glos said .
" the world 's champion exporter is now also an economic locomotive . " glos added that he thought germany would be able to maintain its upswing in 2007 . " we have every reason to be optimistic about the future , " he said .
" the favorable 2006 gdp data is a good basis for a continuation of the upturn in 2007 . " westlb economist jörg lüschow agreed . " we 're confident that the upturn will continue this year , " he said , forecasting full-year 2007 growth of around 1.8 percent . destatis chief walter radermacher was also convinced that the current economic boom in germany was no flash in the pan . the upturn was " strong and stable , " radermacher said at a news conference . " it 's no nine-day wonder , " he said .
" construction and private consumption finally appeared to have emerged out of their long dry period . " dramatic economic turnaround bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german domestic demand and exports were behind 2006 's growth the data mark a spectacular turnaround in germany 's economic fortunes .
only a few years ago , the country had been saddled with the lowest growth and one of the highest public deficits in the entire euro zone . now , however , germany was back in the league of " top performers " internationally , reaping the benefits of robust global growth and long and painful structural reforms , destatis said . germany 's 2006 performance was better than expected : the government 's official forecast had been for growth of 2.3 percent last year .
in contrast to previous years , when german growth was driven primarily by booming foreign trade , growth impulses also came from domestic economy last year , destatis found . domestic demand contributed much more - 1.7 percentage points - to growth than foreign demand , which accounted for 0.7 percentage point of growth . part of broad german upswing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even germany 's lagging construction industry has grown lately positive economic data out of germany appears never-ending at the moment , with unemployment falling to 10.8 percent in 2006 from 11.7 percent in 2005 and booming exports pushing the german trade surplus to a record high . there is every indication , too , that the economy 's robust health will continue . even the rise in value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent from jan .
1 will not derail the recovery , and any related slowdown in consumer spending or overall growth will prove only temporary , experts say . " after a wrenching five-year adjustment crisis , germany is reaping the rewards of its strenuous efforts , " said bank of america economist holger schmieding . " with pronounced wage restraint , some structural reforms , as well as cuts in taxes and government expenditure , germany has finally become a better place to invest again , reversing its post-unification loss of competitiveness , " the analyst said , adding that the whole euro zone would benefit . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german automobile market ends 2006 with a bang the german car industry zoomed to record levels of exports and production last year .

1 had an unexpected side effect : it allowed for the likely formation of a new , far-right european parliamentary group . a motley association of extreme-right wing members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- announced they will form a parliamentary group , enabling them to qualify for eu funding and support . the group , to be called " identity , tradition and sovereignty " -lrb- its -rrb- , will broadly oppose immigration , turkish accession to the eu , and the european constitution .
it will focus on " defending christian values , the family , and european civilization , " eu french national front mep bruno gollnisch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french mep bruno gollnisch founded the new parliamentary group the coalition is made up of a number of extremists who have long sought the chance to forge a political group , which under eu rules must comprise 20 members from at least five different political parties .
the accession of romania and bulgaria to the eu on jan .
1 boosted the ranks of far-right meps in strasbourg , making such a coalition possible . while the 20-odd members represent the european political extreme , their actual power is expected to be very limited .
there are a total of 732 meps in the european parliament . " disturbing show of unity " still , the anti-bigotry activist group anti-defamation league -lrb- adl -rrb- released a statement calling the its 's formation " a disturbing show of unity among bigots . " " we are concerned that the far right is engaging in a show of strength at a time when there is a growing climate of intolerance toward foreigners and minorities on the continent , " adl national director abraham h. foxman said . hannes swoboda , vice president of the european parliament 's socialist group , said the creation of the its is " definitely bad news , " since it gives an essentially disparate group of people a common base .
" until now they were split against each other - they were not so visible and influential , " swoboda noted . " price of democracy " it also gives the group substantial financial , legal and logistical support in the parliament , he said . " de facto , it 's support for not only anti-european , but maybe even racist right-wing propaganda .
and that is of course very negative .
but that is the price of democracy , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alessandra mussolini has said the group is a marriage of necessity " i hope the other political groups , respective of their orientation , will stick together and have a common front against these political attitudes , " swoboda added .
" we should make it clear that their political activities have to be limited by the strong will of other political forces , to demonstrate that europe is for freedom , is for racial equality , and democracy . " mixed bag of politicians should it actually form - on wednesday they had just 17 official signatures in hand , with the promise of three more - the group will most likely be led by the national front 's gollnisch . other members will include six meps from france 's national front , including its leader , jean-marie le pen , and three politicians from flemish nationalist party vlaams belang .
other joiners are italian neo-fascist alessandra mussolini -lrb- benito 's granddaughter -rrb- , andreas mölzer of austria 's xenophobic freedom party , and the uk 's ashley mote . from bulgaria 's attack party came dimitar stoyanov , well known for his anti-semitism and racist baiting of the bulgarian roma community , and a handful of romanian meps from the greater romania party , whose overtly racist and anti-semitic leader , corneliu vadim tudor , had strong ties to nikolai ceausescu . yet , despite their polarizing politics , guillaume durand , a policy analyst at the european policy center think-tank in brussels , played down their actual political strength . the small size of the group " shows just how fragile they are going to be .
it will be enough for one person to leave the group to destroy it , " he said . political mirror indeed , he points out that there is nothing new about having far-right elements in parliament .
" until now their real influence has been close to zero , and frankly this is not going to change , " he asserted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas mölzer was once ejected from austria 's far-right freedom party for extremism " the main reason is that they have no positive agenda .
in the european parliament , if you do n't contribute positively in any way , you just do n't count .
the most you can do is vote against things , " he said . durand said he thought the increased financing " wo n't change much " for the group , but acknowledged that they now will be formally represented in some european parliament organs - such as the conference of presidents - where the extremists previously had no voice . durand denies that the formation of its reflects any serious change in european politics - he argues that extreme right-wingers have always been around . " the european parliament is a political mirror , " he said .
" the fact that we have strong nationalist parties in a number of countries is well known .
it 's just becoming apparent at the eu level in the current account .

in contrast to previous years , when german growth was driven primarily by booming foreign trade , growth impulses also came from domestic economy last year , destatis found . domestic demand contributed much more - 1.7 percentage points - to growth than foreign demand , which accounted for 0.7 percentage point of growth . part of broad german upswing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even germany 's lagging construction industry has grown lately positive economic data out of germany appears never-ending at the moment , with unemployment falling to 10.8 percent in 2006 from 11.7 percent in 2005 and booming exports pushing the german trade surplus to a record high . there is every indication , too , that the economy 's robust health will continue . even the rise in value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent from jan .

europeans responded with skepticism about his priorities . the new strategy announced late wednesday provides for an increase in the number of troops fighting in iraq , from the current level of 132,000 , in a push to quell sectarian violence . berlin 's coordinator for german-us relations , karsten voigt , said he hoped bush 's " new way forward " would prove effective but doubted he would achieve his goal of securing a stable democracy in iraq . " we 've seen that the president tends to be over-optimistic , " he said . conspicuously absent from the new approach was any call for greater diplomacy with neighbors such as syria - an omission that drew criticism from foreign policy experts in germany who would have preferred to see the us actively include iraq 's neighbors in attempts to stabilize the region . " i would have welcomed an invitation to syria to involve itself constructively , " said conservative politician eckart von klaeden of chancellor merkel 's cdu on german radio . military aggression not the answer elmar brok , head of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee , said he doubted that extra troops could contain the country 's spiraling sectarian violence .
he also regretted the lack of focus on training local forces and that the new budget earmarked too little for economic development . " a key priority should be training iraqi soldiers and police and doing more for economic restructuring , " he said . " the situation can not be resolved by more military intervention , " agreed the social democrats ' foreign policy expert , gert weisskirchen .
" his strategy emphasizes an approach that can no longer help . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy also stressed that only a " political strategy " could restore stability to iraq . " the situation in iraq is getting heavily worse , day after day , " douste-blazy , whose country was one of the bitterest opponents of the us-led invasion in 2003 , told a press conference .
" it is through a global approach , a political strategy , that it will be possible to restore stability to iraq , and beyond iraq to the wider region , " he said . " beyond the proposals made by president george bush , we believe the only way for iraq to retrieve its stability , its sovereignty , its territorial integrity and its national unity is through the participation of all civilian , political and religious components of iraqi society .

they were mentioned only in passing or hardly at all , " bildt told swedish national radio sr . bildt stressed the importance of the distribution of iraq 's oil wealth , the inclusion of different groups of the population in the political process and the engagement of iraq 's neighbors to stabilize the country . " this is a more limited initiative than what i think was required , " bildt said . bildt was guarded on the us president 's plan to send additional troops into iraq . " that 's a tactical military decision that foreign ministers in distant countries have a very limited chance of judging , " bildt told swedish news agency tt . " bush is throwing oil on the fire " by sending 21,500 " new rambos " to iraq , wrote the socialist ethnos newspaper in greece . " the march of folly " meanwhile , britain 's the independent declared " the march of folly is to continue ... " on its frontpage .
" so into the graveyard of iraq , george bush , the commander-in-chief , is to send another 21,000 of his soldiers , " it wrote . more than 3,000 us soldiers have died in iraq since the march 2003 invasion . the strategy however won approval from the times of london as a valid , last-ditch attempt to put iraq on the path towards stability . " the new iraq strategy involves serious risks but is better than the alternative , " the times wrote .
while acknowledging that more americans will die in iraq as a result , the times added : " it is right , nevertheless , to make one more effort to create the sort of iraq that its people deserve and the vast majority of its citizens aspire to . " the left-leaning liberation daily in france asserted that " the dispatch of 20,000 additional soldiers to iraq will not correct the insurgency and fighting . " " since victory is not within reach , the aim has been reduced to the maximum , " wrote the right-wing figaro , adding that washington has now set its sights on securing control of the capital baghdad . italy 's corriere della sera noted that key regional players iran and syria were not invited to take part in the solution . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany offers to aid us in building ties to syria , iran germany has said it would like to support the us in creating a dialog with iran and syria and help it meet the recommendations in the newly released us baker commission 's report on iraq .

1 had an unexpected side effect : it allowed for the likely formation of a new , far-right european parliamentary group . a motley association of extreme-right wing members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- announced they will form a parliamentary group , enabling them to qualify for eu funding and support . the group , to be called " identity , tradition and sovereignty " -lrb- its -rrb- , will broadly oppose immigration , turkish accession to the eu , and the european constitution .
it will focus on " defending christian values , the family , and european civilization , " eu french national front mep bruno gollnisch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french mep bruno gollnisch founded the new parliamentary group the coalition is made up of a number of extremists who have long sought the chance to forge a political group , which under eu rules must comprise 20 members from at least five different political parties .
the accession of romania and bulgaria to the eu on jan .
1 boosted the ranks of far-right meps in strasbourg , making such a coalition possible . while the 20-odd members represent the european political extreme , their actual power is expected to be very limited .
there are a total of 732 meps in the european parliament . " disturbing show of unity " still , the anti-bigotry activist group anti-defamation league -lrb- adl -rrb- released a statement calling the its 's formation " a disturbing show of unity among bigots . " " we are concerned that the far right is engaging in a show of strength at a time when there is a growing climate of intolerance toward foreigners and minorities on the continent , " adl national director abraham h. foxman said . hannes swoboda , vice president of the european parliament 's socialist group , said the creation of the its is " definitely bad news , " since it gives an essentially disparate group of people a common base .
" until now they were split against each other - they were not so visible and influential , " swoboda noted . " price of democracy " it also gives the group substantial financial , legal and logistical support in the parliament , he said . " de facto , it 's support for not only anti-european , but maybe even racist right-wing propaganda .
and that is of course very negative .
but that is the price of democracy , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alessandra mussolini has said the group is a marriage of necessity " i hope the other political groups , respective of their orientation , will stick together and have a common front against these political attitudes , " swoboda added .
" we should make it clear that their political activities have to be limited by the strong will of other political forces , to demonstrate that europe is for freedom , is for racial equality , and democracy . " mixed bag of politicians should it actually form - on wednesday they had just 17 official signatures in hand , with the promise of three more - the group will most likely be led by the national front 's gollnisch . other members will include six meps from france 's national front , including its leader , jean-marie le pen , and three politicians from flemish nationalist party vlaams belang .
other joiners are italian neo-fascist alessandra mussolini -lrb- benito 's granddaughter -rrb- , andreas mölzer of austria 's xenophobic freedom party , and the uk 's ashley mote . from bulgaria 's attack party came dimitar stoyanov , well known for his anti-semitism and racist baiting of the bulgarian roma community , and a handful of romanian meps from the greater romania party , whose overtly racist and anti-semitic leader , corneliu vadim tudor , had strong ties to nikolai ceausescu . yet , despite their polarizing politics , guillaume durand , a policy analyst at the european policy center think-tank in brussels , played down their actual political strength . the small size of the group " shows just how fragile they are going to be .
it will be enough for one person to leave the group to destroy it , " he said . political mirror indeed , he points out that there is nothing new about having far-right elements in parliament .
" until now their real influence has been close to zero , and frankly this is not going to change , " he asserted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas mölzer was once ejected from austria 's far-right freedom party for extremism " the main reason is that they have no positive agenda .
in the european parliament , if you do n't contribute positively in any way , you just do n't count .
the most you can do is vote against things , " he said . durand said he thought the increased financing " wo n't change much " for the group , but acknowledged that they now will be formally represented in some european parliament organs - such as the conference of presidents - where the extremists previously had no voice . durand denies that the formation of its reflects any serious change in european politics - he argues that extreme right-wingers have always been around . " the european parliament is a political mirror , " he said .
" the fact that we have strong nationalist parties in a number of countries is well known .
it 's just becoming apparent at the eu level in the current account .

dw-world.de readers had their say on the matter as well . the attack on somalia is just another reason why the us foreign policy for the past 50 years has disgusted me .
we who believe in peace in the world must get behind a strong united nations to convince the us that their actions and foreign policies are destroying the world .
i have lost complete respect for their sanity .
i say this as a 61-year-old female nana of four from canada .
the suffering of women and children all over the world and their looks of pain are never far from my mind .
the backroom dealings with a bunch of rich , old men seem to be dictating the fate of so many innocent people who deserve to live their lives too . - sherry smith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks occurred near the somali-kenyan border the us is totally justified in carrying out air strikes in somalia , or any other country for that matter , that is harboring terrorists .
these people are responsible for killing american citizens , as well as many other people from all over the world .
we can not let these people get away with these crimes .
the entire world has to stand up to these animal terrorists , europe included .
if the world does not stand up now , we will have a much , much bigger problem in the years to come .
no one stood up to hitler until it was too late , we ca n't afford to do the same thing again . - richard mattis pre-emptive strikes that kill innocent civilians and destabilize economies only encourage more people to believe violence and terror are solutions .
many in the us find president bush 's foreign policy deplorable . - dorothea izzo while i am not confident of the overall wisdom of launching these attacks , i 've no doubt that those on the receiving end of the attacks richly deserve them . - tom the us gets criticized for actions taken to stem terrorism .
terrorists are killing defenseless men , women , children and our freedom .
how do you bring terrorists in for peace talks ?
let history speak for itself .
europe has harbored and produced terrorists over the centuries because they dealt with words and promises and the terrorists replied with tanks and guns , killing civilians indiscriminately .
we do not want to see history repeat itself , therefore we will stop them when and where ever we find them .
in doing so , we may succeed in saving lives here and abroad . - frank penna bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : readers disagreed on europe 's reaction to the attacks my friends in germany , wake up and smell the jihad .
just look around you and observe your beautiful yet sad country , reeling from a century of warfare , and understandably wishing for peace in this world , being assaulted from within by an evil religious and philosophical threat .
these are the very same people causing death and mayhem in the middle east , africa , the philippines , indonesia , england , spain , thailand , and virtually in every horrific hotspot on the entire planet .
eradicating these people , especially their fanatical and absolutely evil leaders , as was done in somalia just now , is the only way to achieve a true and lasting peace .
somalia will only have this chance by eliminating the radical islamic threat .
only a fool loves war , but only an extinct fool ignores those intent on killing and dominating him .
godspeed to the ethiopian army .
more civilized nations , especially the " blind mice " of europe , had better come on board before it 's too late .
germany : you have fought for all the wrong reasons in the 20th century ; now is the time to redeem yourself and fight for the right reason . - ron jendry i believe it was the islamist and warlords that destabilized somalia , not the usa , which killed a known terrorist , one that could have easily struck any of the eu embassies or nations .
i believe that the eu has lost perspective here and that it is easier for the eu to criticize than it is to take action or stand by a known ally . - j. becher compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe critical of us airstrikes in somalia european criticism of us military intervention in somalia mounted on wednesday amid reports of fresh american air strikes in the southern part of the country aimed at hunting down al qaeda suspects .

11 , the white house has upheld the belief that when it comes to the war on terror , the end justifies the means .
apparently convinced that international terrorism can not be combated by legal means , the bush administration five years ago began flying suspects to this remote naval base camp in southeast cuba - located far from the world 's prying eyes , and equally far from the rule of law . in 2002 , the first detainees captured in the us-led war on terror were flown to guantanamo bay . in subsequent years , over 700 prisoners have been held here without being charged . but guantanamo - or camp delta as it is also known - is no normal prison . more like prisoners of war than prisoners , the inmates crucially lack this status in terms of international law .
instead , the us government classifies them as " illegal combatants , " which means that they do not have to be conferred the rights granted to pows under the geneva convention . lawless prison bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz in its early days , guantanamo bay was a sordid detention camp in which prisoners were kept in cages and routinely humiliated . today , conditions at camp x-ray and the recently opened camp 6 are no different to high-tech prisons in the western world .
cooperative detainees can even earn certain privileges , such as leisurewear , books and videos as well as expensive medical care . but lawlessness is still rife in guantanamo .
incidents of torture and ill treatment are still commonplace , as a recent fbi report documented in detail .
prisoners have been denied access to the koran and menstrual blood has allegedly been smeared in to detainees ' faces , others are beaten and left to lie for hours in their own vomit or urine in rooms where the temperature is either freezing or stifling .
such reports have badly damaged washington 's reputation around the world and fanned the flames of anti-us sentiment among jihadists . both guantanamo and the abu ghraib prison in iraq have become symbols of the country 's lack of humanity and disrespect for international law - in the name of freedom and tolerance . condoning torture the decision to tackle terrorism with methods many see as illegal was taken in the confused aftermath of sept .
11 .
even torture was considered an acceptable and necessary weapon in a war that could only be won with hawkish , unorthodox policies - although the dirty work was done by private agents rather than the cia or the fbi .
according to president bush , the intelligence gathered helped prevent further terrorist attacks and led to the arrest of many a dangerous terrorist . but experts disagree .

11 attacks - but others are innocent .
and even if the end did justify the means , the last five years have seen a rise in international terrorism , not a drop . guantanamo is grist to the mill of muslim fundamentalists - and the military hearings that allow prisoners to challenge their detention are not enough to allay anyone 's concerns . the camp does considerably more harm than good to the security interests of the us and its allies - and it should be shut .

the european union also wants the united states to cut subsidies to its own farmers , a move which washington has resisted . the us has called on the europeans and some big developing countries , such as brazil , to cut tariffs further on agricultural imports . the talks were launched with the aim of alleviating poverty and boosting the global economy .
but if agreement is not reached in the next few months , there is a risk of years of further delay .

in 2005 , the ratio had stood at 3.2 percent . european commission spokeswoman amelia torres said preliminary figures for germany released by eurostat , the european union statistical agency , confirmed the bloc 's decision to end deficit reprimand procedures against berlin . eu calls for corrective budgetary action by berlin would formally end in " the coming months , " torres said .
the commission , however , still expected berlin - and other countries in the bloc - to take further action to rein in their budget deficits to ensure " balanced " finances , she added . growth to continue in 2007 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts expect a positive 2007 the german government hailed the data as " impressive . " " 2006 was a successful year for germany , " economy minister michael glos said .
" the world 's champion exporter is now also an economic locomotive . " glos added that he thought germany would be able to maintain its upswing in 2007 . " we have every reason to be optimistic about the future , " he said .
" the favorable 2006 gdp data is a good basis for a continuation of the upturn in 2007 . " westlb economist jörg lüschow agreed . " we 're confident that the upturn will continue this year , " he said , forecasting full-year 2007 growth of around 1.8 percent . destatis chief walter radermacher was also convinced that the current economic boom in germany was no flash in the pan . the upturn was " strong and stable , " radermacher said at a news conference . " it 's no nine-day wonder , " he said .
" construction and private consumption finally appeared to have emerged out of their long dry period . " dramatic economic turnaround bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german domestic demand and exports were behind 2006 's growth the data mark a spectacular turnaround in germany 's economic fortunes .
only a few years ago , the country had been saddled with the lowest growth and one of the highest public deficits in the entire euro zone . now , however , germany was back in the league of " top performers " internationally , reaping the benefits of robust global growth and long and painful structural reforms , destatis said . germany 's 2006 performance was better than expected : the government 's official forecast had been for growth of 2.3 percent last year .
in contrast to previous years , when german growth was driven primarily by booming foreign trade , growth impulses also came from domestic economy last year , destatis found . domestic demand contributed much more - 1.7 percentage points - to growth than foreign demand , which accounted for 0.7 percentage point of growth . part of broad german upswing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even germany 's lagging construction industry has grown lately positive economic data out of germany appears never-ending at the moment , with unemployment falling to 10.8 percent in 2006 from 11.7 percent in 2005 and booming exports pushing the german trade surplus to a record high . there is every indication , too , that the economy 's robust health will continue . even the rise in value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent from jan .
1 will not derail the recovery , and any related slowdown in consumer spending or overall growth will prove only temporary , experts say . " after a wrenching five-year adjustment crisis , germany is reaping the rewards of its strenuous efforts , " said bank of america economist holger schmieding . " with pronounced wage restraint , some structural reforms , as well as cuts in taxes and government expenditure , germany has finally become a better place to invest again , reversing its post-unification loss of competitiveness , " the analyst said , adding that the whole euro zone would benefit . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german automobile market ends 2006 with a bang the german car industry zoomed to record levels of exports and production last year .

duncan macneil , 41 , and paul michael neale , 50 , were reported missing from sudbury open prison on wednesday .
their disappearances bring the total number of prisoners to abscond from the jail to five , since last november .
macneil from london was jailed for life in 1982 .
neale was sentenced to life imprisonment in bristol in 1983 for a murder in wiltshire .
on sunday , gary smith , 41 , from liverpool , convicted of manslaughter in 2002 , failed to return to the prison after temporary release .
' great risk ' and last week the prison was in the spotlight over the disappearance of two other inmates - jason croft and michael nixon - in november .
derbyshire police initially refused to release pictures of croft and nixon , because they said there was " no policing purpose " for them to , as they believed the men are no longer in derbyshire .
however , they did so immediately after the disappearances of macneil and neale .
macneil is described as white , 5ft 8in -lrb- 1.72m -rrb- tall with short brown hair and blue eyes .
neale , whose last known address was in wiltshire , is white , 5ft 10in -lrb- 1.77m -rrb- and has short brown hair and brown eyes .
the disappearances have sparked a political row about the role open prisons play in the criminal justice system .
re-offending ' reduced ' shadow home secretary david davis said : " john reid knew about the risk of absconds due to his policy of transferring dangerous offenders to open prisons .
now we see just how great that risk is . "

but a spokesperson from the prison service said open prisons , which house prisoners who have a small part of their sentence remaining , have successfully cut re-offending rates .
prisoners are free to go in and out of the jails but must attend regular roll calls .
more than 660 inmates have gone missing from sudbury in the past 10 years .

duncan macneil , 41 , and paul michael neale , 50 , were reported missing from sudbury open prison on wednesday .
their disappearances bring the total number of prisoners to abscond from the jail to five , since last november .
macneil from london was jailed for life in 1982 .
neale was sentenced to life imprisonment in bristol in 1983 for a murder in wiltshire .
on sunday , gary smith , 41 , from liverpool , convicted of manslaughter in 2002 , failed to return to the prison after temporary release .
' great risk ' and last week the prison was in the spotlight over the disappearance of two other inmates - jason croft and michael nixon - in november .
derbyshire police initially refused to release pictures of croft and nixon , because they said there was " no policing purpose " for them to , as they believed the men are no longer in derbyshire .
however , they did so immediately after the disappearances of macneil and neale .
macneil is described as white , 5ft 8in -lrb- 1.72m -rrb- tall with short brown hair and blue eyes .
neale , whose last known address was in wiltshire , is white , 5ft 10in -lrb- 1.77m -rrb- and has short brown hair and brown eyes .
the disappearances have sparked a political row about the role open prisons play in the criminal justice system .
re-offending ' reduced ' shadow home secretary david davis said : " john reid knew about the risk of absconds due to his policy of transferring dangerous offenders to open prisons .
now we see just how great that risk is . "
the lib dems have describe the level of absconding as " unacceptable " .
but a spokesperson from the prison service said open prisons , which house prisoners who have a small part of their sentence remaining , have successfully cut re-offending rates .
prisoners are free to go in and out of the jails but must attend regular roll calls .
more than 660 inmates have gone missing from sudbury in the past 10 years .

she said : " in some cases people rely on family and friends , in others they pay for their own care .

the bbc 's home editor mark easton said one in eight of the adult population were currently carers - but in a few decades it could become as many as one in five .
dame denise said : " they are doing this without the proper infra-structure in place .
" it is a complex sector , but they are often given no help navigating through it . "
neil hunt , chief executive of the alzheimer 's society , said the system was in crisis , and accused the government of being unwilling to provide sufficient funds to help people with serious medical conditions .
" additional investment in the nhs has not been mirrored in social care .
inevitably the result has been that as need increases , local authorities skew what care there is available to people with high levels of need .
" thousands of people who need extra help to remain independent are being ignored . "
age concern 's director general gordon lishman said : " this is a damning indictment of a social care system that is failing older people .
care ' improving ' " not providing services for people with so-called moderate needs causes much anguish for the individual - but can also result in much higher and more expensive care needs in the future . "
the department of health said social care was improving in many areas .
but a spokesman added : " we are concerned about the potential effect of rising eligibility criteria .
" local authorities need to put a greater emphasis on preventive services - helping people with lower needs to avoid admission to hospital or residential care . "
dame denise said there needed to be a proper debate over what elderly people would be expected to pay for and what the responsibility of the state and families should be .

the association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- meeting will discuss counter-terrorism and trade ties .
the need for enhanced security was underscored by wednesday 's bombs in the south , which killed seven people .
but foreign minister alberto romulo insisted that the summit , on the island of cebu , would go ahead as planned .
even before the bombs , security at the venue was tight , after several participating governments warned of a terrorist threat .
the summit was originally scheduled for december , but it had to be delayed for a month after a typhoon hit the region , though there were allegations the delay was also linked to a terrorist threat .
' more teeth ' presidents , prime ministers and other delegates from the 10 nations that make up asean are due to attend the meetings over the weekend .
representatives from japan , china , india , australia , south korea and new zealand will also take part .
terrorism will be top of the agenda , with leaders expected to sign a pact pledging closer co-operation in the fight against radical groups such as regional militant network jemaah islamiah .
an eu-style charter is also up for discussion .
asean has been criticised for being little more than a talking shop in the past .
creating a more rules-based organisation is seen as giving it more teeth , correspondents say .
speeding up a free trade area in south-east asia is another priority .
the target date for a single market is 2020 , but some members want it in place five years earlier , to make sure the region does not lose out on business opportunities and investment to giant neighbours china and india .
a sticking point is burma , whose military government has been slow to move towards its pledge of greater democracy , frustrating other asean members .
" we welcome recent developments in myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- but call for further progress toward the road to democracy , " mr romulo said on thursday .
security threat philippine security forces say the terrorist threat has now passed , but they are still taking no chances , with 8,000 police and soldiers on duty in cebu .
organisers of the summit insist the bombings on wednesday on the island of mindanao were in response to a crackdown on militants there , and had nothing to do with the conference .
" we 'd like to dispel any notion the recent bombings are in any way related to the hosting of the summit meetings here , " said marciano paynor , head of the summit organising committee .
" our venues and all other concerned areas are safe and the delegates are arriving as scheduled , " he said .

the association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- meeting will discuss counter-terrorism and trade ties .
the need for enhanced security was underscored by wednesday 's bombs in the south , which killed seven people .
but foreign minister alberto romulo insisted that the summit , on the island of cebu , would go ahead as planned .
even before the bombs , security at the venue was tight , after several participating governments warned of a terrorist threat .
the summit was originally scheduled for december , but it had to be delayed for a month after a typhoon hit the region , though there were allegations the delay was also linked to a terrorist threat .
' more teeth ' presidents , prime ministers and other delegates from the 10 nations that make up asean are due to attend the meetings over the weekend .
representatives from japan , china , india , australia , south korea and new zealand will also take part .
terrorism will be top of the agenda , with leaders expected to sign a pact pledging closer co-operation in the fight against radical groups such as regional militant network jemaah islamiah .
an eu-style charter is also up for discussion .
asean has been criticised for being little more than a talking shop in the past .
creating a more rules-based organisation is seen as giving it more teeth , correspondents say .
speeding up a free trade area in south-east asia is another priority .
the target date for a single market is 2020 , but some members want it in place five years earlier , to make sure the region does not lose out on business opportunities and investment to giant neighbours china and india .
a sticking point is burma , whose military government has been slow to move towards its pledge of greater democracy , frustrating other asean members .
" we welcome recent developments in myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- but call for further progress toward the road to democracy , " mr romulo said on thursday .
security threat philippine security forces say the terrorist threat has now passed , but they are still taking no chances , with 8,000 police and soldiers on duty in cebu .
organisers of the summit insist the bombings on wednesday on the island of mindanao were in response to a crackdown on militants there , and had nothing to do with the conference .
" we 'd like to dispel any notion the recent bombings are in any way related to the hosting of the summit meetings here , " said marciano paynor , head of the summit organising committee .
" our venues and all other concerned areas are safe and the delegates are arriving as scheduled , " he said .

the national grid sold half of its eight regional distribution networks in 2005 for £ 5.8bn.
the commons public accounts committee found these deals were likely to mean savings of £ 325m by 2023 - or customers paying £ 1 a year less for gas .
but there was potential for £ 820m more in price reductions , the mps said .
' too cautious ' the committee , which heard from ofgem representatives , said the distribution network deals had been struck " on the basis that they did not result in a net detriment to consumers , rather than because they would bring benefits to consumers " .
its chairman , conservative mp edward leigh , said this was " far too cautious a stance " .
he added : " as gas prices go through the roof , ofgem must do everything it can to get the best possible deal for gas consumers .
" certainly , they can not wait until after 2013 to enjoy most of the benefits of the sales of the networks , as ofgem currently expects . "
mr leigh said ofgem had to be " bold " in setting price controls when the next review happens in 2008 and called for efficiency savings of at least 3 % a year .
he added : " and the regulator must make sure that the regulations it imposes on the gas industry genuinely encourage innovative and efficient behaviour and that lower gas distribution costs really do result in lower gas bills . "
earlier this week , the conservatives called on the office of fair trading to investigate whether gas customers are being ripped off by high gas prices .
party leader david cameron said he wanted people to " live for less ... starting with utility bills " .
the average annual gas bill was £ 630 in october , up £ 300 from 2003 .
meanwhile , british gas customers who do not pay bills within 28 days are to be fined £ 5 from march .
ofgem has advised households to switch suppliers to avoid the penalty .
but duncan sedgwick , chief executive of the energy retail association , said : " what we have here in the uk is the most independent , liberalised and transparent market anywhere in the world .
" an inquiry of this kind would achieve nothing whatsoever . "

the spectator magazine said £ 21m had been raised during the last year , compared with £ 15m in a normal non-election financial year .
the party will be able to reduce its debts to £ 5m when it sells the former conservative central office building at smith square , it was added .
a £ 5,000-a-plate dinner last month is thought to have raised £ 500,000 .
' down to david ' the spectator said the fact labour has debts of £ 23m could mean tony blair 's successor calling a snap general election after the prime minister steps down later this year .
but labour chairman hazel blears wrote to party activists last month , urging them to prepare for a poll " which may be less than 16 months away " .
mr cameron said last week that he would " love to have an early election " .
the liberal democrats also said they were " ready and waiting " .
however , some commentators fear that parties ' reliance on large-scale donations is damaging democracy .
it is helping to reduce memberships and giving wealthy supporters too much say , they argue .

the national grid sold half of its eight regional distribution networks in 2005 for £ 5.8bn.
the commons public accounts committee found these deals were likely to mean savings of £ 325m by 2023 - or customers paying £ 1 a year less for gas .
but there was potential for £ 820m more in price reductions , the mps said .
' too cautious ' the committee , which heard from ofgem representatives , said the distribution network deals had been struck " on the basis that they did not result in a net detriment to consumers , rather than because they would bring benefits to consumers " .
its chairman , conservative mp edward leigh , said this was " far too cautious a stance " .
he added : " as gas prices go through the roof , ofgem must do everything it can to get the best possible deal for gas consumers .
" certainly , they can not wait until after 2013 to enjoy most of the benefits of the sales of the networks , as ofgem currently expects . "
mr leigh said ofgem had to be " bold " in setting price controls when the next review happens in 2008 and called for efficiency savings of at least 3 % a year .
he added : " and the regulator must make sure that the regulations it imposes on the gas industry genuinely encourage innovative and efficient behaviour and that lower gas distribution costs really do result in lower gas bills . "
earlier this week , the conservatives called on the office of fair trading to investigate whether gas customers are being ripped off by high gas prices .
party leader david cameron said he wanted people to " live for less ... starting with utility bills " .
the average annual gas bill was £ 630 in october , up £ 300 from 2003 .
meanwhile , british gas customers who do not pay bills within 28 days are to be fined £ 5 from march .
ofgem has advised households to switch suppliers to avoid the penalty .
but duncan sedgwick , chief executive of the energy retail association , said : " what we have here in the uk is the most independent , liberalised and transparent market anywhere in the world .
" an inquiry of this kind would achieve nothing whatsoever . "

mr cameron said last week that he would " love to have an early election " .
the liberal democrats also said they were " ready and waiting " .
however , some commentators fear that parties ' reliance on large-scale donations is damaging democracy .
it is helping to reduce memberships and giving wealthy supporters too much say , they argue .

the national grid sold half of its eight regional distribution networks in 2005 for £ 5.8bn.
the commons public accounts committee found these deals were likely to mean savings of £ 325m by 2023 - or customers paying £ 1 a year less for gas .
but there was potential for £ 820m more in price reductions , the mps said .
' too cautious ' the committee , which heard from ofgem representatives , said the distribution network deals had been struck " on the basis that they did not result in a net detriment to consumers , rather than because they would bring benefits to consumers " .
its chairman , conservative mp edward leigh , said this was " far too cautious a stance " .
he added : " as gas prices go through the roof , ofgem must do everything it can to get the best possible deal for gas consumers .
" certainly , they can not wait until after 2013 to enjoy most of the benefits of the sales of the networks , as ofgem currently expects . "
mr leigh said ofgem had to be " bold " in setting price controls when the next review happens in 2008 and called for efficiency savings of at least 3 % a year .
he added : " and the regulator must make sure that the regulations it imposes on the gas industry genuinely encourage innovative and efficient behaviour and that lower gas distribution costs really do result in lower gas bills . "
earlier this week , the conservatives called on the office of fair trading to investigate whether gas customers are being ripped off by high gas prices .
party leader david cameron said he wanted people to " live for less ... starting with utility bills " .
the average annual gas bill was £ 630 in october , up £ 300 from 2003 .
meanwhile , british gas customers who do not pay bills within 28 days are to be fined £ 5 from march .
ofgem has advised households to switch suppliers to avoid the penalty .
but duncan sedgwick , chief executive of the energy retail association , said : " what we have here in the uk is the most independent , liberalised and transparent market anywhere in the world .
" an inquiry of this kind would achieve nothing whatsoever . "

new revenue streams and investment capital for the quartet seem inevitable , as they look to match their on-field endeavours with new financial goals off it , maximising income from as many sources as possible .
all four are in the second phase of the lucrative champions league , and a new premiership tv deal will kick in this year .
but a well-timed tackle from across the english channel , in the form of ex-french international player michel platini , could later this month upset the financial plans of at least one of these major footballing brands .
power struggle in london chelsea has been launching its new chinese-language website as part its world domination plans , while arsenal is reaping the extra ticket and hospitality income from its new , bigger , emirates stadium .
in the north west , liverpool is chasing a potentially lucrative takeover deal with dubai international capital -lrb- dic -rrb- , while at manchester united the glazers are still taking in the fact that the new tv premiership deal goes well beyond their wildest expectations . "
the big four clubs should be very worried about this , even if any changes take time to implement " harry philp , hermes sports partners the new premier league tv deal for 2007-10 will see a 65 % increase in premiership tv money for every top flight club , according to barclays capital .
but before then , there is the little matter of the election for the post of president of european football body uefa , with platini taking on incumbent lennart johansson .
and the manifesto of the former three-times european footballer of the year will be causing some sleepless nights at stamford bridge , old trafford , anfield and emirates stadium .
for part of his proposal is to reduce the number of champions league positions available to a maximum of three per country .
' big business ' " let us introduce a maximum limit of three clubs qualifying directly from each country , to enable more nations to take part , " midfielder-turned-administrator mr platini says .
that would lead to the loss of one champions league place each in england , italy and spain , which currently enjoy four slots , with the three places released available to other countries .
the champions league is the money-making machine of modern football and it is crucially important for leading european clubs to be part of it .
it is not just the tv income , ticket revenue and prize monies , though they are very lucrative - it is also vital in terms of a club 's profile , merchandising and sponsors .
" the champions league is big business , with the rewards growing the further you go in the competition , " says harry philp , an analyst at hermes sports partners , which advises clubs and businesses on football finance issues . "
the champions league is such a powerful machine for uefa that it may be difficult to ultimately move and change things " xavier riviore , france football " in return for votes from emerging european nations , platini is promising them more access to the champions league .
" the big four clubs should be very worried about this , even if any changes take time to implement .
" we have four big guns in england and someone is going to lose out on up to £ 30m a season if platini is elected . "
' shrewd move ' when liverpool won the champions league in 2005 , they earned £ 20.5m.
chelsea , which reached the semi-final that year , earned £ 18.8m.
last season , arsenal made more than £ 25m from their run to the champions league final .
and manchester united 's failure to qualify from the group stage in 2005/06 is estimated to have cost them up to £ 20m in prize and appearance money , ticket sales and broadcast revenue .
it is that money that the top english clubs want to hold on to .
so they will be gladdened to know that some observers believe change in the champions league will not come easily .
xavier rivoire , a paris-based writer for respected french publication france football , says : " platini has been quite shrewd in targeting the smaller nations .
" however if he wins and moves to go ahead with cutting champions league places for the larger nations , i do not think it will happen in the near future .
" the champions league is such a powerful machine for uefa that it may be difficult to ultimately move and change things . "
the crucial vote is being held in duesseldorf , germany , at the uefa congress on 25 and 26 january , with well-placed insiders intimating some of the uk national associations may be favouring platini .
wages proposal as well as the lurking champions league issue , other possible financial pitfalls face the big four .
at liverpool , the proposed takeover has still to be completed and looks like becoming more of a glazer-style deal - largely funded by debt , than an abramovich-type deal , which sees a benefactor pouring limitless cash into the club . "
i do n't divide soccer between the rich and the poor " michel platini whatever the final deal though , it appears it will not be the £ 450m straight equity injection that had initially been envisaged when dic first expressed an interest .
meanwhile chelsea may be on the receiving end of uefa proposals , in line with the recent independent european sports review , to limit a club 's wages to an as-yet-unspecified proportion of turnover .
if uefa take the issue to the eu , it could end the unlimited transfer budget available to chelsea .
and arsenal - which went heavily overdrawn to build its emirates stadium - and manchester united , have to keep servicing their debts , which could leave them unable to financially compete for the services of the best global players .
now all four are waiting to see if platini - who says " i do n't divide soccer between the rich and the poor " - is about to disrupt their income from champions league football .

the russian state backed company , gazprom , doubled the price of the gas it sells to georgia at the start of this year .

the healthcare inspectorate wales -lrb- hiw -rrb- report followed claims by the service 's ex-chief executive that failings meant 500 people were dying each year .
the inspectorate 's report does not put a figure on how many people may have died , but said it was clear that improvements would save more lives .
the welsh ambulance service said the report would help it to move forward .
the ambulance service has had a troubled year , beginning last may when acting chief executive roger thayne resigned after two months in the post , claiming the trust was in " crisis " .
he wrote a report cataloguing outdated equipment , poor management and delays in ambulances reaching patients , which he said contributed to a " dangerous " service .
' hope for future ' mr thayne also claimed 500 people were dying unnecessarily each year through the service 's failings and under-funding .
his successor as interim chief executive , anton van dellen , also resigned after two months in the job , saying he was unable to commit long-term to the post .
alan murray said there was a will to improve the service in august , alan murray was appointed chief executive and said improvements would be made by christmas .
but in november , the latest official figures for ambulance performance showed emergency response times were the worst since 2003 .
a welsh assembly inquiry into the state of the service , headed by auditor general jeremy colman , found a lack of direction and weak leadership led to longstanding poor performance by the service .
the report , released in december , made 28 recommendations for improvement .
the latest review , by independent body hiw , found that ambulance staff were " committed to providing good patient care " and that the arrival of the new chief executive had given them " real hope for the future of the service " .
on the claim that of the 500 lives were being lost annually , the hiw reports said it was " very difficult to determine if this estimate is accurate " but said there was " clearly room for significant improvement " .
' will to improve ' peter higson , chief executive of hiw , said the trust faced " significant challenges " .
he added : " there are reasons for genuine optimism that the trust 's board and chief executive will meet these challenges and deliver the needed improvements through its modernisation plan . "
the ambulance service 's chief executive , mr murray said the report 's 26 recommendations would help it in " understanding the challenges ahead as we move to implement our comprehensive modernisation plan " .
on mr thayne 's claim that 500 lives were being lost because of poor performance , mr murray said : " we never accepted that figure and neither did the auditor general in his report .
" there is obviously a correlation between the speed with which ambulances arrive and good patient outcomes .

the healthcare inspectorate wales -lrb- hiw -rrb- report followed claims by the service 's ex-chief executive that failings meant 500 people were dying each year .
the inspectorate 's report does not put a figure on how many people may have died , but said it was clear that improvements would save more lives .
the welsh ambulance service said the report would help it to move forward .
the ambulance service has had a troubled year , beginning last may when acting chief executive roger thayne resigned after two months in the post , claiming the trust was in " crisis " .
he wrote a report cataloguing outdated equipment , poor management and delays in ambulances reaching patients , which he said contributed to a " dangerous " service .
' hope for future ' mr thayne also claimed 500 people were dying unnecessarily each year through the service 's failings and under-funding .
his successor as interim chief executive , anton van dellen , also resigned after two months in the job , saying he was unable to commit long-term to the post .
alan murray said there was a will to improve the service in august , alan murray was appointed chief executive and said improvements would be made by christmas .
but in november , the latest official figures for ambulance performance showed emergency response times were the worst since 2003 .
a welsh assembly inquiry into the state of the service , headed by auditor general jeremy colman , found a lack of direction and weak leadership led to longstanding poor performance by the service .
the report , released in december , made 28 recommendations for improvement .
the latest review , by independent body hiw , found that ambulance staff were " committed to providing good patient care " and that the arrival of the new chief executive had given them " real hope for the future of the service " .
on the claim that of the 500 lives were being lost annually , the hiw reports said it was " very difficult to determine if this estimate is accurate " but said there was " clearly room for significant improvement " .
' will to improve ' peter higson , chief executive of hiw , said the trust faced " significant challenges " .
he added : " there are reasons for genuine optimism that the trust 's board and chief executive will meet these challenges and deliver the needed improvements through its modernisation plan . "
the ambulance service 's chief executive , mr murray said the report 's 26 recommendations would help it in " understanding the challenges ahead as we move to implement our comprehensive modernisation plan " .
on mr thayne 's claim that 500 lives were being lost because of poor performance , mr murray said : " we never accepted that figure and neither did the auditor general in his report .
" there is obviously a correlation between the speed with which ambulances arrive and good patient outcomes .

people in koyli and khutaha in power-scarce bhagalpur district have been killing each other since 1991 in a bloody war to light up their villages .
in a state where only 10 % of the homes have electricity and per capita consumption is a mere 60kwh compared to the indian average of 354kwh , electricity remains elusive for most people .
the killing spree over power in the two villages began in 1991 when district electricity officials set up a pair of cement electric poles along with a transformer in koyli .
it was the first time since independence in 1947 that the authorities had woken up to the need of providing electricity to the area .
vengeful incensed villagers in neighbouring khutaha uprooted the poles and carried them away to their village at night thinking that the move would help them in getting electricity faster .
when the koyli villagers discovered , they attacked their neighbours .
a three-hour-long gun battle between members of the two villages in april 1991 left one person dead and two others wounded .
all of them were from khutaha .
three years later , koyli took its revenge - three residents of khutaha were gunned down in june 1994 .
a few months later , khutaha villagers killed two brothers from koyli .
koyli again retaliated a year later - and the killings continued .
since 1991 , koyli has lost 12 residents and khutaha seven of its people in viciously vengeful battles over electricity .
rajkumar yadav says the situation " is tense , but under control " all the while , electricity has continued to elude the warring villages , even as many surrounding villages were lit up .
the situation became so bad that about 200 families from the two villages moved out to other places in bhagalpur .
" there is no way out except migrate because anybody could get killed any time in this war over electricity , " says ravindra yadav , the head of khutaha .
there has been no fighting since 2000 , but an uneasy calm has prevailed ever since .
" you can best sum up the situation as tense but under control , " says rajkumar yadav , whose father was murdered in the power wars .
' historic ' the villagers have also deposited $ 4,000 with the authorities for electrification .
the electricity department again arrived with fresh poles in april and set them up in both villages - but they have not been wired yet .
they promised connections within two months .
six months later , the villagers are still waiting .
" if they keep their promise , it will be a historic occasion for the two villages , " says baloo yadav from khutaha .
khutaha and koyli are not remote bihar villages - they are just eight kilometres -lrb- five miles -rrb- away from the bustling town of bhagalpur .
the first electric poles were installed in 1991 over 70 % of its people are literate and many work in government jobs .
a koyli villager even topped the state bureaucracy examinations in 1998 .
but all this has not helped the village to get the attention of the authorities 59 years after independence .
things may be changing for the better now , officials say .
" recent village council elections were peaceful .
it seems that the two villages are ready to forget their bloody pasts , " says bhagalpur district magistrate vipin kumar .
residents of both villagers are certainly hoping so .

but are visions of mechanised-man servants still a long way off ?
mankind has long been fascinated with robots .
perhaps isaac asimov knew the impact his short story collection i , robot would have on the world when he wrote the nine tales making up the book .
but in putting pen to paper and imagining a world where humans and robots shared their lives he ignited an interest that shows no sign of waning .
at ces , honda 's robot asimo , whose name bears only coincidental connection to the famed science fiction writer , lopes gently around the giant stand .
the machine is currently starring in a series of adverts for honda , demonstrating the firm 's commitment to innovation .
it is the face of cutting edge robotics , a vision of where consumer robotics is hoping to reach and itself a prototype for the types of machine that could one day be in our homes .
' continuing research ' asimo project leader stephen keeney says honda is committed to one day selling the machine .
" we are continuing our research in hopes that we can one day introduce asimo into a home , or a hospital or maybe someday it will be fighting fires .
we need asimo to be smart enough to understand what we want it to do and they go and do it stephen keeney , asimo project leader " we are committed to making asimo a reality in the future . "
asimo has been in development for 20 years and its skills include walking forwards , backwards , up and down stairs , as well as running .
it may not sound very advanced but there is computational power equivalent to five of the most powerful pcs inside asimo and the greatest technological leap is in its mastery of walking .
" we started out studying how people walked , " says mr keeney .
' mechanics ' " until we started studying it we did n't know really how people walk .
robot rise robots could demand legal rights in pictures : robot menagerie " it 's something we all do naturally .
but no-one had studied the mechanics of walking before because there was no need . "
it took 10 years to master walking and a further 10 to refine it , says mr keeney .
so how do the robots you can buy for the home match up ?
one of the world 's most popular robots , the roomba , has been sold to more than two million homes worldwide .
it is a cleaning robot that scuttles around the floor vacuuming .
' touch lives ' matt palma , of us firm irobot , said : " the vision of the company is to build robots that can touch people 's everyday lives . " irobi wants to be your friend founded in 1990 by mit roboticists dr rodney brooks , helen grainer and colin angle , the firm also produces robots to the military .
more than 700 tactile robots - or tacbots -are deployed in iraq and afghanistan , helping soldiers to stay out of harm 's way .
" the robots we make are extremely effective at doing the job they are designed for .
" people are intrigued by robots .
the promise of robots has been around for a long time .
" we are now seeing the practical application of robots . "
the company has announced the release of a version of roomba , irobot create , that is fully programmable , hoping to inspire a new generation of robot builders .
at ces there is a number of robots that are designed to make people 's lives easier .
r2d2 there are at least five other firms selling floor-cleaning robots while wowwee produces robotic toys , such as the robosapien .
wowwee unveiled its new toy , roboquad there is also a home version of one of the most famous robots in recent history - r2d2 .
it can stream music from an mp3 player and can also project video .
a korean firm at the show is marketing a networked robot , called irobi .
it is being sold as a friend to your children , a security guard and entertainment device .
the machine has wi-fi built-in and can deliver news reports , weather , recipes and act as a karaoke machine in the evening .
a spokesman for the firm said : " if you go out you can call the irobi over your phone and check that the house is safe . "
at $ 3,000 it is an expensive way to join the robotic revolution .
but there is still no price tag on asimo .
honda will not reveal how much it has spent developing the robot but mr keeney said it was considerably less than is spent on developing a prototype vehicle .
in the last year asimo has mastered running and more importantly , the ability to react to a changing environment .
" with running - we are trying to get asimo to stay upright , to react quickly , " says mr keeney .
" we want him to be able to cope with children running through a home , or pets . "
the robot , like other consumer machines on show , has been designed to be personable and human .
" we definitely want people to feel that asimo is approachable - that they would want it to be part of his home .
" that 's why he is human size - about 130 cm tall ; not so large that it would be imposing to small children in a home environment .
" but it is still big enough to do things for you - to open and close doors , switch on and off lights , go to the medicine cabinet .
" we do want people to feel it is something they can accept in their home . "
so what does mr keeney make of the growing trend of consumer robotics ?
' definitive perception ' " any robotic technology which makes people more accepting of having robots in their home is great .
" we have all grown up with movies like star wars and terminator and have a very definitive perception of what robots are .
" we are trying to change that perception with asimo .
" the reality of humanoid robots is going to be much different from what we have seen on television . "
the next hurdle for asimo is better artificial intelligence .
" we need asimo to be smart enough to understand what we want it to do and they go and do it .
" we are still in the infancy of artificial intelligence . "

at $ 3,000 it is an expensive way to join the robotic revolution .
but there is still no price tag on asimo .
honda will not reveal how much it has spent developing the robot but mr keeney said it was considerably less than is spent on developing a prototype vehicle .
in the last year asimo has mastered running and more importantly , the ability to react to a changing environment .
" with running - we are trying to get asimo to stay upright , to react quickly , " says mr keeney .
" we want him to be able to cope with children running through a home , or pets . "
the robot , like other consumer machines on show , has been designed to be personable and human .
" we definitely want people to feel that asimo is approachable - that they would want it to be part of his home .
" that 's why he is human size - about 130 cm tall ; not so large that it would be imposing to small children in a home environment .
" but it is still big enough to do things for you - to open and close doors , switch on and off lights , go to the medicine cabinet .
" we do want people to feel it is something they can accept in their home . "
so what does mr keeney make of the growing trend of consumer robotics ?
' definitive perception ' " any robotic technology which makes people more accepting of having robots in their home is great .
" we have all grown up with movies like star wars and terminator and have a very definitive perception of what robots are .
" we are trying to change that perception with asimo .
" the reality of humanoid robots is going to be much different from what we have seen on television . "
the next hurdle for asimo is better artificial intelligence .
" we need asimo to be smart enough to understand what we want it to do and they go and do it .
" we are still in the infancy of artificial intelligence . "

but are visions of mechanised-man servants still a long way off ?
mankind has long been fascinated with robots .
perhaps isaac asimov knew the impact his short story collection i , robot would have on the world when he wrote the nine tales making up the book .
but in putting pen to paper and imagining a world where humans and robots shared their lives he ignited an interest that shows no sign of waning .
at ces , honda 's robot asimo , whose name bears only coincidental connection to the famed science fiction writer , lopes gently around the giant stand .
the machine is currently starring in a series of adverts for honda , demonstrating the firm 's commitment to innovation .
it is the face of cutting edge robotics , a vision of where consumer robotics is hoping to reach and itself a prototype for the types of machine that could one day be in our homes .
' continuing research ' asimo project leader stephen keeney says honda is committed to one day selling the machine .
" we are continuing our research in hopes that we can one day introduce asimo into a home , or a hospital or maybe someday it will be fighting fires .
we need asimo to be smart enough to understand what we want it to do and they go and do it stephen keeney , asimo project leader " we are committed to making asimo a reality in the future . "
asimo has been in development for 20 years and its skills include walking forwards , backwards , up and down stairs , as well as running .
it may not sound very advanced but there is computational power equivalent to five of the most powerful pcs inside asimo and the greatest technological leap is in its mastery of walking .
" we started out studying how people walked , " says mr keeney .
' mechanics ' " until we started studying it we did n't know really how people walk .
robot rise robots could demand legal rights in pictures : robot menagerie " it 's something we all do naturally .
but no-one had studied the mechanics of walking before because there was no need . "
it took 10 years to master walking and a further 10 to refine it , says mr keeney .
so how do the robots you can buy for the home match up ?
one of the world 's most popular robots , the roomba , has been sold to more than two million homes worldwide .
it is a cleaning robot that scuttles around the floor vacuuming .
' touch lives ' matt palma , of us firm irobot , said : " the vision of the company is to build robots that can touch people 's everyday lives . " irobi wants to be your friend founded in 1990 by mit roboticists dr rodney brooks , helen grainer and colin angle , the firm also produces robots to the military .
more than 700 tactile robots - or tacbots -are deployed in iraq and afghanistan , helping soldiers to stay out of harm 's way .
" the robots we make are extremely effective at doing the job they are designed for .
" people are intrigued by robots .
the promise of robots has been around for a long time .
" we are now seeing the practical application of robots . "
the company has announced the release of a version of roomba , irobot create , that is fully programmable , hoping to inspire a new generation of robot builders .
at ces there is a number of robots that are designed to make people 's lives easier .
r2d2 there are at least five other firms selling floor-cleaning robots while wowwee produces robotic toys , such as the robosapien .
wowwee unveiled its new toy , roboquad there is also a home version of one of the most famous robots in recent history - r2d2 .
it can stream music from an mp3 player and can also project video .
a korean firm at the show is marketing a networked robot , called irobi .
it is being sold as a friend to your children , a security guard and entertainment device .
the machine has wi-fi built-in and can deliver news reports , weather , recipes and act as a karaoke machine in the evening .
a spokesman for the firm said : " if you go out you can call the irobi over your phone and check that the house is safe . "
at $ 3,000 it is an expensive way to join the robotic revolution .
but there is still no price tag on asimo .
honda will not reveal how much it has spent developing the robot but mr keeney said it was considerably less than is spent on developing a prototype vehicle .
in the last year asimo has mastered running and more importantly , the ability to react to a changing environment .
" with running - we are trying to get asimo to stay upright , to react quickly , " says mr keeney .
" we want him to be able to cope with children running through a home , or pets . "

the gamma-ray large area space telescope -lrb- glast -rrb- has been described as an " extreme physics " laboratory .
the probe is due to launch from florida 's cape canaveral base in november on a boeing delta ii rocket .
the team presented details of the mission at the meeting of the american astronomical society in seattle .
we really do n't know what the sky is going to look like julie mcenery , nasa gsfc as its name suggests , glast will detect the emissions of gamma rays in space .
gamma rays are the most energetic form of electromagnetic radiation known to science .
examples of energetic phenomena to be probed by glast include active galaxies , which spew massive amounts of energy from their centres .
this explosive outpouring is thought to be powered by supermassive black holes .
other targets for glast include pulsars - rotating neutron stars which emit radio waves - as well as the remnants of exploded stars , and galaxy clusters .
uncharted territory " the objects that we tend to study are extreme examples of their type , " julie mcenery , glast 's deputy project scientist , told bbc news .
" we 're looking at active galaxies where the jets -lsb- of their black holes -rsb- are pointing directly at us and you are seeing the relativistic particles .
" we 're looking at pulsars , we 're exploring the universe in regions of very high magnetic fields . "
glast will examine supernova remnants dr mcenery , from nasa 's goddard space flight center -lrb- gsfc -rrb- in maryland , said that glast was likely to make many important discoveries because it would study a region of the electromagnetic spectrum that had hardly been explored .
to be precise , this energy-range runs from 10 kiloelectron volts -lrb- kev -rrb- to 300 gigaelectron volts gev .
" we 've got lots of theoretical ideas on what we expect to find and some observational hints there are exciting things there , " she explained .
" but we really do n't know what the sky is going to look like . "
with glast , mission scientists hope to address several unanswered questions about the high energy universe .
one question central to the mission is where in the universe cosmic rays are accelerated to tremendous energies .
energetic particles cosmic rays are composed of atomic nuclei that can move at close to the speed of light .
they can be about one billion times more energetic than the high energy particles created on earth in the most powerful particle accelerators .
" almost all of the astrophysical scenarios where you expect to accelerate cosmic rays , you also expect to produce gamma rays , " said dr mcenery .
" the efficiency of an object to accelerate particles is a function of its size and the strength of its magnetic field .
" you can have a supernova remnant , with a relatively strong magnetic field but relatively small size .
or you can look at a galaxy cluster , which has a relatively small magnetic field but is gigantic .
" a particle running around in a galaxy cluster can spend a long time getting up to a high energy . "
most of the sources glast will look at are thought to play important roles in the acceleration of cosmic rays , the deputy project scientist said .
the spacecraft will carry two instruments : the large area telescope -lrb- lat -rrb- and the glast burst monitor -lrb- gbm -rrb- .
lat has a large field of view which can see about 20 % of the sky at any one time .
in its primary observing mode , the telescope can cover the entire sky every three hours .
glast is due to be launched in the middle of november this year .

the work is to take place beside derry 's guildhall on the site of the old city hotel , which was destroyed 33 years ago in a bomb blast .
currently used as a car park , social development minister david hanson said the hotel and apartment scheme on the site would bring 200 jobs to the area .
big picture developments ltd has been picked as preferred developer .
" the development of this site will complete a comprehensive development scheme for the foyle street area initiated almost 20 years ago by government , with the aim of encouraging private sector investment , " he said .
" that initiative has succeeded in delivering key projects such as the foyleside shopping centre and orchard house and is now completed . "
he said it was estimated that the foyle street development will provide 200 jobs in the construction industry and when completed , over 200 jobs in the retail and tourism sectors .
the big picture developments ltd scheme , involves a boutique hotel ; apartments ; restaurant ; retail units and public inner courtyard .
' respectful ' it is expected to open by 2009 , subject to obtaining planning permission .
big picture director , barry gilligan , said they believed they could deliver a " very exciting and innovative new development " .
" we 're looking forward in the coming months to sitting down with community , business and political representatives to present and explain our plans , while at the same time moving ahead with the necessary agreements and permissions required to get started on site as soon as possible , " he said .
mayor of derry helen quigley said the designs for the scheme she had seen were " respectful and complementary " to the historic setting .
" i am also pleased that the development will enhance the city 's growing evening economy by generating more opportunities for city centre living and eating out , " she said .

one of his most outstanding legacies was a political commitment to african continental unity .
the arabic-speaking states of north africa were , in his vision , no less african than those predominantly non-arab states south of the sahara .
with his initial encouragement , arabs have since become active participants in the politics of africa .
nkrumah 's was no easy mission .
there were many in africa and in the west who wished to extricate arab countries from costly african commitments and interventions south of the sahara .
but nkrumah 's special friendship with the egyptian leader gamal abdel nasser - after whom i was named - was instrumental in cementing arab-african ties .
tempestuous relations nasser was a strong advocate of the african component of the egyptian national composition , the first egyptian leader to take such a view .
according to him , egypt 's national make-up is composed of the intersection of three circles - the arab , the islamic and the african .
the destinies of " arabs " and " africans " have historically and geographically been inextricably intertwined be that as it may , relations between arabs and sub-saharan africans have often been uneasy - and at times even tempestuous .
the precise nature of the role expected to be played by arabs in pan-african politics was at first only dimly understood .
self-styled " arab " somalia fought non-arab ethiopia .
" arab " mauritania went to battle against non-arab senegal .
the so-called borderlands of the sahara and the sahel have become a veritable frontline where " arabs " and " africans " bitterly engage in war .
the focus of much of the fighting has traditionally been sudan , a member of the arab league , a body that groups 22 states - including not only the mediterranean north african countries of egypt , libya , tunisia , algeria and morocco , but also mauritania , sudan , somalia , djibouti and the comoros .
geographically the largest african country , sudan has been embroiled intermittently in civil war since its independence in 1956 .
the international media persists in propagating confusing myths and half-truths about the war between the " arab muslim north " and the " black african south " .
but the north is not composed entirely of ethnic arabs , and most of those classified as " arabs " are far darker in complexion than many of the congressional black caucus members .
similarly conflict in sudan 's province of darfur is depicted as between " arabs " and " black africans " .
there has been a perceptible change in attitudes and perceptions over the years of tensions between " african " and " arab " , but these incremental changes have on the whole been rather negative .
expectations in the wake of the 1973 arab-israeli war and the sudden price hikes of crude oil , african countries began sizing up the readiness of oil-rich arab countries to offer economic aid and financial assistance .
african countries had high expectations of arab largesse , but were sorely disappointed .
sub-saharan migrants head to morocco on their way to europe not only was money not forthcoming , but it became apparent that arab countries were developing countries , after all , and incapable of lending a helping hand in the area of technical expertise .
arabs , in turn , quietly brooded over the consequences of not being able to measure up to african expectations .
summits have reconciled enemies before : chad and libya ; sudan and its numerous neighbours .
but there is no escaping the fact that what are often mistakenly dubbed " arab " versus " african " conflicts have disturbed the placid surface of nkrumah 's vision of african continental unity .
african governments north and south of the sahara can not be absolved of responsibility .
and recently , friction has arisen due to the influx of african youth into arab states .
their main goal of immigrating to the west - and in particular europe - necessitates a long and uncomfortable sojourn in north african transit points .
the stories that filtered back are harrowing : death at sea , slave labour , prostitution and narcotic trafficking and an alarming wave of racism in north africa .
nevertheless , the destinies of " arabs " and " africans " have historically and geographically been inextricably intertwined .
the only way forward for africa is continental african union as envisaged by kwame nkrumah .

one of his most outstanding legacies was a political commitment to african continental unity .
the arabic-speaking states of north africa were , in his vision , no less african than those predominantly non-arab states south of the sahara .
with his initial encouragement , arabs have since become active participants in the politics of africa .
nkrumah 's was no easy mission .
there were many in africa and in the west who wished to extricate arab countries from costly african commitments and interventions south of the sahara .
but nkrumah 's special friendship with the egyptian leader gamal abdel nasser - after whom i was named - was instrumental in cementing arab-african ties .
tempestuous relations nasser was a strong advocate of the african component of the egyptian national composition , the first egyptian leader to take such a view .
according to him , egypt 's national make-up is composed of the intersection of three circles - the arab , the islamic and the african .
the destinies of " arabs " and " africans " have historically and geographically been inextricably intertwined be that as it may , relations between arabs and sub-saharan africans have often been uneasy - and at times even tempestuous .
the precise nature of the role expected to be played by arabs in pan-african politics was at first only dimly understood .
self-styled " arab " somalia fought non-arab ethiopia .
" arab " mauritania went to battle against non-arab senegal .
the so-called borderlands of the sahara and the sahel have become a veritable frontline where " arabs " and " africans " bitterly engage in war .
the focus of much of the fighting has traditionally been sudan , a member of the arab league , a body that groups 22 states - including not only the mediterranean north african countries of egypt , libya , tunisia , algeria and morocco , but also mauritania , sudan , somalia , djibouti and the comoros .
geographically the largest african country , sudan has been embroiled intermittently in civil war since its independence in 1956 .
the international media persists in propagating confusing myths and half-truths about the war between the " arab muslim north " and the " black african south " .

suffolk county council and six district councils in the county are applying to the government to share services such as human resources and it .
the pathfinder bid aims to deliver cheaper and better services for taxpayers across suffolk .
other councils in the bid are babergh , mid suffolk , forest heath , suffolk coastal , st edmundsbury and waveney .
the pathfinder bid is due to be ratified at council meetings across suffolk before being delivered to central government later this month .
the shake-up follows the publication of the local government white paper last autumn giving all local councils the chance to re-shape local government to fit their local needs .
the suffolk pathfinder bid proposes simplifying structures , making it easier for local communities to shape services , pooling resources like computer systems and joining with commercial and voluntary partners to make local government more effective .
leader of suffolk county council jeremy pembroke said : " our vision is a model for modern 21st century government that will give power back to our communities . "
he said it was " a real opportunity " for people to get involved and shape the way their services are delivered .
