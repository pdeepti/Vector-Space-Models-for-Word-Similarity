for 10 years , his testimonies , in exchange for his freedom , have helped police crack down on organized crime . if the three italians on trial in düsseldorf for cocaine-trafficking are found guilty , it won ’ t be the first time that evidence supplied by mobster-turned-police informant basile puts suspected mafiosi behind bars .
before he was even 40 , the man they called " angel face " had murdered up to 30 people . after being arrested in the allgäu region of southern germany in 1998 , he was allowed to go free .
in return for his new life in a witness protection program , he has helped police lock up over 50 criminals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mafia hotbed corleone in sicily now 47 , basile , who will testify wednesday via video from a secret location in italy , was once one of the most redoubtable top dogs within the carelli clan , which belongs to calabria 's notorious ' ndrangheta .
among the most powerful and ruthless mafia-like organizations in italy , ' ndrangheta cells are loosely based on blood relationships .
the organization is believed to rake in some $ 30 billion -lrb- 22 billion euros -rrb- annually , mostly from illegal narcotics , but also from ostensibly legal businesses such as construction , restaurants and supermarkets .
allegedly , it is also involved in counterfeiting , gambling , fraud , theft , labor racketeering , loan sharking , people smuggling and kidnapping .
the ' ndrangheta ‘ s family ties are believed to be closer and their vows of silence more strictly observed than other mafia clans , such as cosa nostra and camorra .
so when giorgio basile decided to break them , it marked a watershed in germany 's fight against the mafia .
becoming numero uno bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlon brando as don corleone in " the godfather " with all the ingredients of a classic " godfather " film , it comes as no surprise that basile 's story has attracted the attention of a munich film company which has worked in the past with german star movie director oliver hirschbiegel -lrb- the downfall -rrb- .
born in corigliano calabro in 1960 , giorgio moved one year later to mühlheim an der ruhr in germany , where his father made a living as a " guest worker . "
in 1966 , his parents separated when his father realized his mother was having an affair .
her lover was antonio de cicco , local boss of the ' ndrangheta in corigliano and every bit the latin stereotype in his sharp suits with slicked-back hair and gold chains .
giorgio spent two years in italy with his new family , but returned to germany when his mother got pregnant .
he lost touch with his adopted father until 1979 , when at the age of 19 , giorgio was persuaded by de cicco to leave the dull , industrial trappings of western germany and work as his driver back in corigliano .
as a fledgling ' ndrinu , he enjoyed the attention his association with de cicco afforded him and soon became versed in the ways of the clan .
but when he discovered his adopted father had been abusing his sister , he resolved to avenge her .
in 1973 , he made his first killing , when he murdered de cicco .
by now , he was one of the most powerful cocaine dealers in tuscany , and a recognized uomo d ' onore -lrb- man of honor -rrb- .
it was during these years that he met his wife , who bore him a daughter .
he extended the business further afield , and in the 1980s , played a key role in building up mafia influence in germany .
betrayed by the organization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mafia boss giuseppe bellocco was arrested in calabria on tuesday arrested in 1998 , he opted to break the omertà , the mafia ‘ s " code of silence " .
within mafia culture , this made him a " stool pigeon " - a violation punishable by death .
according to andreas ulrich , author of " angel face , " a biography of giorgio basile , he agreed to name names because " he felt betrayed by the organization . "
" it never comes good on its promises , " he said .
" it lures young men with promises of power , money and women .
it uses them , then kills them as though they were ants . "
basile has said he lives with the knowledge that the mafia will hunt him down and kill him .
" the mafia bosses are behind bars because of what i did , " he told ulrich .
" they can ‘ t do anything to me any more , but their sons will avenge them . "
eighteen months ago , he told the online version of german news magazine der spiegel that the mafia 's influence was stronger than ever .
" the mafia will continue to expand , " he said .
" the enlarged europe will allow it to spread even further .
for someone with the same criminal energy as i had , it 's even easier in germany than it is in italy .
you can get away with anything . "
basile said the german authorities had failed to recognize the extent of the criminal energy that exists within the underground italian community .
" i couldn ’ t put a figure to it , but germany is home to many sleepers .
go in to any pizzeria and you might find the cook is a hitman just waiting for a call , " he said .
the mob in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giorgio basile the extent of mob influence is definitely underestimated in germany , said mafia expert jürgen roth .
" when berlusconi was in power there was very little information coming out of italy , " he explained .
" the mafia took the opportunity to get a foothold in germany . there is now barely any knowledge of the mafia 's criminal structures here .
it is active mainly in the area of money laundering , drug and weapons trading , protection racketeering and prostitution . "
while the biggest ' ndrangheta presence is in eastern german states such as thuringia and saxony , roth says cosa nostra actually has a higher profile in baden-württemberg .
earlier this month , italy ’ s leading mafia hunter , piero grasso , warned germany in the neue osnabrücker zeitung daily that the mob was even beginning to penetrate legitimate business circles in germany .
" the size and profit potential of german markets , as well as german law , makes the country highly attractive to organized criminals , " he said .

as a fledgling ' ndrinu , he enjoyed the attention his association with de cicco afforded him and soon became versed in the ways of the clan .
but when he discovered his adopted father had been abusing his sister , he resolved to avenge her .
in 1973 , he made his first killing , when he murdered de cicco .
by now , he was one of the most powerful cocaine dealers in tuscany , and a recognized uomo d ' onore -lrb- man of honor -rrb- .
it was during these years that he met his wife , who bore him a daughter .
he extended the business further afield , and in the 1980s , played a key role in building up mafia influence in germany .
betrayed by the organization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mafia boss giuseppe bellocco was arrested in calabria on tuesday arrested in 1998 , he opted to break the omertà , the mafia ‘ s " code of silence " .
within mafia culture , this made him a " stool pigeon " - a violation punishable by death .
according to andreas ulrich , author of " angel face , " a biography of giorgio basile , he agreed to name names because " he felt betrayed by the organization . "
" it never comes good on its promises , " he said .
" it lures young men with promises of power , money and women .
it uses them , then kills them as though they were ants . "
basile has said he lives with the knowledge that the mafia will hunt him down and kill him .
" the mafia bosses are behind bars because of what i did , " he told ulrich .
" they can ‘ t do anything to me any more , but their sons will avenge them . "
eighteen months ago , he told the online version of german news magazine der spiegel that the mafia 's influence was stronger than ever .
" the mafia will continue to expand , " he said .
" the enlarged europe will allow it to spread even further .
for someone with the same criminal energy as i had , it 's even easier in germany than it is in italy .
you can get away with anything . "
basile said the german authorities had failed to recognize the extent of the criminal energy that exists within the underground italian community .
" i couldn ’ t put a figure to it , but germany is home to many sleepers .
go in to any pizzeria and you might find the cook is a hitman just waiting for a call , " he said .
the mob in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giorgio basile the extent of mob influence is definitely underestimated in germany , said mafia expert jürgen roth .
" when berlusconi was in power there was very little information coming out of italy , " he explained .
" the mafia took the opportunity to get a foothold in germany . there is now barely any knowledge of the mafia 's criminal structures here .
it is active mainly in the area of money laundering , drug and weapons trading , protection racketeering and prostitution . "
while the biggest ' ndrangheta presence is in eastern german states such as thuringia and saxony , roth says cosa nostra actually has a higher profile in baden-württemberg .
earlier this month , italy ’ s leading mafia hunter , piero grasso , warned germany in the neue osnabrücker zeitung daily that the mob was even beginning to penetrate legitimate business circles in germany .
" the size and profit potential of german markets , as well as german law , makes the country highly attractive to organized criminals , " he said .
" their goal is to infiltrate legal financial circles in order to invest illegally gained funds with a long-term aim of dominating price wars and creating monopolies . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german and other european leaders have welcomed us president george w. bush 's new middle east initiative calling for an international conference to explore ways of creating a palestinian state . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said germany supported the goal of laying the foundation for " a successful palestinian state " with which peace talks could be conducted .
a two-state solution in the middle east needs a viable palestinian state with an effective government , solid finances , a functioning economy and a society based on law and justice , he said .
ulrich said former british prime minister tony blair had an important role to play as the representative of the mideast quartet , which is made up of the united nations , the european union , the united states and russia .
the quartet is expected to meet in lisbon , portugal , on thursday .

german and other european leaders have welcomed us president george w. bush 's new middle east initiative calling for an international conference to explore ways of creating a palestinian state . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said germany supported the goal of laying the foundation for " a successful palestinian state " with which peace talks could be conducted .
a two-state solution in the middle east needs a viable palestinian state with an effective government , solid finances , a functioning economy and a society based on law and justice , he said .
ulrich said former british prime minister tony blair had an important role to play as the representative of the mideast quartet , which is made up of the united nations , the european union , the united states and russia .
the quartet is expected to meet in lisbon , portugal , on thursday .
blair was picked last month by the quartet to help the palestinians build up their institutions and promote international political and economic support .
bolstering fatah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many palestinians also listened to what bush had to say in his initiative announced monday , bush said us secretary of state condoleezza rice would chair a conference in the autumn that would consist primarily of the israelis and palestinians as well as middle east countries committed to a two-state solution to the conflict .

but perhaps his finest hour came on the political stage in 1989 . masur was born on july 18 , 1927 in what is now the city of brzeg in poland .
the son of an engineer , he taught himself piano as a young child and quickly specialized in conducting - despite suffering from a nervous stutter . in 1970 , masur became kapellmeister at leipzig 's gewandhaus orchestra - the musical ensemble with which he remains most closely associated .
he stayed in the post for 27 years , putting the orchestra back on the international map and presiding over the building of a new concert hall to replace the former one that had been badly damaged by allied bombing during world war ii . in leipzig , masur established an international reputation as a sensitive and innovative interpreter of the classical and romantic repertoire - and specifically mendelssohn , brahms and tchaikovsky . a master of the requiem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of leipzigers protested every monday in 1989 his best-known recording came in 1982 with an interpretation of richard strauss 's " four last songs . "
masur drastically slowed the tempi to create expressive space for soprano jessye norman 's booming , gospel-tinged voice , turning what is often a quiet meditation on impending mortality into a hike through a particularly lush cemetery . decried by some as sluggish bombast , the recording is still in print after 25 years and regularly shows up on classical-music critics ' " best-of " lists . masur has also wielded the baton for new york and london philharmonic orchestras .
despite plans to scale back his activities , he continues to be one of the world 's most sought after and active conductors . calls for non-violence bildunterschrift : masur publicly came out in support of the demonstrators masur declined offers to leave east germany through much of his career and enjoyed cordial relations with former gdr leader erich honecker .

in interviews since then , masur has played down his role in the " peaceful revolution " of 1989 . " i was only one among many people who overcame their fear , " he said . masur has received numerous honors from leipzig and germany for his musical achievements and personal courage . the night of july 18 has been set aside for a concert as part of the london proms with masur conducting the london philharmonic and the orchestre national de france in performances of bruckner and tchaikovsky - a fitting way for a musician who 's always close to the people to spend his eightieth birthday . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but perhaps his finest hour came on the political stage in 1989 . masur was born on july 18 , 1927 in what is now the city of brzeg in poland .
the son of an engineer , he taught himself piano as a young child and quickly specialized in conducting - despite suffering from a nervous stutter . in 1970 , masur became kapellmeister at leipzig 's gewandhaus orchestra - the musical ensemble with which he remains most closely associated .
he stayed in the post for 27 years , putting the orchestra back on the international map and presiding over the building of a new concert hall to replace the former one that had been badly damaged by allied bombing during world war ii . in leipzig , masur established an international reputation as a sensitive and innovative interpreter of the classical and romantic repertoire - and specifically mendelssohn , brahms and tchaikovsky . a master of the requiem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of leipzigers protested every monday in 1989 his best-known recording came in 1982 with an interpretation of richard strauss 's " four last songs . "
masur drastically slowed the tempi to create expressive space for soprano jessye norman 's booming , gospel-tinged voice , turning what is often a quiet meditation on impending mortality into a hike through a particularly lush cemetery . decried by some as sluggish bombast , the recording is still in print after 25 years and regularly shows up on classical-music critics ' " best-of " lists . masur has also wielded the baton for new york and london philharmonic orchestras .
despite plans to scale back his activities , he continues to be one of the world 's most sought after and active conductors . calls for non-violence bildunterschrift : masur publicly came out in support of the demonstrators masur declined offers to leave east germany through much of his career and enjoyed cordial relations with former gdr leader erich honecker .
but he never joined the communist party . in 1989 , amidst growing anti-government protests in leipzig , masur criticized violence by riot police against the demonstrators .
on oct .
9 of that year , he read a public appeal for freedom of discussion in the socialist state - an act widely regarded as helping convince leipzig police to disregard orders from berlin and allow the weekly " monday protests " to continue . " in the same century that saw two world wars , i was witness to a peaceful revolution , " masur told the dpa news agency .

in interviews since then , masur has played down his role in the " peaceful revolution " of 1989 . " i was only one among many people who overcame their fear , " he said . masur has received numerous honors from leipzig and germany for his musical achievements and personal courage . the night of july 18 has been set aside for a concert as part of the london proms with masur conducting the london philharmonic and the orchestre national de france in performances of bruckner and tchaikovsky - a fitting way for a musician who 's always close to the people to spend his eightieth birthday . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gradual disclosures since june 28 , when electrical defects shut down the company 's reactors at krümmel and brunsbüttel near hamburg , have revealed that staff at krümmel were in crisis as a fire raged in a transformer .
neither reactor was damaged and no radioactivity was released , but vattenfall - and the whole nuclear industry in germany - suffered a public relations disaster .

the dutch health ministry said thousands had registered to donate organs since the show aired . more than 12,000 people in the netherlands have registered as organ donors since the broadcast of " the big donorshow " on june 1 , when three contestants vied for the kidney of a dying woman .
the show was revealed to be a hoax at the end of the broadcast , with the role of the " lisa , " who was purportedly suffering from a brain tumor , being played by an actress .
the dutch television network bnn and producers endemol said they wanted to highlight the desperate need for organ donors in the netherlands , which has once of the lowest organ donation rates in europe .

the dutch health ministry released a statement this week revealing a sharp jump in the number of people joining the organ donor registry , with 43,000 forms being downloaded from its web site in the weeks after " the big donorshow " was aired .
of the 12,000 registrations in the last six weeks , 64 percent were people who had never previously been listed as organ donors .
the donor registry normally receives between 3,000 and 4,000 forms each month .
shock tactics pay off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presenter patrick lodiers revealed the truth around 1.2 million people watched the program , which bnn defended , saying it wanted to create public awareness about the suffering of those waiting for transplants in the netherlands , where the average waiting time for a kidney transplant is more than four years .
although the competition was a sham , the three candidates were genuine patients in need of kidney transplants .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 18.07.2007 energy giant 's europe chief quits after nuclear scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus rauscher stepped down on wednesday amid growing criticism of the company 's handling of fires at two german nuclear plants , vattenfall europe 's ceo resigned wednesday .
government leaders meanwhile mulled the future of atomic energy . vattenfall europe ceo klaus rauscher offered his resignation on wednesday after the brunsbüttel nuclear power plant had to be shut off for the third time in three weeks because of problems .
" rauscher explained that it can not be denied that the events of the past few weeks have tarnished the image of vattenfall europe , " read a statement released by vattenfall 's supervisory board chief , lars g. josefsson .
" errors have been made for which he , as head of vattenfall europe , must bear responsibility . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krümmel nuclear plant is still not back in operation a fire in the company 's nearby krümmel nuclear power plant in june had started a series of problems that led to the firing of vattenfall europe 's nuclear energy chief , bruno thomauske , on monday .
gradual disclosures since june 28 , when electrical defects shut down the company 's reactors at krümmel and brunsbüttel near hamburg , have revealed that staff at krümmel were in crisis as a fire raged in a transformer .
neither reactor was damaged and no radioactivity was released , but vattenfall - and the whole nuclear industry in germany - suffered a public relations disaster .
the company said it was commissioning an independent inquiry by scientists and business experts with a budget of 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6.8 million -rrb- to examine exactly what went wrong .
ministers divided on what to do bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , angela merkel and michael glos -lrb- from left -rrb- german economy minister michael glos meanwhile sprang to the defense of the country 's nuclear power stations on wednesday , saying that despite the recent problems , even the oldest plants were ahead of the rest of the world in terms of security .
" what 's definite is that the reactors in operation are as safe as is humanly possible , " glos told german public television zdf .
" on this point , we in germany are ahead " , the minister said .
glos also added that said that the safety of the power stations had nothing to do with their age .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel on the other hand had called for the oldest plants , which began operating in the early 1970s , to be shut down .
in return , the remaining operation time on these plants could be transferred to younger plants , but energy providers are not keen on doing so as the old ones operate much more profitably .
merkel has no pity chancellor angela merkel , who has in the past supported a rethink of germany 's planned nuclear energy phase-out , said wednesday that she could understand the public 's concerns and its criticism of the nuclear industry .
" my pity for the industry is limited , " she said , adding that she found vattenfall 's information policy " totally unacceptable .
" after all , dramatic errors were committed , " merkel said .
but the chancellor also said that the entire industry should not be stigmatized .
" i would n't generalize , " she said .

government leaders meanwhile mulled the future of atomic energy . vattenfall europe ceo klaus rauscher offered his resignation on wednesday after the brunsbüttel nuclear power plant had to be shut off for the third time in three weeks because of problems .
" rauscher explained that it can not be denied that the events of the past few weeks have tarnished the image of vattenfall europe , " read a statement released by vattenfall 's supervisory board chief , lars g. josefsson .
" errors have been made for which he , as head of vattenfall europe , must bear responsibility . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krümmel nuclear plant is still not back in operation a fire in the company 's nearby krümmel nuclear power plant in june had started a series of problems that led to the firing of vattenfall europe 's nuclear energy chief , bruno thomauske , on monday .
gradual disclosures since june 28 , when electrical defects shut down the company 's reactors at krümmel and brunsbüttel near hamburg , have revealed that staff at krümmel were in crisis as a fire raged in a transformer .
neither reactor was damaged and no radioactivity was released , but vattenfall - and the whole nuclear industry in germany - suffered a public relations disaster .
the company said it was commissioning an independent inquiry by scientists and business experts with a budget of 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6.8 million -rrb- to examine exactly what went wrong .
ministers divided on what to do bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , angela merkel and michael glos -lrb- from left -rrb- german economy minister michael glos meanwhile sprang to the defense of the country 's nuclear power stations on wednesday , saying that despite the recent problems , even the oldest plants were ahead of the rest of the world in terms of security .
" what 's definite is that the reactors in operation are as safe as is humanly possible , " glos told german public television zdf .
" on this point , we in germany are ahead " , the minister said .
glos also added that said that the safety of the power stations had nothing to do with their age .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel on the other hand had called for the oldest plants , which began operating in the early 1970s , to be shut down .
in return , the remaining operation time on these plants could be transferred to younger plants , but energy providers are not keen on doing so as the old ones operate much more profitably .
merkel has no pity chancellor angela merkel , who has in the past supported a rethink of germany 's planned nuclear energy phase-out , said wednesday that she could understand the public 's concerns and its criticism of the nuclear industry .
" my pity for the industry is limited , " she said , adding that she found vattenfall 's information policy " totally unacceptable .
" after all , dramatic errors were committed , " merkel said .
but the chancellor also said that the entire industry should not be stigmatized .

but the entire incident might lead to others blackmailing the west , says dw 's rainer sollich . the whole trial was a cynical game of blackmail with foreign hostages - and a still uncertain outcome .
the gadhafi regime tellingly did n't even consider it necessary to come up with comprehensible charges .
it would have been hard to imagine - even in many other dictatorships - that such a bizarre accusation turns into a verdict that 's upheld by several courts : the death penalty for foreign medical personnel accused of - deliberately - infecting more than 400 libyan children with the virus that causes aids .
it does n't get much more grotesque than this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least it 's clear now that the death penalty will not be executed .
one can only hop that that the nurses will soon be transferred to bulgaria .
but even that 's probably also a question of money .
it 's already clear the families of the hiv-infected children will receive compensation that also partially comes from europe .
it 's safe to presume this despite the denials .
one could say that all those involved will benefit in the end .
but that 's still not certain , and even if that 's indeed the case , it still gets more complicated .
the families of the libyan victims should get any help that 's possible , but one should n't overlook the fact that the fate of the nurses is still unknown and that they spent eight years - presumably innocent - in prison .
reports by international experts documented their innocence in a credible way .
according to them , a lack of hygiene in the hospital was responsible for the infections .
it 's obvious why these reports were ignored .
no libyan judge could reach a verdict that would blame the state health care system - and indirectly the ruling class below dictator moammar gadhafi - for the hiv infections of more than 400 children .
that 's why they searched for a way to save face - and simply blamed foreign nurses and physicians .
gadhafi knows exactly who much the europeans need him and his country .
libya is not only gradually opening up to western markets and possesses large oil reserves , the country is also needed by the europeans as a bastion against illegal immigration .
the west is also relieved that libya has renounced terrorism .
that 's why gadhafi thinks he can afford to take foreign medical personnel hostage for his interests .
once the foreigners are released , nothing will stand in the way of good relations with the west .
other regimes could learn a lesson from this : how to blackmail western states .

but the entire incident might lead to others blackmailing the west , says dw 's rainer sollich . the whole trial was a cynical game of blackmail with foreign hostages - and a still uncertain outcome .
the gadhafi regime tellingly did n't even consider it necessary to come up with comprehensible charges .
it would have been hard to imagine - even in many other dictatorships - that such a bizarre accusation turns into a verdict that 's upheld by several courts : the death penalty for foreign medical personnel accused of - deliberately - infecting more than 400 libyan children with the virus that causes aids .
it does n't get much more grotesque than this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least it 's clear now that the death penalty will not be executed .
one can only hop that that the nurses will soon be transferred to bulgaria .
but even that 's probably also a question of money .
it 's already clear the families of the hiv-infected children will receive compensation that also partially comes from europe .
it 's safe to presume this despite the denials .
one could say that all those involved will benefit in the end .
but that 's still not certain , and even if that 's indeed the case , it still gets more complicated .
the families of the libyan victims should get any help that 's possible , but one should n't overlook the fact that the fate of the nurses is still unknown and that they spent eight years - presumably innocent - in prison .
reports by international experts documented their innocence in a credible way .
according to them , a lack of hygiene in the hospital was responsible for the infections .
it 's obvious why these reports were ignored .
no libyan judge could reach a verdict that would blame the state health care system - and indirectly the ruling class below dictator moammar gadhafi - for the hiv infections of more than 400 children .
that 's why they searched for a way to save face - and simply blamed foreign nurses and physicians .
gadhafi knows exactly who much the europeans need him and his country .
libya is not only gradually opening up to western markets and possesses large oil reserves , the country is also needed by the europeans as a bastion against illegal immigration .
the west is also relieved that libya has renounced terrorism .
that 's why gadhafi thinks he can afford to take foreign medical personnel hostage for his interests .
once the foreigners are released , nothing will stand in the way of good relations with the west .
other regimes could learn a lesson from this : how to blackmail western states .

" you ca n't wait until the tour is over , " brender said .
" that 's impossible .
the tour is under constant doping suspicion . "
the german cycling federation had said earlier wednesday that cyclist patrik sinkewitz tested positive for the steroid testosterone at an out-of-competition test on june 8 , ahead of the tour de france . sinkewitz faces a two-year ban from competitive cycling if found guilty of a doping offence . peter kaadtmann , the ard and zdf team chief at the tour , was quoted as saying that " our contract stated that we broadcast the tour as a competition of clean riders , not of people using doping substances . " viewers had to turn elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrik sinkewitz instead of broadcasting the day 's 10th stage , ard ran a feature on doping and interviewed all parties involved .
that program was followed by a telenovela . the two networks also terminated their internet live-ticker of the event . germans who wanted to follow the race had to resort to the eurosport network and its german-language broadcast after the decision . doping has never before prompted german networks to pull the plug on a planned broadcast . but zdf did not broadcast the 1985 european cup final after rioting liverpool fans caused the death of 37 mainly juventus fans ahead of the match between the two sides in brussels ' heysel stadium . ard and zdf , who are funded by fees from every german who owns a tv set , have long held the german tour de france broadcast rights .
no figures have been released but they are worth several million euros . they planned to broadcast a total 90 hours from the three-week tour which ends on july 29 in paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans missed jan ullrich at last year 's tour ratings surged when jan ullrich won the tour in 1997 and came second several times afterwards , but there were always critical voices over the big engagement because the sport was doping-infested . under pressure ard was under special pressure as the network was a sponsor of the telekom team , which is now called t-mobile , from 1998 until 2004 . the networks have become cautious in the past 12 months since ullrich was heavily implicated in the spanish doping probe centering on doctor eufemiano fuentes . ullrich was kicked out of t-mobile on the eve of the 2006 tour . in recent weeks , half a dozen former riders including 1996 tour champion bjarne riss confessed to doping on the team in the 1990s . two team doctors were kicked out in may after admitting to have been actively involved in that doping scheme , t-mobile 's ukrainian rider serhiy honchar was also fired in may over reportedly suspicious test results , and german rider matthias kessler from the astana team was recently caught for testosterone abuse . warned ahead of time ard and zdf told german cycling teams ahead of the tour de france that they could pull the plug if another rider was caught , and sinkewitz ' positive test for testosterone was announced wednesday . bildunterschrift : germany 's gerdemann won the 7th stage last saturday sinkewitz was caught at an out-of-competition test ahead of the tour , but rode in the tour until withdrawing injured on monday . " we talked to the german teams , told them how serious the situation was , " said ard programme director günter struve .
" t-mobile in particular swore that everything was fine with them . " t-mobile has introduced one of the stiffest anti-doping programs in the sport , but not even that may have stopped sinkewitz from tampering . the tv boycott could now also play a major role in sponsor commitments in cycling , with t-mobile company spokesman christian frommert " not ruling out anything " when the tour is assessed . t-mobile only recently committed itself until 2010 . frommert admitted that " the stakes are high " after the move by the networks , while brender said he hoped that wednesday 's move will prompt the teams , and cycling in general , into more action .

" all kinds of nazi incendiary writings have been published in a scientific format , except for ' mein kampf , " ' said möller , a history professor at munich university .
" in my opinion , it 's not justifiable to prohibit this for a single document out of fear that it might have a negative , symbolic effect . "
copyright issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's book was on display at a book fair in tehran in 2006 bavaria 's finance ministry , which holds the copyright to " mein kampf , " has so far refused to permit publication of the book .
while it has been published abroad after 1945 , it is only available for scientific research within germany .
in the interview , möller said that he had recently discussed the issue with bavarian finance minister kurt falthauser , who had declined to give permission .
möller also said that officials at germany 's foreign ministry , where möller 's publicly funded institute also has an office , had advised against publication , saying that it could have a negative effect for germany abroad .
but the copyright is running out in 2015 and möller said he expected many to try and make a quick buck with a sensationalist publication of the book .
his institute , on the other hand , has the resources and expertise to produce an edition that wo n't be easily abused by neo-nazis for propaganda purposes , möller said .
a need for disillusionment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : möller says that " mein kampf " should be published in an annotated edition just like other nazi writings " the book is badly written , it 's put together from all kinds of different sources and consists of many incendiary tirades , " möller said , adding that the book still deserved scientific attention as a key document of the national-socialist regime .
" as long as a carefully annotated edition of ' mein kampf ' does n't exist , the simple-minded speculations about the book 's contents wo n't end . "
mein kampf sets out hitler 's claim that " aryans " were the founders of human culture and jews its spoilers as well as his denunciation of " inferior races " and call to seize lebensraum or territory in eastern europe . prohibiting publication beyond 2015 bavarian finance ministry officials meanwhile said that publication of a sensationalist edition of " mein kampf " would still be illegal after the copyright expires as german law prohibits the distribution of national-socialist propaganda . they also said that the bavarian government feels a responsibility towards protecting holocaust victims against a new publication of the book - including an annotated version as suggested by möller . " considering that bavaria 's strict stance ... is welcomed and supported both domestically and abroad , permission to reprint ' mein kampf ' still can not be considered , " reads a statement from the ministry . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for 10 years , his testimonies , in exchange for his freedom , have helped police crack down on organized crime . if the three italians on trial in düsseldorf for cocaine-trafficking are found guilty , it won ’ t be the first time that evidence supplied by mobster-turned-police informant basile puts suspected mafiosi behind bars .
before he was even 40 , the man they called " angel face " had murdered up to 30 people . after being arrested in the allgäu region of southern germany in 1998 , he was allowed to go free .
in return for his new life in a witness protection program , he has helped police lock up over 50 criminals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mafia hotbed corleone in sicily now 47 , basile , who will testify wednesday via video from a secret location in italy , was once one of the most redoubtable top dogs within the carelli clan , which belongs to calabria 's notorious ' ndrangheta .
among the most powerful and ruthless mafia-like organizations in italy , ' ndrangheta cells are loosely based on blood relationships .
the organization is believed to rake in some $ 30 billion -lrb- 22 billion euros -rrb- annually , mostly from illegal narcotics , but also from ostensibly legal businesses such as construction , restaurants and supermarkets .
allegedly , it is also involved in counterfeiting , gambling , fraud , theft , labor racketeering , loan sharking , people smuggling and kidnapping .
the ' ndrangheta ‘ s family ties are believed to be closer and their vows of silence more strictly observed than other mafia clans , such as cosa nostra and camorra .
so when giorgio basile decided to break them , it marked a watershed in germany 's fight against the mafia .
becoming numero uno bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlon brando as don corleone in " the godfather " with all the ingredients of a classic " godfather " film , it comes as no surprise that basile 's story has attracted the attention of a munich film company which has worked in the past with german star movie director oliver hirschbiegel -lrb- the downfall -rrb- .
born in corigliano calabro in 1960 , giorgio moved one year later to mühlheim an der ruhr in germany , where his father made a living as a " guest worker . "
in 1966 , his parents separated when his father realized his mother was having an affair .
her lover was antonio de cicco , local boss of the ' ndrangheta in corigliano and every bit the latin stereotype in his sharp suits with slicked-back hair and gold chains .
giorgio spent two years in italy with his new family , but returned to germany when his mother got pregnant .
he lost touch with his adopted father until 1979 , when at the age of 19 , giorgio was persuaded by de cicco to leave the dull , industrial trappings of western germany and work as his driver back in corigliano .
as a fledgling ' ndrinu , he enjoyed the attention his association with de cicco afforded him and soon became versed in the ways of the clan .
but when he discovered his adopted father had been abusing his sister , he resolved to avenge her .
in 1973 , he made his first killing , when he murdered de cicco .
by now , he was one of the most powerful cocaine dealers in tuscany , and a recognized uomo d ' onore -lrb- man of honor -rrb- .
it was during these years that he met his wife , who bore him a daughter .
he extended the business further afield , and in the 1980s , played a key role in building up mafia influence in germany .
betrayed by the organization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mafia boss giuseppe bellocco was arrested in calabria on tuesday arrested in 1998 , he opted to break the omertà , the mafia ‘ s " code of silence " .
within mafia culture , this made him a " stool pigeon " - a violation punishable by death .
according to andreas ulrich , author of " angel face , " a biography of giorgio basile , he agreed to name names because " he felt betrayed by the organization . "
" it never comes good on its promises , " he said .
" it lures young men with promises of power , money and women .
it uses them , then kills them as though they were ants . "
basile has said he lives with the knowledge that the mafia will hunt him down and kill him .
" the mafia bosses are behind bars because of what i did , " he told ulrich .
" they can ‘ t do anything to me any more , but their sons will avenge them . "
eighteen months ago , he told the online version of german news magazine der spiegel that the mafia 's influence was stronger than ever .
" the mafia will continue to expand , " he said .
" the enlarged europe will allow it to spread even further .
for someone with the same criminal energy as i had , it 's even easier in germany than it is in italy .
you can get away with anything . "
basile said the german authorities had failed to recognize the extent of the criminal energy that exists within the underground italian community .
" i couldn ’ t put a figure to it , but germany is home to many sleepers .
go in to any pizzeria and you might find the cook is a hitman just waiting for a call , " he said .
the mob in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giorgio basile the extent of mob influence is definitely underestimated in germany , said mafia expert jürgen roth .
" when berlusconi was in power there was very little information coming out of italy , " he explained .
" the mafia took the opportunity to get a foothold in germany . there is now barely any knowledge of the mafia 's criminal structures here .
it is active mainly in the area of money laundering , drug and weapons trading , protection racketeering and prostitution . "
while the biggest ' ndrangheta presence is in eastern german states such as thuringia and saxony , roth says cosa nostra actually has a higher profile in baden-württemberg .
earlier this month , italy ’ s leading mafia hunter , piero grasso , warned germany in the neue osnabrücker zeitung daily that the mob was even beginning to penetrate legitimate business circles in germany .
" the size and profit potential of german markets , as well as german law , makes the country highly attractive to organized criminals , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 18.07.2007 opinion : gadhafi 's cynical game of blackmail großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans may breathe a sigh of relief that libya has commuted the death sentences of bulgarian nurses .
but the entire incident might lead to others blackmailing the west , says dw 's rainer sollich . the whole trial was a cynical game of blackmail with foreign hostages - and a still uncertain outcome .
the gadhafi regime tellingly did n't even consider it necessary to come up with comprehensible charges .
it would have been hard to imagine - even in many other dictatorships - that such a bizarre accusation turns into a verdict that 's upheld by several courts : the death penalty for foreign medical personnel accused of - deliberately - infecting more than 400 libyan children with the virus that causes aids .
it does n't get much more grotesque than this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least it 's clear now that the death penalty will not be executed .
one can only hop that that the nurses will soon be transferred to bulgaria .
but even that 's probably also a question of money .
it 's already clear the families of the hiv-infected children will receive compensation that also partially comes from europe .
it 's safe to presume this despite the denials .
one could say that all those involved will benefit in the end .
but that 's still not certain , and even if that 's indeed the case , it still gets more complicated .
the families of the libyan victims should get any help that 's possible , but one should n't overlook the fact that the fate of the nurses is still unknown and that they spent eight years - presumably innocent - in prison .
reports by international experts documented their innocence in a credible way .
according to them , a lack of hygiene in the hospital was responsible for the infections .
it 's obvious why these reports were ignored .
no libyan judge could reach a verdict that would blame the state health care system - and indirectly the ruling class below dictator moammar gadhafi - for the hiv infections of more than 400 children .
that 's why they searched for a way to save face - and simply blamed foreign nurses and physicians .
gadhafi knows exactly who much the europeans need him and his country .
libya is not only gradually opening up to western markets and possesses large oil reserves , the country is also needed by the europeans as a bastion against illegal immigration .
the west is also relieved that libya has renounced terrorism .
that 's why gadhafi thinks he can afford to take foreign medical personnel hostage for his interests .
once the foreigners are released , nothing will stand in the way of good relations with the west .
other regimes could learn a lesson from this : how to blackmail western states .

but the entire incident might lead to others blackmailing the west , says dw 's rainer sollich . the whole trial was a cynical game of blackmail with foreign hostages - and a still uncertain outcome .
the gadhafi regime tellingly did n't even consider it necessary to come up with comprehensible charges .
it would have been hard to imagine - even in many other dictatorships - that such a bizarre accusation turns into a verdict that 's upheld by several courts : the death penalty for foreign medical personnel accused of - deliberately - infecting more than 400 libyan children with the virus that causes aids .
it does n't get much more grotesque than this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least it 's clear now that the death penalty will not be executed .
one can only hop that that the nurses will soon be transferred to bulgaria .
but even that 's probably also a question of money .
it 's already clear the families of the hiv-infected children will receive compensation that also partially comes from europe .
it 's safe to presume this despite the denials .
one could say that all those involved will benefit in the end .
but that 's still not certain , and even if that 's indeed the case , it still gets more complicated .
the families of the libyan victims should get any help that 's possible , but one should n't overlook the fact that the fate of the nurses is still unknown and that they spent eight years - presumably innocent - in prison .
reports by international experts documented their innocence in a credible way .
according to them , a lack of hygiene in the hospital was responsible for the infections .
it 's obvious why these reports were ignored .
no libyan judge could reach a verdict that would blame the state health care system - and indirectly the ruling class below dictator moammar gadhafi - for the hiv infections of more than 400 children .
that 's why they searched for a way to save face - and simply blamed foreign nurses and physicians .
gadhafi knows exactly who much the europeans need him and his country .
libya is not only gradually opening up to western markets and possesses large oil reserves , the country is also needed by the europeans as a bastion against illegal immigration .
the west is also relieved that libya has renounced terrorism .
that 's why gadhafi thinks he can afford to take foreign medical personnel hostage for his interests .
once the foreigners are released , nothing will stand in the way of good relations with the west .
other regimes could learn a lesson from this : how to blackmail western states .

the tour is under constant doping suspicion . "

" viewers had to turn elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrik sinkewitz instead of broadcasting the day 's 10th stage , ard ran a feature on doping and interviewed all parties involved .
that program was followed by a telenovela . the two networks also terminated their internet live-ticker of the event . germans who wanted to follow the race had to resort to the eurosport network and its german-language broadcast after the decision . doping has never before prompted german networks to pull the plug on a planned broadcast . but zdf did not broadcast the 1985 european cup final after rioting liverpool fans caused the death of 37 mainly juventus fans ahead of the match between the two sides in brussels ' heysel stadium . ard and zdf , who are funded by fees from every german who owns a tv set , have long held the german tour de france broadcast rights .

government leaders meanwhile mulled the future of atomic energy . vattenfall europe ceo klaus rauscher offered his resignation on wednesday after the brunsbüttel nuclear power plant had to be shut off for the third time in three weeks because of problems .
" rauscher explained that it can not be denied that the events of the past few weeks have tarnished the image of vattenfall europe , " read a statement released by vattenfall 's supervisory board chief , lars g. josefsson .
" errors have been made for which he , as head of vattenfall europe , must bear responsibility . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krümmel nuclear plant is still not back in operation a fire in the company 's nearby krümmel nuclear power plant in june had started a series of problems that led to the firing of vattenfall europe 's nuclear energy chief , bruno thomauske , on monday .
gradual disclosures since june 28 , when electrical defects shut down the company 's reactors at krümmel and brunsbüttel near hamburg , have revealed that staff at krümmel were in crisis as a fire raged in a transformer .
neither reactor was damaged and no radioactivity was released , but vattenfall - and the whole nuclear industry in germany - suffered a public relations disaster .
the company said it was commissioning an independent inquiry by scientists and business experts with a budget of 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6.8 million -rrb- to examine exactly what went wrong .
ministers divided on what to do bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , angela merkel and michael glos -lrb- from left -rrb- german economy minister michael glos meanwhile sprang to the defense of the country 's nuclear power stations on wednesday , saying that despite the recent problems , even the oldest plants were ahead of the rest of the world in terms of security .
" what 's definite is that the reactors in operation are as safe as is humanly possible , " glos told german public television zdf .
" on this point , we in germany are ahead " , the minister said .
glos also added that said that the safety of the power stations had nothing to do with their age .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel on the other hand had called for the oldest plants , which began operating in the early 1970s , to be shut down .
in return , the remaining operation time on these plants could be transferred to younger plants , but energy providers are not keen on doing so as the old ones operate much more profitably .
merkel has no pity chancellor angela merkel , who has in the past supported a rethink of germany 's planned nuclear energy phase-out , said wednesday that she could understand the public 's concerns and its criticism of the nuclear industry .
" my pity for the industry is limited , " she said , adding that she found vattenfall 's information policy " totally unacceptable .
" after all , dramatic errors were committed , " merkel said .
but the chancellor also said that the entire industry should not be stigmatized .

german and other european leaders have welcomed us president george w. bush 's new middle east initiative calling for an international conference to explore ways of creating a palestinian state . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said germany supported the goal of laying the foundation for " a successful palestinian state " with which peace talks could be conducted .
a two-state solution in the middle east needs a viable palestinian state with an effective government , solid finances , a functioning economy and a society based on law and justice , he said .
ulrich said former british prime minister tony blair had an important role to play as the representative of the mideast quartet , which is made up of the united nations , the european union , the united states and russia .
the quartet is expected to meet in lisbon , portugal , on thursday .
blair was picked last month by the quartet to help the palestinians build up their institutions and promote international political and economic support .

bush announced $ 190 million -lrb- 137.8 million euros -rrb- in direct aid to the palestinian government led by prime minister-designate salam fayyad and $ 80 million for security .
he has sought to bolster abbas ' moderate fatah government since the beleaguered palestinian leader ousted hamas from the government after the radical group seized control of gaza .

eu , britain back plan others in europe have also said they welcomed bush 's plan .
" the -lsb- bush -rsb- speech has elements that were never said before , " said the eu 's foreign and security policy chief javier solana , adding that the 27-nation bloc would work side by side with the us in a determined effort to bring about an end to the arab-israeli conflict .
british foreign secretary david miliband meanwhile said in a statement that " the international community should offer full support to those seeking a negotiated two-state solution to the conflict . "
french officials , on the other hand , reportedly said they would support the initiative only if it addresses the final status of the palestinian territories . article based on wire reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but perhaps his finest hour came on the political stage in 1989 . masur was born on july 18 , 1927 in what is now the city of brzeg in poland .
the son of an engineer , he taught himself piano as a young child and quickly specialized in conducting - despite suffering from a nervous stutter . in 1970 , masur became kapellmeister at leipzig 's gewandhaus orchestra - the musical ensemble with which he remains most closely associated .
he stayed in the post for 27 years , putting the orchestra back on the international map and presiding over the building of a new concert hall to replace the former one that had been badly damaged by allied bombing during world war ii . in leipzig , masur established an international reputation as a sensitive and innovative interpreter of the classical and romantic repertoire - and specifically mendelssohn , brahms and tchaikovsky . a master of the requiem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of leipzigers protested every monday in 1989 his best-known recording came in 1982 with an interpretation of richard strauss 's " four last songs . "
masur drastically slowed the tempi to create expressive space for soprano jessye norman 's booming , gospel-tinged voice , turning what is often a quiet meditation on impending mortality into a hike through a particularly lush cemetery . decried by some as sluggish bombast , the recording is still in print after 25 years and regularly shows up on classical-music critics ' " best-of " lists . masur has also wielded the baton for new york and london philharmonic orchestras .
despite plans to scale back his activities , he continues to be one of the world 's most sought after and active conductors . calls for non-violence bildunterschrift : masur publicly came out in support of the demonstrators masur declined offers to leave east germany through much of his career and enjoyed cordial relations with former gdr leader erich honecker .

german and other european leaders have welcomed us president george w. bush 's new middle east initiative calling for an international conference to explore ways of creating a palestinian state . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said germany supported the goal of laying the foundation for " a successful palestinian state " with which peace talks could be conducted .
a two-state solution in the middle east needs a viable palestinian state with an effective government , solid finances , a functioning economy and a society based on law and justice , he said .
ulrich said former british prime minister tony blair had an important role to play as the representative of the mideast quartet , which is made up of the united nations , the european union , the united states and russia .
the quartet is expected to meet in lisbon , portugal , on thursday .
blair was picked last month by the quartet to help the palestinians build up their institutions and promote international political and economic support .
bolstering fatah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many palestinians also listened to what bush had to say in his initiative announced monday , bush said us secretary of state condoleezza rice would chair a conference in the autumn that would consist primarily of the israelis and palestinians as well as middle east countries committed to a two-state solution to the conflict .
bush announced $ 190 million -lrb- 137.8 million euros -rrb- in direct aid to the palestinian government led by prime minister-designate salam fayyad and $ 80 million for security .
he has sought to bolster abbas ' moderate fatah government since the beleaguered palestinian leader ousted hamas from the government after the radical group seized control of gaza .
merkel phones fayyad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister salam fayyad the german spokesman said chancellor angela merkel spoke by telephone on tuesday afternoon with fayyad and offered her support for steps taken by his government to move forward with the peace process .
fayyad briefed the chancellor on his efforts to establish an effective system of authority in the palestinian areas , particularly in the security sector , wilhelm said .
eu , britain back plan others in europe have also said they welcomed bush 's plan .
" the -lsb- bush -rsb- speech has elements that were never said before , " said the eu 's foreign and security policy chief javier solana , adding that the 27-nation bloc would work side by side with the us in a determined effort to bring about an end to the arab-israeli conflict .
british foreign secretary david miliband meanwhile said in a statement that " the international community should offer full support to those seeking a negotiated two-state solution to the conflict . "
french officials , on the other hand , reportedly said they would support the initiative only if it addresses the final status of the palestinian territories . article based on wire reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but perhaps his finest hour came on the political stage in 1989 . masur was born on july 18 , 1927 in what is now the city of brzeg in poland .
the son of an engineer , he taught himself piano as a young child and quickly specialized in conducting - despite suffering from a nervous stutter . in 1970 , masur became kapellmeister at leipzig 's gewandhaus orchestra - the musical ensemble with which he remains most closely associated .
he stayed in the post for 27 years , putting the orchestra back on the international map and presiding over the building of a new concert hall to replace the former one that had been badly damaged by allied bombing during world war ii . in leipzig , masur established an international reputation as a sensitive and innovative interpreter of the classical and romantic repertoire - and specifically mendelssohn , brahms and tchaikovsky . a master of the requiem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of leipzigers protested every monday in 1989 his best-known recording came in 1982 with an interpretation of richard strauss 's " four last songs . "
masur drastically slowed the tempi to create expressive space for soprano jessye norman 's booming , gospel-tinged voice , turning what is often a quiet meditation on impending mortality into a hike through a particularly lush cemetery . decried by some as sluggish bombast , the recording is still in print after 25 years and regularly shows up on classical-music critics ' " best-of " lists . masur has also wielded the baton for new york and london philharmonic orchestras .
despite plans to scale back his activities , he continues to be one of the world 's most sought after and active conductors . calls for non-violence bildunterschrift : masur publicly came out in support of the demonstrators masur declined offers to leave east germany through much of his career and enjoyed cordial relations with former gdr leader erich honecker .
but he never joined the communist party . in 1989 , amidst growing anti-government protests in leipzig , masur criticized violence by riot police against the demonstrators .
on oct .
9 of that year , he read a public appeal for freedom of discussion in the socialist state - an act widely regarded as helping convince leipzig police to disregard orders from berlin and allow the weekly " monday protests " to continue .

" all kinds of nazi incendiary writings have been published in a scientific format , except for ' mein kampf , " ' said möller , a history professor at munich university .
" in my opinion , it 's not justifiable to prohibit this for a single document out of fear that it might have a negative , symbolic effect . "
copyright issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's book was on display at a book fair in tehran in 2006 bavaria 's finance ministry , which holds the copyright to " mein kampf , " has so far refused to permit publication of the book .
while it has been published abroad after 1945 , it is only available for scientific research within germany .
in the interview , möller said that he had recently discussed the issue with bavarian finance minister kurt falthauser , who had declined to give permission .
möller also said that officials at germany 's foreign ministry , where möller 's publicly funded institute also has an office , had advised against publication , saying that it could have a negative effect for germany abroad .
but the copyright is running out in 2015 and möller said he expected many to try and make a quick buck with a sensationalist publication of the book .
his institute , on the other hand , has the resources and expertise to produce an edition that wo n't be easily abused by neo-nazis for propaganda purposes , möller said .
a need for disillusionment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : möller says that " mein kampf " should be published in an annotated edition just like other nazi writings " the book is badly written , it 's put together from all kinds of different sources and consists of many incendiary tirades , " möller said , adding that the book still deserved scientific attention as a key document of the national-socialist regime .
" as long as a carefully annotated edition of ' mein kampf ' does n't exist , the simple-minded speculations about the book 's contents wo n't end . "
mein kampf sets out hitler 's claim that " aryans " were the founders of human culture and jews its spoilers as well as his denunciation of " inferior races " and call to seize lebensraum or territory in eastern europe . prohibiting publication beyond 2015 bavarian finance ministry officials meanwhile said that publication of a sensationalist edition of " mein kampf " would still be illegal after the copyright expires as german law prohibits the distribution of national-socialist propaganda . they also said that the bavarian government feels a responsibility towards protecting holocaust victims against a new publication of the book - including an annotated version as suggested by möller . " considering that bavaria 's strict stance ... is welcomed and supported both domestically and abroad , permission to reprint ' mein kampf ' still can not be considered , " reads a statement from the ministry . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for 10 years , his testimonies , in exchange for his freedom , have helped police crack down on organized crime . if the three italians on trial in düsseldorf for cocaine-trafficking are found guilty , it won ’ t be the first time that evidence supplied by mobster-turned-police informant basile puts suspected mafiosi behind bars .
before he was even 40 , the man they called " angel face " had murdered up to 30 people . after being arrested in the allgäu region of southern germany in 1998 , he was allowed to go free .
in return for his new life in a witness protection program , he has helped police lock up over 50 criminals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mafia hotbed corleone in sicily now 47 , basile , who will testify wednesday via video from a secret location in italy , was once one of the most redoubtable top dogs within the carelli clan , which belongs to calabria 's notorious ' ndrangheta .
among the most powerful and ruthless mafia-like organizations in italy , ' ndrangheta cells are loosely based on blood relationships .
the organization is believed to rake in some $ 30 billion -lrb- 22 billion euros -rrb- annually , mostly from illegal narcotics , but also from ostensibly legal businesses such as construction , restaurants and supermarkets .
allegedly , it is also involved in counterfeiting , gambling , fraud , theft , labor racketeering , loan sharking , people smuggling and kidnapping .
the ' ndrangheta ‘ s family ties are believed to be closer and their vows of silence more strictly observed than other mafia clans , such as cosa nostra and camorra .
so when giorgio basile decided to break them , it marked a watershed in germany 's fight against the mafia .
becoming numero uno bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlon brando as don corleone in " the godfather " with all the ingredients of a classic " godfather " film , it comes as no surprise that basile 's story has attracted the attention of a munich film company which has worked in the past with german star movie director oliver hirschbiegel -lrb- the downfall -rrb- .
born in corigliano calabro in 1960 , giorgio moved one year later to mühlheim an der ruhr in germany , where his father made a living as a " guest worker . "
in 1966 , his parents separated when his father realized his mother was having an affair .
her lover was antonio de cicco , local boss of the ' ndrangheta in corigliano and every bit the latin stereotype in his sharp suits with slicked-back hair and gold chains .
giorgio spent two years in italy with his new family , but returned to germany when his mother got pregnant .
he lost touch with his adopted father until 1979 , when at the age of 19 , giorgio was persuaded by de cicco to leave the dull , industrial trappings of western germany and work as his driver back in corigliano .
as a fledgling ' ndrinu , he enjoyed the attention his association with de cicco afforded him and soon became versed in the ways of the clan .
but when he discovered his adopted father had been abusing his sister , he resolved to avenge her .
in 1973 , he made his first killing , when he murdered de cicco .
by now , he was one of the most powerful cocaine dealers in tuscany , and a recognized uomo d ' onore -lrb- man of honor -rrb- .
it was during these years that he met his wife , who bore him a daughter .
he extended the business further afield , and in the 1980s , played a key role in building up mafia influence in germany .
betrayed by the organization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mafia boss giuseppe bellocco was arrested in calabria on tuesday arrested in 1998 , he opted to break the omertà , the mafia ‘ s " code of silence " .
within mafia culture , this made him a " stool pigeon " - a violation punishable by death .
according to andreas ulrich , author of " angel face , " a biography of giorgio basile , he agreed to name names because " he felt betrayed by the organization . "
" it never comes good on its promises , " he said .
" it lures young men with promises of power , money and women .
it uses them , then kills them as though they were ants . "
basile has said he lives with the knowledge that the mafia will hunt him down and kill him .
" the mafia bosses are behind bars because of what i did , " he told ulrich .
" they can ‘ t do anything to me any more , but their sons will avenge them . "
eighteen months ago , he told the online version of german news magazine der spiegel that the mafia 's influence was stronger than ever .
" the mafia will continue to expand , " he said .
" the enlarged europe will allow it to spread even further .
for someone with the same criminal energy as i had , it 's even easier in germany than it is in italy .
you can get away with anything . "
basile said the german authorities had failed to recognize the extent of the criminal energy that exists within the underground italian community .
" i couldn ’ t put a figure to it , but germany is home to many sleepers .
go in to any pizzeria and you might find the cook is a hitman just waiting for a call , " he said .
the mob in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giorgio basile the extent of mob influence is definitely underestimated in germany , said mafia expert jürgen roth .
" when berlusconi was in power there was very little information coming out of italy , " he explained .
" the mafia took the opportunity to get a foothold in germany . there is now barely any knowledge of the mafia 's criminal structures here .
it is active mainly in the area of money laundering , drug and weapons trading , protection racketeering and prostitution . "
while the biggest ' ndrangheta presence is in eastern german states such as thuringia and saxony , roth says cosa nostra actually has a higher profile in baden-württemberg .
earlier this month , italy ’ s leading mafia hunter , piero grasso , warned germany in the neue osnabrücker zeitung daily that the mob was even beginning to penetrate legitimate business circles in germany .
" the size and profit potential of german markets , as well as german law , makes the country highly attractive to organized criminals , " he said .
" their goal is to infiltrate legal financial circles in order to invest illegally gained funds with a long-term aim of dominating price wars and creating monopolies . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but perhaps his finest hour came on the political stage in 1989 . masur was born on july 18 , 1927 in what is now the city of brzeg in poland .
the son of an engineer , he taught himself piano as a young child and quickly specialized in conducting - despite suffering from a nervous stutter . in 1970 , masur became kapellmeister at leipzig 's gewandhaus orchestra - the musical ensemble with which he remains most closely associated .
he stayed in the post for 27 years , putting the orchestra back on the international map and presiding over the building of a new concert hall to replace the former one that had been badly damaged by allied bombing during world war ii . in leipzig , masur established an international reputation as a sensitive and innovative interpreter of the classical and romantic repertoire - and specifically mendelssohn , brahms and tchaikovsky . a master of the requiem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of leipzigers protested every monday in 1989 his best-known recording came in 1982 with an interpretation of richard strauss 's " four last songs . "
masur drastically slowed the tempi to create expressive space for soprano jessye norman 's booming , gospel-tinged voice , turning what is often a quiet meditation on impending mortality into a hike through a particularly lush cemetery . decried by some as sluggish bombast , the recording is still in print after 25 years and regularly shows up on classical-music critics ' " best-of " lists . masur has also wielded the baton for new york and london philharmonic orchestras .
despite plans to scale back his activities , he continues to be one of the world 's most sought after and active conductors . calls for non-violence bildunterschrift : masur publicly came out in support of the demonstrators masur declined offers to leave east germany through much of his career and enjoyed cordial relations with former gdr leader erich honecker .
but he never joined the communist party . in 1989 , amidst growing anti-government protests in leipzig , masur criticized violence by riot police against the demonstrators .
on oct .
9 of that year , he read a public appeal for freedom of discussion in the socialist state - an act widely regarded as helping convince leipzig police to disregard orders from berlin and allow the weekly " monday protests " to continue . " in the same century that saw two world wars , i was witness to a peaceful revolution , " masur told the dpa news agency .
" no television cameras captured the entire drama of what happened on that night in leipzig . " a musical and political icon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masur says , for him , music is a passion , not a career in 1990 , after the fall of the berlin wall and the reunification of germany , masur was sometimes mentioned as a possible candidate for the german presidency , but he demurred , saying he was a musician , not a politician .
in interviews since then , masur has played down his role in the " peaceful revolution " of 1989 . " i was only one among many people who overcame their fear , " he said . masur has received numerous honors from leipzig and germany for his musical achievements and personal courage . the night of july 18 has been set aside for a concert as part of the london proms with masur conducting the london philharmonic and the orchestre national de france in performances of bruckner and tchaikovsky - a fitting way for a musician who 's always close to the people to spend his eightieth birthday . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 18.07.2007 notorious mobster to testify at german trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian-german mobster giorgio basile killed 30 people before he was arrested a german court will hear evidence wednesday from infamous italian-german mafioso giorgio basile .
for 10 years , his testimonies , in exchange for his freedom , have helped police crack down on organized crime . if the three italians on trial in düsseldorf for cocaine-trafficking are found guilty , it won ’ t be the first time that evidence supplied by mobster-turned-police informant basile puts suspected mafiosi behind bars .
before he was even 40 , the man they called " angel face " had murdered up to 30 people . after being arrested in the allgäu region of southern germany in 1998 , he was allowed to go free .
in return for his new life in a witness protection program , he has helped police lock up over 50 criminals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mafia hotbed corleone in sicily now 47 , basile , who will testify wednesday via video from a secret location in italy , was once one of the most redoubtable top dogs within the carelli clan , which belongs to calabria 's notorious ' ndrangheta .
among the most powerful and ruthless mafia-like organizations in italy , ' ndrangheta cells are loosely based on blood relationships .
the organization is believed to rake in some $ 30 billion -lrb- 22 billion euros -rrb- annually , mostly from illegal narcotics , but also from ostensibly legal businesses such as construction , restaurants and supermarkets .
allegedly , it is also involved in counterfeiting , gambling , fraud , theft , labor racketeering , loan sharking , people smuggling and kidnapping .
the ' ndrangheta ‘ s family ties are believed to be closer and their vows of silence more strictly observed than other mafia clans , such as cosa nostra and camorra .
so when giorgio basile decided to break them , it marked a watershed in germany 's fight against the mafia .
becoming numero uno bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlon brando as don corleone in " the godfather " with all the ingredients of a classic " godfather " film , it comes as no surprise that basile 's story has attracted the attention of a munich film company which has worked in the past with german star movie director oliver hirschbiegel -lrb- the downfall -rrb- .
born in corigliano calabro in 1960 , giorgio moved one year later to mühlheim an der ruhr in germany , where his father made a living as a " guest worker . "
in 1966 , his parents separated when his father realized his mother was having an affair .
her lover was antonio de cicco , local boss of the ' ndrangheta in corigliano and every bit the latin stereotype in his sharp suits with slicked-back hair and gold chains .
giorgio spent two years in italy with his new family , but returned to germany when his mother got pregnant .
he lost touch with his adopted father until 1979 , when at the age of 19 , giorgio was persuaded by de cicco to leave the dull , industrial trappings of western germany and work as his driver back in corigliano .
as a fledgling ' ndrinu , he enjoyed the attention his association with de cicco afforded him and soon became versed in the ways of the clan .
but when he discovered his adopted father had been abusing his sister , he resolved to avenge her .
in 1973 , he made his first killing , when he murdered de cicco .
by now , he was one of the most powerful cocaine dealers in tuscany , and a recognized uomo d ' onore -lrb- man of honor -rrb- .
it was during these years that he met his wife , who bore him a daughter .
he extended the business further afield , and in the 1980s , played a key role in building up mafia influence in germany .
betrayed by the organization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mafia boss giuseppe bellocco was arrested in calabria on tuesday arrested in 1998 , he opted to break the omertà , the mafia ‘ s " code of silence " .
within mafia culture , this made him a " stool pigeon " - a violation punishable by death .
according to andreas ulrich , author of " angel face , " a biography of giorgio basile , he agreed to name names because " he felt betrayed by the organization . "
" it never comes good on its promises , " he said .
" it lures young men with promises of power , money and women .
it uses them , then kills them as though they were ants . "
basile has said he lives with the knowledge that the mafia will hunt him down and kill him .
" the mafia bosses are behind bars because of what i did , " he told ulrich .
" they can ‘ t do anything to me any more , but their sons will avenge them . "
eighteen months ago , he told the online version of german news magazine der spiegel that the mafia 's influence was stronger than ever .
" the mafia will continue to expand , " he said .
" the enlarged europe will allow it to spread even further .
for someone with the same criminal energy as i had , it 's even easier in germany than it is in italy .
you can get away with anything . "
basile said the german authorities had failed to recognize the extent of the criminal energy that exists within the underground italian community .
" i couldn ’ t put a figure to it , but germany is home to many sleepers .
go in to any pizzeria and you might find the cook is a hitman just waiting for a call , " he said .
the mob in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giorgio basile the extent of mob influence is definitely underestimated in germany , said mafia expert jürgen roth .
" when berlusconi was in power there was very little information coming out of italy , " he explained .
" the mafia took the opportunity to get a foothold in germany . there is now barely any knowledge of the mafia 's criminal structures here .
it is active mainly in the area of money laundering , drug and weapons trading , protection racketeering and prostitution . "
while the biggest ' ndrangheta presence is in eastern german states such as thuringia and saxony , roth says cosa nostra actually has a higher profile in baden-württemberg .
earlier this month , italy ’ s leading mafia hunter , piero grasso , warned germany in the neue osnabrücker zeitung daily that the mob was even beginning to penetrate legitimate business circles in germany .
" the size and profit potential of german markets , as well as german law , makes the country highly attractive to organized criminals , " he said .
" their goal is to infiltrate legal financial circles in order to invest illegally gained funds with a long-term aim of dominating price wars and creating monopolies . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" they can ‘ t do anything to me any more , but their sons will avenge them . "
eighteen months ago , he told the online version of german news magazine der spiegel that the mafia 's influence was stronger than ever .
" the mafia will continue to expand , " he said .
" the enlarged europe will allow it to spread even further .
for someone with the same criminal energy as i had , it 's even easier in germany than it is in italy .

basile said the german authorities had failed to recognize the extent of the criminal energy that exists within the underground italian community .

the mob in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giorgio basile the extent of mob influence is definitely underestimated in germany , said mafia expert jürgen roth .
" when berlusconi was in power there was very little information coming out of italy , " he explained .
" the mafia took the opportunity to get a foothold in germany . there is now barely any knowledge of the mafia 's criminal structures here .
it is active mainly in the area of money laundering , drug and weapons trading , protection racketeering and prostitution . "
while the biggest ' ndrangheta presence is in eastern german states such as thuringia and saxony , roth says cosa nostra actually has a higher profile in baden-württemberg .

for 10 years , his testimonies , in exchange for his freedom , have helped police crack down on organized crime . if the three italians on trial in düsseldorf for cocaine-trafficking are found guilty , it won ’ t be the first time that evidence supplied by mobster-turned-police informant basile puts suspected mafiosi behind bars .
before he was even 40 , the man they called " angel face " had murdered up to 30 people . after being arrested in the allgäu region of southern germany in 1998 , he was allowed to go free .
in return for his new life in a witness protection program , he has helped police lock up over 50 criminals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mafia hotbed corleone in sicily now 47 , basile , who will testify wednesday via video from a secret location in italy , was once one of the most redoubtable top dogs within the carelli clan , which belongs to calabria 's notorious ' ndrangheta .
among the most powerful and ruthless mafia-like organizations in italy , ' ndrangheta cells are loosely based on blood relationships .
the organization is believed to rake in some $ 30 billion -lrb- 22 billion euros -rrb- annually , mostly from illegal narcotics , but also from ostensibly legal businesses such as construction , restaurants and supermarkets .
allegedly , it is also involved in counterfeiting , gambling , fraud , theft , labor racketeering , loan sharking , people smuggling and kidnapping .
the ' ndrangheta ‘ s family ties are believed to be closer and their vows of silence more strictly observed than other mafia clans , such as cosa nostra and camorra .
so when giorgio basile decided to break them , it marked a watershed in germany 's fight against the mafia .
becoming numero uno bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlon brando as don corleone in " the godfather " with all the ingredients of a classic " godfather " film , it comes as no surprise that basile 's story has attracted the attention of a munich film company which has worked in the past with german star movie director oliver hirschbiegel -lrb- the downfall -rrb- .
born in corigliano calabro in 1960 , giorgio moved one year later to mühlheim an der ruhr in germany , where his father made a living as a " guest worker . "
in 1966 , his parents separated when his father realized his mother was having an affair .
her lover was antonio de cicco , local boss of the ' ndrangheta in corigliano and every bit the latin stereotype in his sharp suits with slicked-back hair and gold chains .
giorgio spent two years in italy with his new family , but returned to germany when his mother got pregnant .
he lost touch with his adopted father until 1979 , when at the age of 19 , giorgio was persuaded by de cicco to leave the dull , industrial trappings of western germany and work as his driver back in corigliano .
as a fledgling ' ndrinu , he enjoyed the attention his association with de cicco afforded him and soon became versed in the ways of the clan .
but when he discovered his adopted father had been abusing his sister , he resolved to avenge her .
in 1973 , he made his first killing , when he murdered de cicco .
by now , he was one of the most powerful cocaine dealers in tuscany , and a recognized uomo d ' onore -lrb- man of honor -rrb- .
it was during these years that he met his wife , who bore him a daughter .
he extended the business further afield , and in the 1980s , played a key role in building up mafia influence in germany .
betrayed by the organization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mafia boss giuseppe bellocco was arrested in calabria on tuesday arrested in 1998 , he opted to break the omertà , the mafia ‘ s " code of silence " .
within mafia culture , this made him a " stool pigeon " - a violation punishable by death .
according to andreas ulrich , author of " angel face , " a biography of giorgio basile , he agreed to name names because " he felt betrayed by the organization . "
" it never comes good on its promises , " he said .
" it lures young men with promises of power , money and women .
it uses them , then kills them as though they were ants . "
basile has said he lives with the knowledge that the mafia will hunt him down and kill him .
" the mafia bosses are behind bars because of what i did , " he told ulrich .

" all kinds of nazi incendiary writings have been published in a scientific format , except for ' mein kampf , " ' said möller , a history professor at munich university .
" in my opinion , it 's not justifiable to prohibit this for a single document out of fear that it might have a negative , symbolic effect . "
copyright issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's book was on display at a book fair in tehran in 2006 bavaria 's finance ministry , which holds the copyright to " mein kampf , " has so far refused to permit publication of the book .
while it has been published abroad after 1945 , it is only available for scientific research within germany .
in the interview , möller said that he had recently discussed the issue with bavarian finance minister kurt falthauser , who had declined to give permission .
möller also said that officials at germany 's foreign ministry , where möller 's publicly funded institute also has an office , had advised against publication , saying that it could have a negative effect for germany abroad .
but the copyright is running out in 2015 and möller said he expected many to try and make a quick buck with a sensationalist publication of the book .
his institute , on the other hand , has the resources and expertise to produce an edition that wo n't be easily abused by neo-nazis for propaganda purposes , möller said .
a need for disillusionment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : möller says that " mein kampf " should be published in an annotated edition just like other nazi writings " the book is badly written , it 's put together from all kinds of different sources and consists of many incendiary tirades , " möller said , adding that the book still deserved scientific attention as a key document of the national-socialist regime .
" as long as a carefully annotated edition of ' mein kampf ' does n't exist , the simple-minded speculations about the book 's contents wo n't end . "
mein kampf sets out hitler 's claim that " aryans " were the founders of human culture and jews its spoilers as well as his denunciation of " inferior races " and call to seize lebensraum or territory in eastern europe . prohibiting publication beyond 2015 bavarian finance ministry officials meanwhile said that publication of a sensationalist edition of " mein kampf " would still be illegal after the copyright expires as german law prohibits the distribution of national-socialist propaganda . they also said that the bavarian government feels a responsibility towards protecting holocaust victims against a new publication of the book - including an annotated version as suggested by möller . " considering that bavaria 's strict stance ... is welcomed and supported both domestically and abroad , permission to reprint ' mein kampf ' still can not be considered , " reads a statement from the ministry . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but perhaps his finest hour came on the political stage in 1989 . masur was born on july 18 , 1927 in what is now the city of brzeg in poland .
the son of an engineer , he taught himself piano as a young child and quickly specialized in conducting - despite suffering from a nervous stutter . in 1970 , masur became kapellmeister at leipzig 's gewandhaus orchestra - the musical ensemble with which he remains most closely associated .
he stayed in the post for 27 years , putting the orchestra back on the international map and presiding over the building of a new concert hall to replace the former one that had been badly damaged by allied bombing during world war ii . in leipzig , masur established an international reputation as a sensitive and innovative interpreter of the classical and romantic repertoire - and specifically mendelssohn , brahms and tchaikovsky . a master of the requiem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of leipzigers protested every monday in 1989 his best-known recording came in 1982 with an interpretation of richard strauss 's " four last songs . "
masur drastically slowed the tempi to create expressive space for soprano jessye norman 's booming , gospel-tinged voice , turning what is often a quiet meditation on impending mortality into a hike through a particularly lush cemetery . decried by some as sluggish bombast , the recording is still in print after 25 years and regularly shows up on classical-music critics ' " best-of " lists . masur has also wielded the baton for new york and london philharmonic orchestras .
despite plans to scale back his activities , he continues to be one of the world 's most sought after and active conductors . calls for non-violence bildunterschrift : masur publicly came out in support of the demonstrators masur declined offers to leave east germany through much of his career and enjoyed cordial relations with former gdr leader erich honecker .
but he never joined the communist party . in 1989 , amidst growing anti-government protests in leipzig , masur criticized violence by riot police against the demonstrators .
on oct .
9 of that year , he read a public appeal for freedom of discussion in the socialist state - an act widely regarded as helping convince leipzig police to disregard orders from berlin and allow the weekly " monday protests " to continue . " in the same century that saw two world wars , i was witness to a peaceful revolution , " masur told the dpa news agency .
" no television cameras captured the entire drama of what happened on that night in leipzig . " a musical and political icon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masur says , for him , music is a passion , not a career in 1990 , after the fall of the berlin wall and the reunification of germany , masur was sometimes mentioned as a possible candidate for the german presidency , but he demurred , saying he was a musician , not a politician .
in interviews since then , masur has played down his role in the " peaceful revolution " of 1989 . " i was only one among many people who overcame their fear , " he said . masur has received numerous honors from leipzig and germany for his musical achievements and personal courage . the night of july 18 has been set aside for a concert as part of the london proms with masur conducting the london philharmonic and the orchestre national de france in performances of bruckner and tchaikovsky - a fitting way for a musician who 's always close to the people to spend his eightieth birthday . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german and other european leaders have welcomed us president george w. bush 's new middle east initiative calling for an international conference to explore ways of creating a palestinian state . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said germany supported the goal of laying the foundation for " a successful palestinian state " with which peace talks could be conducted .
a two-state solution in the middle east needs a viable palestinian state with an effective government , solid finances , a functioning economy and a society based on law and justice , he said .
ulrich said former british prime minister tony blair had an important role to play as the representative of the mideast quartet , which is made up of the united nations , the european union , the united states and russia .
the quartet is expected to meet in lisbon , portugal , on thursday .
blair was picked last month by the quartet to help the palestinians build up their institutions and promote international political and economic support .

bush announced $ 190 million -lrb- 137.8 million euros -rrb- in direct aid to the palestinian government led by prime minister-designate salam fayyad and $ 80 million for security .
he has sought to bolster abbas ' moderate fatah government since the beleaguered palestinian leader ousted hamas from the government after the radical group seized control of gaza .
merkel phones fayyad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister salam fayyad the german spokesman said chancellor angela merkel spoke by telephone on tuesday afternoon with fayyad and offered her support for steps taken by his government to move forward with the peace process .
fayyad briefed the chancellor on his efforts to establish an effective system of authority in the palestinian areas , particularly in the security sector , wilhelm said .
eu , britain back plan others in europe have also said they welcomed bush 's plan .
" the -lsb- bush -rsb- speech has elements that were never said before , " said the eu 's foreign and security policy chief javier solana , adding that the 27-nation bloc would work side by side with the us in a determined effort to bring about an end to the arab-israeli conflict .
british foreign secretary david miliband meanwhile said in a statement that " the international community should offer full support to those seeking a negotiated two-state solution to the conflict . "
french officials , on the other hand , reportedly said they would support the initiative only if it addresses the final status of the palestinian territories . article based on wire reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german and other european leaders have welcomed us president george w. bush 's new middle east initiative calling for an international conference to explore ways of creating a palestinian state . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said germany supported the goal of laying the foundation for " a successful palestinian state " with which peace talks could be conducted .
a two-state solution in the middle east needs a viable palestinian state with an effective government , solid finances , a functioning economy and a society based on law and justice , he said .
ulrich said former british prime minister tony blair had an important role to play as the representative of the mideast quartet , which is made up of the united nations , the european union , the united states and russia .
the quartet is expected to meet in lisbon , portugal , on thursday .
blair was picked last month by the quartet to help the palestinians build up their institutions and promote international political and economic support .

bush announced $ 190 million -lrb- 137.8 million euros -rrb- in direct aid to the palestinian government led by prime minister-designate salam fayyad and $ 80 million for security .

" all kinds of nazi incendiary writings have been published in a scientific format , except for ' mein kampf , " ' said möller , a history professor at munich university .
" in my opinion , it 's not justifiable to prohibit this for a single document out of fear that it might have a negative , symbolic effect . "
copyright issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's book was on display at a book fair in tehran in 2006 bavaria 's finance ministry , which holds the copyright to " mein kampf , " has so far refused to permit publication of the book .
while it has been published abroad after 1945 , it is only available for scientific research within germany .
in the interview , möller said that he had recently discussed the issue with bavarian finance minister kurt falthauser , who had declined to give permission .
möller also said that officials at germany 's foreign ministry , where möller 's publicly funded institute also has an office , had advised against publication , saying that it could have a negative effect for germany abroad .
but the copyright is running out in 2015 and möller said he expected many to try and make a quick buck with a sensationalist publication of the book .

a need for disillusionment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : möller says that " mein kampf " should be published in an annotated edition just like other nazi writings " the book is badly written , it 's put together from all kinds of different sources and consists of many incendiary tirades , " möller said , adding that the book still deserved scientific attention as a key document of the national-socialist regime .
" as long as a carefully annotated edition of ' mein kampf ' does n't exist , the simple-minded speculations about the book 's contents wo n't end . "
mein kampf sets out hitler 's claim that " aryans " were the founders of human culture and jews its spoilers as well as his denunciation of " inferior races " and call to seize lebensraum or territory in eastern europe . prohibiting publication beyond 2015 bavarian finance ministry officials meanwhile said that publication of a sensationalist edition of " mein kampf " would still be illegal after the copyright expires as german law prohibits the distribution of national-socialist propaganda . they also said that the bavarian government feels a responsibility towards protecting holocaust victims against a new publication of the book - including an annotated version as suggested by möller .

german and other european leaders have welcomed us president george w. bush 's new middle east initiative calling for an international conference to explore ways of creating a palestinian state . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said germany supported the goal of laying the foundation for " a successful palestinian state " with which peace talks could be conducted .
a two-state solution in the middle east needs a viable palestinian state with an effective government , solid finances , a functioning economy and a society based on law and justice , he said .
ulrich said former british prime minister tony blair had an important role to play as the representative of the mideast quartet , which is made up of the united nations , the european union , the united states and russia .
the quartet is expected to meet in lisbon , portugal , on thursday .
blair was picked last month by the quartet to help the palestinians build up their institutions and promote international political and economic support .
bolstering fatah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many palestinians also listened to what bush had to say in his initiative announced monday , bush said us secretary of state condoleezza rice would chair a conference in the autumn that would consist primarily of the israelis and palestinians as well as middle east countries committed to a two-state solution to the conflict .
bush announced $ 190 million -lrb- 137.8 million euros -rrb- in direct aid to the palestinian government led by prime minister-designate salam fayyad and $ 80 million for security .
he has sought to bolster abbas ' moderate fatah government since the beleaguered palestinian leader ousted hamas from the government after the radical group seized control of gaza .
merkel phones fayyad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister salam fayyad the german spokesman said chancellor angela merkel spoke by telephone on tuesday afternoon with fayyad and offered her support for steps taken by his government to move forward with the peace process .
fayyad briefed the chancellor on his efforts to establish an effective system of authority in the palestinian areas , particularly in the security sector , wilhelm said .
eu , britain back plan others in europe have also said they welcomed bush 's plan .
" the -lsb- bush -rsb- speech has elements that were never said before , " said the eu 's foreign and security policy chief javier solana , adding that the 27-nation bloc would work side by side with the us in a determined effort to bring about an end to the arab-israeli conflict .
british foreign secretary david miliband meanwhile said in a statement that " the international community should offer full support to those seeking a negotiated two-state solution to the conflict . "
french officials , on the other hand , reportedly said they would support the initiative only if it addresses the final status of the palestinian territories . article based on wire reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" all kinds of nazi incendiary writings have been published in a scientific format , except for ' mein kampf , " ' said möller , a history professor at munich university .
" in my opinion , it 's not justifiable to prohibit this for a single document out of fear that it might have a negative , symbolic effect . "

while it has been published abroad after 1945 , it is only available for scientific research within germany .
in the interview , möller said that he had recently discussed the issue with bavarian finance minister kurt falthauser , who had declined to give permission .
möller also said that officials at germany 's foreign ministry , where möller 's publicly funded institute also has an office , had advised against publication , saying that it could have a negative effect for germany abroad .
but the copyright is running out in 2015 and möller said he expected many to try and make a quick buck with a sensationalist publication of the book .

a need for disillusionment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : möller says that " mein kampf " should be published in an annotated edition just like other nazi writings " the book is badly written , it 's put together from all kinds of different sources and consists of many incendiary tirades , " möller said , adding that the book still deserved scientific attention as a key document of the national-socialist regime .
" as long as a carefully annotated edition of ' mein kampf ' does n't exist , the simple-minded speculations about the book 's contents wo n't end . "
mein kampf sets out hitler 's claim that " aryans " were the founders of human culture and jews its spoilers as well as his denunciation of " inferior races " and call to seize lebensraum or territory in eastern europe . prohibiting publication beyond 2015 bavarian finance ministry officials meanwhile said that publication of a sensationalist edition of " mein kampf " would still be illegal after the copyright expires as german law prohibits the distribution of national-socialist propaganda . they also said that the bavarian government feels a responsibility towards protecting holocaust victims against a new publication of the book - including an annotated version as suggested by möller .

but perhaps his finest hour came on the political stage in 1989 . masur was born on july 18 , 1927 in what is now the city of brzeg in poland .
the son of an engineer , he taught himself piano as a young child and quickly specialized in conducting - despite suffering from a nervous stutter . in 1970 , masur became kapellmeister at leipzig 's gewandhaus orchestra - the musical ensemble with which he remains most closely associated .
he stayed in the post for 27 years , putting the orchestra back on the international map and presiding over the building of a new concert hall to replace the former one that had been badly damaged by allied bombing during world war ii . in leipzig , masur established an international reputation as a sensitive and innovative interpreter of the classical and romantic repertoire - and specifically mendelssohn , brahms and tchaikovsky . a master of the requiem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of leipzigers protested every monday in 1989 his best-known recording came in 1982 with an interpretation of richard strauss 's " four last songs . "
masur drastically slowed the tempi to create expressive space for soprano jessye norman 's booming , gospel-tinged voice , turning what is often a quiet meditation on impending mortality into a hike through a particularly lush cemetery . decried by some as sluggish bombast , the recording is still in print after 25 years and regularly shows up on classical-music critics ' " best-of " lists . masur has also wielded the baton for new york and london philharmonic orchestras .
despite plans to scale back his activities , he continues to be one of the world 's most sought after and active conductors . calls for non-violence bildunterschrift : masur publicly came out in support of the demonstrators masur declined offers to leave east germany through much of his career and enjoyed cordial relations with former gdr leader erich honecker .
but he never joined the communist party . in 1989 , amidst growing anti-government protests in leipzig , masur criticized violence by riot police against the demonstrators .
on oct .
9 of that year , he read a public appeal for freedom of discussion in the socialist state - an act widely regarded as helping convince leipzig police to disregard orders from berlin and allow the weekly " monday protests " to continue . " in the same century that saw two world wars , i was witness to a peaceful revolution , " masur told the dpa news agency .
" no television cameras captured the entire drama of what happened on that night in leipzig . " a musical and political icon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masur says , for him , music is a passion , not a career in 1990 , after the fall of the berlin wall and the reunification of germany , masur was sometimes mentioned as a possible candidate for the german presidency , but he demurred , saying he was a musician , not a politician .
in interviews since then , masur has played down his role in the " peaceful revolution " of 1989 . " i was only one among many people who overcame their fear , " he said . masur has received numerous honors from leipzig and germany for his musical achievements and personal courage . the night of july 18 has been set aside for a concert as part of the london proms with masur conducting the london philharmonic and the orchestre national de france in performances of bruckner and tchaikovsky - a fitting way for a musician who 's always close to the people to spend his eightieth birthday . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" all kinds of nazi incendiary writings have been published in a scientific format , except for ' mein kampf , " ' said möller , a history professor at munich university .
" in my opinion , it 's not justifiable to prohibit this for a single document out of fear that it might have a negative , symbolic effect . "
copyright issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's book was on display at a book fair in tehran in 2006 bavaria 's finance ministry , which holds the copyright to " mein kampf , " has so far refused to permit publication of the book .
while it has been published abroad after 1945 , it is only available for scientific research within germany .
in the interview , möller said that he had recently discussed the issue with bavarian finance minister kurt falthauser , who had declined to give permission .
möller also said that officials at germany 's foreign ministry , where möller 's publicly funded institute also has an office , had advised against publication , saying that it could have a negative effect for germany abroad .
but the copyright is running out in 2015 and möller said he expected many to try and make a quick buck with a sensationalist publication of the book .

" as long as a carefully annotated edition of ' mein kampf ' does n't exist , the simple-minded speculations about the book 's contents wo n't end . "
mein kampf sets out hitler 's claim that " aryans " were the founders of human culture and jews its spoilers as well as his denunciation of " inferior races " and call to seize lebensraum or territory in eastern europe . prohibiting publication beyond 2015 bavarian finance ministry officials meanwhile said that publication of a sensationalist edition of " mein kampf " would still be illegal after the copyright expires as german law prohibits the distribution of national-socialist propaganda . they also said that the bavarian government feels a responsibility towards protecting holocaust victims against a new publication of the book - including an annotated version as suggested by möller .

but perhaps his finest hour came on the political stage in 1989 . masur was born on july 18 , 1927 in what is now the city of brzeg in poland .
the son of an engineer , he taught himself piano as a young child and quickly specialized in conducting - despite suffering from a nervous stutter . in 1970 , masur became kapellmeister at leipzig 's gewandhaus orchestra - the musical ensemble with which he remains most closely associated .
he stayed in the post for 27 years , putting the orchestra back on the international map and presiding over the building of a new concert hall to replace the former one that had been badly damaged by allied bombing during world war ii . in leipzig , masur established an international reputation as a sensitive and innovative interpreter of the classical and romantic repertoire - and specifically mendelssohn , brahms and tchaikovsky . a master of the requiem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of leipzigers protested every monday in 1989 his best-known recording came in 1982 with an interpretation of richard strauss 's " four last songs . "
masur drastically slowed the tempi to create expressive space for soprano jessye norman 's booming , gospel-tinged voice , turning what is often a quiet meditation on impending mortality into a hike through a particularly lush cemetery . decried by some as sluggish bombast , the recording is still in print after 25 years and regularly shows up on classical-music critics ' " best-of " lists . masur has also wielded the baton for new york and london philharmonic orchestras .
despite plans to scale back his activities , he continues to be one of the world 's most sought after and active conductors . calls for non-violence bildunterschrift : masur publicly came out in support of the demonstrators masur declined offers to leave east germany through much of his career and enjoyed cordial relations with former gdr leader erich honecker .
but he never joined the communist party . in 1989 , amidst growing anti-government protests in leipzig , masur criticized violence by riot police against the demonstrators .

in interviews since then , masur has played down his role in the " peaceful revolution " of 1989 . " i was only one among many people who overcame their fear , " he said . masur has received numerous honors from leipzig and germany for his musical achievements and personal courage . the night of july 18 has been set aside for a concert as part of the london proms with masur conducting the london philharmonic and the orchestre national de france in performances of bruckner and tchaikovsky - a fitting way for a musician who 's always close to the people to spend his eightieth birthday . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but perhaps his finest hour came on the political stage in 1989 . masur was born on july 18 , 1927 in what is now the city of brzeg in poland .
the son of an engineer , he taught himself piano as a young child and quickly specialized in conducting - despite suffering from a nervous stutter . in 1970 , masur became kapellmeister at leipzig 's gewandhaus orchestra - the musical ensemble with which he remains most closely associated .
he stayed in the post for 27 years , putting the orchestra back on the international map and presiding over the building of a new concert hall to replace the former one that had been badly damaged by allied bombing during world war ii . in leipzig , masur established an international reputation as a sensitive and innovative interpreter of the classical and romantic repertoire - and specifically mendelssohn , brahms and tchaikovsky . a master of the requiem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of leipzigers protested every monday in 1989 his best-known recording came in 1982 with an interpretation of richard strauss 's " four last songs . "
masur drastically slowed the tempi to create expressive space for soprano jessye norman 's booming , gospel-tinged voice , turning what is often a quiet meditation on impending mortality into a hike through a particularly lush cemetery . decried by some as sluggish bombast , the recording is still in print after 25 years and regularly shows up on classical-music critics ' " best-of " lists . masur has also wielded the baton for new york and london philharmonic orchestras .
despite plans to scale back his activities , he continues to be one of the world 's most sought after and active conductors . calls for non-violence bildunterschrift : masur publicly came out in support of the demonstrators masur declined offers to leave east germany through much of his career and enjoyed cordial relations with former gdr leader erich honecker .
but he never joined the communist party . in 1989 , amidst growing anti-government protests in leipzig , masur criticized violence by riot police against the demonstrators .
on oct .
9 of that year , he read a public appeal for freedom of discussion in the socialist state - an act widely regarded as helping convince leipzig police to disregard orders from berlin and allow the weekly " monday protests " to continue . " in the same century that saw two world wars , i was witness to a peaceful revolution , " masur told the dpa news agency .

in interviews since then , masur has played down his role in the " peaceful revolution " of 1989 . " i was only one among many people who overcame their fear , " he said . masur has received numerous honors from leipzig and germany for his musical achievements and personal courage . the night of july 18 has been set aside for a concert as part of the london proms with masur conducting the london philharmonic and the orchestre national de france in performances of bruckner and tchaikovsky - a fitting way for a musician who 's always close to the people to spend his eightieth birthday . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german and other european leaders have welcomed us president george w. bush 's new middle east initiative calling for an international conference to explore ways of creating a palestinian state . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said germany supported the goal of laying the foundation for " a successful palestinian state " with which peace talks could be conducted .
a two-state solution in the middle east needs a viable palestinian state with an effective government , solid finances , a functioning economy and a society based on law and justice , he said .
ulrich said former british prime minister tony blair had an important role to play as the representative of the mideast quartet , which is made up of the united nations , the european union , the united states and russia .
the quartet is expected to meet in lisbon , portugal , on thursday .
blair was picked last month by the quartet to help the palestinians build up their institutions and promote international political and economic support .

german and other european leaders have welcomed us president george w. bush 's new middle east initiative calling for an international conference to explore ways of creating a palestinian state . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said germany supported the goal of laying the foundation for " a successful palestinian state " with which peace talks could be conducted .
a two-state solution in the middle east needs a viable palestinian state with an effective government , solid finances , a functioning economy and a society based on law and justice , he said .
ulrich said former british prime minister tony blair had an important role to play as the representative of the mideast quartet , which is made up of the united nations , the european union , the united states and russia .
the quartet is expected to meet in lisbon , portugal , on thursday .
blair was picked last month by the quartet to help the palestinians build up their institutions and promote international political and economic support .
bolstering fatah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many palestinians also listened to what bush had to say in his initiative announced monday , bush said us secretary of state condoleezza rice would chair a conference in the autumn that would consist primarily of the israelis and palestinians as well as middle east countries committed to a two-state solution to the conflict .
bush announced $ 190 million -lrb- 137.8 million euros -rrb- in direct aid to the palestinian government led by prime minister-designate salam fayyad and $ 80 million for security .
he has sought to bolster abbas ' moderate fatah government since the beleaguered palestinian leader ousted hamas from the government after the radical group seized control of gaza .
merkel phones fayyad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister salam fayyad the german spokesman said chancellor angela merkel spoke by telephone on tuesday afternoon with fayyad and offered her support for steps taken by his government to move forward with the peace process .
fayyad briefed the chancellor on his efforts to establish an effective system of authority in the palestinian areas , particularly in the security sector , wilhelm said .
eu , britain back plan others in europe have also said they welcomed bush 's plan .
" the -lsb- bush -rsb- speech has elements that were never said before , " said the eu 's foreign and security policy chief javier solana , adding that the 27-nation bloc would work side by side with the us in a determined effort to bring about an end to the arab-israeli conflict .
british foreign secretary david miliband meanwhile said in a statement that " the international community should offer full support to those seeking a negotiated two-state solution to the conflict . "
french officials , on the other hand , reportedly said they would support the initiative only if it addresses the final status of the palestinian territories . article based on wire reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the entire incident might lead to others blackmailing the west , says dw 's rainer sollich . the whole trial was a cynical game of blackmail with foreign hostages - and a still uncertain outcome .
the gadhafi regime tellingly did n't even consider it necessary to come up with comprehensible charges .
it would have been hard to imagine - even in many other dictatorships - that such a bizarre accusation turns into a verdict that 's upheld by several courts : the death penalty for foreign medical personnel accused of - deliberately - infecting more than 400 libyan children with the virus that causes aids .
it does n't get much more grotesque than this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least it 's clear now that the death penalty will not be executed .
one can only hop that that the nurses will soon be transferred to bulgaria .
but even that 's probably also a question of money .
it 's already clear the families of the hiv-infected children will receive compensation that also partially comes from europe .
it 's safe to presume this despite the denials .
one could say that all those involved will benefit in the end .
but that 's still not certain , and even if that 's indeed the case , it still gets more complicated .
the families of the libyan victims should get any help that 's possible , but one should n't overlook the fact that the fate of the nurses is still unknown and that they spent eight years - presumably innocent - in prison .
reports by international experts documented their innocence in a credible way .
according to them , a lack of hygiene in the hospital was responsible for the infections .
it 's obvious why these reports were ignored .
no libyan judge could reach a verdict that would blame the state health care system - and indirectly the ruling class below dictator moammar gadhafi - for the hiv infections of more than 400 children .
that 's why they searched for a way to save face - and simply blamed foreign nurses and physicians .
gadhafi knows exactly who much the europeans need him and his country .
libya is not only gradually opening up to western markets and possesses large oil reserves , the country is also needed by the europeans as a bastion against illegal immigration .
the west is also relieved that libya has renounced terrorism .
that 's why gadhafi thinks he can afford to take foreign medical personnel hostage for his interests .
once the foreigners are released , nothing will stand in the way of good relations with the west .
other regimes could learn a lesson from this : how to blackmail western states .

" you ca n't wait until the tour is over , " brender said .
" that 's impossible .
the tour is under constant doping suspicion . "
the german cycling federation had said earlier wednesday that cyclist patrik sinkewitz tested positive for the steroid testosterone at an out-of-competition test on june 8 , ahead of the tour de france . sinkewitz faces a two-year ban from competitive cycling if found guilty of a doping offence . peter kaadtmann , the ard and zdf team chief at the tour , was quoted as saying that " our contract stated that we broadcast the tour as a competition of clean riders , not of people using doping substances . " viewers had to turn elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrik sinkewitz instead of broadcasting the day 's 10th stage , ard ran a feature on doping and interviewed all parties involved .
that program was followed by a telenovela . the two networks also terminated their internet live-ticker of the event . germans who wanted to follow the race had to resort to the eurosport network and its german-language broadcast after the decision . doping has never before prompted german networks to pull the plug on a planned broadcast . but zdf did not broadcast the 1985 european cup final after rioting liverpool fans caused the death of 37 mainly juventus fans ahead of the match between the two sides in brussels ' heysel stadium . ard and zdf , who are funded by fees from every german who owns a tv set , have long held the german tour de france broadcast rights .
no figures have been released but they are worth several million euros . they planned to broadcast a total 90 hours from the three-week tour which ends on july 29 in paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans missed jan ullrich at last year 's tour ratings surged when jan ullrich won the tour in 1997 and came second several times afterwards , but there were always critical voices over the big engagement because the sport was doping-infested . under pressure ard was under special pressure as the network was a sponsor of the telekom team , which is now called t-mobile , from 1998 until 2004 . the networks have become cautious in the past 12 months since ullrich was heavily implicated in the spanish doping probe centering on doctor eufemiano fuentes . ullrich was kicked out of t-mobile on the eve of the 2006 tour . in recent weeks , half a dozen former riders including 1996 tour champion bjarne riss confessed to doping on the team in the 1990s . two team doctors were kicked out in may after admitting to have been actively involved in that doping scheme , t-mobile 's ukrainian rider serhiy honchar was also fired in may over reportedly suspicious test results , and german rider matthias kessler from the astana team was recently caught for testosterone abuse . warned ahead of time ard and zdf told german cycling teams ahead of the tour de france that they could pull the plug if another rider was caught , and sinkewitz ' positive test for testosterone was announced wednesday . bildunterschrift : germany 's gerdemann won the 7th stage last saturday sinkewitz was caught at an out-of-competition test ahead of the tour , but rode in the tour until withdrawing injured on monday . " we talked to the german teams , told them how serious the situation was , " said ard programme director günter struve .
" t-mobile in particular swore that everything was fine with them . " t-mobile has introduced one of the stiffest anti-doping programs in the sport , but not even that may have stopped sinkewitz from tampering . the tv boycott could now also play a major role in sponsor commitments in cycling , with t-mobile company spokesman christian frommert " not ruling out anything " when the tour is assessed . t-mobile only recently committed itself until 2010 . frommert admitted that " the stakes are high " after the move by the networks , while brender said he hoped that wednesday 's move will prompt the teams , and cycling in general , into more action . " i hope we have done our share in this , " said brender . deutsche welle belongs to the ard network . article based on wire reports -lrb- als / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the entire incident might lead to others blackmailing the west , says dw 's rainer sollich . the whole trial was a cynical game of blackmail with foreign hostages - and a still uncertain outcome .
the gadhafi regime tellingly did n't even consider it necessary to come up with comprehensible charges .
it would have been hard to imagine - even in many other dictatorships - that such a bizarre accusation turns into a verdict that 's upheld by several courts : the death penalty for foreign medical personnel accused of - deliberately - infecting more than 400 libyan children with the virus that causes aids .
it does n't get much more grotesque than this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least it 's clear now that the death penalty will not be executed .
one can only hop that that the nurses will soon be transferred to bulgaria .
but even that 's probably also a question of money .
it 's already clear the families of the hiv-infected children will receive compensation that also partially comes from europe .
it 's safe to presume this despite the denials .
one could say that all those involved will benefit in the end .
but that 's still not certain , and even if that 's indeed the case , it still gets more complicated .
the families of the libyan victims should get any help that 's possible , but one should n't overlook the fact that the fate of the nurses is still unknown and that they spent eight years - presumably innocent - in prison .
reports by international experts documented their innocence in a credible way .
according to them , a lack of hygiene in the hospital was responsible for the infections .
it 's obvious why these reports were ignored .
no libyan judge could reach a verdict that would blame the state health care system - and indirectly the ruling class below dictator moammar gadhafi - for the hiv infections of more than 400 children .
that 's why they searched for a way to save face - and simply blamed foreign nurses and physicians .
gadhafi knows exactly who much the europeans need him and his country .
libya is not only gradually opening up to western markets and possesses large oil reserves , the country is also needed by the europeans as a bastion against illegal immigration .
the west is also relieved that libya has renounced terrorism .
that 's why gadhafi thinks he can afford to take foreign medical personnel hostage for his interests .
once the foreigners are released , nothing will stand in the way of good relations with the west .
other regimes could learn a lesson from this : how to blackmail western states .

for 10 years , his testimonies , in exchange for his freedom , have helped police crack down on organized crime . if the three italians on trial in düsseldorf for cocaine-trafficking are found guilty , it won ’ t be the first time that evidence supplied by mobster-turned-police informant basile puts suspected mafiosi behind bars .
before he was even 40 , the man they called " angel face " had murdered up to 30 people . after being arrested in the allgäu region of southern germany in 1998 , he was allowed to go free .
in return for his new life in a witness protection program , he has helped police lock up over 50 criminals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mafia hotbed corleone in sicily now 47 , basile , who will testify wednesday via video from a secret location in italy , was once one of the most redoubtable top dogs within the carelli clan , which belongs to calabria 's notorious ' ndrangheta .
among the most powerful and ruthless mafia-like organizations in italy , ' ndrangheta cells are loosely based on blood relationships .
the organization is believed to rake in some $ 30 billion -lrb- 22 billion euros -rrb- annually , mostly from illegal narcotics , but also from ostensibly legal businesses such as construction , restaurants and supermarkets .
allegedly , it is also involved in counterfeiting , gambling , fraud , theft , labor racketeering , loan sharking , people smuggling and kidnapping .
the ' ndrangheta ‘ s family ties are believed to be closer and their vows of silence more strictly observed than other mafia clans , such as cosa nostra and camorra .
so when giorgio basile decided to break them , it marked a watershed in germany 's fight against the mafia .
becoming numero uno bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlon brando as don corleone in " the godfather " with all the ingredients of a classic " godfather " film , it comes as no surprise that basile 's story has attracted the attention of a munich film company which has worked in the past with german star movie director oliver hirschbiegel -lrb- the downfall -rrb- .
born in corigliano calabro in 1960 , giorgio moved one year later to mühlheim an der ruhr in germany , where his father made a living as a " guest worker . "
in 1966 , his parents separated when his father realized his mother was having an affair .
her lover was antonio de cicco , local boss of the ' ndrangheta in corigliano and every bit the latin stereotype in his sharp suits with slicked-back hair and gold chains .
giorgio spent two years in italy with his new family , but returned to germany when his mother got pregnant .
he lost touch with his adopted father until 1979 , when at the age of 19 , giorgio was persuaded by de cicco to leave the dull , industrial trappings of western germany and work as his driver back in corigliano .
as a fledgling ' ndrinu , he enjoyed the attention his association with de cicco afforded him and soon became versed in the ways of the clan .
but when he discovered his adopted father had been abusing his sister , he resolved to avenge her .
in 1973 , he made his first killing , when he murdered de cicco .
by now , he was one of the most powerful cocaine dealers in tuscany , and a recognized uomo d ' onore -lrb- man of honor -rrb- .
it was during these years that he met his wife , who bore him a daughter .
he extended the business further afield , and in the 1980s , played a key role in building up mafia influence in germany .
betrayed by the organization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mafia boss giuseppe bellocco was arrested in calabria on tuesday arrested in 1998 , he opted to break the omertà , the mafia ‘ s " code of silence " .
within mafia culture , this made him a " stool pigeon " - a violation punishable by death .
according to andreas ulrich , author of " angel face , " a biography of giorgio basile , he agreed to name names because " he felt betrayed by the organization . "
" it never comes good on its promises , " he said .
" it lures young men with promises of power , money and women .
it uses them , then kills them as though they were ants . "
basile has said he lives with the knowledge that the mafia will hunt him down and kill him .
" the mafia bosses are behind bars because of what i did , " he told ulrich .
" they can ‘ t do anything to me any more , but their sons will avenge them . "
eighteen months ago , he told the online version of german news magazine der spiegel that the mafia 's influence was stronger than ever .
" the mafia will continue to expand , " he said .
" the enlarged europe will allow it to spread even further .
for someone with the same criminal energy as i had , it 's even easier in germany than it is in italy .
you can get away with anything . "
basile said the german authorities had failed to recognize the extent of the criminal energy that exists within the underground italian community .
" i couldn ’ t put a figure to it , but germany is home to many sleepers .
go in to any pizzeria and you might find the cook is a hitman just waiting for a call , " he said .
the mob in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giorgio basile the extent of mob influence is definitely underestimated in germany , said mafia expert jürgen roth .
" when berlusconi was in power there was very little information coming out of italy , " he explained .
" the mafia took the opportunity to get a foothold in germany . there is now barely any knowledge of the mafia 's criminal structures here .
it is active mainly in the area of money laundering , drug and weapons trading , protection racketeering and prostitution . "
while the biggest ' ndrangheta presence is in eastern german states such as thuringia and saxony , roth says cosa nostra actually has a higher profile in baden-württemberg .
earlier this month , italy ’ s leading mafia hunter , piero grasso , warned germany in the neue osnabrücker zeitung daily that the mob was even beginning to penetrate legitimate business circles in germany .
" the size and profit potential of german markets , as well as german law , makes the country highly attractive to organized criminals , " he said .
" their goal is to infiltrate legal financial circles in order to invest illegally gained funds with a long-term aim of dominating price wars and creating monopolies . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ' ndrangheta ‘ s family ties are believed to be closer and their vows of silence more strictly observed than other mafia clans , such as cosa nostra and camorra .
so when giorgio basile decided to break them , it marked a watershed in germany 's fight against the mafia .
becoming numero uno bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlon brando as don corleone in " the godfather " with all the ingredients of a classic " godfather " film , it comes as no surprise that basile 's story has attracted the attention of a munich film company which has worked in the past with german star movie director oliver hirschbiegel -lrb- the downfall -rrb- .
born in corigliano calabro in 1960 , giorgio moved one year later to mühlheim an der ruhr in germany , where his father made a living as a " guest worker . "
in 1966 , his parents separated when his father realized his mother was having an affair .
her lover was antonio de cicco , local boss of the ' ndrangheta in corigliano and every bit the latin stereotype in his sharp suits with slicked-back hair and gold chains .
giorgio spent two years in italy with his new family , but returned to germany when his mother got pregnant .
he lost touch with his adopted father until 1979 , when at the age of 19 , giorgio was persuaded by de cicco to leave the dull , industrial trappings of western germany and work as his driver back in corigliano .
as a fledgling ' ndrinu , he enjoyed the attention his association with de cicco afforded him and soon became versed in the ways of the clan .
but when he discovered his adopted father had been abusing his sister , he resolved to avenge her .
in 1973 , he made his first killing , when he murdered de cicco .
by now , he was one of the most powerful cocaine dealers in tuscany , and a recognized uomo d ' onore -lrb- man of honor -rrb- .
it was during these years that he met his wife , who bore him a daughter .
he extended the business further afield , and in the 1980s , played a key role in building up mafia influence in germany .
betrayed by the organization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mafia boss giuseppe bellocco was arrested in calabria on tuesday arrested in 1998 , he opted to break the omertà , the mafia ‘ s " code of silence " .
within mafia culture , this made him a " stool pigeon " - a violation punishable by death .
according to andreas ulrich , author of " angel face , " a biography of giorgio basile , he agreed to name names because " he felt betrayed by the organization . "
" it never comes good on its promises , " he said .
" it lures young men with promises of power , money and women .
it uses them , then kills them as though they were ants . "
basile has said he lives with the knowledge that the mafia will hunt him down and kill him .
" the mafia bosses are behind bars because of what i did , " he told ulrich .
" they can ‘ t do anything to me any more , but their sons will avenge them . "
eighteen months ago , he told the online version of german news magazine der spiegel that the mafia 's influence was stronger than ever .
" the mafia will continue to expand , " he said .
" the enlarged europe will allow it to spread even further .
for someone with the same criminal energy as i had , it 's even easier in germany than it is in italy .
you can get away with anything . "
basile said the german authorities had failed to recognize the extent of the criminal energy that exists within the underground italian community .
" i couldn ’ t put a figure to it , but germany is home to many sleepers .

the mob in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giorgio basile the extent of mob influence is definitely underestimated in germany , said mafia expert jürgen roth .
" when berlusconi was in power there was very little information coming out of italy , " he explained .
" the mafia took the opportunity to get a foothold in germany . there is now barely any knowledge of the mafia 's criminal structures here .
it is active mainly in the area of money laundering , drug and weapons trading , protection racketeering and prostitution . "
while the biggest ' ndrangheta presence is in eastern german states such as thuringia and saxony , roth says cosa nostra actually has a higher profile in baden-württemberg .
earlier this month , italy ’ s leading mafia hunter , piero grasso , warned germany in the neue osnabrücker zeitung daily that the mob was even beginning to penetrate legitimate business circles in germany .

the mob in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giorgio basile the extent of mob influence is definitely underestimated in germany , said mafia expert jürgen roth .
" when berlusconi was in power there was very little information coming out of italy , " he explained .
" the mafia took the opportunity to get a foothold in germany . there is now barely any knowledge of the mafia 's criminal structures here .
it is active mainly in the area of money laundering , drug and weapons trading , protection racketeering and prostitution . "
while the biggest ' ndrangheta presence is in eastern german states such as thuringia and saxony , roth says cosa nostra actually has a higher profile in baden-württemberg .
earlier this month , italy ’ s leading mafia hunter , piero grasso , warned germany in the neue osnabrücker zeitung daily that the mob was even beginning to penetrate legitimate business circles in germany .
" the size and profit potential of german markets , as well as german law , makes the country highly attractive to organized criminals , " he said .
" their goal is to infiltrate legal financial circles in order to invest illegally gained funds with a long-term aim of dominating price wars and creating monopolies . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" you ca n't wait until the tour is over , " brender said .
" that 's impossible .
the tour is under constant doping suspicion . "
the german cycling federation had said earlier wednesday that cyclist patrik sinkewitz tested positive for the steroid testosterone at an out-of-competition test on june 8 , ahead of the tour de france . sinkewitz faces a two-year ban from competitive cycling if found guilty of a doping offence . peter kaadtmann , the ard and zdf team chief at the tour , was quoted as saying that " our contract stated that we broadcast the tour as a competition of clean riders , not of people using doping substances . " viewers had to turn elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrik sinkewitz instead of broadcasting the day 's 10th stage , ard ran a feature on doping and interviewed all parties involved .
that program was followed by a telenovela . the two networks also terminated their internet live-ticker of the event . germans who wanted to follow the race had to resort to the eurosport network and its german-language broadcast after the decision . doping has never before prompted german networks to pull the plug on a planned broadcast . but zdf did not broadcast the 1985 european cup final after rioting liverpool fans caused the death of 37 mainly juventus fans ahead of the match between the two sides in brussels ' heysel stadium . ard and zdf , who are funded by fees from every german who owns a tv set , have long held the german tour de france broadcast rights .
no figures have been released but they are worth several million euros . they planned to broadcast a total 90 hours from the three-week tour which ends on july 29 in paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans missed jan ullrich at last year 's tour ratings surged when jan ullrich won the tour in 1997 and came second several times afterwards , but there were always critical voices over the big engagement because the sport was doping-infested . under pressure ard was under special pressure as the network was a sponsor of the telekom team , which is now called t-mobile , from 1998 until 2004 . the networks have become cautious in the past 12 months since ullrich was heavily implicated in the spanish doping probe centering on doctor eufemiano fuentes . ullrich was kicked out of t-mobile on the eve of the 2006 tour . in recent weeks , half a dozen former riders including 1996 tour champion bjarne riss confessed to doping on the team in the 1990s . two team doctors were kicked out in may after admitting to have been actively involved in that doping scheme , t-mobile 's ukrainian rider serhiy honchar was also fired in may over reportedly suspicious test results , and german rider matthias kessler from the astana team was recently caught for testosterone abuse . warned ahead of time ard and zdf told german cycling teams ahead of the tour de france that they could pull the plug if another rider was caught , and sinkewitz ' positive test for testosterone was announced wednesday . bildunterschrift : germany 's gerdemann won the 7th stage last saturday sinkewitz was caught at an out-of-competition test ahead of the tour , but rode in the tour until withdrawing injured on monday . " we talked to the german teams , told them how serious the situation was , " said ard programme director günter struve .
" t-mobile in particular swore that everything was fine with them . " t-mobile has introduced one of the stiffest anti-doping programs in the sport , but not even that may have stopped sinkewitz from tampering . the tv boycott could now also play a major role in sponsor commitments in cycling , with t-mobile company spokesman christian frommert " not ruling out anything " when the tour is assessed . t-mobile only recently committed itself until 2010 . frommert admitted that " the stakes are high " after the move by the networks , while brender said he hoped that wednesday 's move will prompt the teams , and cycling in general , into more action . " i hope we have done our share in this , " said brender . deutsche welle belongs to the ard network . article based on wire reports -lrb- als / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" errors have been made for which he , as head of vattenfall europe , must bear responsibility . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krümmel nuclear plant is still not back in operation a fire in the company 's nearby krümmel nuclear power plant in june had started a series of problems that led to the firing of vattenfall europe 's nuclear energy chief , bruno thomauske , on monday .
gradual disclosures since june 28 , when electrical defects shut down the company 's reactors at krümmel and brunsbüttel near hamburg , have revealed that staff at krümmel were in crisis as a fire raged in a transformer .
neither reactor was damaged and no radioactivity was released , but vattenfall - and the whole nuclear industry in germany - suffered a public relations disaster .
the company said it was commissioning an independent inquiry by scientists and business experts with a budget of 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6.8 million -rrb- to examine exactly what went wrong .
ministers divided on what to do bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , angela merkel and michael glos -lrb- from left -rrb- german economy minister michael glos meanwhile sprang to the defense of the country 's nuclear power stations on wednesday , saying that despite the recent problems , even the oldest plants were ahead of the rest of the world in terms of security .
" what 's definite is that the reactors in operation are as safe as is humanly possible , " glos told german public television zdf .
" on this point , we in germany are ahead " , the minister said .
glos also added that said that the safety of the power stations had nothing to do with their age .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel on the other hand had called for the oldest plants , which began operating in the early 1970s , to be shut down .
in return , the remaining operation time on these plants could be transferred to younger plants , but energy providers are not keen on doing so as the old ones operate much more profitably .
merkel has no pity chancellor angela merkel , who has in the past supported a rethink of germany 's planned nuclear energy phase-out , said wednesday that she could understand the public 's concerns and its criticism of the nuclear industry .
" my pity for the industry is limited , " she said , adding that she found vattenfall 's information policy " totally unacceptable .
" after all , dramatic errors were committed , " merkel said .
but the chancellor also said that the entire industry should not be stigmatized .
" i would n't generalize , " she said .
" it must not happen again . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german and other european leaders have welcomed us president george w. bush 's new middle east initiative calling for an international conference to explore ways of creating a palestinian state . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said germany supported the goal of laying the foundation for " a successful palestinian state " with which peace talks could be conducted .
a two-state solution in the middle east needs a viable palestinian state with an effective government , solid finances , a functioning economy and a society based on law and justice , he said .
ulrich said former british prime minister tony blair had an important role to play as the representative of the mideast quartet , which is made up of the united nations , the european union , the united states and russia .
the quartet is expected to meet in lisbon , portugal , on thursday .
blair was picked last month by the quartet to help the palestinians build up their institutions and promote international political and economic support .
bolstering fatah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many palestinians also listened to what bush had to say in his initiative announced monday , bush said us secretary of state condoleezza rice would chair a conference in the autumn that would consist primarily of the israelis and palestinians as well as middle east countries committed to a two-state solution to the conflict .
bush announced $ 190 million -lrb- 137.8 million euros -rrb- in direct aid to the palestinian government led by prime minister-designate salam fayyad and $ 80 million for security .
he has sought to bolster abbas ' moderate fatah government since the beleaguered palestinian leader ousted hamas from the government after the radical group seized control of gaza .
merkel phones fayyad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister salam fayyad the german spokesman said chancellor angela merkel spoke by telephone on tuesday afternoon with fayyad and offered her support for steps taken by his government to move forward with the peace process .
fayyad briefed the chancellor on his efforts to establish an effective system of authority in the palestinian areas , particularly in the security sector , wilhelm said .
eu , britain back plan others in europe have also said they welcomed bush 's plan .

german and other european leaders have welcomed us president george w. bush 's new middle east initiative calling for an international conference to explore ways of creating a palestinian state . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said germany supported the goal of laying the foundation for " a successful palestinian state " with which peace talks could be conducted .
a two-state solution in the middle east needs a viable palestinian state with an effective government , solid finances , a functioning economy and a society based on law and justice , he said .
ulrich said former british prime minister tony blair had an important role to play as the representative of the mideast quartet , which is made up of the united nations , the european union , the united states and russia .
the quartet is expected to meet in lisbon , portugal , on thursday .
blair was picked last month by the quartet to help the palestinians build up their institutions and promote international political and economic support .
bolstering fatah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many palestinians also listened to what bush had to say in his initiative announced monday , bush said us secretary of state condoleezza rice would chair a conference in the autumn that would consist primarily of the israelis and palestinians as well as middle east countries committed to a two-state solution to the conflict .
bush announced $ 190 million -lrb- 137.8 million euros -rrb- in direct aid to the palestinian government led by prime minister-designate salam fayyad and $ 80 million for security .
he has sought to bolster abbas ' moderate fatah government since the beleaguered palestinian leader ousted hamas from the government after the radical group seized control of gaza .
merkel phones fayyad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister salam fayyad the german spokesman said chancellor angela merkel spoke by telephone on tuesday afternoon with fayyad and offered her support for steps taken by his government to move forward with the peace process .
fayyad briefed the chancellor on his efforts to establish an effective system of authority in the palestinian areas , particularly in the security sector , wilhelm said .
eu , britain back plan others in europe have also said they welcomed bush 's plan .
" the -lsb- bush -rsb- speech has elements that were never said before , " said the eu 's foreign and security policy chief javier solana , adding that the 27-nation bloc would work side by side with the us in a determined effort to bring about an end to the arab-israeli conflict .
british foreign secretary david miliband meanwhile said in a statement that " the international community should offer full support to those seeking a negotiated two-state solution to the conflict . "
french officials , on the other hand , reportedly said they would support the initiative only if it addresses the final status of the palestinian territories . article based on wire reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for 10 years , his testimonies , in exchange for his freedom , have helped police crack down on organized crime . if the three italians on trial in düsseldorf for cocaine-trafficking are found guilty , it won ’ t be the first time that evidence supplied by mobster-turned-police informant basile puts suspected mafiosi behind bars .
before he was even 40 , the man they called " angel face " had murdered up to 30 people . after being arrested in the allgäu region of southern germany in 1998 , he was allowed to go free .
in return for his new life in a witness protection program , he has helped police lock up over 50 criminals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mafia hotbed corleone in sicily now 47 , basile , who will testify wednesday via video from a secret location in italy , was once one of the most redoubtable top dogs within the carelli clan , which belongs to calabria 's notorious ' ndrangheta .
among the most powerful and ruthless mafia-like organizations in italy , ' ndrangheta cells are loosely based on blood relationships .
the organization is believed to rake in some $ 30 billion -lrb- 22 billion euros -rrb- annually , mostly from illegal narcotics , but also from ostensibly legal businesses such as construction , restaurants and supermarkets .
allegedly , it is also involved in counterfeiting , gambling , fraud , theft , labor racketeering , loan sharking , people smuggling and kidnapping .
the ' ndrangheta ‘ s family ties are believed to be closer and their vows of silence more strictly observed than other mafia clans , such as cosa nostra and camorra .
so when giorgio basile decided to break them , it marked a watershed in germany 's fight against the mafia .
becoming numero uno bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlon brando as don corleone in " the godfather " with all the ingredients of a classic " godfather " film , it comes as no surprise that basile 's story has attracted the attention of a munich film company which has worked in the past with german star movie director oliver hirschbiegel -lrb- the downfall -rrb- .
born in corigliano calabro in 1960 , giorgio moved one year later to mühlheim an der ruhr in germany , where his father made a living as a " guest worker . "
in 1966 , his parents separated when his father realized his mother was having an affair .
her lover was antonio de cicco , local boss of the ' ndrangheta in corigliano and every bit the latin stereotype in his sharp suits with slicked-back hair and gold chains .
giorgio spent two years in italy with his new family , but returned to germany when his mother got pregnant .
he lost touch with his adopted father until 1979 , when at the age of 19 , giorgio was persuaded by de cicco to leave the dull , industrial trappings of western germany and work as his driver back in corigliano .
as a fledgling ' ndrinu , he enjoyed the attention his association with de cicco afforded him and soon became versed in the ways of the clan .
but when he discovered his adopted father had been abusing his sister , he resolved to avenge her .
in 1973 , he made his first killing , when he murdered de cicco .
by now , he was one of the most powerful cocaine dealers in tuscany , and a recognized uomo d ' onore -lrb- man of honor -rrb- .
it was during these years that he met his wife , who bore him a daughter .
he extended the business further afield , and in the 1980s , played a key role in building up mafia influence in germany .
betrayed by the organization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mafia boss giuseppe bellocco was arrested in calabria on tuesday arrested in 1998 , he opted to break the omertà , the mafia ‘ s " code of silence " .
within mafia culture , this made him a " stool pigeon " - a violation punishable by death .
according to andreas ulrich , author of " angel face , " a biography of giorgio basile , he agreed to name names because " he felt betrayed by the organization . "
" it never comes good on its promises , " he said .
" it lures young men with promises of power , money and women .
it uses them , then kills them as though they were ants . "
basile has said he lives with the knowledge that the mafia will hunt him down and kill him .
" the mafia bosses are behind bars because of what i did , " he told ulrich .
" they can ‘ t do anything to me any more , but their sons will avenge them . "
eighteen months ago , he told the online version of german news magazine der spiegel that the mafia 's influence was stronger than ever .
" the mafia will continue to expand , " he said .
" the enlarged europe will allow it to spread even further .
for someone with the same criminal energy as i had , it 's even easier in germany than it is in italy .
you can get away with anything . "
basile said the german authorities had failed to recognize the extent of the criminal energy that exists within the underground italian community .
" i couldn ’ t put a figure to it , but germany is home to many sleepers .
go in to any pizzeria and you might find the cook is a hitman just waiting for a call , " he said .
the mob in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giorgio basile the extent of mob influence is definitely underestimated in germany , said mafia expert jürgen roth .
" when berlusconi was in power there was very little information coming out of italy , " he explained .
" the mafia took the opportunity to get a foothold in germany . there is now barely any knowledge of the mafia 's criminal structures here .
it is active mainly in the area of money laundering , drug and weapons trading , protection racketeering and prostitution . "
while the biggest ' ndrangheta presence is in eastern german states such as thuringia and saxony , roth says cosa nostra actually has a higher profile in baden-württemberg .
earlier this month , italy ’ s leading mafia hunter , piero grasso , warned germany in the neue osnabrücker zeitung daily that the mob was even beginning to penetrate legitimate business circles in germany .
" the size and profit potential of german markets , as well as german law , makes the country highly attractive to organized criminals , " he said .
" their goal is to infiltrate legal financial circles in order to invest illegally gained funds with a long-term aim of dominating price wars and creating monopolies . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" all kinds of nazi incendiary writings have been published in a scientific format , except for ' mein kampf , " ' said möller , a history professor at munich university .

" all kinds of nazi incendiary writings have been published in a scientific format , except for ' mein kampf , " ' said möller , a history professor at munich university .

" you ca n't wait until the tour is over , " brender said .
" that 's impossible .
the tour is under constant doping suspicion . "
the german cycling federation had said earlier wednesday that cyclist patrik sinkewitz tested positive for the steroid testosterone at an out-of-competition test on june 8 , ahead of the tour de france . sinkewitz faces a two-year ban from competitive cycling if found guilty of a doping offence . peter kaadtmann , the ard and zdf team chief at the tour , was quoted as saying that " our contract stated that we broadcast the tour as a competition of clean riders , not of people using doping substances . " viewers had to turn elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrik sinkewitz instead of broadcasting the day 's 10th stage , ard ran a feature on doping and interviewed all parties involved .
that program was followed by a telenovela . the two networks also terminated their internet live-ticker of the event . germans who wanted to follow the race had to resort to the eurosport network and its german-language broadcast after the decision . doping has never before prompted german networks to pull the plug on a planned broadcast . but zdf did not broadcast the 1985 european cup final after rioting liverpool fans caused the death of 37 mainly juventus fans ahead of the match between the two sides in brussels ' heysel stadium . ard and zdf , who are funded by fees from every german who owns a tv set , have long held the german tour de france broadcast rights .
no figures have been released but they are worth several million euros . they planned to broadcast a total 90 hours from the three-week tour which ends on july 29 in paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans missed jan ullrich at last year 's tour ratings surged when jan ullrich won the tour in 1997 and came second several times afterwards , but there were always critical voices over the big engagement because the sport was doping-infested . under pressure ard was under special pressure as the network was a sponsor of the telekom team , which is now called t-mobile , from 1998 until 2004 . the networks have become cautious in the past 12 months since ullrich was heavily implicated in the spanish doping probe centering on doctor eufemiano fuentes . ullrich was kicked out of t-mobile on the eve of the 2006 tour . in recent weeks , half a dozen former riders including 1996 tour champion bjarne riss confessed to doping on the team in the 1990s . two team doctors were kicked out in may after admitting to have been actively involved in that doping scheme , t-mobile 's ukrainian rider serhiy honchar was also fired in may over reportedly suspicious test results , and german rider matthias kessler from the astana team was recently caught for testosterone abuse . warned ahead of time ard and zdf told german cycling teams ahead of the tour de france that they could pull the plug if another rider was caught , and sinkewitz ' positive test for testosterone was announced wednesday . bildunterschrift : germany 's gerdemann won the 7th stage last saturday sinkewitz was caught at an out-of-competition test ahead of the tour , but rode in the tour until withdrawing injured on monday . " we talked to the german teams , told them how serious the situation was , " said ard programme director günter struve .
" t-mobile in particular swore that everything was fine with them . " t-mobile has introduced one of the stiffest anti-doping programs in the sport , but not even that may have stopped sinkewitz from tampering . the tv boycott could now also play a major role in sponsor commitments in cycling , with t-mobile company spokesman christian frommert " not ruling out anything " when the tour is assessed . t-mobile only recently committed itself until 2010 . frommert admitted that " the stakes are high " after the move by the networks , while brender said he hoped that wednesday 's move will prompt the teams , and cycling in general , into more action . " i hope we have done our share in this , " said brender . deutsche welle belongs to the ard network . article based on wire reports -lrb- als / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for 10 years , his testimonies , in exchange for his freedom , have helped police crack down on organized crime . if the three italians on trial in düsseldorf for cocaine-trafficking are found guilty , it won ’ t be the first time that evidence supplied by mobster-turned-police informant basile puts suspected mafiosi behind bars .
before he was even 40 , the man they called " angel face " had murdered up to 30 people . after being arrested in the allgäu region of southern germany in 1998 , he was allowed to go free .
in return for his new life in a witness protection program , he has helped police lock up over 50 criminals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mafia hotbed corleone in sicily now 47 , basile , who will testify wednesday via video from a secret location in italy , was once one of the most redoubtable top dogs within the carelli clan , which belongs to calabria 's notorious ' ndrangheta .
among the most powerful and ruthless mafia-like organizations in italy , ' ndrangheta cells are loosely based on blood relationships .
the organization is believed to rake in some $ 30 billion -lrb- 22 billion euros -rrb- annually , mostly from illegal narcotics , but also from ostensibly legal businesses such as construction , restaurants and supermarkets .
allegedly , it is also involved in counterfeiting , gambling , fraud , theft , labor racketeering , loan sharking , people smuggling and kidnapping .
the ' ndrangheta ‘ s family ties are believed to be closer and their vows of silence more strictly observed than other mafia clans , such as cosa nostra and camorra .
so when giorgio basile decided to break them , it marked a watershed in germany 's fight against the mafia .
becoming numero uno bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlon brando as don corleone in " the godfather " with all the ingredients of a classic " godfather " film , it comes as no surprise that basile 's story has attracted the attention of a munich film company which has worked in the past with german star movie director oliver hirschbiegel -lrb- the downfall -rrb- .
born in corigliano calabro in 1960 , giorgio moved one year later to mühlheim an der ruhr in germany , where his father made a living as a " guest worker . "
in 1966 , his parents separated when his father realized his mother was having an affair .
her lover was antonio de cicco , local boss of the ' ndrangheta in corigliano and every bit the latin stereotype in his sharp suits with slicked-back hair and gold chains .
giorgio spent two years in italy with his new family , but returned to germany when his mother got pregnant .
he lost touch with his adopted father until 1979 , when at the age of 19 , giorgio was persuaded by de cicco to leave the dull , industrial trappings of western germany and work as his driver back in corigliano .
as a fledgling ' ndrinu , he enjoyed the attention his association with de cicco afforded him and soon became versed in the ways of the clan .
but when he discovered his adopted father had been abusing his sister , he resolved to avenge her .
in 1973 , he made his first killing , when he murdered de cicco .
by now , he was one of the most powerful cocaine dealers in tuscany , and a recognized uomo d ' onore -lrb- man of honor -rrb- .
it was during these years that he met his wife , who bore him a daughter .
he extended the business further afield , and in the 1980s , played a key role in building up mafia influence in germany .
betrayed by the organization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mafia boss giuseppe bellocco was arrested in calabria on tuesday arrested in 1998 , he opted to break the omertà , the mafia ‘ s " code of silence " .
within mafia culture , this made him a " stool pigeon " - a violation punishable by death .
according to andreas ulrich , author of " angel face , " a biography of giorgio basile , he agreed to name names because " he felt betrayed by the organization . "
" it never comes good on its promises , " he said .
" it lures young men with promises of power , money and women .
it uses them , then kills them as though they were ants . "
basile has said he lives with the knowledge that the mafia will hunt him down and kill him .
" the mafia bosses are behind bars because of what i did , " he told ulrich .
" they can ‘ t do anything to me any more , but their sons will avenge them . "
eighteen months ago , he told the online version of german news magazine der spiegel that the mafia 's influence was stronger than ever .
" the mafia will continue to expand , " he said .
" the enlarged europe will allow it to spread even further .
for someone with the same criminal energy as i had , it 's even easier in germany than it is in italy .
you can get away with anything . "
basile said the german authorities had failed to recognize the extent of the criminal energy that exists within the underground italian community .
" i couldn ’ t put a figure to it , but germany is home to many sleepers .
go in to any pizzeria and you might find the cook is a hitman just waiting for a call , " he said .
the mob in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giorgio basile the extent of mob influence is definitely underestimated in germany , said mafia expert jürgen roth .
" when berlusconi was in power there was very little information coming out of italy , " he explained .
" the mafia took the opportunity to get a foothold in germany . there is now barely any knowledge of the mafia 's criminal structures here .
it is active mainly in the area of money laundering , drug and weapons trading , protection racketeering and prostitution . "
while the biggest ' ndrangheta presence is in eastern german states such as thuringia and saxony , roth says cosa nostra actually has a higher profile in baden-württemberg .
earlier this month , italy ’ s leading mafia hunter , piero grasso , warned germany in the neue osnabrücker zeitung daily that the mob was even beginning to penetrate legitimate business circles in germany .
" the size and profit potential of german markets , as well as german law , makes the country highly attractive to organized criminals , " he said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mafia hotbed corleone in sicily now 47 , basile , who will testify wednesday via video from a secret location in italy , was once one of the most redoubtable top dogs within the carelli clan , which belongs to calabria 's notorious ' ndrangheta .
among the most powerful and ruthless mafia-like organizations in italy , ' ndrangheta cells are loosely based on blood relationships .
the organization is believed to rake in some $ 30 billion -lrb- 22 billion euros -rrb- annually , mostly from illegal narcotics , but also from ostensibly legal businesses such as construction , restaurants and supermarkets .
allegedly , it is also involved in counterfeiting , gambling , fraud , theft , labor racketeering , loan sharking , people smuggling and kidnapping .
the ' ndrangheta ‘ s family ties are believed to be closer and their vows of silence more strictly observed than other mafia clans , such as cosa nostra and camorra .
so when giorgio basile decided to break them , it marked a watershed in germany 's fight against the mafia .
becoming numero uno bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlon brando as don corleone in " the godfather " with all the ingredients of a classic " godfather " film , it comes as no surprise that basile 's story has attracted the attention of a munich film company which has worked in the past with german star movie director oliver hirschbiegel -lrb- the downfall -rrb- .
born in corigliano calabro in 1960 , giorgio moved one year later to mühlheim an der ruhr in germany , where his father made a living as a " guest worker . "
in 1966 , his parents separated when his father realized his mother was having an affair .
her lover was antonio de cicco , local boss of the ' ndrangheta in corigliano and every bit the latin stereotype in his sharp suits with slicked-back hair and gold chains .
giorgio spent two years in italy with his new family , but returned to germany when his mother got pregnant .
he lost touch with his adopted father until 1979 , when at the age of 19 , giorgio was persuaded by de cicco to leave the dull , industrial trappings of western germany and work as his driver back in corigliano .
as a fledgling ' ndrinu , he enjoyed the attention his association with de cicco afforded him and soon became versed in the ways of the clan .
but when he discovered his adopted father had been abusing his sister , he resolved to avenge her .
in 1973 , he made his first killing , when he murdered de cicco .
by now , he was one of the most powerful cocaine dealers in tuscany , and a recognized uomo d ' onore -lrb- man of honor -rrb- .
it was during these years that he met his wife , who bore him a daughter .
he extended the business further afield , and in the 1980s , played a key role in building up mafia influence in germany .
betrayed by the organization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mafia boss giuseppe bellocco was arrested in calabria on tuesday arrested in 1998 , he opted to break the omertà , the mafia ‘ s " code of silence " .
within mafia culture , this made him a " stool pigeon " - a violation punishable by death .
according to andreas ulrich , author of " angel face , " a biography of giorgio basile , he agreed to name names because " he felt betrayed by the organization . "
" it never comes good on its promises , " he said .
" it lures young men with promises of power , money and women .
it uses them , then kills them as though they were ants . "
basile has said he lives with the knowledge that the mafia will hunt him down and kill him .
" the mafia bosses are behind bars because of what i did , " he told ulrich .
" they can ‘ t do anything to me any more , but their sons will avenge them . "
eighteen months ago , he told the online version of german news magazine der spiegel that the mafia 's influence was stronger than ever .
" the mafia will continue to expand , " he said .
" the enlarged europe will allow it to spread even further .
for someone with the same criminal energy as i had , it 's even easier in germany than it is in italy .
you can get away with anything . "
basile said the german authorities had failed to recognize the extent of the criminal energy that exists within the underground italian community .
" i couldn ’ t put a figure to it , but germany is home to many sleepers .
go in to any pizzeria and you might find the cook is a hitman just waiting for a call , " he said .
the mob in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giorgio basile the extent of mob influence is definitely underestimated in germany , said mafia expert jürgen roth .
" when berlusconi was in power there was very little information coming out of italy , " he explained .
" the mafia took the opportunity to get a foothold in germany . there is now barely any knowledge of the mafia 's criminal structures here .
it is active mainly in the area of money laundering , drug and weapons trading , protection racketeering and prostitution . "
while the biggest ' ndrangheta presence is in eastern german states such as thuringia and saxony , roth says cosa nostra actually has a higher profile in baden-württemberg .
earlier this month , italy ’ s leading mafia hunter , piero grasso , warned germany in the neue osnabrücker zeitung daily that the mob was even beginning to penetrate legitimate business circles in germany .
" the size and profit potential of german markets , as well as german law , makes the country highly attractive to organized criminals , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 18.07.2007 opinion : gadhafi 's cynical game of blackmail großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans may breathe a sigh of relief that libya has commuted the death sentences of bulgarian nurses .
but the entire incident might lead to others blackmailing the west , says dw 's rainer sollich . the whole trial was a cynical game of blackmail with foreign hostages - and a still uncertain outcome .
the gadhafi regime tellingly did n't even consider it necessary to come up with comprehensible charges .
it would have been hard to imagine - even in many other dictatorships - that such a bizarre accusation turns into a verdict that 's upheld by several courts : the death penalty for foreign medical personnel accused of - deliberately - infecting more than 400 libyan children with the virus that causes aids .
it does n't get much more grotesque than this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least it 's clear now that the death penalty will not be executed .
one can only hop that that the nurses will soon be transferred to bulgaria .
but even that 's probably also a question of money .
it 's already clear the families of the hiv-infected children will receive compensation that also partially comes from europe .
it 's safe to presume this despite the denials .
one could say that all those involved will benefit in the end .
but that 's still not certain , and even if that 's indeed the case , it still gets more complicated .
the families of the libyan victims should get any help that 's possible , but one should n't overlook the fact that the fate of the nurses is still unknown and that they spent eight years - presumably innocent - in prison .
reports by international experts documented their innocence in a credible way .
according to them , a lack of hygiene in the hospital was responsible for the infections .
it 's obvious why these reports were ignored .
no libyan judge could reach a verdict that would blame the state health care system - and indirectly the ruling class below dictator moammar gadhafi - for the hiv infections of more than 400 children .
that 's why they searched for a way to save face - and simply blamed foreign nurses and physicians .
gadhafi knows exactly who much the europeans need him and his country .
libya is not only gradually opening up to western markets and possesses large oil reserves , the country is also needed by the europeans as a bastion against illegal immigration .
the west is also relieved that libya has renounced terrorism .
that 's why gadhafi thinks he can afford to take foreign medical personnel hostage for his interests .
once the foreigners are released , nothing will stand in the way of good relations with the west .
other regimes could learn a lesson from this : how to blackmail western states .

the show was revealed to be a hoax at the end of the broadcast , with the role of the " lisa , " who was purportedly suffering from a brain tumor , being played by an actress .

the dutch health ministry released a statement this week revealing a sharp jump in the number of people joining the organ donor registry , with 43,000 forms being downloaded from its web site in the weeks after " the big donorshow " was aired .

but perhaps his finest hour came on the political stage in 1989 . masur was born on july 18 , 1927 in what is now the city of brzeg in poland .
the son of an engineer , he taught himself piano as a young child and quickly specialized in conducting - despite suffering from a nervous stutter . in 1970 , masur became kapellmeister at leipzig 's gewandhaus orchestra - the musical ensemble with which he remains most closely associated .
he stayed in the post for 27 years , putting the orchestra back on the international map and presiding over the building of a new concert hall to replace the former one that had been badly damaged by allied bombing during world war ii . in leipzig , masur established an international reputation as a sensitive and innovative interpreter of the classical and romantic repertoire - and specifically mendelssohn , brahms and tchaikovsky . a master of the requiem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of leipzigers protested every monday in 1989 his best-known recording came in 1982 with an interpretation of richard strauss 's " four last songs . "
masur drastically slowed the tempi to create expressive space for soprano jessye norman 's booming , gospel-tinged voice , turning what is often a quiet meditation on impending mortality into a hike through a particularly lush cemetery . decried by some as sluggish bombast , the recording is still in print after 25 years and regularly shows up on classical-music critics ' " best-of " lists . masur has also wielded the baton for new york and london philharmonic orchestras .
despite plans to scale back his activities , he continues to be one of the world 's most sought after and active conductors . calls for non-violence bildunterschrift : masur publicly came out in support of the demonstrators masur declined offers to leave east germany through much of his career and enjoyed cordial relations with former gdr leader erich honecker .

in interviews since then , masur has played down his role in the " peaceful revolution " of 1989 . " i was only one among many people who overcame their fear , " he said . masur has received numerous honors from leipzig and germany for his musical achievements and personal courage . the night of july 18 has been set aside for a concert as part of the london proms with masur conducting the london philharmonic and the orchestre national de france in performances of bruckner and tchaikovsky - a fitting way for a musician who 's always close to the people to spend his eightieth birthday . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but perhaps his finest hour came on the political stage in 1989 . masur was born on july 18 , 1927 in what is now the city of brzeg in poland .
the son of an engineer , he taught himself piano as a young child and quickly specialized in conducting - despite suffering from a nervous stutter . in 1970 , masur became kapellmeister at leipzig 's gewandhaus orchestra - the musical ensemble with which he remains most closely associated .
he stayed in the post for 27 years , putting the orchestra back on the international map and presiding over the building of a new concert hall to replace the former one that had been badly damaged by allied bombing during world war ii . in leipzig , masur established an international reputation as a sensitive and innovative interpreter of the classical and romantic repertoire - and specifically mendelssohn , brahms and tchaikovsky . a master of the requiem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of leipzigers protested every monday in 1989 his best-known recording came in 1982 with an interpretation of richard strauss 's " four last songs . "
masur drastically slowed the tempi to create expressive space for soprano jessye norman 's booming , gospel-tinged voice , turning what is often a quiet meditation on impending mortality into a hike through a particularly lush cemetery . decried by some as sluggish bombast , the recording is still in print after 25 years and regularly shows up on classical-music critics ' " best-of " lists . masur has also wielded the baton for new york and london philharmonic orchestras .
despite plans to scale back his activities , he continues to be one of the world 's most sought after and active conductors . calls for non-violence bildunterschrift : masur publicly came out in support of the demonstrators masur declined offers to leave east germany through much of his career and enjoyed cordial relations with former gdr leader erich honecker .
but he never joined the communist party . in 1989 , amidst growing anti-government protests in leipzig , masur criticized violence by riot police against the demonstrators .

in interviews since then , masur has played down his role in the " peaceful revolution " of 1989 . " i was only one among many people who overcame their fear , " he said . masur has received numerous honors from leipzig and germany for his musical achievements and personal courage . the night of july 18 has been set aside for a concert as part of the london proms with masur conducting the london philharmonic and the orchestre national de france in performances of bruckner and tchaikovsky - a fitting way for a musician who 's always close to the people to spend his eightieth birthday . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german and other european leaders have welcomed us president george w. bush 's new middle east initiative calling for an international conference to explore ways of creating a palestinian state . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said germany supported the goal of laying the foundation for " a successful palestinian state " with which peace talks could be conducted .
a two-state solution in the middle east needs a viable palestinian state with an effective government , solid finances , a functioning economy and a society based on law and justice , he said .
ulrich said former british prime minister tony blair had an important role to play as the representative of the mideast quartet , which is made up of the united nations , the european union , the united states and russia .
the quartet is expected to meet in lisbon , portugal , on thursday .
blair was picked last month by the quartet to help the palestinians build up their institutions and promote international political and economic support .

bush announced $ 190 million -lrb- 137.8 million euros -rrb- in direct aid to the palestinian government led by prime minister-designate salam fayyad and $ 80 million for security .

german and other european leaders have welcomed us president george w. bush 's new middle east initiative calling for an international conference to explore ways of creating a palestinian state . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said germany supported the goal of laying the foundation for " a successful palestinian state " with which peace talks could be conducted .
a two-state solution in the middle east needs a viable palestinian state with an effective government , solid finances , a functioning economy and a society based on law and justice , he said .
ulrich said former british prime minister tony blair had an important role to play as the representative of the mideast quartet , which is made up of the united nations , the european union , the united states and russia .
the quartet is expected to meet in lisbon , portugal , on thursday .
blair was picked last month by the quartet to help the palestinians build up their institutions and promote international political and economic support .

bush announced $ 190 million -lrb- 137.8 million euros -rrb- in direct aid to the palestinian government led by prime minister-designate salam fayyad and $ 80 million for security .
he has sought to bolster abbas ' moderate fatah government since the beleaguered palestinian leader ousted hamas from the government after the radical group seized control of gaza .
merkel phones fayyad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister salam fayyad the german spokesman said chancellor angela merkel spoke by telephone on tuesday afternoon with fayyad and offered her support for steps taken by his government to move forward with the peace process .
fayyad briefed the chancellor on his efforts to establish an effective system of authority in the palestinian areas , particularly in the security sector , wilhelm said .
eu , britain back plan others in europe have also said they welcomed bush 's plan .
" the -lsb- bush -rsb- speech has elements that were never said before , " said the eu 's foreign and security policy chief javier solana , adding that the 27-nation bloc would work side by side with the us in a determined effort to bring about an end to the arab-israeli conflict .
british foreign secretary david miliband meanwhile said in a statement that " the international community should offer full support to those seeking a negotiated two-state solution to the conflict . "

but the entire incident might lead to others blackmailing the west , says dw 's rainer sollich . the whole trial was a cynical game of blackmail with foreign hostages - and a still uncertain outcome .
the gadhafi regime tellingly did n't even consider it necessary to come up with comprehensible charges .
it would have been hard to imagine - even in many other dictatorships - that such a bizarre accusation turns into a verdict that 's upheld by several courts : the death penalty for foreign medical personnel accused of - deliberately - infecting more than 400 libyan children with the virus that causes aids .
it does n't get much more grotesque than this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least it 's clear now that the death penalty will not be executed .
one can only hop that that the nurses will soon be transferred to bulgaria .
but even that 's probably also a question of money .
it 's already clear the families of the hiv-infected children will receive compensation that also partially comes from europe .
it 's safe to presume this despite the denials .
one could say that all those involved will benefit in the end .
but that 's still not certain , and even if that 's indeed the case , it still gets more complicated .
the families of the libyan victims should get any help that 's possible , but one should n't overlook the fact that the fate of the nurses is still unknown and that they spent eight years - presumably innocent - in prison .
reports by international experts documented their innocence in a credible way .
according to them , a lack of hygiene in the hospital was responsible for the infections .
it 's obvious why these reports were ignored .
no libyan judge could reach a verdict that would blame the state health care system - and indirectly the ruling class below dictator moammar gadhafi - for the hiv infections of more than 400 children .
that 's why they searched for a way to save face - and simply blamed foreign nurses and physicians .
gadhafi knows exactly who much the europeans need him and his country .
libya is not only gradually opening up to western markets and possesses large oil reserves , the country is also needed by the europeans as a bastion against illegal immigration .
the west is also relieved that libya has renounced terrorism .
that 's why gadhafi thinks he can afford to take foreign medical personnel hostage for his interests .
once the foreigners are released , nothing will stand in the way of good relations with the west .
other regimes could learn a lesson from this : how to blackmail western states .

but the entire incident might lead to others blackmailing the west , says dw 's rainer sollich . the whole trial was a cynical game of blackmail with foreign hostages - and a still uncertain outcome .
the gadhafi regime tellingly did n't even consider it necessary to come up with comprehensible charges .
it would have been hard to imagine - even in many other dictatorships - that such a bizarre accusation turns into a verdict that 's upheld by several courts : the death penalty for foreign medical personnel accused of - deliberately - infecting more than 400 libyan children with the virus that causes aids .
it does n't get much more grotesque than this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least it 's clear now that the death penalty will not be executed .
one can only hop that that the nurses will soon be transferred to bulgaria .
but even that 's probably also a question of money .
it 's already clear the families of the hiv-infected children will receive compensation that also partially comes from europe .
it 's safe to presume this despite the denials .
one could say that all those involved will benefit in the end .
but that 's still not certain , and even if that 's indeed the case , it still gets more complicated .
the families of the libyan victims should get any help that 's possible , but one should n't overlook the fact that the fate of the nurses is still unknown and that they spent eight years - presumably innocent - in prison .
reports by international experts documented their innocence in a credible way .
according to them , a lack of hygiene in the hospital was responsible for the infections .
it 's obvious why these reports were ignored .
no libyan judge could reach a verdict that would blame the state health care system - and indirectly the ruling class below dictator moammar gadhafi - for the hiv infections of more than 400 children .
that 's why they searched for a way to save face - and simply blamed foreign nurses and physicians .
gadhafi knows exactly who much the europeans need him and his country .
libya is not only gradually opening up to western markets and possesses large oil reserves , the country is also needed by the europeans as a bastion against illegal immigration .
the west is also relieved that libya has renounced terrorism .
that 's why gadhafi thinks he can afford to take foreign medical personnel hostage for his interests .
once the foreigners are released , nothing will stand in the way of good relations with the west .
other regimes could learn a lesson from this : how to blackmail western states .

government leaders meanwhile mulled the future of atomic energy . vattenfall europe ceo klaus rauscher offered his resignation on wednesday after the brunsbüttel nuclear power plant had to be shut off for the third time in three weeks because of problems .
" rauscher explained that it can not be denied that the events of the past few weeks have tarnished the image of vattenfall europe , " read a statement released by vattenfall 's supervisory board chief , lars g. josefsson .
" errors have been made for which he , as head of vattenfall europe , must bear responsibility . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krümmel nuclear plant is still not back in operation a fire in the company 's nearby krümmel nuclear power plant in june had started a series of problems that led to the firing of vattenfall europe 's nuclear energy chief , bruno thomauske , on monday .
gradual disclosures since june 28 , when electrical defects shut down the company 's reactors at krümmel and brunsbüttel near hamburg , have revealed that staff at krümmel were in crisis as a fire raged in a transformer .
neither reactor was damaged and no radioactivity was released , but vattenfall - and the whole nuclear industry in germany - suffered a public relations disaster .
the company said it was commissioning an independent inquiry by scientists and business experts with a budget of 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6.8 million -rrb- to examine exactly what went wrong .

" what 's definite is that the reactors in operation are as safe as is humanly possible , " glos told german public television zdf .
" on this point , we in germany are ahead " , the minister said .
glos also added that said that the safety of the power stations had nothing to do with their age .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel on the other hand had called for the oldest plants , which began operating in the early 1970s , to be shut down .
in return , the remaining operation time on these plants could be transferred to younger plants , but energy providers are not keen on doing so as the old ones operate much more profitably .
merkel has no pity chancellor angela merkel , who has in the past supported a rethink of germany 's planned nuclear energy phase-out , said wednesday that she could understand the public 's concerns and its criticism of the nuclear industry .
" my pity for the industry is limited , " she said , adding that she found vattenfall 's information policy " totally unacceptable .

government leaders meanwhile mulled the future of atomic energy . vattenfall europe ceo klaus rauscher offered his resignation on wednesday after the brunsbüttel nuclear power plant had to be shut off for the third time in three weeks because of problems .
" rauscher explained that it can not be denied that the events of the past few weeks have tarnished the image of vattenfall europe , " read a statement released by vattenfall 's supervisory board chief , lars g. josefsson .
" errors have been made for which he , as head of vattenfall europe , must bear responsibility . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krümmel nuclear plant is still not back in operation a fire in the company 's nearby krümmel nuclear power plant in june had started a series of problems that led to the firing of vattenfall europe 's nuclear energy chief , bruno thomauske , on monday .
gradual disclosures since june 28 , when electrical defects shut down the company 's reactors at krümmel and brunsbüttel near hamburg , have revealed that staff at krümmel were in crisis as a fire raged in a transformer .
neither reactor was damaged and no radioactivity was released , but vattenfall - and the whole nuclear industry in germany - suffered a public relations disaster .

" on this point , we in germany are ahead " , the minister said .
glos also added that said that the safety of the power stations had nothing to do with their age .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel on the other hand had called for the oldest plants , which began operating in the early 1970s , to be shut down .
in return , the remaining operation time on these plants could be transferred to younger plants , but energy providers are not keen on doing so as the old ones operate much more profitably .

" you ca n't wait until the tour is over , " brender said .
" that 's impossible .
the tour is under constant doping suspicion . "
the german cycling federation had said earlier wednesday that cyclist patrik sinkewitz tested positive for the steroid testosterone at an out-of-competition test on june 8 , ahead of the tour de france . sinkewitz faces a two-year ban from competitive cycling if found guilty of a doping offence . peter kaadtmann , the ard and zdf team chief at the tour , was quoted as saying that " our contract stated that we broadcast the tour as a competition of clean riders , not of people using doping substances . " viewers had to turn elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrik sinkewitz instead of broadcasting the day 's 10th stage , ard ran a feature on doping and interviewed all parties involved .
that program was followed by a telenovela . the two networks also terminated their internet live-ticker of the event . germans who wanted to follow the race had to resort to the eurosport network and its german-language broadcast after the decision . doping has never before prompted german networks to pull the plug on a planned broadcast . but zdf did not broadcast the 1985 european cup final after rioting liverpool fans caused the death of 37 mainly juventus fans ahead of the match between the two sides in brussels ' heysel stadium . ard and zdf , who are funded by fees from every german who owns a tv set , have long held the german tour de france broadcast rights .
no figures have been released but they are worth several million euros . they planned to broadcast a total 90 hours from the three-week tour which ends on july 29 in paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans missed jan ullrich at last year 's tour ratings surged when jan ullrich won the tour in 1997 and came second several times afterwards , but there were always critical voices over the big engagement because the sport was doping-infested . under pressure ard was under special pressure as the network was a sponsor of the telekom team , which is now called t-mobile , from 1998 until 2004 . the networks have become cautious in the past 12 months since ullrich was heavily implicated in the spanish doping probe centering on doctor eufemiano fuentes . ullrich was kicked out of t-mobile on the eve of the 2006 tour . in recent weeks , half a dozen former riders including 1996 tour champion bjarne riss confessed to doping on the team in the 1990s . two team doctors were kicked out in may after admitting to have been actively involved in that doping scheme , t-mobile 's ukrainian rider serhiy honchar was also fired in may over reportedly suspicious test results , and german rider matthias kessler from the astana team was recently caught for testosterone abuse . warned ahead of time ard and zdf told german cycling teams ahead of the tour de france that they could pull the plug if another rider was caught , and sinkewitz ' positive test for testosterone was announced wednesday . bildunterschrift : germany 's gerdemann won the 7th stage last saturday sinkewitz was caught at an out-of-competition test ahead of the tour , but rode in the tour until withdrawing injured on monday . " we talked to the german teams , told them how serious the situation was , " said ard programme director günter struve .
" t-mobile in particular swore that everything was fine with them . " t-mobile has introduced one of the stiffest anti-doping programs in the sport , but not even that may have stopped sinkewitz from tampering . the tv boycott could now also play a major role in sponsor commitments in cycling , with t-mobile company spokesman christian frommert " not ruling out anything " when the tour is assessed . t-mobile only recently committed itself until 2010 . frommert admitted that " the stakes are high " after the move by the networks , while brender said he hoped that wednesday 's move will prompt the teams , and cycling in general , into more action . " i hope we have done our share in this , " said brender . deutsche welle belongs to the ard network . article based on wire reports -lrb- als / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" all kinds of nazi incendiary writings have been published in a scientific format , except for ' mein kampf , " ' said möller , a history professor at munich university .
" in my opinion , it 's not justifiable to prohibit this for a single document out of fear that it might have a negative , symbolic effect . "
copyright issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's book was on display at a book fair in tehran in 2006 bavaria 's finance ministry , which holds the copyright to " mein kampf , " has so far refused to permit publication of the book .
while it has been published abroad after 1945 , it is only available for scientific research within germany .
in the interview , möller said that he had recently discussed the issue with bavarian finance minister kurt falthauser , who had declined to give permission .
möller also said that officials at germany 's foreign ministry , where möller 's publicly funded institute also has an office , had advised against publication , saying that it could have a negative effect for germany abroad .
but the copyright is running out in 2015 and möller said he expected many to try and make a quick buck with a sensationalist publication of the book .
his institute , on the other hand , has the resources and expertise to produce an edition that wo n't be easily abused by neo-nazis for propaganda purposes , möller said .
a need for disillusionment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : möller says that " mein kampf " should be published in an annotated edition just like other nazi writings " the book is badly written , it 's put together from all kinds of different sources and consists of many incendiary tirades , " möller said , adding that the book still deserved scientific attention as a key document of the national-socialist regime .
" as long as a carefully annotated edition of ' mein kampf ' does n't exist , the simple-minded speculations about the book 's contents wo n't end . "
mein kampf sets out hitler 's claim that " aryans " were the founders of human culture and jews its spoilers as well as his denunciation of " inferior races " and call to seize lebensraum or territory in eastern europe . prohibiting publication beyond 2015 bavarian finance ministry officials meanwhile said that publication of a sensationalist edition of " mein kampf " would still be illegal after the copyright expires as german law prohibits the distribution of national-socialist propaganda . they also said that the bavarian government feels a responsibility towards protecting holocaust victims against a new publication of the book - including an annotated version as suggested by möller . " considering that bavaria 's strict stance ... is welcomed and supported both domestically and abroad , permission to reprint ' mein kampf ' still can not be considered , " reads a statement from the ministry . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for 10 years , his testimonies , in exchange for his freedom , have helped police crack down on organized crime . if the three italians on trial in düsseldorf for cocaine-trafficking are found guilty , it won ’ t be the first time that evidence supplied by mobster-turned-police informant basile puts suspected mafiosi behind bars .
before he was even 40 , the man they called " angel face " had murdered up to 30 people . after being arrested in the allgäu region of southern germany in 1998 , he was allowed to go free .
in return for his new life in a witness protection program , he has helped police lock up over 50 criminals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mafia hotbed corleone in sicily now 47 , basile , who will testify wednesday via video from a secret location in italy , was once one of the most redoubtable top dogs within the carelli clan , which belongs to calabria 's notorious ' ndrangheta .
among the most powerful and ruthless mafia-like organizations in italy , ' ndrangheta cells are loosely based on blood relationships .
the organization is believed to rake in some $ 30 billion -lrb- 22 billion euros -rrb- annually , mostly from illegal narcotics , but also from ostensibly legal businesses such as construction , restaurants and supermarkets .
allegedly , it is also involved in counterfeiting , gambling , fraud , theft , labor racketeering , loan sharking , people smuggling and kidnapping .
the ' ndrangheta ‘ s family ties are believed to be closer and their vows of silence more strictly observed than other mafia clans , such as cosa nostra and camorra .
so when giorgio basile decided to break them , it marked a watershed in germany 's fight against the mafia .
becoming numero uno bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlon brando as don corleone in " the godfather " with all the ingredients of a classic " godfather " film , it comes as no surprise that basile 's story has attracted the attention of a munich film company which has worked in the past with german star movie director oliver hirschbiegel -lrb- the downfall -rrb- .
born in corigliano calabro in 1960 , giorgio moved one year later to mühlheim an der ruhr in germany , where his father made a living as a " guest worker . "
in 1966 , his parents separated when his father realized his mother was having an affair .
her lover was antonio de cicco , local boss of the ' ndrangheta in corigliano and every bit the latin stereotype in his sharp suits with slicked-back hair and gold chains .
giorgio spent two years in italy with his new family , but returned to germany when his mother got pregnant .
he lost touch with his adopted father until 1979 , when at the age of 19 , giorgio was persuaded by de cicco to leave the dull , industrial trappings of western germany and work as his driver back in corigliano .
as a fledgling ' ndrinu , he enjoyed the attention his association with de cicco afforded him and soon became versed in the ways of the clan .
but when he discovered his adopted father had been abusing his sister , he resolved to avenge her .
in 1973 , he made his first killing , when he murdered de cicco .
by now , he was one of the most powerful cocaine dealers in tuscany , and a recognized uomo d ' onore -lrb- man of honor -rrb- .
it was during these years that he met his wife , who bore him a daughter .
he extended the business further afield , and in the 1980s , played a key role in building up mafia influence in germany .
betrayed by the organization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mafia boss giuseppe bellocco was arrested in calabria on tuesday arrested in 1998 , he opted to break the omertà , the mafia ‘ s " code of silence " .
within mafia culture , this made him a " stool pigeon " - a violation punishable by death .
according to andreas ulrich , author of " angel face , " a biography of giorgio basile , he agreed to name names because " he felt betrayed by the organization . "
" it never comes good on its promises , " he said .
" it lures young men with promises of power , money and women .
it uses them , then kills them as though they were ants . "
basile has said he lives with the knowledge that the mafia will hunt him down and kill him .
" the mafia bosses are behind bars because of what i did , " he told ulrich .
" they can ‘ t do anything to me any more , but their sons will avenge them . "
eighteen months ago , he told the online version of german news magazine der spiegel that the mafia 's influence was stronger than ever .
" the mafia will continue to expand , " he said .
" the enlarged europe will allow it to spread even further .
for someone with the same criminal energy as i had , it 's even easier in germany than it is in italy .
you can get away with anything . "
basile said the german authorities had failed to recognize the extent of the criminal energy that exists within the underground italian community .
" i couldn ’ t put a figure to it , but germany is home to many sleepers .
go in to any pizzeria and you might find the cook is a hitman just waiting for a call , " he said .
the mob in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giorgio basile the extent of mob influence is definitely underestimated in germany , said mafia expert jürgen roth .
" when berlusconi was in power there was very little information coming out of italy , " he explained .
" the mafia took the opportunity to get a foothold in germany . there is now barely any knowledge of the mafia 's criminal structures here .
it is active mainly in the area of money laundering , drug and weapons trading , protection racketeering and prostitution . "
while the biggest ' ndrangheta presence is in eastern german states such as thuringia and saxony , roth says cosa nostra actually has a higher profile in baden-württemberg .
earlier this month , italy ’ s leading mafia hunter , piero grasso , warned germany in the neue osnabrücker zeitung daily that the mob was even beginning to penetrate legitimate business circles in germany .
" the size and profit potential of german markets , as well as german law , makes the country highly attractive to organized criminals , " he said .

german and other european leaders have welcomed us president george w. bush 's new middle east initiative calling for an international conference to explore ways of creating a palestinian state . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said germany supported the goal of laying the foundation for " a successful palestinian state " with which peace talks could be conducted .
a two-state solution in the middle east needs a viable palestinian state with an effective government , solid finances , a functioning economy and a society based on law and justice , he said .
ulrich said former british prime minister tony blair had an important role to play as the representative of the mideast quartet , which is made up of the united nations , the european union , the united states and russia .
the quartet is expected to meet in lisbon , portugal , on thursday .
blair was picked last month by the quartet to help the palestinians build up their institutions and promote international political and economic support .

bush announced $ 190 million -lrb- 137.8 million euros -rrb- in direct aid to the palestinian government led by prime minister-designate salam fayyad and $ 80 million for security .

but perhaps his finest hour came on the political stage in 1989 . masur was born on july 18 , 1927 in what is now the city of brzeg in poland .
the son of an engineer , he taught himself piano as a young child and quickly specialized in conducting - despite suffering from a nervous stutter . in 1970 , masur became kapellmeister at leipzig 's gewandhaus orchestra - the musical ensemble with which he remains most closely associated .
he stayed in the post for 27 years , putting the orchestra back on the international map and presiding over the building of a new concert hall to replace the former one that had been badly damaged by allied bombing during world war ii . in leipzig , masur established an international reputation as a sensitive and innovative interpreter of the classical and romantic repertoire - and specifically mendelssohn , brahms and tchaikovsky . a master of the requiem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of leipzigers protested every monday in 1989 his best-known recording came in 1982 with an interpretation of richard strauss 's " four last songs . "
masur drastically slowed the tempi to create expressive space for soprano jessye norman 's booming , gospel-tinged voice , turning what is often a quiet meditation on impending mortality into a hike through a particularly lush cemetery . decried by some as sluggish bombast , the recording is still in print after 25 years and regularly shows up on classical-music critics ' " best-of " lists . masur has also wielded the baton for new york and london philharmonic orchestras .
despite plans to scale back his activities , he continues to be one of the world 's most sought after and active conductors . calls for non-violence bildunterschrift : masur publicly came out in support of the demonstrators masur declined offers to leave east germany through much of his career and enjoyed cordial relations with former gdr leader erich honecker .
but he never joined the communist party . in 1989 , amidst growing anti-government protests in leipzig , masur criticized violence by riot police against the demonstrators .
on oct .
9 of that year , he read a public appeal for freedom of discussion in the socialist state - an act widely regarded as helping convince leipzig police to disregard orders from berlin and allow the weekly " monday protests " to continue . " in the same century that saw two world wars , i was witness to a peaceful revolution , " masur told the dpa news agency .
" no television cameras captured the entire drama of what happened on that night in leipzig . " a musical and political icon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masur says , for him , music is a passion , not a career in 1990 , after the fall of the berlin wall and the reunification of germany , masur was sometimes mentioned as a possible candidate for the german presidency , but he demurred , saying he was a musician , not a politician .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 18.07.2007 opinion : gadhafi 's cynical game of blackmail großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans may breathe a sigh of relief that libya has commuted the death sentences of bulgarian nurses .
but the entire incident might lead to others blackmailing the west , says dw 's rainer sollich . the whole trial was a cynical game of blackmail with foreign hostages - and a still uncertain outcome .
the gadhafi regime tellingly did n't even consider it necessary to come up with comprehensible charges .
it would have been hard to imagine - even in many other dictatorships - that such a bizarre accusation turns into a verdict that 's upheld by several courts : the death penalty for foreign medical personnel accused of - deliberately - infecting more than 400 libyan children with the virus that causes aids .
it does n't get much more grotesque than this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least it 's clear now that the death penalty will not be executed .
one can only hop that that the nurses will soon be transferred to bulgaria .
but even that 's probably also a question of money .
it 's already clear the families of the hiv-infected children will receive compensation that also partially comes from europe .
it 's safe to presume this despite the denials .
one could say that all those involved will benefit in the end .
but that 's still not certain , and even if that 's indeed the case , it still gets more complicated .
the families of the libyan victims should get any help that 's possible , but one should n't overlook the fact that the fate of the nurses is still unknown and that they spent eight years - presumably innocent - in prison .
reports by international experts documented their innocence in a credible way .
according to them , a lack of hygiene in the hospital was responsible for the infections .
it 's obvious why these reports were ignored .
no libyan judge could reach a verdict that would blame the state health care system - and indirectly the ruling class below dictator moammar gadhafi - for the hiv infections of more than 400 children .
that 's why they searched for a way to save face - and simply blamed foreign nurses and physicians .
gadhafi knows exactly who much the europeans need him and his country .
libya is not only gradually opening up to western markets and possesses large oil reserves , the country is also needed by the europeans as a bastion against illegal immigration .
the west is also relieved that libya has renounced terrorism .
that 's why gadhafi thinks he can afford to take foreign medical personnel hostage for his interests .
once the foreigners are released , nothing will stand in the way of good relations with the west .
other regimes could learn a lesson from this : how to blackmail western states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 18.07.2007 opinion : gadhafi 's cynical game of blackmail großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans may breathe a sigh of relief that libya has commuted the death sentences of bulgarian nurses .
but the entire incident might lead to others blackmailing the west , says dw 's rainer sollich . the whole trial was a cynical game of blackmail with foreign hostages - and a still uncertain outcome .
the gadhafi regime tellingly did n't even consider it necessary to come up with comprehensible charges .
it would have been hard to imagine - even in many other dictatorships - that such a bizarre accusation turns into a verdict that 's upheld by several courts : the death penalty for foreign medical personnel accused of - deliberately - infecting more than 400 libyan children with the virus that causes aids .
it does n't get much more grotesque than this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least it 's clear now that the death penalty will not be executed .
one can only hop that that the nurses will soon be transferred to bulgaria .
but even that 's probably also a question of money .
it 's already clear the families of the hiv-infected children will receive compensation that also partially comes from europe .
it 's safe to presume this despite the denials .
one could say that all those involved will benefit in the end .
but that 's still not certain , and even if that 's indeed the case , it still gets more complicated .
the families of the libyan victims should get any help that 's possible , but one should n't overlook the fact that the fate of the nurses is still unknown and that they spent eight years - presumably innocent - in prison .
reports by international experts documented their innocence in a credible way .
according to them , a lack of hygiene in the hospital was responsible for the infections .
it 's obvious why these reports were ignored .
no libyan judge could reach a verdict that would blame the state health care system - and indirectly the ruling class below dictator moammar gadhafi - for the hiv infections of more than 400 children .
that 's why they searched for a way to save face - and simply blamed foreign nurses and physicians .
gadhafi knows exactly who much the europeans need him and his country .
libya is not only gradually opening up to western markets and possesses large oil reserves , the country is also needed by the europeans as a bastion against illegal immigration .
the west is also relieved that libya has renounced terrorism .
that 's why gadhafi thinks he can afford to take foreign medical personnel hostage for his interests .
once the foreigners are released , nothing will stand in the way of good relations with the west .
other regimes could learn a lesson from this : how to blackmail western states .

" you ca n't wait until the tour is over , " brender said .
" that 's impossible .
the tour is under constant doping suspicion . "
the german cycling federation had said earlier wednesday that cyclist patrik sinkewitz tested positive for the steroid testosterone at an out-of-competition test on june 8 , ahead of the tour de france . sinkewitz faces a two-year ban from competitive cycling if found guilty of a doping offence . peter kaadtmann , the ard and zdf team chief at the tour , was quoted as saying that " our contract stated that we broadcast the tour as a competition of clean riders , not of people using doping substances . " viewers had to turn elsewhere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrik sinkewitz instead of broadcasting the day 's 10th stage , ard ran a feature on doping and interviewed all parties involved .
that program was followed by a telenovela . the two networks also terminated their internet live-ticker of the event . germans who wanted to follow the race had to resort to the eurosport network and its german-language broadcast after the decision . doping has never before prompted german networks to pull the plug on a planned broadcast . but zdf did not broadcast the 1985 european cup final after rioting liverpool fans caused the death of 37 mainly juventus fans ahead of the match between the two sides in brussels ' heysel stadium . ard and zdf , who are funded by fees from every german who owns a tv set , have long held the german tour de france broadcast rights .

" we talked to the german teams , told them how serious the situation was , " said ard programme director günter struve .
" t-mobile in particular swore that everything was fine with them .

no figures have been released but they are worth several million euros . they planned to broadcast a total 90 hours from the three-week tour which ends on july 29 in paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans missed jan ullrich at last year 's tour ratings surged when jan ullrich won the tour in 1997 and came second several times afterwards , but there were always critical voices over the big engagement because the sport was doping-infested . under pressure ard was under special pressure as the network was a sponsor of the telekom team , which is now called t-mobile , from 1998 until 2004 . the networks have become cautious in the past 12 months since ullrich was heavily implicated in the spanish doping probe centering on doctor eufemiano fuentes . ullrich was kicked out of t-mobile on the eve of the 2006 tour . in recent weeks , half a dozen former riders including 1996 tour champion bjarne riss confessed to doping on the team in the 1990s . two team doctors were kicked out in may after admitting to have been actively involved in that doping scheme , t-mobile 's ukrainian rider serhiy honchar was also fired in may over reportedly suspicious test results , and german rider matthias kessler from the astana team was recently caught for testosterone abuse . warned ahead of time ard and zdf told german cycling teams ahead of the tour de france that they could pull the plug if another rider was caught , and sinkewitz ' positive test for testosterone was announced wednesday . bildunterschrift : germany 's gerdemann won the 7th stage last saturday sinkewitz was caught at an out-of-competition test ahead of the tour , but rode in the tour until withdrawing injured on monday . " we talked to the german teams , told them how serious the situation was , " said ard programme director günter struve .
" t-mobile in particular swore that everything was fine with them . " t-mobile has introduced one of the stiffest anti-doping programs in the sport , but not even that may have stopped sinkewitz from tampering . the tv boycott could now also play a major role in sponsor commitments in cycling , with t-mobile company spokesman christian frommert " not ruling out anything " when the tour is assessed . t-mobile only recently committed itself until 2010 . frommert admitted that " the stakes are high " after the move by the networks , while brender said he hoped that wednesday 's move will prompt the teams , and cycling in general , into more action . " i hope we have done our share in this , " said brender . deutsche welle belongs to the ard network . article based on wire reports -lrb- als / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" all kinds of nazi incendiary writings have been published in a scientific format , except for ' mein kampf , " ' said möller , a history professor at munich university .
" in my opinion , it 's not justifiable to prohibit this for a single document out of fear that it might have a negative , symbolic effect . "
copyright issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's book was on display at a book fair in tehran in 2006 bavaria 's finance ministry , which holds the copyright to " mein kampf , " has so far refused to permit publication of the book .
while it has been published abroad after 1945 , it is only available for scientific research within germany .
in the interview , möller said that he had recently discussed the issue with bavarian finance minister kurt falthauser , who had declined to give permission .
möller also said that officials at germany 's foreign ministry , where möller 's publicly funded institute also has an office , had advised against publication , saying that it could have a negative effect for germany abroad .
but the copyright is running out in 2015 and möller said he expected many to try and make a quick buck with a sensationalist publication of the book .
his institute , on the other hand , has the resources and expertise to produce an edition that wo n't be easily abused by neo-nazis for propaganda purposes , möller said .
a need for disillusionment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : möller says that " mein kampf " should be published in an annotated edition just like other nazi writings " the book is badly written , it 's put together from all kinds of different sources and consists of many incendiary tirades , " möller said , adding that the book still deserved scientific attention as a key document of the national-socialist regime .
" as long as a carefully annotated edition of ' mein kampf ' does n't exist , the simple-minded speculations about the book 's contents wo n't end . "
mein kampf sets out hitler 's claim that " aryans " were the founders of human culture and jews its spoilers as well as his denunciation of " inferior races " and call to seize lebensraum or territory in eastern europe . prohibiting publication beyond 2015 bavarian finance ministry officials meanwhile said that publication of a sensationalist edition of " mein kampf " would still be illegal after the copyright expires as german law prohibits the distribution of national-socialist propaganda . they also said that the bavarian government feels a responsibility towards protecting holocaust victims against a new publication of the book - including an annotated version as suggested by möller . " considering that bavaria 's strict stance ... is welcomed and supported both domestically and abroad , permission to reprint ' mein kampf ' still can not be considered , " reads a statement from the ministry . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" all kinds of nazi incendiary writings have been published in a scientific format , except for ' mein kampf , " ' said möller , a history professor at munich university .
" in my opinion , it 's not justifiable to prohibit this for a single document out of fear that it might have a negative , symbolic effect . "
copyright issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's book was on display at a book fair in tehran in 2006 bavaria 's finance ministry , which holds the copyright to " mein kampf , " has so far refused to permit publication of the book .
while it has been published abroad after 1945 , it is only available for scientific research within germany .
in the interview , möller said that he had recently discussed the issue with bavarian finance minister kurt falthauser , who had declined to give permission .
möller also said that officials at germany 's foreign ministry , where möller 's publicly funded institute also has an office , had advised against publication , saying that it could have a negative effect for germany abroad .
but the copyright is running out in 2015 and möller said he expected many to try and make a quick buck with a sensationalist publication of the book .
his institute , on the other hand , has the resources and expertise to produce an edition that wo n't be easily abused by neo-nazis for propaganda purposes , möller said .
a need for disillusionment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : möller says that " mein kampf " should be published in an annotated edition just like other nazi writings " the book is badly written , it 's put together from all kinds of different sources and consists of many incendiary tirades , " möller said , adding that the book still deserved scientific attention as a key document of the national-socialist regime .
" as long as a carefully annotated edition of ' mein kampf ' does n't exist , the simple-minded speculations about the book 's contents wo n't end . "
mein kampf sets out hitler 's claim that " aryans " were the founders of human culture and jews its spoilers as well as his denunciation of " inferior races " and call to seize lebensraum or territory in eastern europe . prohibiting publication beyond 2015 bavarian finance ministry officials meanwhile said that publication of a sensationalist edition of " mein kampf " would still be illegal after the copyright expires as german law prohibits the distribution of national-socialist propaganda . they also said that the bavarian government feels a responsibility towards protecting holocaust victims against a new publication of the book - including an annotated version as suggested by möller . " considering that bavaria 's strict stance ... is welcomed and supported both domestically and abroad , permission to reprint ' mein kampf ' still can not be considered , " reads a statement from the ministry . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" all kinds of nazi incendiary writings have been published in a scientific format , except for ' mein kampf , " ' said möller , a history professor at munich university .
" in my opinion , it 's not justifiable to prohibit this for a single document out of fear that it might have a negative , symbolic effect . "

while it has been published abroad after 1945 , it is only available for scientific research within germany .
in the interview , möller said that he had recently discussed the issue with bavarian finance minister kurt falthauser , who had declined to give permission .
möller also said that officials at germany 's foreign ministry , where möller 's publicly funded institute also has an office , had advised against publication , saying that it could have a negative effect for germany abroad .
but the copyright is running out in 2015 and möller said he expected many to try and make a quick buck with a sensationalist publication of the book .

" as long as a carefully annotated edition of ' mein kampf ' does n't exist , the simple-minded speculations about the book 's contents wo n't end . "
mein kampf sets out hitler 's claim that " aryans " were the founders of human culture and jews its spoilers as well as his denunciation of " inferior races " and call to seize lebensraum or territory in eastern europe . prohibiting publication beyond 2015 bavarian finance ministry officials meanwhile said that publication of a sensationalist edition of " mein kampf " would still be illegal after the copyright expires as german law prohibits the distribution of national-socialist propaganda . they also said that the bavarian government feels a responsibility towards protecting holocaust victims against a new publication of the book - including an annotated version as suggested by möller .

" all kinds of nazi incendiary writings have been published in a scientific format , except for ' mein kampf , " ' said möller , a history professor at munich university .
" in my opinion , it 's not justifiable to prohibit this for a single document out of fear that it might have a negative , symbolic effect . "
copyright issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's book was on display at a book fair in tehran in 2006 bavaria 's finance ministry , which holds the copyright to " mein kampf , " has so far refused to permit publication of the book .
while it has been published abroad after 1945 , it is only available for scientific research within germany .
in the interview , möller said that he had recently discussed the issue with bavarian finance minister kurt falthauser , who had declined to give permission .
möller also said that officials at germany 's foreign ministry , where möller 's publicly funded institute also has an office , had advised against publication , saying that it could have a negative effect for germany abroad .
but the copyright is running out in 2015 and möller said he expected many to try and make a quick buck with a sensationalist publication of the book .
his institute , on the other hand , has the resources and expertise to produce an edition that wo n't be easily abused by neo-nazis for propaganda purposes , möller said .
a need for disillusionment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : möller says that " mein kampf " should be published in an annotated edition just like other nazi writings " the book is badly written , it 's put together from all kinds of different sources and consists of many incendiary tirades , " möller said , adding that the book still deserved scientific attention as a key document of the national-socialist regime .
" as long as a carefully annotated edition of ' mein kampf ' does n't exist , the simple-minded speculations about the book 's contents wo n't end . "
mein kampf sets out hitler 's claim that " aryans " were the founders of human culture and jews its spoilers as well as his denunciation of " inferior races " and call to seize lebensraum or territory in eastern europe . prohibiting publication beyond 2015 bavarian finance ministry officials meanwhile said that publication of a sensationalist edition of " mein kampf " would still be illegal after the copyright expires as german law prohibits the distribution of national-socialist propaganda . they also said that the bavarian government feels a responsibility towards protecting holocaust victims against a new publication of the book - including an annotated version as suggested by möller . " considering that bavaria 's strict stance ... is welcomed and supported both domestically and abroad , permission to reprint ' mein kampf ' still can not be considered , " reads a statement from the ministry . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for 10 years , his testimonies , in exchange for his freedom , have helped police crack down on organized crime . if the three italians on trial in düsseldorf for cocaine-trafficking are found guilty , it won ’ t be the first time that evidence supplied by mobster-turned-police informant basile puts suspected mafiosi behind bars .
before he was even 40 , the man they called " angel face " had murdered up to 30 people . after being arrested in the allgäu region of southern germany in 1998 , he was allowed to go free .
in return for his new life in a witness protection program , he has helped police lock up over 50 criminals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mafia hotbed corleone in sicily now 47 , basile , who will testify wednesday via video from a secret location in italy , was once one of the most redoubtable top dogs within the carelli clan , which belongs to calabria 's notorious ' ndrangheta .
among the most powerful and ruthless mafia-like organizations in italy , ' ndrangheta cells are loosely based on blood relationships .
the organization is believed to rake in some $ 30 billion -lrb- 22 billion euros -rrb- annually , mostly from illegal narcotics , but also from ostensibly legal businesses such as construction , restaurants and supermarkets .
allegedly , it is also involved in counterfeiting , gambling , fraud , theft , labor racketeering , loan sharking , people smuggling and kidnapping .
the ' ndrangheta ‘ s family ties are believed to be closer and their vows of silence more strictly observed than other mafia clans , such as cosa nostra and camorra .
so when giorgio basile decided to break them , it marked a watershed in germany 's fight against the mafia .
becoming numero uno bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlon brando as don corleone in " the godfather " with all the ingredients of a classic " godfather " film , it comes as no surprise that basile 's story has attracted the attention of a munich film company which has worked in the past with german star movie director oliver hirschbiegel -lrb- the downfall -rrb- .
born in corigliano calabro in 1960 , giorgio moved one year later to mühlheim an der ruhr in germany , where his father made a living as a " guest worker . "
in 1966 , his parents separated when his father realized his mother was having an affair .
her lover was antonio de cicco , local boss of the ' ndrangheta in corigliano and every bit the latin stereotype in his sharp suits with slicked-back hair and gold chains .
giorgio spent two years in italy with his new family , but returned to germany when his mother got pregnant .
he lost touch with his adopted father until 1979 , when at the age of 19 , giorgio was persuaded by de cicco to leave the dull , industrial trappings of western germany and work as his driver back in corigliano .
as a fledgling ' ndrinu , he enjoyed the attention his association with de cicco afforded him and soon became versed in the ways of the clan .
but when he discovered his adopted father had been abusing his sister , he resolved to avenge her .
in 1973 , he made his first killing , when he murdered de cicco .
by now , he was one of the most powerful cocaine dealers in tuscany , and a recognized uomo d ' onore -lrb- man of honor -rrb- .
it was during these years that he met his wife , who bore him a daughter .
he extended the business further afield , and in the 1980s , played a key role in building up mafia influence in germany .
betrayed by the organization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mafia boss giuseppe bellocco was arrested in calabria on tuesday arrested in 1998 , he opted to break the omertà , the mafia ‘ s " code of silence " .
within mafia culture , this made him a " stool pigeon " - a violation punishable by death .
according to andreas ulrich , author of " angel face , " a biography of giorgio basile , he agreed to name names because " he felt betrayed by the organization . "
" it never comes good on its promises , " he said .
" it lures young men with promises of power , money and women .
it uses them , then kills them as though they were ants . "
basile has said he lives with the knowledge that the mafia will hunt him down and kill him .
" the mafia bosses are behind bars because of what i did , " he told ulrich .
" they can ‘ t do anything to me any more , but their sons will avenge them . "
eighteen months ago , he told the online version of german news magazine der spiegel that the mafia 's influence was stronger than ever .
" the mafia will continue to expand , " he said .
" the enlarged europe will allow it to spread even further .
for someone with the same criminal energy as i had , it 's even easier in germany than it is in italy .
you can get away with anything . "
basile said the german authorities had failed to recognize the extent of the criminal energy that exists within the underground italian community .
" i couldn ’ t put a figure to it , but germany is home to many sleepers .
go in to any pizzeria and you might find the cook is a hitman just waiting for a call , " he said .
the mob in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giorgio basile the extent of mob influence is definitely underestimated in germany , said mafia expert jürgen roth .
" when berlusconi was in power there was very little information coming out of italy , " he explained .
" the mafia took the opportunity to get a foothold in germany . there is now barely any knowledge of the mafia 's criminal structures here .
it is active mainly in the area of money laundering , drug and weapons trading , protection racketeering and prostitution . "
while the biggest ' ndrangheta presence is in eastern german states such as thuringia and saxony , roth says cosa nostra actually has a higher profile in baden-württemberg .
earlier this month , italy ’ s leading mafia hunter , piero grasso , warned germany in the neue osnabrücker zeitung daily that the mob was even beginning to penetrate legitimate business circles in germany .
" the size and profit potential of german markets , as well as german law , makes the country highly attractive to organized criminals , " he said .

for 10 years , his testimonies , in exchange for his freedom , have helped police crack down on organized crime . if the three italians on trial in düsseldorf for cocaine-trafficking are found guilty , it won ’ t be the first time that evidence supplied by mobster-turned-police informant basile puts suspected mafiosi behind bars .
before he was even 40 , the man they called " angel face " had murdered up to 30 people . after being arrested in the allgäu region of southern germany in 1998 , he was allowed to go free .
in return for his new life in a witness protection program , he has helped police lock up over 50 criminals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mafia hotbed corleone in sicily now 47 , basile , who will testify wednesday via video from a secret location in italy , was once one of the most redoubtable top dogs within the carelli clan , which belongs to calabria 's notorious ' ndrangheta .
among the most powerful and ruthless mafia-like organizations in italy , ' ndrangheta cells are loosely based on blood relationships .
the organization is believed to rake in some $ 30 billion -lrb- 22 billion euros -rrb- annually , mostly from illegal narcotics , but also from ostensibly legal businesses such as construction , restaurants and supermarkets .
allegedly , it is also involved in counterfeiting , gambling , fraud , theft , labor racketeering , loan sharking , people smuggling and kidnapping .
the ' ndrangheta ‘ s family ties are believed to be closer and their vows of silence more strictly observed than other mafia clans , such as cosa nostra and camorra .
so when giorgio basile decided to break them , it marked a watershed in germany 's fight against the mafia .
becoming numero uno bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlon brando as don corleone in " the godfather " with all the ingredients of a classic " godfather " film , it comes as no surprise that basile 's story has attracted the attention of a munich film company which has worked in the past with german star movie director oliver hirschbiegel -lrb- the downfall -rrb- .
born in corigliano calabro in 1960 , giorgio moved one year later to mühlheim an der ruhr in germany , where his father made a living as a " guest worker . "
in 1966 , his parents separated when his father realized his mother was having an affair .
her lover was antonio de cicco , local boss of the ' ndrangheta in corigliano and every bit the latin stereotype in his sharp suits with slicked-back hair and gold chains .
giorgio spent two years in italy with his new family , but returned to germany when his mother got pregnant .
he lost touch with his adopted father until 1979 , when at the age of 19 , giorgio was persuaded by de cicco to leave the dull , industrial trappings of western germany and work as his driver back in corigliano .
as a fledgling ' ndrinu , he enjoyed the attention his association with de cicco afforded him and soon became versed in the ways of the clan .
but when he discovered his adopted father had been abusing his sister , he resolved to avenge her .
in 1973 , he made his first killing , when he murdered de cicco .
by now , he was one of the most powerful cocaine dealers in tuscany , and a recognized uomo d ' onore -lrb- man of honor -rrb- .
it was during these years that he met his wife , who bore him a daughter .
he extended the business further afield , and in the 1980s , played a key role in building up mafia influence in germany .
betrayed by the organization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mafia boss giuseppe bellocco was arrested in calabria on tuesday arrested in 1998 , he opted to break the omertà , the mafia ‘ s " code of silence " .
within mafia culture , this made him a " stool pigeon " - a violation punishable by death .
according to andreas ulrich , author of " angel face , " a biography of giorgio basile , he agreed to name names because " he felt betrayed by the organization . "
" it never comes good on its promises , " he said .
" it lures young men with promises of power , money and women .
it uses them , then kills them as though they were ants . "
basile has said he lives with the knowledge that the mafia will hunt him down and kill him .
" the mafia bosses are behind bars because of what i did , " he told ulrich .
" they can ‘ t do anything to me any more , but their sons will avenge them . "
eighteen months ago , he told the online version of german news magazine der spiegel that the mafia 's influence was stronger than ever .
" the mafia will continue to expand , " he said .
" the enlarged europe will allow it to spread even further .
for someone with the same criminal energy as i had , it 's even easier in germany than it is in italy .
you can get away with anything . "
basile said the german authorities had failed to recognize the extent of the criminal energy that exists within the underground italian community .
" i couldn ’ t put a figure to it , but germany is home to many sleepers .
go in to any pizzeria and you might find the cook is a hitman just waiting for a call , " he said .

government leaders meanwhile mulled the future of atomic energy . vattenfall europe ceo klaus rauscher offered his resignation on wednesday after the brunsbüttel nuclear power plant had to be shut off for the third time in three weeks because of problems .
" rauscher explained that it can not be denied that the events of the past few weeks have tarnished the image of vattenfall europe , " read a statement released by vattenfall 's supervisory board chief , lars g. josefsson .
" errors have been made for which he , as head of vattenfall europe , must bear responsibility . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krümmel nuclear plant is still not back in operation a fire in the company 's nearby krümmel nuclear power plant in june had started a series of problems that led to the firing of vattenfall europe 's nuclear energy chief , bruno thomauske , on monday .
gradual disclosures since june 28 , when electrical defects shut down the company 's reactors at krümmel and brunsbüttel near hamburg , have revealed that staff at krümmel were in crisis as a fire raged in a transformer .
neither reactor was damaged and no radioactivity was released , but vattenfall - and the whole nuclear industry in germany - suffered a public relations disaster .
the company said it was commissioning an independent inquiry by scientists and business experts with a budget of 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6.8 million -rrb- to examine exactly what went wrong .
ministers divided on what to do bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , angela merkel and michael glos -lrb- from left -rrb- german economy minister michael glos meanwhile sprang to the defense of the country 's nuclear power stations on wednesday , saying that despite the recent problems , even the oldest plants were ahead of the rest of the world in terms of security .
" what 's definite is that the reactors in operation are as safe as is humanly possible , " glos told german public television zdf .
" on this point , we in germany are ahead " , the minister said .
glos also added that said that the safety of the power stations had nothing to do with their age .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel on the other hand had called for the oldest plants , which began operating in the early 1970s , to be shut down .
in return , the remaining operation time on these plants could be transferred to younger plants , but energy providers are not keen on doing so as the old ones operate much more profitably .
merkel has no pity chancellor angela merkel , who has in the past supported a rethink of germany 's planned nuclear energy phase-out , said wednesday that she could understand the public 's concerns and its criticism of the nuclear industry .
" my pity for the industry is limited , " she said , adding that she found vattenfall 's information policy " totally unacceptable .
" after all , dramatic errors were committed , " merkel said .
but the chancellor also said that the entire industry should not be stigmatized .
" i would n't generalize , " she said .
" it must not happen again . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german and other european leaders have welcomed us president george w. bush 's new middle east initiative calling for an international conference to explore ways of creating a palestinian state . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said germany supported the goal of laying the foundation for " a successful palestinian state " with which peace talks could be conducted .
a two-state solution in the middle east needs a viable palestinian state with an effective government , solid finances , a functioning economy and a society based on law and justice , he said .
ulrich said former british prime minister tony blair had an important role to play as the representative of the mideast quartet , which is made up of the united nations , the european union , the united states and russia .
the quartet is expected to meet in lisbon , portugal , on thursday .
blair was picked last month by the quartet to help the palestinians build up their institutions and promote international political and economic support .

but perhaps his finest hour came on the political stage in 1989 . masur was born on july 18 , 1927 in what is now the city of brzeg in poland .
the son of an engineer , he taught himself piano as a young child and quickly specialized in conducting - despite suffering from a nervous stutter . in 1970 , masur became kapellmeister at leipzig 's gewandhaus orchestra - the musical ensemble with which he remains most closely associated .
he stayed in the post for 27 years , putting the orchestra back on the international map and presiding over the building of a new concert hall to replace the former one that had been badly damaged by allied bombing during world war ii . in leipzig , masur established an international reputation as a sensitive and innovative interpreter of the classical and romantic repertoire - and specifically mendelssohn , brahms and tchaikovsky . a master of the requiem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of leipzigers protested every monday in 1989 his best-known recording came in 1982 with an interpretation of richard strauss 's " four last songs . "
masur drastically slowed the tempi to create expressive space for soprano jessye norman 's booming , gospel-tinged voice , turning what is often a quiet meditation on impending mortality into a hike through a particularly lush cemetery . decried by some as sluggish bombast , the recording is still in print after 25 years and regularly shows up on classical-music critics ' " best-of " lists . masur has also wielded the baton for new york and london philharmonic orchestras .
despite plans to scale back his activities , he continues to be one of the world 's most sought after and active conductors . calls for non-violence bildunterschrift : masur publicly came out in support of the demonstrators masur declined offers to leave east germany through much of his career and enjoyed cordial relations with former gdr leader erich honecker .

but perhaps his finest hour came on the political stage in 1989 . masur was born on july 18 , 1927 in what is now the city of brzeg in poland .
the son of an engineer , he taught himself piano as a young child and quickly specialized in conducting - despite suffering from a nervous stutter . in 1970 , masur became kapellmeister at leipzig 's gewandhaus orchestra - the musical ensemble with which he remains most closely associated .
he stayed in the post for 27 years , putting the orchestra back on the international map and presiding over the building of a new concert hall to replace the former one that had been badly damaged by allied bombing during world war ii . in leipzig , masur established an international reputation as a sensitive and innovative interpreter of the classical and romantic repertoire - and specifically mendelssohn , brahms and tchaikovsky . a master of the requiem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of leipzigers protested every monday in 1989 his best-known recording came in 1982 with an interpretation of richard strauss 's " four last songs . "
masur drastically slowed the tempi to create expressive space for soprano jessye norman 's booming , gospel-tinged voice , turning what is often a quiet meditation on impending mortality into a hike through a particularly lush cemetery . decried by some as sluggish bombast , the recording is still in print after 25 years and regularly shows up on classical-music critics ' " best-of " lists . masur has also wielded the baton for new york and london philharmonic orchestras .
despite plans to scale back his activities , he continues to be one of the world 's most sought after and active conductors . calls for non-violence bildunterschrift : masur publicly came out in support of the demonstrators masur declined offers to leave east germany through much of his career and enjoyed cordial relations with former gdr leader erich honecker .
but he never joined the communist party . in 1989 , amidst growing anti-government protests in leipzig , masur criticized violence by riot police against the demonstrators .
on oct .
9 of that year , he read a public appeal for freedom of discussion in the socialist state - an act widely regarded as helping convince leipzig police to disregard orders from berlin and allow the weekly " monday protests " to continue . " in the same century that saw two world wars , i was witness to a peaceful revolution , " masur told the dpa news agency .
" no television cameras captured the entire drama of what happened on that night in leipzig . " a musical and political icon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masur says , for him , music is a passion , not a career in 1990 , after the fall of the berlin wall and the reunification of germany , masur was sometimes mentioned as a possible candidate for the german presidency , but he demurred , saying he was a musician , not a politician .
in interviews since then , masur has played down his role in the " peaceful revolution " of 1989 . " i was only one among many people who overcame their fear , " he said . masur has received numerous honors from leipzig and germany for his musical achievements and personal courage . the night of july 18 has been set aside for a concert as part of the london proms with masur conducting the london philharmonic and the orchestre national de france in performances of bruckner and tchaikovsky - a fitting way for a musician who 's always close to the people to spend his eightieth birthday . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the dutch health ministry said thousands had registered to donate organs since the show aired . more than 12,000 people in the netherlands have registered as organ donors since the broadcast of " the big donorshow " on june 1 , when three contestants vied for the kidney of a dying woman .
the show was revealed to be a hoax at the end of the broadcast , with the role of the " lisa , " who was purportedly suffering from a brain tumor , being played by an actress .
the dutch television network bnn and producers endemol said they wanted to highlight the desperate need for organ donors in the netherlands , which has once of the lowest organ donation rates in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bart de graaff , in 1999 tribute to founder bnn , a channel aimed at young people , screened the show on the fifth anniversary of the death of its founder , bart de graaff .
he died after waiting seven years for a kidney donation .
the dutch health ministry released a statement this week revealing a sharp jump in the number of people joining the organ donor registry , with 43,000 forms being downloaded from its web site in the weeks after " the big donorshow " was aired .
of the 12,000 registrations in the last six weeks , 64 percent were people who had never previously been listed as organ donors .

but the entire incident might lead to others blackmailing the west , says dw 's rainer sollich . the whole trial was a cynical game of blackmail with foreign hostages - and a still uncertain outcome .
the gadhafi regime tellingly did n't even consider it necessary to come up with comprehensible charges .
it would have been hard to imagine - even in many other dictatorships - that such a bizarre accusation turns into a verdict that 's upheld by several courts : the death penalty for foreign medical personnel accused of - deliberately - infecting more than 400 libyan children with the virus that causes aids .
it does n't get much more grotesque than this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least it 's clear now that the death penalty will not be executed .
one can only hop that that the nurses will soon be transferred to bulgaria .
but even that 's probably also a question of money .
it 's already clear the families of the hiv-infected children will receive compensation that also partially comes from europe .
it 's safe to presume this despite the denials .
one could say that all those involved will benefit in the end .
but that 's still not certain , and even if that 's indeed the case , it still gets more complicated .
the families of the libyan victims should get any help that 's possible , but one should n't overlook the fact that the fate of the nurses is still unknown and that they spent eight years - presumably innocent - in prison .
reports by international experts documented their innocence in a credible way .
according to them , a lack of hygiene in the hospital was responsible for the infections .
it 's obvious why these reports were ignored .
no libyan judge could reach a verdict that would blame the state health care system - and indirectly the ruling class below dictator moammar gadhafi - for the hiv infections of more than 400 children .
that 's why they searched for a way to save face - and simply blamed foreign nurses and physicians .
gadhafi knows exactly who much the europeans need him and his country .
libya is not only gradually opening up to western markets and possesses large oil reserves , the country is also needed by the europeans as a bastion against illegal immigration .
the west is also relieved that libya has renounced terrorism .
that 's why gadhafi thinks he can afford to take foreign medical personnel hostage for his interests .
once the foreigners are released , nothing will stand in the way of good relations with the west .
other regimes could learn a lesson from this : how to blackmail western states .

but the entire incident might lead to others blackmailing the west , says dw 's rainer sollich . the whole trial was a cynical game of blackmail with foreign hostages - and a still uncertain outcome .
the gadhafi regime tellingly did n't even consider it necessary to come up with comprehensible charges .
it would have been hard to imagine - even in many other dictatorships - that such a bizarre accusation turns into a verdict that 's upheld by several courts : the death penalty for foreign medical personnel accused of - deliberately - infecting more than 400 libyan children with the virus that causes aids .
it does n't get much more grotesque than this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least it 's clear now that the death penalty will not be executed .
one can only hop that that the nurses will soon be transferred to bulgaria .
but even that 's probably also a question of money .
it 's already clear the families of the hiv-infected children will receive compensation that also partially comes from europe .
it 's safe to presume this despite the denials .
one could say that all those involved will benefit in the end .
but that 's still not certain , and even if that 's indeed the case , it still gets more complicated .
the families of the libyan victims should get any help that 's possible , but one should n't overlook the fact that the fate of the nurses is still unknown and that they spent eight years - presumably innocent - in prison .
reports by international experts documented their innocence in a credible way .
according to them , a lack of hygiene in the hospital was responsible for the infections .
it 's obvious why these reports were ignored .
no libyan judge could reach a verdict that would blame the state health care system - and indirectly the ruling class below dictator moammar gadhafi - for the hiv infections of more than 400 children .
that 's why they searched for a way to save face - and simply blamed foreign nurses and physicians .
gadhafi knows exactly who much the europeans need him and his country .
libya is not only gradually opening up to western markets and possesses large oil reserves , the country is also needed by the europeans as a bastion against illegal immigration .
the west is also relieved that libya has renounced terrorism .
that 's why gadhafi thinks he can afford to take foreign medical personnel hostage for his interests .
once the foreigners are released , nothing will stand in the way of good relations with the west .
other regimes could learn a lesson from this : how to blackmail western states .

" you ca n't wait until the tour is over , " brender said .
" that 's impossible .
the tour is under constant doping suspicion . "
the german cycling federation had said earlier wednesday that cyclist patrik sinkewitz tested positive for the steroid testosterone at an out-of-competition test on june 8 , ahead of the tour de france . sinkewitz faces a two-year ban from competitive cycling if found guilty of a doping offence . peter kaadtmann , the ard and zdf team chief at the tour , was quoted as saying that " our contract stated that we broadcast the tour as a competition of clean riders , not of people using doping substances .

government leaders meanwhile mulled the future of atomic energy . vattenfall europe ceo klaus rauscher offered his resignation on wednesday after the brunsbüttel nuclear power plant had to be shut off for the third time in three weeks because of problems .
" rauscher explained that it can not be denied that the events of the past few weeks have tarnished the image of vattenfall europe , " read a statement released by vattenfall 's supervisory board chief , lars g. josefsson .
" errors have been made for which he , as head of vattenfall europe , must bear responsibility . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krümmel nuclear plant is still not back in operation a fire in the company 's nearby krümmel nuclear power plant in june had started a series of problems that led to the firing of vattenfall europe 's nuclear energy chief , bruno thomauske , on monday .
gradual disclosures since june 28 , when electrical defects shut down the company 's reactors at krümmel and brunsbüttel near hamburg , have revealed that staff at krümmel were in crisis as a fire raged in a transformer .
neither reactor was damaged and no radioactivity was released , but vattenfall - and the whole nuclear industry in germany - suffered a public relations disaster .
the company said it was commissioning an independent inquiry by scientists and business experts with a budget of 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6.8 million -rrb- to examine exactly what went wrong .
ministers divided on what to do bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , angela merkel and michael glos -lrb- from left -rrb- german economy minister michael glos meanwhile sprang to the defense of the country 's nuclear power stations on wednesday , saying that despite the recent problems , even the oldest plants were ahead of the rest of the world in terms of security .
" what 's definite is that the reactors in operation are as safe as is humanly possible , " glos told german public television zdf .
" on this point , we in germany are ahead " , the minister said .
glos also added that said that the safety of the power stations had nothing to do with their age .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel on the other hand had called for the oldest plants , which began operating in the early 1970s , to be shut down .
in return , the remaining operation time on these plants could be transferred to younger plants , but energy providers are not keen on doing so as the old ones operate much more profitably .
merkel has no pity chancellor angela merkel , who has in the past supported a rethink of germany 's planned nuclear energy phase-out , said wednesday that she could understand the public 's concerns and its criticism of the nuclear industry .
" my pity for the industry is limited , " she said , adding that she found vattenfall 's information policy " totally unacceptable .
" after all , dramatic errors were committed , " merkel said .
but the chancellor also said that the entire industry should not be stigmatized .

german and other european leaders have welcomed us president george w. bush 's new middle east initiative calling for an international conference to explore ways of creating a palestinian state . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said germany supported the goal of laying the foundation for " a successful palestinian state " with which peace talks could be conducted .
a two-state solution in the middle east needs a viable palestinian state with an effective government , solid finances , a functioning economy and a society based on law and justice , he said .
ulrich said former british prime minister tony blair had an important role to play as the representative of the mideast quartet , which is made up of the united nations , the european union , the united states and russia .
the quartet is expected to meet in lisbon , portugal , on thursday .
blair was picked last month by the quartet to help the palestinians build up their institutions and promote international political and economic support .

bush announced $ 190 million -lrb- 137.8 million euros -rrb- in direct aid to the palestinian government led by prime minister-designate salam fayyad and $ 80 million for security .
he has sought to bolster abbas ' moderate fatah government since the beleaguered palestinian leader ousted hamas from the government after the radical group seized control of gaza .
merkel phones fayyad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister salam fayyad the german spokesman said chancellor angela merkel spoke by telephone on tuesday afternoon with fayyad and offered her support for steps taken by his government to move forward with the peace process .
fayyad briefed the chancellor on his efforts to establish an effective system of authority in the palestinian areas , particularly in the security sector , wilhelm said .
eu , britain back plan others in europe have also said they welcomed bush 's plan .
" the -lsb- bush -rsb- speech has elements that were never said before , " said the eu 's foreign and security policy chief javier solana , adding that the 27-nation bloc would work side by side with the us in a determined effort to bring about an end to the arab-israeli conflict .
british foreign secretary david miliband meanwhile said in a statement that " the international community should offer full support to those seeking a negotiated two-state solution to the conflict . "
french officials , on the other hand , reportedly said they would support the initiative only if it addresses the final status of the palestinian territories . article based on wire reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

government leaders meanwhile mulled the future of atomic energy . vattenfall europe ceo klaus rauscher offered his resignation on wednesday after the brunsbüttel nuclear power plant had to be shut off for the third time in three weeks because of problems .
" rauscher explained that it can not be denied that the events of the past few weeks have tarnished the image of vattenfall europe , " read a statement released by vattenfall 's supervisory board chief , lars g. josefsson .
" errors have been made for which he , as head of vattenfall europe , must bear responsibility . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krümmel nuclear plant is still not back in operation a fire in the company 's nearby krümmel nuclear power plant in june had started a series of problems that led to the firing of vattenfall europe 's nuclear energy chief , bruno thomauske , on monday .
gradual disclosures since june 28 , when electrical defects shut down the company 's reactors at krümmel and brunsbüttel near hamburg , have revealed that staff at krümmel were in crisis as a fire raged in a transformer .
neither reactor was damaged and no radioactivity was released , but vattenfall - and the whole nuclear industry in germany - suffered a public relations disaster .
the company said it was commissioning an independent inquiry by scientists and business experts with a budget of 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6.8 million -rrb- to examine exactly what went wrong .
ministers divided on what to do bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel , angela merkel and michael glos -lrb- from left -rrb- german economy minister michael glos meanwhile sprang to the defense of the country 's nuclear power stations on wednesday , saying that despite the recent problems , even the oldest plants were ahead of the rest of the world in terms of security .
" what 's definite is that the reactors in operation are as safe as is humanly possible , " glos told german public television zdf .
" on this point , we in germany are ahead " , the minister said .
glos also added that said that the safety of the power stations had nothing to do with their age .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel on the other hand had called for the oldest plants , which began operating in the early 1970s , to be shut down .
in return , the remaining operation time on these plants could be transferred to younger plants , but energy providers are not keen on doing so as the old ones operate much more profitably .
merkel has no pity chancellor angela merkel , who has in the past supported a rethink of germany 's planned nuclear energy phase-out , said wednesday that she could understand the public 's concerns and its criticism of the nuclear industry .
" my pity for the industry is limited , " she said , adding that she found vattenfall 's information policy " totally unacceptable .
" after all , dramatic errors were committed , " merkel said .
but the chancellor also said that the entire industry should not be stigmatized .
" i would n't generalize , " she said .

but perhaps his finest hour came on the political stage in 1989 . masur was born on july 18 , 1927 in what is now the city of brzeg in poland .
the son of an engineer , he taught himself piano as a young child and quickly specialized in conducting - despite suffering from a nervous stutter . in 1970 , masur became kapellmeister at leipzig 's gewandhaus orchestra - the musical ensemble with which he remains most closely associated .
he stayed in the post for 27 years , putting the orchestra back on the international map and presiding over the building of a new concert hall to replace the former one that had been badly damaged by allied bombing during world war ii . in leipzig , masur established an international reputation as a sensitive and innovative interpreter of the classical and romantic repertoire - and specifically mendelssohn , brahms and tchaikovsky . a master of the requiem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of leipzigers protested every monday in 1989 his best-known recording came in 1982 with an interpretation of richard strauss 's " four last songs .

" all kinds of nazi incendiary writings have been published in a scientific format , except for ' mein kampf , " ' said möller , a history professor at munich university .
" in my opinion , it 's not justifiable to prohibit this for a single document out of fear that it might have a negative , symbolic effect . "
copyright issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's book was on display at a book fair in tehran in 2006 bavaria 's finance ministry , which holds the copyright to " mein kampf , " has so far refused to permit publication of the book .
while it has been published abroad after 1945 , it is only available for scientific research within germany .
in the interview , möller said that he had recently discussed the issue with bavarian finance minister kurt falthauser , who had declined to give permission .
möller also said that officials at germany 's foreign ministry , where möller 's publicly funded institute also has an office , had advised against publication , saying that it could have a negative effect for germany abroad .
but the copyright is running out in 2015 and möller said he expected many to try and make a quick buck with a sensationalist publication of the book .
his institute , on the other hand , has the resources and expertise to produce an edition that wo n't be easily abused by neo-nazis for propaganda purposes , möller said .
a need for disillusionment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : möller says that " mein kampf " should be published in an annotated edition just like other nazi writings " the book is badly written , it 's put together from all kinds of different sources and consists of many incendiary tirades , " möller said , adding that the book still deserved scientific attention as a key document of the national-socialist regime .
" as long as a carefully annotated edition of ' mein kampf ' does n't exist , the simple-minded speculations about the book 's contents wo n't end . "
mein kampf sets out hitler 's claim that " aryans " were the founders of human culture and jews its spoilers as well as his denunciation of " inferior races " and call to seize lebensraum or territory in eastern europe . prohibiting publication beyond 2015 bavarian finance ministry officials meanwhile said that publication of a sensationalist edition of " mein kampf " would still be illegal after the copyright expires as german law prohibits the distribution of national-socialist propaganda . they also said that the bavarian government feels a responsibility towards protecting holocaust victims against a new publication of the book - including an annotated version as suggested by möller . " considering that bavaria 's strict stance ... is welcomed and supported both domestically and abroad , permission to reprint ' mein kampf ' still can not be considered , " reads a statement from the ministry . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for 10 years , his testimonies , in exchange for his freedom , have helped police crack down on organized crime . if the three italians on trial in düsseldorf for cocaine-trafficking are found guilty , it won ’ t be the first time that evidence supplied by mobster-turned-police informant basile puts suspected mafiosi behind bars .
before he was even 40 , the man they called " angel face " had murdered up to 30 people . after being arrested in the allgäu region of southern germany in 1998 , he was allowed to go free .
in return for his new life in a witness protection program , he has helped police lock up over 50 criminals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mafia hotbed corleone in sicily now 47 , basile , who will testify wednesday via video from a secret location in italy , was once one of the most redoubtable top dogs within the carelli clan , which belongs to calabria 's notorious ' ndrangheta .
among the most powerful and ruthless mafia-like organizations in italy , ' ndrangheta cells are loosely based on blood relationships .
the organization is believed to rake in some $ 30 billion -lrb- 22 billion euros -rrb- annually , mostly from illegal narcotics , but also from ostensibly legal businesses such as construction , restaurants and supermarkets .
allegedly , it is also involved in counterfeiting , gambling , fraud , theft , labor racketeering , loan sharking , people smuggling and kidnapping .
the ' ndrangheta ‘ s family ties are believed to be closer and their vows of silence more strictly observed than other mafia clans , such as cosa nostra and camorra .
so when giorgio basile decided to break them , it marked a watershed in germany 's fight against the mafia .
becoming numero uno bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlon brando as don corleone in " the godfather " with all the ingredients of a classic " godfather " film , it comes as no surprise that basile 's story has attracted the attention of a munich film company which has worked in the past with german star movie director oliver hirschbiegel -lrb- the downfall -rrb- .
born in corigliano calabro in 1960 , giorgio moved one year later to mühlheim an der ruhr in germany , where his father made a living as a " guest worker . "
in 1966 , his parents separated when his father realized his mother was having an affair .
her lover was antonio de cicco , local boss of the ' ndrangheta in corigliano and every bit the latin stereotype in his sharp suits with slicked-back hair and gold chains .
giorgio spent two years in italy with his new family , but returned to germany when his mother got pregnant .
he lost touch with his adopted father until 1979 , when at the age of 19 , giorgio was persuaded by de cicco to leave the dull , industrial trappings of western germany and work as his driver back in corigliano .
as a fledgling ' ndrinu , he enjoyed the attention his association with de cicco afforded him and soon became versed in the ways of the clan .
but when he discovered his adopted father had been abusing his sister , he resolved to avenge her .
in 1973 , he made his first killing , when he murdered de cicco .
by now , he was one of the most powerful cocaine dealers in tuscany , and a recognized uomo d ' onore -lrb- man of honor -rrb- .
it was during these years that he met his wife , who bore him a daughter .
he extended the business further afield , and in the 1980s , played a key role in building up mafia influence in germany .
betrayed by the organization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mafia boss giuseppe bellocco was arrested in calabria on tuesday arrested in 1998 , he opted to break the omertà , the mafia ‘ s " code of silence " .
within mafia culture , this made him a " stool pigeon " - a violation punishable by death .
according to andreas ulrich , author of " angel face , " a biography of giorgio basile , he agreed to name names because " he felt betrayed by the organization . "
" it never comes good on its promises , " he said .
" it lures young men with promises of power , money and women .
it uses them , then kills them as though they were ants . "
basile has said he lives with the knowledge that the mafia will hunt him down and kill him .
" the mafia bosses are behind bars because of what i did , " he told ulrich .
" they can ‘ t do anything to me any more , but their sons will avenge them . "
eighteen months ago , he told the online version of german news magazine der spiegel that the mafia 's influence was stronger than ever .
" the mafia will continue to expand , " he said .
" the enlarged europe will allow it to spread even further .
for someone with the same criminal energy as i had , it 's even easier in germany than it is in italy .
you can get away with anything . "
basile said the german authorities had failed to recognize the extent of the criminal energy that exists within the underground italian community .
" i couldn ’ t put a figure to it , but germany is home to many sleepers .
go in to any pizzeria and you might find the cook is a hitman just waiting for a call , " he said .
the mob in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giorgio basile the extent of mob influence is definitely underestimated in germany , said mafia expert jürgen roth .
" when berlusconi was in power there was very little information coming out of italy , " he explained .
" the mafia took the opportunity to get a foothold in germany . there is now barely any knowledge of the mafia 's criminal structures here .
it is active mainly in the area of money laundering , drug and weapons trading , protection racketeering and prostitution . "
while the biggest ' ndrangheta presence is in eastern german states such as thuringia and saxony , roth says cosa nostra actually has a higher profile in baden-württemberg .
earlier this month , italy ’ s leading mafia hunter , piero grasso , warned germany in the neue osnabrücker zeitung daily that the mob was even beginning to penetrate legitimate business circles in germany .
" the size and profit potential of german markets , as well as german law , makes the country highly attractive to organized criminals , " he said .

aberdonian lawrie is back at carnoustie - where he famously won the claret jug in 1999 - for the open which starts on thursday morning .
lawrie is priced at 200-1 by bookmakers william hill , and the biggest bet on him is only £ 25 each-way to be placed .
however bookmakers say a montgomerie win at 25-1 would cost more than £ 1m .
we would be delighted to see paul lawrie win - we are on his side graham sharp william hill william hill spokesman graham sharp said : " despite his failure to make the cut in the scottish open last week , monty is the man the punters want to back for the open and his have odds tumbled to 25-1 from 80-1 .
" every other bet seems to have his name on at the moment , and we will certainly be handing over a hefty seven-figure sum to punters should monty manage to win .
" the biggest bet is £ 300 each-way at 80-1 , but it 's the volume of smaller bets .
monty is to the open what frankie dettori is to the derby . "
socks off he added : " we would be delighted to see paul lawrie win - we are on his side . "
lawrie is 150-1 at other bookmakers including ladbrokes and coral .
lawrie won a dramatic open play-off in 1999 after jean van de velde blew a three shot lead going into the final hole with a triple bogey .
his tee-shot went in the rough , then he shot into the dreaded barry burn water hazard .
he even famously took off his shoes and socks and climbed into the burn in an attempt to rescue his title hopes , to no avail .
lawrie meanwhile shot six birdies on the final day to bring him up to six over for the championship , and won the play-off .
lawrie comes into the open after some good early play at the scottish open , but he fell away in the second two rounds .
montgomerie , who has never won a golf major , won the european open earlier this month , but missed the cut at the scottish open last week .
richie ramsay , aberdeen 's us amateur champion , is 400-1 with william hill , and 1,000-1 at coral .

plans have been announced to build the renewable energy plant on boston road to the east of sleaford .
the station - run by eco2 biomass limited - would generate enough electricity for 90,000 homes each year as well as 80 jobs .
the plans will be shown in sleaford and kirby la thorpe in july .
the planning application will be submitted to north kesteven district council in august .
a thorough environmental impact assessment -lrb- eia -rrb- has been commissioned to evaluate issues including visual impact , noise , heritage and nature conservation .
around 200,000 tonnes of straw will be burnt every year with contingency plans to burn limited amounts of clean wood .
the resulting ash will be cleaned and recycled to local farms as fertiliser .
managing director of eco2 biomass limited darren williams said : " lincolnshire is one of the most arable areas in europe and it is only fitting that such a project is based here . "

in may , the brecon beacons national park said that sgwd yr eira had to be fenced off for safety reasons amid concerns over unstable rocks .
the park now says work will not start until at least january , which brought criticism from the ramblers in wales .
as one of the few waterfalls which people are able to walk behind , it used to attract 160,000 visitors a year .
earlier this year , health and safety officials were called in amid concerns about rocks above the waterfall , which is in an area known as waterfall country near ystradfellte , in the upper neath valley .
their inspection led to people being barred two months ago from the waterfall and the path leading to it .
they need to get their fingers out and step things up a bit mike mills , rambler the national park said , until the area was deemed safe , it would remain " fenced off in the interests of visitor safety " .
it has now emerged that remedial work will not start for another six months at the earliest .
mike mills , of the ramblers in wales , said : " that 's appalling , bearing in mind this is one of the key tourist attractions in the brecon beacons .
" there are obviously health and safety concerns , but i 'm very disappointed the work is taking so long .
they need to get their fingers out and step things up a bit . "
the forestry commission , which owns the land around the falls , applied for the closure order and has since held talks with the national park and the countryside council for wales .
sam games of the brecon beacons national park said : " we can appreciate that this has disappointed visitors who enjoy and love the unique experience of sgwd yr eira .
" but it goes without saying that the health and safety of visitors is of paramount importance . "
the wildlife in the area , a site of special scientific interest -lrb- sssi -rrb- and a european special area of conservation , is described as " unique " .

plagued by worsening sales , emi hopes a takeover will give it new impetus .
warner said it reserved the right to reconsider its position should emi receive another bid besides the terra firma offer .
former emi chief executive jim fifield has been linked with a bid for emi and he has until thursday to clarify his position .

councillor mick barton , chairman of licensing at the council , said : " the council , police and licensed trade in mansfield are involved in some excellent partnership work which has seen us buck the national trend and help reduce alcohol-related assaults in the last few years .
" however , drink-related violence is still a major issue and there is no doubt that the amount of licensed premises we have in such a concentrated area is a major contributory factor . "

dow jones confirmed it " would be prepared to approve , and recommend to the dow jones stockholders " the agreement , it said in a statement .
the deal 's future now rests with shareholders in the bancroft family , which holds 64 % of the voting stock .
if it goes ahead , the deal could reshape the us media landscape .
the offer represents a 65 % premium on dow jones ' share price at the time the deal was announced .
the proposal is expected to be presented to the bancrofts at a meeting on thursday .
several bancroft family members have been looking for alternatives to rupert murdoch 's news corporation , and have courted other potential investors .
but no-one has come forward with an offer that trumps news corp 's $ 60-a-share price .
a number of wall street journal journalists - and the iape union - have also voiced strong opposition to mr murdoch gaining control of dow jones .
news corporation launched the surprise bid for dow jones in may .
since then , mr murdoch 's company has been battling to reassure sceptics that the paper 's independence will be maintained under new corp 's ownership .
a successful bid would bring dow jones publications including the wall street journal and barron 's under the same stable as news corp 's new york post in the us , and the sun and the times in the uk .

with many schools about to begin a six-week holiday - there are schools on the continent which are shut for 16 weeks over the summer .
but there is little sign of a link between longer hours in the classroom and higher standards .
schools in finland , one of the most successful education systems , have been on holiday since the beginning of june .
germany and liechtenstein are also at the bottom of the holiday league with six-week summer breaks - but many european countries have holidays that stretch between 10 and 12 weeks .
family friendly ?
it means that english and welsh state school pupils are still studying when almost every other classroom in europe is empty and family holidays are in full swing .
school summer holidays england , wales : 6 weeks germany : 6 weeks scotland : 7 weeks austria : 9 weeks sweden : 10 weeks finland : 11 weeks italy : 12 weeks portugal : 12 weeks bulgaria : 16 weeks both the government and opposition have been campaigning on supporting the family .
but if the drive for extended schools continues , families in england could see even less of their children - with plans for more schools to provide term-time " wrap-around services " , offering after and before-school activities between 8am and 6pm .
and the english school system also involves children starting in education at a very young age - with increasing numbers of three year olds in nursery classes attached to primary schools .
in contrast , many northern european countries do not start compulsory education until children are seven .
but there is no evidence that spending so many more hours in the education system delivers better results - in fact , the countries with the lowest teaching hours have the most successful systems .
less is more ?
each year , the oecd publishes a report comparing the performance of education systems in the industrialised world .
total hours in school england : 7,274 spain : 6,827 sweden : 5,924 germany : 6,250 finland : 5,523 -lrb- hours in school between aged 7 and 14 -rrb- and this shows that the countries which have the lowest number of hours in the classroom - finland , norway , sweden , south korea and denmark - are also among the countries with the highest level of achievement .
independent schools in england , which often get two more weeks in the summer than state schools , are among the highest flyers in exam league tables , apparently not suffering from their reduced hours .
the atl teachers ' union heard warnings at its conference earlier this year that parents ' long working hours - and children 's increasing time in school and child-care - meant that family life was being damaged .
teachers warned that such a long-hours culture for children , away from the influence of family life , was a factor in aggression and anti-social behaviour .
we invited your comments .
here is a selection of some of your views : i think that 6 weeks in the summer is a good length because the children have more breaks throughout the year .
i wish we had a shorter summer , i live in the us with 12 weeks in the summer , 2 weeks at christmas , one week in march and several long weekends .
we are told that if we do not so some form of school work , then the children loose 25 % of what they have learned and spend they seem to spend the first month each year reviewing last years work .
my children aged 6 and 9 spend 2/3 days at a -lrb- day camp -rrb- centre that provide lots of activities which help with the boredom and so i can work from home without distractions .
children do not do well with long hours - even as adults are we really productive towards the end of a long day ?
lorraine bowring , meridian , idaho usa -lrb- ex pat -rrb- i have been teaching primary school in the uk for the past two years , and i have to say that , although i would appreciate a longer summer holiday -lrb- the last ten days of school are hard on both students and staff -rrb- , i really do enjoy the frequent 1- and 2-week holidays scheduled throughout the year .
just when i feel i ca n't bear another moment in the classroom , a holiday pops up .
very good for re-building energy and boosting morale .
last year , when i told my students about the 3-month-long summer holidays in parts of the usa , there was a universal moan of envy - until they heard the trade-off , that us students get a few long weekends , two weeks at christmas and a week at easter , and no other holidays during the school year .
suddenly a long break did not look so pleasant anymore .
lawrence wilson , mayfield , east sussex not everything is learned in school .
part of learning comes from spending time with family and great summer experiences ... that should n't be taken away from kids .
there 's more outside books and classrooms .
nisha , chicago schoolchildren in iceland have 3 months ' holiday in the summer , but they are required to do community work such as weeding roadside verges .
they 're probably pleased to get back to school in september , having had a taste of what the future might be like if they do n't get a good education , especially as - unlike here in the uk - iceland does n't seem to have a benefits system that discourages people from seeking work .
iceland has just been voted the happiest country in europe , by the way : i wonder if there 's any connection .
brian cox , wooler , northumberland the uk seems to be madly trying to impose on children a system that includes long hours and school uniforms , but yet it does not work .
we should follow other eu countries examples , because if you try and shove education down their throats , they 're not going to thank you for it .
we should stop pretending that our state schools are private schools ; that just makes them worse .
alice , london , uk in malta we also have a long summer stretch for 11-12 weeks .
however in our case we must consider that our summer is scorching hot and it would be torture for the students to stay in a class .
another thing is that we do not have a two week mid term holiday or autumn holiday for example !
mase , malta i 'm from belgium and one of the few things i found really odd , and different , was the amount of time that children spend at school .
in belgium you only get 4 full days of school , and one half day on wednesday .
which i have always found great as a child , and i never had problems with after school care .
also , the summer holidays in belgium start on the 1st of july and end on the 31st of august .
there is no difference in regions , which is the case in the uk .
i believe that 's fair and square for every child .
and my parents have always managed to find solutions around all of these holidays and wednesdays , so i do n't see why parents in the uk ca n't do the same ?
vanessa verlinden , bromsgrove here in chicago there are some schools which are open year round , allowing for those parents who genuinely have no choice but to work .
they are very popular !
and even when parents do have the luxury of being able to stay home , it 's not like they are all born entertainers - my own mother stayed at home with us and we spent our summers watching tv or playing outside .
those weeks could have been spent much more productively in a summer school or even just staying in regular school .
jennifer , chicago , ex-uk northern ireland has 9 weeks summer holidays -lrb- they break up around the same time as scotland and return in september about the same time as england & wales -rrb- .
they receive the same education as their english & welsh counterparts and do not fare any worse in examination results than the other legions of the uk .
a watts , paulton typical uk approach to things , it 's all about quantity over quality .
i knew we have the longest working hours in europe and yet some of the lowest productivity , now i find out that we have the longest school terms in europe , with some of the lowest educational standards .
same in my office , it 's not how good at your job that determines bonuses and promotions , it 's how much extra overtime you 're perceived to have done .
being good at your job and getting things done in normal office hours gets no praise , yet if you are seen to be working late to get the same tasks done it 's fast track to management .
nick , london it 's important to consider how long students get other holiday breaks during the year .
i know my friends in england get 2 weeks at easter , and longer breaks for certain holidays than in canada .
while we get out of school in mid-june , the numbers seem to balance out either way .
kalvis mikelsteins , toronto , canada i have always believed 6 weeks is far too long , everything is more expensive during the hols , also , the children do get very bored , it is hard for working parents to provide the time to go out especially during the week to spend with our children .
i think the summer hols should be split up more , extra week at easter , christmas , and perhaps have another week half term during the year .
jackie smith , newton abbot devon why do people bother to have children if they never want to spend any time with them ?
starting school even younger , longer hours at school , longer terms .
having children is a privilege not a right .
if you decide to have a child , then please spend quality time with them , giving them a sense of identity and security rather than leaving them to be raised by tired , worn out and disillusioned school teachers .
roxanne , london in response to roxanne i have to say i do raise my children and i spend quality time with them .
i also work - i believe i also have a duty to support the children i chose to have financially - as a working parent i have to work 9-5 and as such an 8-6 school day suits my needs .
it 's a fact of life that many parents have to , or want to work - providing a positive role model for their children .
or should we all give up our jobs and rely on the state ?
i work part time - between 8:30 and 4:30 tues-thurs i do not magically stop being a parent - i still raise my children - they just spend 22 hours a week at school or with a childminder !
for working parents those 6 weeks can be a nightmare of juggling childcare and work !

iceland has just been voted the happiest country in europe , by the way : i wonder if there 's any connection .
brian cox , wooler , northumberland the uk seems to be madly trying to impose on children a system that includes long hours and school uniforms , but yet it does not work .
we should follow other eu countries examples , because if you try and shove education down their throats , they 're not going to thank you for it .
we should stop pretending that our state schools are private schools ; that just makes them worse .
alice , london , uk in malta we also have a long summer stretch for 11-12 weeks .
however in our case we must consider that our summer is scorching hot and it would be torture for the students to stay in a class .
another thing is that we do not have a two week mid term holiday or autumn holiday for example !
mase , malta i 'm from belgium and one of the few things i found really odd , and different , was the amount of time that children spend at school .
in belgium you only get 4 full days of school , and one half day on wednesday .
which i have always found great as a child , and i never had problems with after school care .
also , the summer holidays in belgium start on the 1st of july and end on the 31st of august .
there is no difference in regions , which is the case in the uk .
i believe that 's fair and square for every child .
and my parents have always managed to find solutions around all of these holidays and wednesdays , so i do n't see why parents in the uk ca n't do the same ?
vanessa verlinden , bromsgrove here in chicago there are some schools which are open year round , allowing for those parents who genuinely have no choice but to work .
they are very popular !
and even when parents do have the luxury of being able to stay home , it 's not like they are all born entertainers - my own mother stayed at home with us and we spent our summers watching tv or playing outside .
those weeks could have been spent much more productively in a summer school or even just staying in regular school .
jennifer , chicago , ex-uk northern ireland has 9 weeks summer holidays -lrb- they break up around the same time as scotland and return in september about the same time as england & wales -rrb- .
they receive the same education as their english & welsh counterparts and do not fare any worse in examination results than the other legions of the uk .
a watts , paulton typical uk approach to things , it 's all about quantity over quality .
i knew we have the longest working hours in europe and yet some of the lowest productivity , now i find out that we have the longest school terms in europe , with some of the lowest educational standards .
same in my office , it 's not how good at your job that determines bonuses and promotions , it 's how much extra overtime you 're perceived to have done .
being good at your job and getting things done in normal office hours gets no praise , yet if you are seen to be working late to get the same tasks done it 's fast track to management .
nick , london it 's important to consider how long students get other holiday breaks during the year .
i know my friends in england get 2 weeks at easter , and longer breaks for certain holidays than in canada .
while we get out of school in mid-june , the numbers seem to balance out either way .
kalvis mikelsteins , toronto , canada i have always believed 6 weeks is far too long , everything is more expensive during the hols , also , the children do get very bored , it is hard for working parents to provide the time to go out especially during the week to spend with our children .
i think the summer hols should be split up more , extra week at easter , christmas , and perhaps have another week half term during the year .
jackie smith , newton abbot devon why do people bother to have children if they never want to spend any time with them ?
starting school even younger , longer hours at school , longer terms .
having children is a privilege not a right .
if you decide to have a child , then please spend quality time with them , giving them a sense of identity and security rather than leaving them to be raised by tired , worn out and disillusioned school teachers .
roxanne , london in response to roxanne i have to say i do raise my children and i spend quality time with them .
i also work - i believe i also have a duty to support the children i chose to have financially - as a working parent i have to work 9-5 and as such an 8-6 school day suits my needs .
it 's a fact of life that many parents have to , or want to work - providing a positive role model for their children .
or should we all give up our jobs and rely on the state ?
i work part time - between 8:30 and 4:30 tues-thurs i do not magically stop being a parent - i still raise my children - they just spend 22 hours a week at school or with a childminder !
for working parents those 6 weeks can be a nightmare of juggling childcare and work !

with many schools about to begin a six-week holiday - there are schools on the continent which are shut for 16 weeks over the summer .
but there is little sign of a link between longer hours in the classroom and higher standards .
schools in finland , one of the most successful education systems , have been on holiday since the beginning of june .
germany and liechtenstein are also at the bottom of the holiday league with six-week summer breaks - but many european countries have holidays that stretch between 10 and 12 weeks .
family friendly ?
it means that english and welsh state school pupils are still studying when almost every other classroom in europe is empty and family holidays are in full swing .
school summer holidays england , wales : 6 weeks germany : 6 weeks scotland : 7 weeks austria : 9 weeks sweden : 10 weeks finland : 11 weeks italy : 12 weeks portugal : 12 weeks bulgaria : 16 weeks both the government and opposition have been campaigning on supporting the family .
but if the drive for extended schools continues , families in england could see even less of their children - with plans for more schools to provide term-time " wrap-around services " , offering after and before-school activities between 8am and 6pm .
and the english school system also involves children starting in education at a very young age - with increasing numbers of three year olds in nursery classes attached to primary schools .
in contrast , many northern european countries do not start compulsory education until children are seven .
but there is no evidence that spending so many more hours in the education system delivers better results - in fact , the countries with the lowest teaching hours have the most successful systems .
less is more ?
each year , the oecd publishes a report comparing the performance of education systems in the industrialised world .
total hours in school england : 7,274 spain : 6,827 sweden : 5,924 germany : 6,250 finland : 5,523 -lrb- hours in school between aged 7 and 14 -rrb- and this shows that the countries which have the lowest number of hours in the classroom - finland , norway , sweden , south korea and denmark - are also among the countries with the highest level of achievement .
independent schools in england , which often get two more weeks in the summer than state schools , are among the highest flyers in exam league tables , apparently not suffering from their reduced hours .
the atl teachers ' union heard warnings at its conference earlier this year that parents ' long working hours - and children 's increasing time in school and child-care - meant that family life was being damaged .
teachers warned that such a long-hours culture for children , away from the influence of family life , was a factor in aggression and anti-social behaviour .
we invited your comments .
here is a selection of some of your views : i think that 6 weeks in the summer is a good length because the children have more breaks throughout the year .
i wish we had a shorter summer , i live in the us with 12 weeks in the summer , 2 weeks at christmas , one week in march and several long weekends .
we are told that if we do not so some form of school work , then the children loose 25 % of what they have learned and spend they seem to spend the first month each year reviewing last years work .
my children aged 6 and 9 spend 2/3 days at a -lrb- day camp -rrb- centre that provide lots of activities which help with the boredom and so i can work from home without distractions .
children do not do well with long hours - even as adults are we really productive towards the end of a long day ?
lorraine bowring , meridian , idaho usa -lrb- ex pat -rrb- i have been teaching primary school in the uk for the past two years , and i have to say that , although i would appreciate a longer summer holiday -lrb- the last ten days of school are hard on both students and staff -rrb- , i really do enjoy the frequent 1- and 2-week holidays scheduled throughout the year .
just when i feel i ca n't bear another moment in the classroom , a holiday pops up .
very good for re-building energy and boosting morale .
last year , when i told my students about the 3-month-long summer holidays in parts of the usa , there was a universal moan of envy - until they heard the trade-off , that us students get a few long weekends , two weeks at christmas and a week at easter , and no other holidays during the school year .
suddenly a long break did not look so pleasant anymore .
lawrence wilson , mayfield , east sussex not everything is learned in school .
part of learning comes from spending time with family and great summer experiences ... that should n't be taken away from kids .
there 's more outside books and classrooms .

with many schools about to begin a six-week holiday - there are schools on the continent which are shut for 16 weeks over the summer .
but there is little sign of a link between longer hours in the classroom and higher standards .
schools in finland , one of the most successful education systems , have been on holiday since the beginning of june .
germany and liechtenstein are also at the bottom of the holiday league with six-week summer breaks - but many european countries have holidays that stretch between 10 and 12 weeks .
family friendly ?
it means that english and welsh state school pupils are still studying when almost every other classroom in europe is empty and family holidays are in full swing .
school summer holidays england , wales : 6 weeks germany : 6 weeks scotland : 7 weeks austria : 9 weeks sweden : 10 weeks finland : 11 weeks italy : 12 weeks portugal : 12 weeks bulgaria : 16 weeks both the government and opposition have been campaigning on supporting the family .
but if the drive for extended schools continues , families in england could see even less of their children - with plans for more schools to provide term-time " wrap-around services " , offering after and before-school activities between 8am and 6pm .
and the english school system also involves children starting in education at a very young age - with increasing numbers of three year olds in nursery classes attached to primary schools .
in contrast , many northern european countries do not start compulsory education until children are seven .
but there is no evidence that spending so many more hours in the education system delivers better results - in fact , the countries with the lowest teaching hours have the most successful systems .
less is more ?
each year , the oecd publishes a report comparing the performance of education systems in the industrialised world .
total hours in school england : 7,274 spain : 6,827 sweden : 5,924 germany : 6,250 finland : 5,523 -lrb- hours in school between aged 7 and 14 -rrb- and this shows that the countries which have the lowest number of hours in the classroom - finland , norway , sweden , south korea and denmark - are also among the countries with the highest level of achievement .
independent schools in england , which often get two more weeks in the summer than state schools , are among the highest flyers in exam league tables , apparently not suffering from their reduced hours .
the atl teachers ' union heard warnings at its conference earlier this year that parents ' long working hours - and children 's increasing time in school and child-care - meant that family life was being damaged .
teachers warned that such a long-hours culture for children , away from the influence of family life , was a factor in aggression and anti-social behaviour .
we invited your comments .
here is a selection of some of your views : i think that 6 weeks in the summer is a good length because the children have more breaks throughout the year .
i wish we had a shorter summer , i live in the us with 12 weeks in the summer , 2 weeks at christmas , one week in march and several long weekends .
we are told that if we do not so some form of school work , then the children loose 25 % of what they have learned and spend they seem to spend the first month each year reviewing last years work .
my children aged 6 and 9 spend 2/3 days at a -lrb- day camp -rrb- centre that provide lots of activities which help with the boredom and so i can work from home without distractions .
children do not do well with long hours - even as adults are we really productive towards the end of a long day ?
lorraine bowring , meridian , idaho usa -lrb- ex pat -rrb- i have been teaching primary school in the uk for the past two years , and i have to say that , although i would appreciate a longer summer holiday -lrb- the last ten days of school are hard on both students and staff -rrb- , i really do enjoy the frequent 1- and 2-week holidays scheduled throughout the year .
just when i feel i ca n't bear another moment in the classroom , a holiday pops up .
very good for re-building energy and boosting morale .
last year , when i told my students about the 3-month-long summer holidays in parts of the usa , there was a universal moan of envy - until they heard the trade-off , that us students get a few long weekends , two weeks at christmas and a week at easter , and no other holidays during the school year .
suddenly a long break did not look so pleasant anymore .
lawrence wilson , mayfield , east sussex not everything is learned in school .
part of learning comes from spending time with family and great summer experiences ... that should n't be taken away from kids .
there 's more outside books and classrooms .
nisha , chicago schoolchildren in iceland have 3 months ' holiday in the summer , but they are required to do community work such as weeding roadside verges .
they 're probably pleased to get back to school in september , having had a taste of what the future might be like if they do n't get a good education , especially as - unlike here in the uk - iceland does n't seem to have a benefits system that discourages people from seeking work .
iceland has just been voted the happiest country in europe , by the way : i wonder if there 's any connection .
brian cox , wooler , northumberland the uk seems to be madly trying to impose on children a system that includes long hours and school uniforms , but yet it does not work .
we should follow other eu countries examples , because if you try and shove education down their throats , they 're not going to thank you for it .
we should stop pretending that our state schools are private schools ; that just makes them worse .
alice , london , uk in malta we also have a long summer stretch for 11-12 weeks .
however in our case we must consider that our summer is scorching hot and it would be torture for the students to stay in a class .
another thing is that we do not have a two week mid term holiday or autumn holiday for example !
mase , malta i 'm from belgium and one of the few things i found really odd , and different , was the amount of time that children spend at school .
in belgium you only get 4 full days of school , and one half day on wednesday .
which i have always found great as a child , and i never had problems with after school care .
also , the summer holidays in belgium start on the 1st of july and end on the 31st of august .
there is no difference in regions , which is the case in the uk .
i believe that 's fair and square for every child .
and my parents have always managed to find solutions around all of these holidays and wednesdays , so i do n't see why parents in the uk ca n't do the same ?
vanessa verlinden , bromsgrove here in chicago there are some schools which are open year round , allowing for those parents who genuinely have no choice but to work .
they are very popular !
and even when parents do have the luxury of being able to stay home , it 's not like they are all born entertainers - my own mother stayed at home with us and we spent our summers watching tv or playing outside .
those weeks could have been spent much more productively in a summer school or even just staying in regular school .
jennifer , chicago , ex-uk northern ireland has 9 weeks summer holidays -lrb- they break up around the same time as scotland and return in september about the same time as england & wales -rrb- .
they receive the same education as their english & welsh counterparts and do not fare any worse in examination results than the other legions of the uk .
a watts , paulton typical uk approach to things , it 's all about quantity over quality .
i knew we have the longest working hours in europe and yet some of the lowest productivity , now i find out that we have the longest school terms in europe , with some of the lowest educational standards .
same in my office , it 's not how good at your job that determines bonuses and promotions , it 's how much extra overtime you 're perceived to have done .
being good at your job and getting things done in normal office hours gets no praise , yet if you are seen to be working late to get the same tasks done it 's fast track to management .
nick , london it 's important to consider how long students get other holiday breaks during the year .
i know my friends in england get 2 weeks at easter , and longer breaks for certain holidays than in canada .
while we get out of school in mid-june , the numbers seem to balance out either way .
kalvis mikelsteins , toronto , canada i have always believed 6 weeks is far too long , everything is more expensive during the hols , also , the children do get very bored , it is hard for working parents to provide the time to go out especially during the week to spend with our children .
i think the summer hols should be split up more , extra week at easter , christmas , and perhaps have another week half term during the year .
jackie smith , newton abbot devon why do people bother to have children if they never want to spend any time with them ?
starting school even younger , longer hours at school , longer terms .
having children is a privilege not a right .
if you decide to have a child , then please spend quality time with them , giving them a sense of identity and security rather than leaving them to be raised by tired , worn out and disillusioned school teachers .
roxanne , london in response to roxanne i have to say i do raise my children and i spend quality time with them .
i also work - i believe i also have a duty to support the children i chose to have financially - as a working parent i have to work 9-5 and as such an 8-6 school day suits my needs .
it 's a fact of life that many parents have to , or want to work - providing a positive role model for their children .
or should we all give up our jobs and rely on the state ?
i work part time - between 8:30 and 4:30 tues-thurs i do not magically stop being a parent - i still raise my children - they just spend 22 hours a week at school or with a childminder !
for working parents those 6 weeks can be a nightmare of juggling childcare and work !

i think the summer hols should be split up more , extra week at easter , christmas , and perhaps have another week half term during the year .
jackie smith , newton abbot devon why do people bother to have children if they never want to spend any time with them ?
starting school even younger , longer hours at school , longer terms .
having children is a privilege not a right .

it 's a fact of life that many parents have to , or want to work - providing a positive role model for their children .

with many schools about to begin a six-week holiday - there are schools on the continent which are shut for 16 weeks over the summer .
but there is little sign of a link between longer hours in the classroom and higher standards .
schools in finland , one of the most successful education systems , have been on holiday since the beginning of june .
germany and liechtenstein are also at the bottom of the holiday league with six-week summer breaks - but many european countries have holidays that stretch between 10 and 12 weeks .
family friendly ?
it means that english and welsh state school pupils are still studying when almost every other classroom in europe is empty and family holidays are in full swing .
school summer holidays england , wales : 6 weeks germany : 6 weeks scotland : 7 weeks austria : 9 weeks sweden : 10 weeks finland : 11 weeks italy : 12 weeks portugal : 12 weeks bulgaria : 16 weeks both the government and opposition have been campaigning on supporting the family .
but if the drive for extended schools continues , families in england could see even less of their children - with plans for more schools to provide term-time " wrap-around services " , offering after and before-school activities between 8am and 6pm .
and the english school system also involves children starting in education at a very young age - with increasing numbers of three year olds in nursery classes attached to primary schools .
in contrast , many northern european countries do not start compulsory education until children are seven .
but there is no evidence that spending so many more hours in the education system delivers better results - in fact , the countries with the lowest teaching hours have the most successful systems .
less is more ?
each year , the oecd publishes a report comparing the performance of education systems in the industrialised world .
total hours in school england : 7,274 spain : 6,827 sweden : 5,924 germany : 6,250 finland : 5,523 -lrb- hours in school between aged 7 and 14 -rrb- and this shows that the countries which have the lowest number of hours in the classroom - finland , norway , sweden , south korea and denmark - are also among the countries with the highest level of achievement .
independent schools in england , which often get two more weeks in the summer than state schools , are among the highest flyers in exam league tables , apparently not suffering from their reduced hours .
the atl teachers ' union heard warnings at its conference earlier this year that parents ' long working hours - and children 's increasing time in school and child-care - meant that family life was being damaged .
teachers warned that such a long-hours culture for children , away from the influence of family life , was a factor in aggression and anti-social behaviour .
we invited your comments .
here is a selection of some of your views : i think that 6 weeks in the summer is a good length because the children have more breaks throughout the year .
i wish we had a shorter summer , i live in the us with 12 weeks in the summer , 2 weeks at christmas , one week in march and several long weekends .
we are told that if we do not so some form of school work , then the children loose 25 % of what they have learned and spend they seem to spend the first month each year reviewing last years work .
my children aged 6 and 9 spend 2/3 days at a -lrb- day camp -rrb- centre that provide lots of activities which help with the boredom and so i can work from home without distractions .
children do not do well with long hours - even as adults are we really productive towards the end of a long day ?
lorraine bowring , meridian , idaho usa -lrb- ex pat -rrb- i have been teaching primary school in the uk for the past two years , and i have to say that , although i would appreciate a longer summer holiday -lrb- the last ten days of school are hard on both students and staff -rrb- , i really do enjoy the frequent 1- and 2-week holidays scheduled throughout the year .
just when i feel i ca n't bear another moment in the classroom , a holiday pops up .
very good for re-building energy and boosting morale .
last year , when i told my students about the 3-month-long summer holidays in parts of the usa , there was a universal moan of envy - until they heard the trade-off , that us students get a few long weekends , two weeks at christmas and a week at easter , and no other holidays during the school year .
suddenly a long break did not look so pleasant anymore .
lawrence wilson , mayfield , east sussex not everything is learned in school .
part of learning comes from spending time with family and great summer experiences ... that should n't be taken away from kids .
there 's more outside books and classrooms .
nisha , chicago schoolchildren in iceland have 3 months ' holiday in the summer , but they are required to do community work such as weeding roadside verges .
they 're probably pleased to get back to school in september , having had a taste of what the future might be like if they do n't get a good education , especially as - unlike here in the uk - iceland does n't seem to have a benefits system that discourages people from seeking work .

with many schools about to begin a six-week holiday - there are schools on the continent which are shut for 16 weeks over the summer .
but there is little sign of a link between longer hours in the classroom and higher standards .
schools in finland , one of the most successful education systems , have been on holiday since the beginning of june .
germany and liechtenstein are also at the bottom of the holiday league with six-week summer breaks - but many european countries have holidays that stretch between 10 and 12 weeks .
family friendly ?
it means that english and welsh state school pupils are still studying when almost every other classroom in europe is empty and family holidays are in full swing .
school summer holidays england , wales : 6 weeks germany : 6 weeks scotland : 7 weeks austria : 9 weeks sweden : 10 weeks finland : 11 weeks italy : 12 weeks portugal : 12 weeks bulgaria : 16 weeks both the government and opposition have been campaigning on supporting the family .
but if the drive for extended schools continues , families in england could see even less of their children - with plans for more schools to provide term-time " wrap-around services " , offering after and before-school activities between 8am and 6pm .
and the english school system also involves children starting in education at a very young age - with increasing numbers of three year olds in nursery classes attached to primary schools .
in contrast , many northern european countries do not start compulsory education until children are seven .
but there is no evidence that spending so many more hours in the education system delivers better results - in fact , the countries with the lowest teaching hours have the most successful systems .
less is more ?
each year , the oecd publishes a report comparing the performance of education systems in the industrialised world .
total hours in school england : 7,274 spain : 6,827 sweden : 5,924 germany : 6,250 finland : 5,523 -lrb- hours in school between aged 7 and 14 -rrb- and this shows that the countries which have the lowest number of hours in the classroom - finland , norway , sweden , south korea and denmark - are also among the countries with the highest level of achievement .
independent schools in england , which often get two more weeks in the summer than state schools , are among the highest flyers in exam league tables , apparently not suffering from their reduced hours .
the atl teachers ' union heard warnings at its conference earlier this year that parents ' long working hours - and children 's increasing time in school and child-care - meant that family life was being damaged .
teachers warned that such a long-hours culture for children , away from the influence of family life , was a factor in aggression and anti-social behaviour .
we invited your comments .
here is a selection of some of your views : i think that 6 weeks in the summer is a good length because the children have more breaks throughout the year .
i wish we had a shorter summer , i live in the us with 12 weeks in the summer , 2 weeks at christmas , one week in march and several long weekends .
we are told that if we do not so some form of school work , then the children loose 25 % of what they have learned and spend they seem to spend the first month each year reviewing last years work .
my children aged 6 and 9 spend 2/3 days at a -lrb- day camp -rrb- centre that provide lots of activities which help with the boredom and so i can work from home without distractions .
children do not do well with long hours - even as adults are we really productive towards the end of a long day ?
lorraine bowring , meridian , idaho usa -lrb- ex pat -rrb- i have been teaching primary school in the uk for the past two years , and i have to say that , although i would appreciate a longer summer holiday -lrb- the last ten days of school are hard on both students and staff -rrb- , i really do enjoy the frequent 1- and 2-week holidays scheduled throughout the year .
just when i feel i ca n't bear another moment in the classroom , a holiday pops up .
very good for re-building energy and boosting morale .
last year , when i told my students about the 3-month-long summer holidays in parts of the usa , there was a universal moan of envy - until they heard the trade-off , that us students get a few long weekends , two weeks at christmas and a week at easter , and no other holidays during the school year .
suddenly a long break did not look so pleasant anymore .
lawrence wilson , mayfield , east sussex not everything is learned in school .
part of learning comes from spending time with family and great summer experiences ... that should n't be taken away from kids .
there 's more outside books and classrooms .
nisha , chicago schoolchildren in iceland have 3 months ' holiday in the summer , but they are required to do community work such as weeding roadside verges .
they 're probably pleased to get back to school in september , having had a taste of what the future might be like if they do n't get a good education , especially as - unlike here in the uk - iceland does n't seem to have a benefits system that discourages people from seeking work .
iceland has just been voted the happiest country in europe , by the way : i wonder if there 's any connection .
brian cox , wooler , northumberland the uk seems to be madly trying to impose on children a system that includes long hours and school uniforms , but yet it does not work .
we should follow other eu countries examples , because if you try and shove education down their throats , they 're not going to thank you for it .
we should stop pretending that our state schools are private schools ; that just makes them worse .
alice , london , uk in malta we also have a long summer stretch for 11-12 weeks .
however in our case we must consider that our summer is scorching hot and it would be torture for the students to stay in a class .
another thing is that we do not have a two week mid term holiday or autumn holiday for example !
mase , malta i 'm from belgium and one of the few things i found really odd , and different , was the amount of time that children spend at school .
in belgium you only get 4 full days of school , and one half day on wednesday .
which i have always found great as a child , and i never had problems with after school care .
also , the summer holidays in belgium start on the 1st of july and end on the 31st of august .
there is no difference in regions , which is the case in the uk .
i believe that 's fair and square for every child .
and my parents have always managed to find solutions around all of these holidays and wednesdays , so i do n't see why parents in the uk ca n't do the same ?
vanessa verlinden , bromsgrove here in chicago there are some schools which are open year round , allowing for those parents who genuinely have no choice but to work .
they are very popular !
and even when parents do have the luxury of being able to stay home , it 's not like they are all born entertainers - my own mother stayed at home with us and we spent our summers watching tv or playing outside .
those weeks could have been spent much more productively in a summer school or even just staying in regular school .
jennifer , chicago , ex-uk northern ireland has 9 weeks summer holidays -lrb- they break up around the same time as scotland and return in september about the same time as england & wales -rrb- .
they receive the same education as their english & welsh counterparts and do not fare any worse in examination results than the other legions of the uk .
a watts , paulton typical uk approach to things , it 's all about quantity over quality .
i knew we have the longest working hours in europe and yet some of the lowest productivity , now i find out that we have the longest school terms in europe , with some of the lowest educational standards .
same in my office , it 's not how good at your job that determines bonuses and promotions , it 's how much extra overtime you 're perceived to have done .
being good at your job and getting things done in normal office hours gets no praise , yet if you are seen to be working late to get the same tasks done it 's fast track to management .
nick , london it 's important to consider how long students get other holiday breaks during the year .
i know my friends in england get 2 weeks at easter , and longer breaks for certain holidays than in canada .
while we get out of school in mid-june , the numbers seem to balance out either way .
kalvis mikelsteins , toronto , canada i have always believed 6 weeks is far too long , everything is more expensive during the hols , also , the children do get very bored , it is hard for working parents to provide the time to go out especially during the week to spend with our children .
i think the summer hols should be split up more , extra week at easter , christmas , and perhaps have another week half term during the year .
jackie smith , newton abbot devon why do people bother to have children if they never want to spend any time with them ?
starting school even younger , longer hours at school , longer terms .
having children is a privilege not a right .
if you decide to have a child , then please spend quality time with them , giving them a sense of identity and security rather than leaving them to be raised by tired , worn out and disillusioned school teachers .
roxanne , london in response to roxanne i have to say i do raise my children and i spend quality time with them .
i also work - i believe i also have a duty to support the children i chose to have financially - as a working parent i have to work 9-5 and as such an 8-6 school day suits my needs .
it 's a fact of life that many parents have to , or want to work - providing a positive role model for their children .
or should we all give up our jobs and rely on the state ?
i work part time - between 8:30 and 4:30 tues-thurs i do not magically stop being a parent - i still raise my children - they just spend 22 hours a week at school or with a childminder !
for working parents those 6 weeks can be a nightmare of juggling childcare and work !

but you can not rely on a relic of the nineteenth century to keep us moving today .
by the time the government started considering the problem in the late 1990s it was obvious - the tube needed rebuilding .
easy to say , almost unimaginably hard to do .
bustling beneath after all three million journeys are made on the system every day .
many of its tunnels are too narrow to stand in , let alone work in , when a train is passing .
stations , tracks , signalling and trains all need attention .
the government had a choice .
it could let london underground , controlled by mayor ken livingstone , borrow billions of pounds and do the work itself .
or , bring in the private sector , in a new manifestation of the public-private partnership that was already being used to rebuild schools and hospitals .
gordon brown , for it was his pet project , decided on the latter when he was chancellor .
the famous tube map was split up into three sets of lines , each with its own contract .
metronet took control of two of the three - and is now responsible for maintaining and improving the bakerloo , central , victoria , district and circle , and metropolitan lines , among others .
mr livingstone was furious and even tried to stop the plan in court .
but he failed , and has had to spend recent years presiding over a system he entirely disagrees with .
in practice the work - dirty and physical - is done at night , when trains are n't running .
' extremely confident ' the crucial test of the new private contractors is their ability to get the system open again in the morning - especially after the weekend , when commuting hits a rush-hour peak .
it is a test metronet failed earlier this week at victoria as some platforms remained shut following weekend work .
the current row , and problems metronet has encountered , is about the financial efficiency of the company .
metronet claims its contract with london underground is not fixed but flexible .
it varies depending on the amount of work , with more money paid if extra work is needed .
metronet says that is exactly what has happened .
writing in the company 's in-house magazine , its chairman graham pimlott said " the condition and even the existence of some assets were unknown " .
he also says london underground has asked metronet to do more - especially to improve stations .
" i 'm extremely confident that we shall be paid a large sum of money , " he says .
with metronet calling in the administrators , mr pimlott 's confidence seems to have been misplaced .
cash bank metronet has exhausted its supply of cash from its banks , and had asked the independent ppp , chris bolt , for an initial increase of £ 551m from london underground to cover the extra work .
mr bolt , whose job is ensuring public money is well spent , refused and was highly critical of the company .
his draft decision , which triggered metronet 's slide into administration , allowed for only £ 121m in extra funds , nowhere near enough .
he told bbc news : " if they had been delivering properly they would have had cash in the bank , not these debts . "
the problem for metronet is that the other ppp company , tubelines , appears to be making ends meet .
some experts believe the difference between the two is down to the way they operate .
tubelines subcontracts to other suppliers the work on tracks , trains and stations .
metronet is a consortium of suppliers - including balfour beatty , atkins , edf energy and thames water - and it may be that their costs are simply too high .
bright future ?
so what happens now ? "
with metronet in administration at least all involved could consider the future " tom symonds the priority is to keep the tube running , and maintenance workers at their jobs .
then the administrators would try to pay off the companies creditors .
metronet 's problems may seem familiar , in so much as they are a smaller version of the spectacular collapse into administration of the overground railway company railtrack .
the difference is that then , it was the government cutting the supply of cash .
this time it is the regulator - the official arbiter .
one sobering fact is that it took two years for railtrack 's replacement , network rail , to emerge .
breathing space with metronet in administration at least all involved could consider the future .
the options : should metronet be split up into more manageable chunks ?
or should the contract be re-let ?
should the arbiter or the government pump in more money ?
and should the ppp experiment be stopped , at least the metronet segment of it , with tube maintenance taken back in-house .

keeping the tube running is a massive undertaking costing billions but you can not rely on a relic of the nineteenth century to keep us moving today .
by the time the government started considering the problem in the late 1990s it was obvious - the tube needed rebuilding .
easy to say , almost unimaginably hard to do .
bustling beneath after all three million journeys are made on the system every day .
many of its tunnels are too narrow to stand in , let alone work in , when a train is passing .
stations , tracks , signalling and trains all need attention .
the government had a choice .
it could let london underground , controlled by mayor ken livingstone , borrow billions of pounds and do the work itself .
or , bring in the private sector , in a new manifestation of the public-private partnership that was already being used to rebuild schools and hospitals .
gordon brown , for it was his pet project , decided on the latter when he was chancellor .
gordon brown has been criticised for his decision to create the ppp the famous tube map was split up into three sets of lines , each with its own contract .
metronet took control of two of the three - and is now responsible for maintaining and improving the bakerloo , central , victoria , district and circle , and metropolitan lines , among others .
mr livingstone was furious and even tried to stop the plan in court .
but he failed , and has had to spend recent years presiding over a system he entirely disagrees with .
in practice the work - dirty and physical - is done at night , when trains are n't running .
' extremely confident ' the crucial test of the new private contractors is their ability to get the system open again in the morning - especially after the weekend , when commuting hits a rush-hour peak .
it is a test metronet failed earlier this week at victoria as some platforms remained shut following weekend work .
the current row , and problems metronet has encountered , is about the financial efficiency of the company .
london 's tube is set to undergo a massive period of change metronet claims its contract with london underground is not fixed but flexible .
it varies depending on the amount of work , with more money paid if extra work is needed .
metronet says that is exactly what has happened .
writing in the company 's in-house magazine , its chairman graham pimlott said " the condition and even the existence of some assets were unknown " .
he also says london underground has asked metronet to do more - especially to improve stations .
" i 'm extremely confident that we shall be paid a large sum of money , " he says .
with metronet calling in the administrators , mr pimlott 's confidence seems to have been misplaced .
cash bank metronet has exhausted its supply of cash from its banks , and had asked the independent ppp , chris bolt , for an initial increase of £ 551m from london underground to cover the extra work .
mr bolt , whose job is ensuring public money is well spent , refused and was highly critical of the company .
his draft decision , which triggered metronet 's slide into administration , allowed for only £ 121m in extra funds , nowhere near enough .
he told bbc news : " if they had been delivering properly they would have had cash in the bank , not these debts . "
the problem for metronet is that the other ppp company , tubelines , appears to be making ends meet .
some experts believe the difference between the two is down to the way they operate .
tubelines subcontracts to other suppliers the work on tracks , trains and stations .
metronet is a consortium of suppliers - including balfour beatty , atkins , edf energy and thames water - and it may be that their costs are simply too high .
bright future ?
so what happens now ?
with metronet in administration at least all involved could consider the future tom symonds the priority is to keep the tube running , and maintenance workers at their jobs .
then the administrators would try to pay off the companies creditors .
metronet 's problems may seem familiar , in so much as they are a smaller version of the spectacular collapse into administration of the overground railway company railtrack .
the difference is that then , it was the government cutting the supply of cash .
this time it is the regulator - the official arbiter .
one sobering fact is that it took two years for railtrack 's replacement , network rail , to emerge .
breathing space with metronet in administration at least all involved could consider the future .
the options : should metronet be split up into more manageable chunks ?
or should the contract be re-let ?
should the arbiter or the government pump in more money ?
and should the ppp experiment be stopped , at least the metronet segment of it , with tube maintenance taken back in-house .
that would be a severe embarrassment to the man who dreamt up the whole idea .
because of course , gordon brown , is now the prime minister .

chlamydia cases are four times that of 1996 , and cases of infectious syphilis increased more than 10-fold .
the figures only include those infections diagnosed at genito-urinary medicine -lrb- gum -rrb- clinics .
a spokeswoman for the scottish executive said the rise was partly explained by greater awareness and improved testing .
while nearly 18,000 cases of chlamydia were diagnosed last year , less than half of these - 8,832 - were diagnosed at gum clinics .
this compares with 8,095 cases diagnosed at gum clinics the previous year .
chlamydia cases at gums 2006 - 8,832 2005 - 8,095 2004 - 7,090 1996 - 1,770 sexual health treatment ' in days ' the cases were mostly seen among people under 25 .
the total number of cases of sexually-transmitted infections diagnosed at gum clinics was 21,461 , compared to 20,138 in 2005 - and fewer than 11,000 in 1996 .
nearly all types of infection showed an increase since 2005 , although the number of newly-diagnosed cases of hiv fell from 111 to 88 .
the number of cases of infectious syphilis went up from 188 in 2005 to 246 last year - more than 10-times the 1996 figure of 21 cases .
officials said most of cases were among the gay community in edinburgh and glasgow .
a spokeswoman for the scottish executive said poor sexual health was a major public health issue , and that nhs boards had been asked to address rising levels of sexually-transmitted infection as part of a scotland-wide action plan .
she said : " within health boards , a nominated nhs board director and lead clinician are responsible for taking forward actions in their area .
' raise awareness ' she added that the executive had made an extra £ 4.5m per annum available over the financial years 2005-06 , 2006-07 and 2007-08 to improve clinic services .
conservative msp mary scanlon said the figure showed a " shocking and dramatic " increase , particularly in cases of chlamydia .
she added : " one of the most worrying concerns is that this std is mainly symptomless and can lead to infertility .
" i hope that the new health secretary will raise awareness of this infection in both men and women , as the consequences of infertility can be devastating for those wishing to have children . "
the british medical association -lrb- bma -rrb- said the increase showed the need for urgent action and even more funding to improve sexual health services .
