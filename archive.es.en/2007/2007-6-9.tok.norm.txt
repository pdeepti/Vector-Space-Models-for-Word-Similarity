but it 's still a struggle .
dw-world.de examines the trials and triumphs of two clubs : hansa rostock and magdeburg . it went down to the last day of the second-division season , but in the end hansa rostock got the job done .
a 3-1 win over unterhachingen sent them back to the bundesliga 's top flight after a two-year absence . rostock 's revival may signal a minor renaissance in eastern german soccer .
but the club 's president , dirk grabow realizes that , for eastern and western german clubs alike , success is not always easy to consolidate . " that 's the fate of all small clubs : you 're always confronted with the possibility of going down , " grabow said .

that makes rostock the most successful eastern german club since the country 's reunification in 1990 . the keys to that success include an emphasis on team chemistry over individual stars , youth development and financial discipline .
and hansa 's management maintained a cool head even after being relegated . " we did n't feel like we had to be afraid of spending the rest of eternity in the second division , " grabow said .

they are proud of that legacy - and the responsibility that comes with it . " we 're very conscious that we 're something of a flagship for eastern german soccer because of our decade in the first division , " grabow said .

" we always say that magdeburg never got relegated , " said commercial manager bernd hofmann .
" but we still dropped down to soccer 's nether regions . " the nadir came in 2002 , when the club had to file for bankruptcy . " after reunification , a lot of eastern german clubs did n't really know how a market economy worked , " hofmann said .

" we can certainly not impose anything on africa on the basis of our european experience , " merkel told a podium discussion that included 2006 nobel peace prize laureate muhammed yunus .

" globalization can only succeed if there are social minimum standards and minimum standards in the environment , " she said .
" we have to implement these . "
merkel , herself the daughter of a lutheran minister , was rounding off a busy week with her attendance at the german evangelical church -lrb- ekd -rrb- ecumenical congress , held in the shadow of cologne 's famous catholic cathedral .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee " we need the expertise in this technology and we need the jobs which the sector will generate , " said german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , whose country is current president of the eu .
all 27 ministers approved the plan , which will require an initial outlay of 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- of public money towards the project 's total cost of about 4 billion euros .
this would come on top of the 1.3 billion euros national governments have already committed to galileo , seen as europe 's answer to the us-operated global positioning system gps .
private involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps is already used in millions of navigation systems in cars amid internal bickering , the eight companies from five countries involved in galileo had missed a may 10 deadline to decide how to share work on the project .
after the initial investment , private industry will be tasked with operating the system and new bids will be called for operation and maintenance of satellites , only one of which is in orbit .
there were originally to be 30 satellites in place by 2010 , but the timeline for galileo to be fully operational was moved to 2012 due to delays inside the industry consortium .
the system is to be used for civilian purposes only , monitoring natural disasters , air and sea rescue services and for a range of commercial uses .

eu officials had warned that the bloc could lose out in the international competition for global space technology as the us , russia , china and japan are busy building and improving their satellite navigation technology .
the gps system - run by the us defense department - is offered free to businesses worldwide , while galileo plans to charge users .
galileo 's original consortium included the franco-german aerospace consortium eads , france 's thales and alcatel-lucent , british company inmarsat , italy 's finmeccanica , aena and hispasat of spain and a german group with deutsche telekom and the german aerospace center .
the eu hopes that galileo will generate at least 150,000 jobs and bring a return of investments of up to 9 billion euros , making it the continent 's most lucrative infrastructure project .

" we can certainly not impose anything on africa on the basis of our european experience , " merkel told a podium discussion that included 2006 nobel peace prize laureate muhammed yunus .
but the chancellor added that minimum standards in some areas had to be set for all countries .
" globalization can only succeed if there are social minimum standards and minimum standards in the environment , " she said .
" we have to implement these . "
merkel , herself the daughter of a lutheran minister , was rounding off a busy week with her attendance at the german evangelical church -lrb- ekd -rrb- ecumenical congress , held in the shadow of cologne 's famous catholic cathedral .
nearly 4,000 guests from abroad and more than 100,000 german participants have been attending the lutheran congress which began wednesday and wraps up on sunday .
it is one of germany 's most significant ecumenical events .
merkel : fair trade needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with ghanaian president john a. kufuor on friday on friday , merkel had met african leaders , including ghaniaian president john kufuor , current chairman of the african union , in the northern german resort of heiligendamm .

" it 's necessary to freeze the deployment of missile defense systems in europe for a period of study and analysis , " he was quoted by itar-tass as saying .
he went on to say that the us missile defense plans could " seriously complicate " efforts by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to resolve the stand-off over iran 's nuclear program .
" work is under way within the framework of the united nations , the iaea , " he said .
" we want this to fully clarify all aspects .

" at the moment there is enough information on hypothetical threats provided by the radar station in azerbaijan , " he said .
" it is a reliable warning station .
joint use of information from the station would allow the united states to refrain from deploying elements of the missile shield in europe and from deployment of its space components . "
russia has strongly objected to the us plans to deploy a radar system in the czech republic and linked interceptor missiles in poland - european countries that were under moscow 's control in soviet times .
putin insisted on thursday that the radar in azerbaijan , which is currently under russian control , could be shared with washington and would be able to detect any missile fired by iran .
nato , us doubts experts and the secretary general of nato , jaap de hoop scheffer , have voiced doubts about the azerbaijani radar 's ability to meet us requirement .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee " we need the expertise in this technology and we need the jobs which the sector will generate , " said german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , whose country is current president of the eu .
all 27 ministers approved the plan , which will require an initial outlay of 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- of public money towards the project 's total cost of about 4 billion euros .
this would come on top of the 1.3 billion euros national governments have already committed to galileo , seen as europe 's answer to the us-operated global positioning system gps .
private involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps is already used in millions of navigation systems in cars amid internal bickering , the eight companies from five countries involved in galileo had missed a may 10 deadline to decide how to share work on the project .
after the initial investment , private industry will be tasked with operating the system and new bids will be called for operation and maintenance of satellites , only one of which is in orbit .
there were originally to be 30 satellites in place by 2010 , but the timeline for galileo to be fully operational was moved to 2012 due to delays inside the industry consortium .

there were originally to be 30 satellites in place by 2010 , but the timeline for galileo to be fully operational was moved to 2012 due to delays inside the industry consortium .

private involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps is already used in millions of navigation systems in cars amid internal bickering , the eight companies from five countries involved in galileo had missed a may 10 deadline to decide how to share work on the project .
after the initial investment , private industry will be tasked with operating the system and new bids will be called for operation and maintenance of satellites , only one of which is in orbit .
there were originally to be 30 satellites in place by 2010 , but the timeline for galileo to be fully operational was moved to 2012 due to delays inside the industry consortium .
the system is to be used for civilian purposes only , monitoring natural disasters , air and sea rescue services and for a range of commercial uses .
falling behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can galileo still catch up with other programs ?
eu officials had warned that the bloc could lose out in the international competition for global space technology as the us , russia , china and japan are busy building and improving their satellite navigation technology .
the gps system - run by the us defense department - is offered free to businesses worldwide , while galileo plans to charge users .
galileo 's original consortium included the franco-german aerospace consortium eads , france 's thales and alcatel-lucent , british company inmarsat , italy 's finmeccanica , aena and hispasat of spain and a german group with deutsche telekom and the german aerospace center .
the eu hopes that galileo will generate at least 150,000 jobs and bring a return of investments of up to 9 billion euros , making it the continent 's most lucrative infrastructure project .
china , israel , the us , ukraine , india , morocco and south korea have also agreed to invest in galileo . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says public funding needed to rescue galileo from delays the european commission said on wednesday that the eu should inject huge amounts of public money into the prestigious galileo satellite navigation system to rescue it from bickering among private-sector investors .

" it 's necessary to freeze the deployment of missile defense systems in europe for a period of study and analysis , " he was quoted by itar-tass as saying .
he went on to say that the us missile defense plans could " seriously complicate " efforts by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to resolve the stand-off over iran 's nuclear program .

" at the moment there is enough information on hypothetical threats provided by the radar station in azerbaijan , " he said .
" it is a reliable warning station .
joint use of information from the station would allow the united states to refrain from deploying elements of the missile shield in europe and from deployment of its space components . "
russia has strongly objected to the us plans to deploy a radar system in the czech republic and linked interceptor missiles in poland - european countries that were under moscow 's control in soviet times .
putin insisted on thursday that the radar in azerbaijan , which is currently under russian control , could be shared with washington and would be able to detect any missile fired by iran .
nato , us doubts experts and the secretary general of nato , jaap de hoop scheffer , have voiced doubts about the azerbaijani radar 's ability to meet us requirement .

a 3-1 win over unterhachingen sent them back to the bundesliga 's top flight after a two-year absence . rostock 's revival may signal a minor renaissance in eastern german soccer .

that makes rostock the most successful eastern german club since the country 's reunification in 1990 . the keys to that success include an emphasis on team chemistry over individual stars , youth development and financial discipline .

" we always say that magdeburg never got relegated , " said commercial manager bernd hofmann .
" but we still dropped down to soccer 's nether regions . " the nadir came in 2002 , when the club had to file for bankruptcy . " after reunification , a lot of eastern german clubs did n't really know how a market economy worked , " hofmann said .

that makes rostock the most successful eastern german club since the country 's reunification in 1990 . the keys to that success include an emphasis on team chemistry over individual stars , youth development and financial discipline .

they are proud of that legacy - and the responsibility that comes with it . " we 're very conscious that we 're something of a flagship for eastern german soccer because of our decade in the first division , " grabow said .

" but we still dropped down to soccer 's nether regions . " the nadir came in 2002 , when the club had to file for bankruptcy . " after reunification , a lot of eastern german clubs did n't really know how a market economy worked , " hofmann said .

" we can certainly not impose anything on africa on the basis of our european experience , " merkel told a podium discussion that included 2006 nobel peace prize laureate muhammed yunus .
but the chancellor added that minimum standards in some areas had to be set for all countries .
" globalization can only succeed if there are social minimum standards and minimum standards in the environment , " she said .
" we have to implement these . "
merkel , herself the daughter of a lutheran minister , was rounding off a busy week with her attendance at the german evangelical church -lrb- ekd -rrb- ecumenical congress , held in the shadow of cologne 's famous catholic cathedral .
nearly 4,000 guests from abroad and more than 100,000 german participants have been attending the lutheran congress which began wednesday and wraps up on sunday .
it is one of germany 's most significant ecumenical events .
merkel : fair trade needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with ghanaian president john a. kufuor on friday on friday , merkel had met african leaders , including ghaniaian president john kufuor , current chairman of the african union , in the northern german resort of heiligendamm .
the g8 summit was just one of many steps on the road to a more just global economy , merkel said .
" the poorest countries will only have a chance with their products if they have fair conditions of trade , " she added .
the general secretary of the all africa conference of churches , bishop mvume dandala , said europe should see africans as partners rather than as supplicants or beggars .
inhumane banking system ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and yunus in cologne yunus , whose micro-credits to the very poor and especially to women secured him the nobel prize , outlined his vision of a new kind of development aid .
two-thirds of humanity had no access to banks , he noted , querying whether the current banking system was humane .
yunus explained how his home country bangladesh is on the way to halve poverty by 2015 in line with un goals .

that makes rostock the most successful eastern german club since the country 's reunification in 1990 . the keys to that success include an emphasis on team chemistry over individual stars , youth development and financial discipline .

they are proud of that legacy - and the responsibility that comes with it . " we 're very conscious that we 're something of a flagship for eastern german soccer because of our decade in the first division , " grabow said .

" but we still dropped down to soccer 's nether regions . " the nadir came in 2002 , when the club had to file for bankruptcy . " after reunification , a lot of eastern german clubs did n't really know how a market economy worked , " hofmann said .

dw-world.de examines the trials and triumphs of two clubs : hansa rostock and magdeburg . it went down to the last day of the second-division season , but in the end hansa rostock got the job done .
a 3-1 win over unterhachingen sent them back to the bundesliga 's top flight after a two-year absence . rostock 's revival may signal a minor renaissance in eastern german soccer .
but the club 's president , dirk grabow realizes that , for eastern and western german clubs alike , success is not always easy to consolidate . " that 's the fate of all small clubs : you 're always confronted with the possibility of going down , " grabow said .

that makes rostock the most successful eastern german club since the country 's reunification in 1990 . the keys to that success include an emphasis on team chemistry over individual stars , youth development and financial discipline .
and hansa 's management maintained a cool head even after being relegated . " we did n't feel like we had to be afraid of spending the rest of eternity in the second division , " grabow said .

they are proud of that legacy - and the responsibility that comes with it . " we 're very conscious that we 're something of a flagship for eastern german soccer because of our decade in the first division , " grabow said .

few realize there is a third , german-speaking minority . headlines in belgium tend to be dominated by the tug-of-war between the flemish , based in the country 's north , who want more autonomy from the less prosperous , french-speaking areas that are still coming to terms with the post-industrial age .
but belgium has another official linguistic group : the germans who live on the eastern border and make up only one percent of the population .
the area was ceded to belgium after the world war i under the terms of the versailles treaty .
over the decades , a unique belgo-german way of life has developed .
the capital of the german-speaking region is eupen , close to the german city of aachen .
the area formally belongs to the province of liège , but this minority community is autonomous and functions like a federal state of its own .
lingua franca : german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian capital brussels is used to seeing many flags flying people here mainly speak german in shops and schools , watch german tv channels and even have their own german-language newspaper , the grenz-echo or border echo .
the sports page covers bundesliga games , of course .
but editor-in-chief gérard cremer said his readership has a broader outlook .
" people are also interested in how anderlecht or standard liège are doing , " he said .
" that 's why they read the grenz-echo .
that 's why it is not your normal newspaper in that sense .
it 's our job to bring belgium closer to our readers . "
many people here might only be able to name the belgian prime minister , while they can list the entire german cabinet .
nevertheless , they are belgian and they certainly do n't want to be called germans .
" we are a mix and i mean that positively , " cremer said .
" not just linguistically , but also in terms of our mentality , in all ways really . "
but cremer added that the minority here are culturally german .
and there are a lot of active cultural organizations here .
multi-layered identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french-speaking and dutch-speaking communities look set to dominate the election , but the german-speaking minority is far from dissatisfied the flags at the headquarters of the government of the german-speaking community reflect the area 's diverse allegiances .
the belgian flag flutters next to the european union 's blue star-sprinkled banner , the arms of the province and the emblem of the german-speaking community - a red lion surrounded by nine blue gentians .
the area 's deputy premier , bernd gentges , said he appreciates his community 's status .
" we think that we are one of the best protected minorities in europe , " he said .
one of gentges 's responsibilities is the integration of immigrants from other countries .
but most of them come from germany and do not present any " acute problems " , according to gentges .
they come because of the lower taxes and the more favorable housebuilding conditions in belgium .
many are employed over the border , in aachen , for example , which is just 17 kilometers -lrb- 10.6 miles -rrb- away .
but not only the recent immigrants tend to commute across national frontiers to work : many of the longstanding members of the german-language community are employed in germany or luxembourg .
gentges sees this with mixed feelings .
" the advantage is that people have greater purchasing power , " he said .
" disadvantages arise because many qualified workers are going to luxembourg and then there is a shortage of those workers here .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee " we need the expertise in this technology and we need the jobs which the sector will generate , " said german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , whose country is current president of the eu .
all 27 ministers approved the plan , which will require an initial outlay of 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- of public money towards the project 's total cost of about 4 billion euros .
this would come on top of the 1.3 billion euros national governments have already committed to galileo , seen as europe 's answer to the us-operated global positioning system gps .
private involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps is already used in millions of navigation systems in cars amid internal bickering , the eight companies from five countries involved in galileo had missed a may 10 deadline to decide how to share work on the project .
after the initial investment , private industry will be tasked with operating the system and new bids will be called for operation and maintenance of satellites , only one of which is in orbit .
there were originally to be 30 satellites in place by 2010 , but the timeline for galileo to be fully operational was moved to 2012 due to delays inside the industry consortium .
the system is to be used for civilian purposes only , monitoring natural disasters , air and sea rescue services and for a range of commercial uses .

the gps system - run by the us defense department - is offered free to businesses worldwide , while galileo plans to charge users .
galileo 's original consortium included the franco-german aerospace consortium eads , france 's thales and alcatel-lucent , british company inmarsat , italy 's finmeccanica , aena and hispasat of spain and a german group with deutsche telekom and the german aerospace center .
the eu hopes that galileo will generate at least 150,000 jobs and bring a return of investments of up to 9 billion euros , making it the continent 's most lucrative infrastructure project .

" we can certainly not impose anything on africa on the basis of our european experience , " merkel told a podium discussion that included 2006 nobel peace prize laureate muhammed yunus .
but the chancellor added that minimum standards in some areas had to be set for all countries .
" globalization can only succeed if there are social minimum standards and minimum standards in the environment , " she said .
" we have to implement these . "
merkel , herself the daughter of a lutheran minister , was rounding off a busy week with her attendance at the german evangelical church -lrb- ekd -rrb- ecumenical congress , held in the shadow of cologne 's famous catholic cathedral .
nearly 4,000 guests from abroad and more than 100,000 german participants have been attending the lutheran congress which began wednesday and wraps up on sunday .

the g8 summit was just one of many steps on the road to a more just global economy , merkel said .
" the poorest countries will only have a chance with their products if they have fair conditions of trade , " she added .
the general secretary of the all africa conference of churches , bishop mvume dandala , said europe should see africans as partners rather than as supplicants or beggars .

yunus explained how his home country bangladesh is on the way to halve poverty by 2015 in line with un goals .
old promises ?
at the g8 summit merkel and kufuor pledged to keep previous pledges - the g8 countries to implement the ambitious aid program outlined at gleneagles two years ago and the african countries to fight corruption and ensure good governance .
the rich industrialized countries pledged a $ 60-billion -lrb- 44.5-billion euro -rrb- fund to fight aids , tuberculosis and malaria , with half of it going to africa , but non-governmental aid organizations were critical , saying most of the money promised was not new . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but belgium has another official linguistic group : the germans who live on the eastern border and make up only one percent of the population .
the area was ceded to belgium after the world war i under the terms of the versailles treaty .
over the decades , a unique belgo-german way of life has developed .

few realize there is a third , german-speaking minority . headlines in belgium tend to be dominated by the tug-of-war between the flemish , based in the country 's north , who want more autonomy from the less prosperous , french-speaking areas that are still coming to terms with the post-industrial age .
but belgium has another official linguistic group : the germans who live on the eastern border and make up only one percent of the population .
the area was ceded to belgium after the world war i under the terms of the versailles treaty .
over the decades , a unique belgo-german way of life has developed .
the capital of the german-speaking region is eupen , close to the german city of aachen .
the area formally belongs to the province of liège , but this minority community is autonomous and functions like a federal state of its own .

the sports page covers bundesliga games , of course .
but editor-in-chief gérard cremer said his readership has a broader outlook .
" people are also interested in how anderlecht or standard liège are doing , " he said .
" that 's why they read the grenz-echo .
that 's why it is not your normal newspaper in that sense .
it 's our job to bring belgium closer to our readers . "
many people here might only be able to name the belgian prime minister , while they can list the entire german cabinet .
nevertheless , they are belgian and they certainly do n't want to be called germans .
" we are a mix and i mean that positively , " cremer said .
" not just linguistically , but also in terms of our mentality , in all ways really . "
but cremer added that the minority here are culturally german .
and there are a lot of active cultural organizations here .
multi-layered identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french-speaking and dutch-speaking communities look set to dominate the election , but the german-speaking minority is far from dissatisfied the flags at the headquarters of the government of the german-speaking community reflect the area 's diverse allegiances .
the belgian flag flutters next to the european union 's blue star-sprinkled banner , the arms of the province and the emblem of the german-speaking community - a red lion surrounded by nine blue gentians .
the area 's deputy premier , bernd gentges , said he appreciates his community 's status .
" we think that we are one of the best protected minorities in europe , " he said .
one of gentges 's responsibilities is the integration of immigrants from other countries .
but most of them come from germany and do not present any " acute problems " , according to gentges .
they come because of the lower taxes and the more favorable housebuilding conditions in belgium .
many are employed over the border , in aachen , for example , which is just 17 kilometers -lrb- 10.6 miles -rrb- away .
but not only the recent immigrants tend to commute across national frontiers to work : many of the longstanding members of the german-language community are employed in germany or luxembourg .
gentges sees this with mixed feelings .
" the advantage is that people have greater purchasing power , " he said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee " we need the expertise in this technology and we need the jobs which the sector will generate , " said german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , whose country is current president of the eu .
all 27 ministers approved the plan , which will require an initial outlay of 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- of public money towards the project 's total cost of about 4 billion euros .
this would come on top of the 1.3 billion euros national governments have already committed to galileo , seen as europe 's answer to the us-operated global positioning system gps .

after the initial investment , private industry will be tasked with operating the system and new bids will be called for operation and maintenance of satellites , only one of which is in orbit .
there were originally to be 30 satellites in place by 2010 , but the timeline for galileo to be fully operational was moved to 2012 due to delays inside the industry consortium .
the system is to be used for civilian purposes only , monitoring natural disasters , air and sea rescue services and for a range of commercial uses .

eu officials had warned that the bloc could lose out in the international competition for global space technology as the us , russia , china and japan are busy building and improving their satellite navigation technology .
the gps system - run by the us defense department - is offered free to businesses worldwide , while galileo plans to charge users .
galileo 's original consortium included the franco-german aerospace consortium eads , france 's thales and alcatel-lucent , british company inmarsat , italy 's finmeccanica , aena and hispasat of spain and a german group with deutsche telekom and the german aerospace center .
the eu hopes that galileo will generate at least 150,000 jobs and bring a return of investments of up to 9 billion euros , making it the continent 's most lucrative infrastructure project .

" it 's necessary to freeze the deployment of missile defense systems in europe for a period of study and analysis , " he was quoted by itar-tass as saying .
he went on to say that the us missile defense plans could " seriously complicate " efforts by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to resolve the stand-off over iran 's nuclear program .
" work is under way within the framework of the united nations , the iaea , " he said .

" at the moment there is enough information on hypothetical threats provided by the radar station in azerbaijan , " he said .
" it is a reliable warning station .
joint use of information from the station would allow the united states to refrain from deploying elements of the missile shield in europe and from deployment of its space components . "
russia has strongly objected to the us plans to deploy a radar system in the czech republic and linked interceptor missiles in poland - european countries that were under moscow 's control in soviet times .
putin insisted on thursday that the radar in azerbaijan , which is currently under russian control , could be shared with washington and would be able to detect any missile fired by iran .
nato , us doubts experts and the secretary general of nato , jaap de hoop scheffer , have voiced doubts about the azerbaijani radar 's ability to meet us requirement .

" we can certainly not impose anything on africa on the basis of our european experience , " merkel told a podium discussion that included 2006 nobel peace prize laureate muhammed yunus .
but the chancellor added that minimum standards in some areas had to be set for all countries .
" globalization can only succeed if there are social minimum standards and minimum standards in the environment , " she said .
" we have to implement these . "
merkel , herself the daughter of a lutheran minister , was rounding off a busy week with her attendance at the german evangelical church -lrb- ekd -rrb- ecumenical congress , held in the shadow of cologne 's famous catholic cathedral .
nearly 4,000 guests from abroad and more than 100,000 german participants have been attending the lutheran congress which began wednesday and wraps up on sunday .
it is one of germany 's most significant ecumenical events .
merkel : fair trade needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with ghanaian president john a. kufuor on friday on friday , merkel had met african leaders , including ghaniaian president john kufuor , current chairman of the african union , in the northern german resort of heiligendamm .
the g8 summit was just one of many steps on the road to a more just global economy , merkel said .
" the poorest countries will only have a chance with their products if they have fair conditions of trade , " she added .

" we can certainly not impose anything on africa on the basis of our european experience , " merkel told a podium discussion that included 2006 nobel peace prize laureate muhammed yunus .
but the chancellor added that minimum standards in some areas had to be set for all countries .
" globalization can only succeed if there are social minimum standards and minimum standards in the environment , " she said .
" we have to implement these . "
merkel , herself the daughter of a lutheran minister , was rounding off a busy week with her attendance at the german evangelical church -lrb- ekd -rrb- ecumenical congress , held in the shadow of cologne 's famous catholic cathedral .
nearly 4,000 guests from abroad and more than 100,000 german participants have been attending the lutheran congress which began wednesday and wraps up on sunday .
it is one of germany 's most significant ecumenical events .
merkel : fair trade needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with ghanaian president john a. kufuor on friday on friday , merkel had met african leaders , including ghaniaian president john kufuor , current chairman of the african union , in the northern german resort of heiligendamm .
the g8 summit was just one of many steps on the road to a more just global economy , merkel said .
" the poorest countries will only have a chance with their products if they have fair conditions of trade , " she added .
the general secretary of the all africa conference of churches , bishop mvume dandala , said europe should see africans as partners rather than as supplicants or beggars .
inhumane banking system ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and yunus in cologne yunus , whose micro-credits to the very poor and especially to women secured him the nobel prize , outlined his vision of a new kind of development aid .
two-thirds of humanity had no access to banks , he noted , querying whether the current banking system was humane .
yunus explained how his home country bangladesh is on the way to halve poverty by 2015 in line with un goals .
old promises ?
at the g8 summit merkel and kufuor pledged to keep previous pledges - the g8 countries to implement the ambitious aid program outlined at gleneagles two years ago and the african countries to fight corruption and ensure good governance .
the rich industrialized countries pledged a $ 60-billion -lrb- 44.5-billion euro -rrb- fund to fight aids , tuberculosis and malaria , with half of it going to africa , but non-governmental aid organizations were critical , saying most of the money promised was not new . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

few realize there is a third , german-speaking minority . headlines in belgium tend to be dominated by the tug-of-war between the flemish , based in the country 's north , who want more autonomy from the less prosperous , french-speaking areas that are still coming to terms with the post-industrial age .
but belgium has another official linguistic group : the germans who live on the eastern border and make up only one percent of the population .
the area was ceded to belgium after the world war i under the terms of the versailles treaty .
over the decades , a unique belgo-german way of life has developed .
the capital of the german-speaking region is eupen , close to the german city of aachen .
the area formally belongs to the province of liège , but this minority community is autonomous and functions like a federal state of its own .
lingua franca : german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian capital brussels is used to seeing many flags flying people here mainly speak german in shops and schools , watch german tv channels and even have their own german-language newspaper , the grenz-echo or border echo .
the sports page covers bundesliga games , of course .
but editor-in-chief gérard cremer said his readership has a broader outlook .
" people are also interested in how anderlecht or standard liège are doing , " he said .
" that 's why they read the grenz-echo .
that 's why it is not your normal newspaper in that sense .
it 's our job to bring belgium closer to our readers . "
many people here might only be able to name the belgian prime minister , while they can list the entire german cabinet .
nevertheless , they are belgian and they certainly do n't want to be called germans .
" we are a mix and i mean that positively , " cremer said .
" not just linguistically , but also in terms of our mentality , in all ways really . "
but cremer added that the minority here are culturally german .
and there are a lot of active cultural organizations here .
multi-layered identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french-speaking and dutch-speaking communities look set to dominate the election , but the german-speaking minority is far from dissatisfied the flags at the headquarters of the government of the german-speaking community reflect the area 's diverse allegiances .
the belgian flag flutters next to the european union 's blue star-sprinkled banner , the arms of the province and the emblem of the german-speaking community - a red lion surrounded by nine blue gentians .
the area 's deputy premier , bernd gentges , said he appreciates his community 's status .
" we think that we are one of the best protected minorities in europe , " he said .
one of gentges 's responsibilities is the integration of immigrants from other countries .
but most of them come from germany and do not present any " acute problems " , according to gentges .
they come because of the lower taxes and the more favorable housebuilding conditions in belgium .
many are employed over the border , in aachen , for example , which is just 17 kilometers -lrb- 10.6 miles -rrb- away .
but not only the recent immigrants tend to commute across national frontiers to work : many of the longstanding members of the german-language community are employed in germany or luxembourg .
gentges sees this with mixed feelings .
" the advantage is that people have greater purchasing power , " he said .
" disadvantages arise because many qualified workers are going to luxembourg and then there is a shortage of those workers here .

" it 's necessary to freeze the deployment of missile defense systems in europe for a period of study and analysis , " he was quoted by itar-tass as saying .
he went on to say that the us missile defense plans could " seriously complicate " efforts by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to resolve the stand-off over iran 's nuclear program .
" work is under way within the framework of the united nations , the iaea , " he said .
" we want this to fully clarify all aspects .
the deployment of the missile shield in europe may complicate these efforts , put in question iran 's willingness to openly cooperate . "
reliable warning station ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin made the offer to bush during the g8 summit information from the gabala radar in azerbaijan , which putin said could be used jointly by russia and the united states , is sufficient for the detection of current threats , lavrov said .
" at the moment there is enough information on hypothetical threats provided by the radar station in azerbaijan , " he said .
" it is a reliable warning station .
joint use of information from the station would allow the united states to refrain from deploying elements of the missile shield in europe and from deployment of its space components . "
russia has strongly objected to the us plans to deploy a radar system in the czech republic and linked interceptor missiles in poland - european countries that were under moscow 's control in soviet times .
putin insisted on thursday that the radar in azerbaijan , which is currently under russian control , could be shared with washington and would be able to detect any missile fired by iran .
nato , us doubts experts and the secretary general of nato , jaap de hoop scheffer , have voiced doubts about the azerbaijani radar 's ability to meet us requirement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice did n't make it sound like the us was interested in accepting the russian offer us secretary of state condoleezza rice meanwhile said friday that the us would " take a look " at the proposal , but added that missile radar sites are n't " chosen out of the blue .

few realize there is a third , german-speaking minority . headlines in belgium tend to be dominated by the tug-of-war between the flemish , based in the country 's north , who want more autonomy from the less prosperous , french-speaking areas that are still coming to terms with the post-industrial age .
but belgium has another official linguistic group : the germans who live on the eastern border and make up only one percent of the population .
the area was ceded to belgium after the world war i under the terms of the versailles treaty .
over the decades , a unique belgo-german way of life has developed .

one of gentges 's responsibilities is the integration of immigrants from other countries .

" it 's necessary to freeze the deployment of missile defense systems in europe for a period of study and analysis , " he was quoted by itar-tass as saying .
he went on to say that the us missile defense plans could " seriously complicate " efforts by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to resolve the stand-off over iran 's nuclear program .
" work is under way within the framework of the united nations , the iaea , " he said .

" it is a reliable warning station .
joint use of information from the station would allow the united states to refrain from deploying elements of the missile shield in europe and from deployment of its space components . "
russia has strongly objected to the us plans to deploy a radar system in the czech republic and linked interceptor missiles in poland - european countries that were under moscow 's control in soviet times .

few realize there is a third , german-speaking minority . headlines in belgium tend to be dominated by the tug-of-war between the flemish , based in the country 's north , who want more autonomy from the less prosperous , french-speaking areas that are still coming to terms with the post-industrial age .
but belgium has another official linguistic group : the germans who live on the eastern border and make up only one percent of the population .
the area was ceded to belgium after the world war i under the terms of the versailles treaty .
over the decades , a unique belgo-german way of life has developed .
the capital of the german-speaking region is eupen , close to the german city of aachen .
the area formally belongs to the province of liège , but this minority community is autonomous and functions like a federal state of its own .
lingua franca : german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian capital brussels is used to seeing many flags flying people here mainly speak german in shops and schools , watch german tv channels and even have their own german-language newspaper , the grenz-echo or border echo .
the sports page covers bundesliga games , of course .
but editor-in-chief gérard cremer said his readership has a broader outlook .
" people are also interested in how anderlecht or standard liège are doing , " he said .
" that 's why they read the grenz-echo .
that 's why it is not your normal newspaper in that sense .
it 's our job to bring belgium closer to our readers . "
many people here might only be able to name the belgian prime minister , while they can list the entire german cabinet .
nevertheless , they are belgian and they certainly do n't want to be called germans .
" we are a mix and i mean that positively , " cremer said .
" not just linguistically , but also in terms of our mentality , in all ways really . "
but cremer added that the minority here are culturally german .
and there are a lot of active cultural organizations here .
multi-layered identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french-speaking and dutch-speaking communities look set to dominate the election , but the german-speaking minority is far from dissatisfied the flags at the headquarters of the government of the german-speaking community reflect the area 's diverse allegiances .
the belgian flag flutters next to the european union 's blue star-sprinkled banner , the arms of the province and the emblem of the german-speaking community - a red lion surrounded by nine blue gentians .
the area 's deputy premier , bernd gentges , said he appreciates his community 's status .
" we think that we are one of the best protected minorities in europe , " he said .
one of gentges 's responsibilities is the integration of immigrants from other countries .
but most of them come from germany and do not present any " acute problems " , according to gentges .
they come because of the lower taxes and the more favorable housebuilding conditions in belgium .
many are employed over the border , in aachen , for example , which is just 17 kilometers -lrb- 10.6 miles -rrb- away .
but not only the recent immigrants tend to commute across national frontiers to work : many of the longstanding members of the german-language community are employed in germany or luxembourg .
gentges sees this with mixed feelings .
" the advantage is that people have greater purchasing power , " he said .
" disadvantages arise because many qualified workers are going to luxembourg and then there is a shortage of those workers here .

" we can certainly not impose anything on africa on the basis of our european experience , " merkel told a podium discussion that included 2006 nobel peace prize laureate muhammed yunus .
but the chancellor added that minimum standards in some areas had to be set for all countries .
" globalization can only succeed if there are social minimum standards and minimum standards in the environment , " she said .
" we have to implement these . "
merkel , herself the daughter of a lutheran minister , was rounding off a busy week with her attendance at the german evangelical church -lrb- ekd -rrb- ecumenical congress , held in the shadow of cologne 's famous catholic cathedral .
nearly 4,000 guests from abroad and more than 100,000 german participants have been attending the lutheran congress which began wednesday and wraps up on sunday .
it is one of germany 's most significant ecumenical events .

the g8 summit was just one of many steps on the road to a more just global economy , merkel said .
" the poorest countries will only have a chance with their products if they have fair conditions of trade , " she added .
the general secretary of the all africa conference of churches , bishop mvume dandala , said europe should see africans as partners rather than as supplicants or beggars .

yunus explained how his home country bangladesh is on the way to halve poverty by 2015 in line with un goals .
old promises ?
at the g8 summit merkel and kufuor pledged to keep previous pledges - the g8 countries to implement the ambitious aid program outlined at gleneagles two years ago and the african countries to fight corruption and ensure good governance .
the rich industrialized countries pledged a $ 60-billion -lrb- 44.5-billion euro -rrb- fund to fight aids , tuberculosis and malaria , with half of it going to africa , but non-governmental aid organizations were critical , saying most of the money promised was not new . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee " we need the expertise in this technology and we need the jobs which the sector will generate , " said german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , whose country is current president of the eu .
all 27 ministers approved the plan , which will require an initial outlay of 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- of public money towards the project 's total cost of about 4 billion euros .
this would come on top of the 1.3 billion euros national governments have already committed to galileo , seen as europe 's answer to the us-operated global positioning system gps .
private involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps is already used in millions of navigation systems in cars amid internal bickering , the eight companies from five countries involved in galileo had missed a may 10 deadline to decide how to share work on the project .
after the initial investment , private industry will be tasked with operating the system and new bids will be called for operation and maintenance of satellites , only one of which is in orbit .
there were originally to be 30 satellites in place by 2010 , but the timeline for galileo to be fully operational was moved to 2012 due to delays inside the industry consortium .
the system is to be used for civilian purposes only , monitoring natural disasters , air and sea rescue services and for a range of commercial uses .
falling behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can galileo still catch up with other programs ?
eu officials had warned that the bloc could lose out in the international competition for global space technology as the us , russia , china and japan are busy building and improving their satellite navigation technology .
the gps system - run by the us defense department - is offered free to businesses worldwide , while galileo plans to charge users .
galileo 's original consortium included the franco-german aerospace consortium eads , france 's thales and alcatel-lucent , british company inmarsat , italy 's finmeccanica , aena and hispasat of spain and a german group with deutsche telekom and the german aerospace center .
the eu hopes that galileo will generate at least 150,000 jobs and bring a return of investments of up to 9 billion euros , making it the continent 's most lucrative infrastructure project .
china , israel , the us , ukraine , india , morocco and south korea have also agreed to invest in galileo . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says public funding needed to rescue galileo from delays the european commission said on wednesday that the eu should inject huge amounts of public money into the prestigious galileo satellite navigation system to rescue it from bickering among private-sector investors .

few realize there is a third , german-speaking minority . headlines in belgium tend to be dominated by the tug-of-war between the flemish , based in the country 's north , who want more autonomy from the less prosperous , french-speaking areas that are still coming to terms with the post-industrial age .
but belgium has another official linguistic group : the germans who live on the eastern border and make up only one percent of the population .
the area was ceded to belgium after the world war i under the terms of the versailles treaty .
over the decades , a unique belgo-german way of life has developed .
the capital of the german-speaking region is eupen , close to the german city of aachen .
the area formally belongs to the province of liège , but this minority community is autonomous and functions like a federal state of its own .
lingua franca : german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian capital brussels is used to seeing many flags flying people here mainly speak german in shops and schools , watch german tv channels and even have their own german-language newspaper , the grenz-echo or border echo .
the sports page covers bundesliga games , of course .
but editor-in-chief gérard cremer said his readership has a broader outlook .
" people are also interested in how anderlecht or standard liège are doing , " he said .
" that 's why they read the grenz-echo .
that 's why it is not your normal newspaper in that sense .
it 's our job to bring belgium closer to our readers . "
many people here might only be able to name the belgian prime minister , while they can list the entire german cabinet .
nevertheless , they are belgian and they certainly do n't want to be called germans .
" we are a mix and i mean that positively , " cremer said .
" not just linguistically , but also in terms of our mentality , in all ways really . "
but cremer added that the minority here are culturally german .
and there are a lot of active cultural organizations here .
multi-layered identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french-speaking and dutch-speaking communities look set to dominate the election , but the german-speaking minority is far from dissatisfied the flags at the headquarters of the government of the german-speaking community reflect the area 's diverse allegiances .
the belgian flag flutters next to the european union 's blue star-sprinkled banner , the arms of the province and the emblem of the german-speaking community - a red lion surrounded by nine blue gentians .
the area 's deputy premier , bernd gentges , said he appreciates his community 's status .
" we think that we are one of the best protected minorities in europe , " he said .
one of gentges 's responsibilities is the integration of immigrants from other countries .
but most of them come from germany and do not present any " acute problems " , according to gentges .
they come because of the lower taxes and the more favorable housebuilding conditions in belgium .
many are employed over the border , in aachen , for example , which is just 17 kilometers -lrb- 10.6 miles -rrb- away .
but not only the recent immigrants tend to commute across national frontiers to work : many of the longstanding members of the german-language community are employed in germany or luxembourg .
gentges sees this with mixed feelings .
" the advantage is that people have greater purchasing power , " he said .
" disadvantages arise because many qualified workers are going to luxembourg and then there is a shortage of those workers here .

few realize there is a third , german-speaking minority . headlines in belgium tend to be dominated by the tug-of-war between the flemish , based in the country 's north , who want more autonomy from the less prosperous , french-speaking areas that are still coming to terms with the post-industrial age .
but belgium has another official linguistic group : the germans who live on the eastern border and make up only one percent of the population .
the area was ceded to belgium after the world war i under the terms of the versailles treaty .
over the decades , a unique belgo-german way of life has developed .
the capital of the german-speaking region is eupen , close to the german city of aachen .
the area formally belongs to the province of liège , but this minority community is autonomous and functions like a federal state of its own .
lingua franca : german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian capital brussels is used to seeing many flags flying people here mainly speak german in shops and schools , watch german tv channels and even have their own german-language newspaper , the grenz-echo or border echo .
the sports page covers bundesliga games , of course .
but editor-in-chief gérard cremer said his readership has a broader outlook .
" people are also interested in how anderlecht or standard liège are doing , " he said .
" that 's why they read the grenz-echo .
that 's why it is not your normal newspaper in that sense .
it 's our job to bring belgium closer to our readers . "
many people here might only be able to name the belgian prime minister , while they can list the entire german cabinet .
nevertheless , they are belgian and they certainly do n't want to be called germans .
" we are a mix and i mean that positively , " cremer said .
" not just linguistically , but also in terms of our mentality , in all ways really . "
but cremer added that the minority here are culturally german .
and there are a lot of active cultural organizations here .
multi-layered identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french-speaking and dutch-speaking communities look set to dominate the election , but the german-speaking minority is far from dissatisfied the flags at the headquarters of the government of the german-speaking community reflect the area 's diverse allegiances .
the belgian flag flutters next to the european union 's blue star-sprinkled banner , the arms of the province and the emblem of the german-speaking community - a red lion surrounded by nine blue gentians .
the area 's deputy premier , bernd gentges , said he appreciates his community 's status .
" we think that we are one of the best protected minorities in europe , " he said .
one of gentges 's responsibilities is the integration of immigrants from other countries .
but most of them come from germany and do not present any " acute problems " , according to gentges .
they come because of the lower taxes and the more favorable housebuilding conditions in belgium .
many are employed over the border , in aachen , for example , which is just 17 kilometers -lrb- 10.6 miles -rrb- away .
but not only the recent immigrants tend to commute across national frontiers to work : many of the longstanding members of the german-language community are employed in germany or luxembourg .
gentges sees this with mixed feelings .
" the advantage is that people have greater purchasing power , " he said .
" disadvantages arise because many qualified workers are going to luxembourg and then there is a shortage of those workers here .

few realize there is a third , german-speaking minority . headlines in belgium tend to be dominated by the tug-of-war between the flemish , based in the country 's north , who want more autonomy from the less prosperous , french-speaking areas that are still coming to terms with the post-industrial age .
but belgium has another official linguistic group : the germans who live on the eastern border and make up only one percent of the population .
the area was ceded to belgium after the world war i under the terms of the versailles treaty .
over the decades , a unique belgo-german way of life has developed .
the capital of the german-speaking region is eupen , close to the german city of aachen .
the area formally belongs to the province of liège , but this minority community is autonomous and functions like a federal state of its own .
lingua franca : german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian capital brussels is used to seeing many flags flying people here mainly speak german in shops and schools , watch german tv channels and even have their own german-language newspaper , the grenz-echo or border echo .
the sports page covers bundesliga games , of course .
but editor-in-chief gérard cremer said his readership has a broader outlook .
" people are also interested in how anderlecht or standard liège are doing , " he said .
" that 's why they read the grenz-echo .
that 's why it is not your normal newspaper in that sense .
it 's our job to bring belgium closer to our readers . "
many people here might only be able to name the belgian prime minister , while they can list the entire german cabinet .
nevertheless , they are belgian and they certainly do n't want to be called germans .
" we are a mix and i mean that positively , " cremer said .
" not just linguistically , but also in terms of our mentality , in all ways really . "
but cremer added that the minority here are culturally german .
and there are a lot of active cultural organizations here .
multi-layered identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french-speaking and dutch-speaking communities look set to dominate the election , but the german-speaking minority is far from dissatisfied the flags at the headquarters of the government of the german-speaking community reflect the area 's diverse allegiances .
the belgian flag flutters next to the european union 's blue star-sprinkled banner , the arms of the province and the emblem of the german-speaking community - a red lion surrounded by nine blue gentians .
the area 's deputy premier , bernd gentges , said he appreciates his community 's status .

few realize there is a third , german-speaking minority . headlines in belgium tend to be dominated by the tug-of-war between the flemish , based in the country 's north , who want more autonomy from the less prosperous , french-speaking areas that are still coming to terms with the post-industrial age .
but belgium has another official linguistic group : the germans who live on the eastern border and make up only one percent of the population .
the area was ceded to belgium after the world war i under the terms of the versailles treaty .
over the decades , a unique belgo-german way of life has developed .
the capital of the german-speaking region is eupen , close to the german city of aachen .
the area formally belongs to the province of liège , but this minority community is autonomous and functions like a federal state of its own .
lingua franca : german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian capital brussels is used to seeing many flags flying people here mainly speak german in shops and schools , watch german tv channels and even have their own german-language newspaper , the grenz-echo or border echo .
the sports page covers bundesliga games , of course .
but editor-in-chief gérard cremer said his readership has a broader outlook .
" people are also interested in how anderlecht or standard liège are doing , " he said .
" that 's why they read the grenz-echo .
that 's why it is not your normal newspaper in that sense .
it 's our job to bring belgium closer to our readers . "
many people here might only be able to name the belgian prime minister , while they can list the entire german cabinet .
nevertheless , they are belgian and they certainly do n't want to be called germans .
" we are a mix and i mean that positively , " cremer said .
" not just linguistically , but also in terms of our mentality , in all ways really . "
but cremer added that the minority here are culturally german .
and there are a lot of active cultural organizations here .
multi-layered identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french-speaking and dutch-speaking communities look set to dominate the election , but the german-speaking minority is far from dissatisfied the flags at the headquarters of the government of the german-speaking community reflect the area 's diverse allegiances .
the belgian flag flutters next to the european union 's blue star-sprinkled banner , the arms of the province and the emblem of the german-speaking community - a red lion surrounded by nine blue gentians .
the area 's deputy premier , bernd gentges , said he appreciates his community 's status .
" we think that we are one of the best protected minorities in europe , " he said .
one of gentges 's responsibilities is the integration of immigrants from other countries .
but most of them come from germany and do not present any " acute problems " , according to gentges .
they come because of the lower taxes and the more favorable housebuilding conditions in belgium .
many are employed over the border , in aachen , for example , which is just 17 kilometers -lrb- 10.6 miles -rrb- away .
but not only the recent immigrants tend to commute across national frontiers to work : many of the longstanding members of the german-language community are employed in germany or luxembourg .
gentges sees this with mixed feelings .
" the advantage is that people have greater purchasing power , " he said .
" disadvantages arise because many qualified workers are going to luxembourg and then there is a shortage of those workers here .

" we can certainly not impose anything on africa on the basis of our european experience , " merkel told a podium discussion that included 2006 nobel peace prize laureate muhammed yunus .
but the chancellor added that minimum standards in some areas had to be set for all countries .
" globalization can only succeed if there are social minimum standards and minimum standards in the environment , " she said .
" we have to implement these . "
merkel , herself the daughter of a lutheran minister , was rounding off a busy week with her attendance at the german evangelical church -lrb- ekd -rrb- ecumenical congress , held in the shadow of cologne 's famous catholic cathedral .
nearly 4,000 guests from abroad and more than 100,000 german participants have been attending the lutheran congress which began wednesday and wraps up on sunday .
it is one of germany 's most significant ecumenical events .
merkel : fair trade needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with ghanaian president john a. kufuor on friday on friday , merkel had met african leaders , including ghaniaian president john kufuor , current chairman of the african union , in the northern german resort of heiligendamm .
the g8 summit was just one of many steps on the road to a more just global economy , merkel said .
" the poorest countries will only have a chance with their products if they have fair conditions of trade , " she added .
the general secretary of the all africa conference of churches , bishop mvume dandala , said europe should see africans as partners rather than as supplicants or beggars .
inhumane banking system ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and yunus in cologne yunus , whose micro-credits to the very poor and especially to women secured him the nobel prize , outlined his vision of a new kind of development aid .
two-thirds of humanity had no access to banks , he noted , querying whether the current banking system was humane .
yunus explained how his home country bangladesh is on the way to halve poverty by 2015 in line with un goals .

few realize there is a third , german-speaking minority . headlines in belgium tend to be dominated by the tug-of-war between the flemish , based in the country 's north , who want more autonomy from the less prosperous , french-speaking areas that are still coming to terms with the post-industrial age .
but belgium has another official linguistic group : the germans who live on the eastern border and make up only one percent of the population .
the area was ceded to belgium after the world war i under the terms of the versailles treaty .
over the decades , a unique belgo-german way of life has developed .
the capital of the german-speaking region is eupen , close to the german city of aachen .
the area formally belongs to the province of liège , but this minority community is autonomous and functions like a federal state of its own .
lingua franca : german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian capital brussels is used to seeing many flags flying people here mainly speak german in shops and schools , watch german tv channels and even have their own german-language newspaper , the grenz-echo or border echo .
the sports page covers bundesliga games , of course .
but editor-in-chief gérard cremer said his readership has a broader outlook .
" people are also interested in how anderlecht or standard liège are doing , " he said .
" that 's why they read the grenz-echo .
that 's why it is not your normal newspaper in that sense .
it 's our job to bring belgium closer to our readers . "
many people here might only be able to name the belgian prime minister , while they can list the entire german cabinet .
nevertheless , they are belgian and they certainly do n't want to be called germans .
" we are a mix and i mean that positively , " cremer said .
" not just linguistically , but also in terms of our mentality , in all ways really . "
but cremer added that the minority here are culturally german .
and there are a lot of active cultural organizations here .
multi-layered identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french-speaking and dutch-speaking communities look set to dominate the election , but the german-speaking minority is far from dissatisfied the flags at the headquarters of the government of the german-speaking community reflect the area 's diverse allegiances .
the belgian flag flutters next to the european union 's blue star-sprinkled banner , the arms of the province and the emblem of the german-speaking community - a red lion surrounded by nine blue gentians .
the area 's deputy premier , bernd gentges , said he appreciates his community 's status .
" we think that we are one of the best protected minorities in europe , " he said .
one of gentges 's responsibilities is the integration of immigrants from other countries .
but most of them come from germany and do not present any " acute problems " , according to gentges .
they come because of the lower taxes and the more favorable housebuilding conditions in belgium .
many are employed over the border , in aachen , for example , which is just 17 kilometers -lrb- 10.6 miles -rrb- away .
but not only the recent immigrants tend to commute across national frontiers to work : many of the longstanding members of the german-language community are employed in germany or luxembourg .
gentges sees this with mixed feelings .
" the advantage is that people have greater purchasing power , " he said .
" disadvantages arise because many qualified workers are going to luxembourg and then there is a shortage of those workers here .

he 's been on the road now for two years . retirement means different things to different people : buying a house in tuscany , golfing every other day or simply lounging by a pool with a cold gin and tonic by one 's side .
but for dankmar hugo scheuchl , it meant he could embark on an adventure of a lifetime .
with little more than his trusty steed - a bmw r1000 motorcycle - and 100 kilograms -lrb- 220 lbs . -rrb- of clothes and supplies , he set off on a tour of the globe that would take him to the war-torn mountain ranges of afghanistan , the crowded streets of calcutta , the australian outback and wide african savannahs .
the resident of erding , germany was 66 years old when he first departed .
" my family was quite amazed when i told them i was doing this , " said scheuchl , now 68 .
" they surely thought i was crazy in the beginning , " he said , while sitting at a guest house in the kenyan capital nairobi , but itching to get on the road again .

it 's been a dream of his to make such a journey but when he attempted to do so 43 years ago , the voyage was cut short unexpectedly .
then , at 25 , scheuchl and a friend made it by motorbike to nepal , but sold their vehicles and headed back to germany by train because of a lack of funds and time .
after a lifetime of working as a software developer , with enough money and all the time he needs , scheuchl is completing his loop around the world .

" now , i intend to get this route done 40 years later . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the open road has much to offer and that means following the same path he took so many decades ago , including traveling through afghanistan .

" many people have never seen the inside of a school , " he said .
" family and clan structures are destroyed and people are without orientation . "
he said he does n't regret driving through kandahar , kabul and the rest of the volatile country that is home to a myriad of foreign troops , but he would n't advise any other visitors to meander around it .
all across the continents this was the lowest part of his trip .
but for the most part , scheuchl 's travels through eastern europe , asia , australia , south america and africa have been enjoyable .

" they tried to rob me but i was able to defeat them , " he said , describing a raucous street battle that ended with the thieves - younger than scheuchl - scurrying away with none of his possessions .
" a punch in the face - that 's all they got . "

few realize there is a third , german-speaking minority . headlines in belgium tend to be dominated by the tug-of-war between the flemish , based in the country 's north , who want more autonomy from the less prosperous , french-speaking areas that are still coming to terms with the post-industrial age .
but belgium has another official linguistic group : the germans who live on the eastern border and make up only one percent of the population .
the area was ceded to belgium after the world war i under the terms of the versailles treaty .
over the decades , a unique belgo-german way of life has developed .
the capital of the german-speaking region is eupen , close to the german city of aachen .
the area formally belongs to the province of liège , but this minority community is autonomous and functions like a federal state of its own .
lingua franca : german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian capital brussels is used to seeing many flags flying people here mainly speak german in shops and schools , watch german tv channels and even have their own german-language newspaper , the grenz-echo or border echo .
the sports page covers bundesliga games , of course .
but editor-in-chief gérard cremer said his readership has a broader outlook .
" people are also interested in how anderlecht or standard liège are doing , " he said .
" that 's why they read the grenz-echo .
that 's why it is not your normal newspaper in that sense .
it 's our job to bring belgium closer to our readers . "
many people here might only be able to name the belgian prime minister , while they can list the entire german cabinet .
nevertheless , they are belgian and they certainly do n't want to be called germans .
" we are a mix and i mean that positively , " cremer said .
" not just linguistically , but also in terms of our mentality , in all ways really . "
but cremer added that the minority here are culturally german .
and there are a lot of active cultural organizations here .
multi-layered identity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french-speaking and dutch-speaking communities look set to dominate the election , but the german-speaking minority is far from dissatisfied the flags at the headquarters of the government of the german-speaking community reflect the area 's diverse allegiances .
the belgian flag flutters next to the european union 's blue star-sprinkled banner , the arms of the province and the emblem of the german-speaking community - a red lion surrounded by nine blue gentians .
the area 's deputy premier , bernd gentges , said he appreciates his community 's status .
" we think that we are one of the best protected minorities in europe , " he said .
one of gentges 's responsibilities is the integration of immigrants from other countries .
but most of them come from germany and do not present any " acute problems " , according to gentges .
they come because of the lower taxes and the more favorable housebuilding conditions in belgium .
many are employed over the border , in aachen , for example , which is just 17 kilometers -lrb- 10.6 miles -rrb- away .
but not only the recent immigrants tend to commute across national frontiers to work : many of the longstanding members of the german-language community are employed in germany or luxembourg .
gentges sees this with mixed feelings .
" the advantage is that people have greater purchasing power , " he said .
" disadvantages arise because many qualified workers are going to luxembourg and then there is a shortage of those workers here .

dw-world.de examines the trials and triumphs of two clubs : hansa rostock and magdeburg . it went down to the last day of the second-division season , but in the end hansa rostock got the job done .
a 3-1 win over unterhachingen sent them back to the bundesliga 's top flight after a two-year absence . rostock 's revival may signal a minor renaissance in eastern german soccer .
but the club 's president , dirk grabow realizes that , for eastern and western german clubs alike , success is not always easy to consolidate . " that 's the fate of all small clubs : you 're always confronted with the possibility of going down , " grabow said .

that makes rostock the most successful eastern german club since the country 's reunification in 1990 . the keys to that success include an emphasis on team chemistry over individual stars , youth development and financial discipline .
and hansa 's management maintained a cool head even after being relegated . " we did n't feel like we had to be afraid of spending the rest of eternity in the second division , " grabow said .

they are proud of that legacy - and the responsibility that comes with it . " we 're very conscious that we 're something of a flagship for eastern german soccer because of our decade in the first division , " grabow said .

" we always say that magdeburg never got relegated , " said commercial manager bernd hofmann .
" but we still dropped down to soccer 's nether regions . " the nadir came in 2002 , when the club had to file for bankruptcy . " after reunification , a lot of eastern german clubs did n't really know how a market economy worked , " hofmann said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 09.06.2007 eu approves billions for galileo satellite navigation system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu officials have high hopes for galileo eu transportation ministers have approved the use of billions of euros in public funds to finance the ailing satellite-navigation system galileo . ministers on friday gave the green-light to plans by the european commission after the collapse of talks last month to undertake the ambitious project in partnership with private industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee " we need the expertise in this technology and we need the jobs which the sector will generate , " said german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , whose country is current president of the eu .
all 27 ministers approved the plan , which will require an initial outlay of 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- of public money towards the project 's total cost of about 4 billion euros .
this would come on top of the 1.3 billion euros national governments have already committed to galileo , seen as europe 's answer to the us-operated global positioning system gps .
private involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps is already used in millions of navigation systems in cars amid internal bickering , the eight companies from five countries involved in galileo had missed a may 10 deadline to decide how to share work on the project .
after the initial investment , private industry will be tasked with operating the system and new bids will be called for operation and maintenance of satellites , only one of which is in orbit .
there were originally to be 30 satellites in place by 2010 , but the timeline for galileo to be fully operational was moved to 2012 due to delays inside the industry consortium .
the system is to be used for civilian purposes only , monitoring natural disasters , air and sea rescue services and for a range of commercial uses .
falling behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can galileo still catch up with other programs ?
eu officials had warned that the bloc could lose out in the international competition for global space technology as the us , russia , china and japan are busy building and improving their satellite navigation technology .
the gps system - run by the us defense department - is offered free to businesses worldwide , while galileo plans to charge users .
galileo 's original consortium included the franco-german aerospace consortium eads , france 's thales and alcatel-lucent , british company inmarsat , italy 's finmeccanica , aena and hispasat of spain and a german group with deutsche telekom and the german aerospace center .
the eu hopes that galileo will generate at least 150,000 jobs and bring a return of investments of up to 9 billion euros , making it the continent 's most lucrative infrastructure project .
china , israel , the us , ukraine , india , morocco and south korea have also agreed to invest in galileo . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says public funding needed to rescue galileo from delays the european commission said on wednesday that the eu should inject huge amounts of public money into the prestigious galileo satellite navigation system to rescue it from bickering among private-sector investors .
-lrb- 16.05.2007 -rrb- eu takes over galileo global navigation system tired of the bickering and lack of progress on one of europe 's premier projects , the european commission has decided to take the reins of control for the galileo satellite navigation system away from private industry .
-lrb- 08.05.2007 -rrb- eu considers running galileo gps project the european union is to consider taking over the galileo satellite system as it is faced with demands for more time and extra public funds from the project 's private builders , officials said .

" it 's necessary to freeze the deployment of missile defense systems in europe for a period of study and analysis , " he was quoted by itar-tass as saying .
he went on to say that the us missile defense plans could " seriously complicate " efforts by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to resolve the stand-off over iran 's nuclear program .
" work is under way within the framework of the united nations , the iaea , " he said .

" at the moment there is enough information on hypothetical threats provided by the radar station in azerbaijan , " he said .
" it is a reliable warning station .
joint use of information from the station would allow the united states to refrain from deploying elements of the missile shield in europe and from deployment of its space components . "
russia has strongly objected to the us plans to deploy a radar system in the czech republic and linked interceptor missiles in poland - european countries that were under moscow 's control in soviet times .
putin insisted on thursday that the radar in azerbaijan , which is currently under russian control , could be shared with washington and would be able to detect any missile fired by iran .
nato , us doubts experts and the secretary general of nato , jaap de hoop scheffer , have voiced doubts about the azerbaijani radar 's ability to meet us requirement .
