21 , karzai asked the germans to be patient with their peacekeeping mission .
" we need more time , " he told the paper .
" rebuilding will take longer than we expected .
i suspect it could take a further 10 years - at least 10 years . "
huge benefits for germany germany has been heavily involved in the nato-led isaf peacekeeping mission to afghanistan since 2002 .
it has around 3,000 troops in the relatively calmer north of the country , who are largely responsible for civilian reconstruction projects and peacekeeping .
karzai emphasised that germany stood to benefit hugely from its engagement in afghanistan .
" when people in afghanistan today take care of their own lives , it means security for europe and germany , " he said .
" in places where terrorists and our neighbors try to -lsb- steer things -rsb- , it means disaster - even for germany .
that means the afghans have both things in their power : afghanistan 's security as well as germany 's security . "
the afghan leader also rebuffed us criticism of germany 's reluctance to send combat troops to volatile southern afghanistan , where us-led forces are fighting insurgents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has sent six tornado jets to afghanistan the german military has , however , contributed six reconnaissance jets that fly missions over the country 's southern regions and made a limited number of special forces soldiers available , though they have not been called on to take part in military missions .
germany is also training afghan armed forces and police to take over security operations .
but the program has been widely criticized for a lack of adequate planning and funds .
germany staying the course earlier this month , germany 's lower house of parliament voted to extend the peacekeeping mission in afghanistan by another year .
the mission has claimed the lives of 26 german soldiers so far .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said germany was committed to helping afghanistan .
" if we give up , the opponents of the civilized world have won , " he told parliament .
" we do n't want to let that happen .
we will stand by the people of afghanistan and help them to continue along the mapped-out path . "
underscoring the importance of germany 's involvement in afghanistan , karzai spoke about berlin 's readiness to help a young afghan girl who was seriously wounded during a bomb attack in kandahar , in southern afghanistan , three years ago .
she was flown to germany for treatment and now speaks a smattering of german .
" that 's the most beautiful message for christmas : germany taking care of a little afghan girl , " karzai said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" rebuilding will take longer than we expected .
i suspect it could take a further 10 years - at least 10 years . "
huge benefits for germany germany has been heavily involved in the nato-led isaf peacekeeping mission to afghanistan since 2002 .
it has around 3,000 troops in the relatively calmer north of the country , who are largely responsible for civilian reconstruction projects and peacekeeping .
karzai emphasised that germany stood to benefit hugely from its engagement in afghanistan .

" in places where terrorists and our neighbors try to -lsb- steer things -rsb- , it means disaster - even for germany .

21 , karzai asked the germans to be patient with their peacekeeping mission .
" we need more time , " he told the paper .
" rebuilding will take longer than we expected .
i suspect it could take a further 10 years - at least 10 years . "
huge benefits for germany germany has been heavily involved in the nato-led isaf peacekeeping mission to afghanistan since 2002 .
it has around 3,000 troops in the relatively calmer north of the country , who are largely responsible for civilian reconstruction projects and peacekeeping .
karzai emphasised that germany stood to benefit hugely from its engagement in afghanistan .
" when people in afghanistan today take care of their own lives , it means security for europe and germany , " he said .
" in places where terrorists and our neighbors try to -lsb- steer things -rsb- , it means disaster - even for germany .
that means the afghans have both things in their power : afghanistan 's security as well as germany 's security . "
the afghan leader also rebuffed us criticism of germany 's reluctance to send combat troops to volatile southern afghanistan , where us-led forces are fighting insurgents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has sent six tornado jets to afghanistan the german military has , however , contributed six reconnaissance jets that fly missions over the country 's southern regions and made a limited number of special forces soldiers available , though they have not been called on to take part in military missions .
germany is also training afghan armed forces and police to take over security operations .
but the program has been widely criticized for a lack of adequate planning and funds .
germany staying the course earlier this month , germany 's lower house of parliament voted to extend the peacekeeping mission in afghanistan by another year .
the mission has claimed the lives of 26 german soldiers so far .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said germany was committed to helping afghanistan .
" if we give up , the opponents of the civilized world have won , " he told parliament .
" we do n't want to let that happen .
we will stand by the people of afghanistan and help them to continue along the mapped-out path . "
underscoring the importance of germany 's involvement in afghanistan , karzai spoke about berlin 's readiness to help a young afghan girl who was seriously wounded during a bomb attack in kandahar , in southern afghanistan , three years ago .
she was flown to germany for treatment and now speaks a smattering of german .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 21.12.2007 airlines to pay less to pollute under eu ministers ' plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air travel accounts for about 3 percent of global co2 emissions european leaders have approved a deal to include airlines in the bloc 's emissions trading scheme in 2012 .
the plan has irked both eu lawmakers and environmentalists and brought on litigation threats from the us . the proposal calls for european airlines , as well as those with flights to and from the 27-member bloc , to have to meet emissions quotas by either reducing their co2 output or purchasing carbon dioxide credits from other less pollutant industries . " our decision is of utmost importance in our fight against climate change , " said portuguese environment minister francisco nunes correia , who chaired the talks held on thursday , dec .
20 , in brussels .
his country holds the rotating eu presidency through the end of the year . germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel said that " air traffic must contribute to climate protection , there 's no alternative . "
gabriel has long pushed for airlines to be included in the bloc 's carbon trading program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal is part of a larger eu emissions trading plan that includes other industrial sectors he told reporters on the sidelines of the conference that the proposal could make long-distance flights 30 euros to 40 euros -lrb- $ 43 to $ 57 -rrb- more expensive for travelers .
however , airlines could avoid a price hike by using environmentally-friendly technology , added gabriel . ministers water down eu plan the european parliament , which has to agree to the ministers ' plan for it to take effect , had originally advocated a 2011 start to emissions trading in the aviation industry .
eu lawmakers ' disappointment over thursday 's deal cast doubts on the likelihood that it will find approval in parliament . " it is regrettable that the council wants to start so late with emissions trading in aviation , " said conservative german mep peter liese .
" the european parliament as co-legislator will not accept that this weak decision comes into force unchanged . " ministers on thursday capped the sector 's total carbon dioxide output at 100 percent of average emissions between 2004 and 2006 , while parliament had proposed a 90 percent limit in relation to the same period . thursday 's agreement also sees the airlines purchasing 10 percent of available emissions permits when first issued ; the european parliament had set the amount at 25 percent .
guidelines for buying carbon credits in following years have not yet been decided . plan under fire from us , environmentalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel said do n't listen to the us on environmental matters environmentalists have warned that the trading scheme does n't go far enough . " this is a christmas gift to the aviation industry which should be required to do its fair share in tackling climate change , " said delia villagrasa from the world wildlife fund . the aviation sector is also fiercely opposed .
the industry warned earlier this year that it would have to spend over 45 billion euros between 2011 and 2022 to buy up credits in order to meet emissions quotas . the united states , which has consistently supported voluntary participation in ecological programs instead of enforced quotas , has threatened the eu with litigation should the trading plan go through . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , karzai asked the germans to be patient with their peacekeeping mission .
" we need more time , " he told the paper .
" rebuilding will take longer than we expected .
i suspect it could take a further 10 years - at least 10 years . "
huge benefits for germany germany has been heavily involved in the nato-led isaf peacekeeping mission to afghanistan since 2002 .
it has around 3,000 troops in the relatively calmer north of the country , who are largely responsible for civilian reconstruction projects and peacekeeping .
karzai emphasised that germany stood to benefit hugely from its engagement in afghanistan .
" when people in afghanistan today take care of their own lives , it means security for europe and germany , " he said .
" in places where terrorists and our neighbors try to -lsb- steer things -rsb- , it means disaster - even for germany .
that means the afghans have both things in their power : afghanistan 's security as well as germany 's security . "
the afghan leader also rebuffed us criticism of germany 's reluctance to send combat troops to volatile southern afghanistan , where us-led forces are fighting insurgents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has sent six tornado jets to afghanistan the german military has , however , contributed six reconnaissance jets that fly missions over the country 's southern regions and made a limited number of special forces soldiers available , though they have not been called on to take part in military missions .
germany is also training afghan armed forces and police to take over security operations .
but the program has been widely criticized for a lack of adequate planning and funds .
germany staying the course earlier this month , germany 's lower house of parliament voted to extend the peacekeeping mission in afghanistan by another year .
the mission has claimed the lives of 26 german soldiers so far .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said germany was committed to helping afghanistan .
" if we give up , the opponents of the civilized world have won , " he told parliament .
" we do n't want to let that happen .
we will stand by the people of afghanistan and help them to continue along the mapped-out path . "
underscoring the importance of germany 's involvement in afghanistan , karzai spoke about berlin 's readiness to help a young afghan girl who was seriously wounded during a bomb attack in kandahar , in southern afghanistan , three years ago .
she was flown to germany for treatment and now speaks a smattering of german .
" that 's the most beautiful message for christmas : germany taking care of a little afghan girl , " karzai said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 .
some also recalled their own pasts behind the iron curtain . german chancellor angela merkel , polish prime minister donald tusk and czech prime minister mirek topolanek all grew up in the communist east bloc , where foreign travel was forbidden and contact with the west was closely monitored by the secret service . for them , the accession of nine additional european states to the free-movement schengen treaty at midnight on friday took on personal significance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for angela merkel -lrb- right -rrb- , the schengen expansion had a special meaning " we now have a europe where passport controls from sweden to italy , from portugal to the baltic no longer take place , " merkel said at a ceremony later in the morning in zittau , located where the polish , czech and german borders meet . " for those of us who are a bit older , this is not simply a matter of course . " tusk , who assumed state leadership in october following early national elections , called the event a " triumph of freedom . "
he and topolanek symbolically sawed through a now obsolete border post . even polish president lech kaczynski , known for his anti-european stance , called the occasion a " huge success " while speaking at a separate celebration on the polish-lithuanian border .
ceremonies were held throughout the night at former border points , with midnight firework displays in some locations . critics fear crime wave " we have now succeeded in overcoming the most difficult border - that of fear and anxiety , " said tusk in his speech in zittau . the schengen expansion , however , has raised concerns among critics about a possible increase in crime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the schengen area may continue to grow over the next few years allowing free travel between germany and its eastern neighbors is " an invitation to criminals , " said federal police union chief josef scheuring on thursday .
union members held demonstrations against the border-opening last month . frontex , the eu 's border watchdog , has also warned that illegal immigration would increase as a result of lifting border checks . politicians have countered opponents by saying that security will be tighter and reminding that preparations for the expansions have been underway for two years . " we will actually have an increase in security , not a decrease " said german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , referring to the mobile police units that have now replaced stationary border checks . " the abolition of the border controls is of symbolic importance because we are turning the page on the division of europe , " he added , speaking from the site of a new joint german-polish police center in the polish border town of swiecko . further expansion ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian prime minister wants his country to join schengen the area is now made up of 22 eu member states plus iceland and norway .
the nine new schengen states - the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia - all joined the european union in 2004 . bulgarian prime minister ivaylo kalfin said on friday that bulgaria and romania , which became eu members on jan .
1 , 2007 , may join schengen within the next several years , reported afp news service . " the realistic date for entering the schengen treaty zone is 2010 to 2011 , " he said at a press conference .
" but that depends on how prepared romania will be , since it would be odd for bulgaria to join but to have a schengen border with romania . " switzerland , a non-eu member , has expressed interest in adopting the schengen treaty in nov .

the plan has irked both eu lawmakers and environmentalists and brought on litigation threats from the us . the proposal calls for european airlines , as well as those with flights to and from the 27-member bloc , to have to meet emissions quotas by either reducing their co2 output or purchasing carbon dioxide credits from other less pollutant industries . " our decision is of utmost importance in our fight against climate change , " said portuguese environment minister francisco nunes correia , who chaired the talks held on thursday , dec .
20 , in brussels .
his country holds the rotating eu presidency through the end of the year . germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel said that " air traffic must contribute to climate protection , there 's no alternative . "
gabriel has long pushed for airlines to be included in the bloc 's carbon trading program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal is part of a larger eu emissions trading plan that includes other industrial sectors he told reporters on the sidelines of the conference that the proposal could make long-distance flights 30 euros to 40 euros -lrb- $ 43 to $ 57 -rrb- more expensive for travelers .
however , airlines could avoid a price hike by using environmentally-friendly technology , added gabriel . ministers water down eu plan the european parliament , which has to agree to the ministers ' plan for it to take effect , had originally advocated a 2011 start to emissions trading in the aviation industry .
eu lawmakers ' disappointment over thursday 's deal cast doubts on the likelihood that it will find approval in parliament . " it is regrettable that the council wants to start so late with emissions trading in aviation , " said conservative german mep peter liese .
" the european parliament as co-legislator will not accept that this weak decision comes into force unchanged . " ministers on thursday capped the sector 's total carbon dioxide output at 100 percent of average emissions between 2004 and 2006 , while parliament had proposed a 90 percent limit in relation to the same period . thursday 's agreement also sees the airlines purchasing 10 percent of available emissions permits when first issued ; the european parliament had set the amount at 25 percent .
guidelines for buying carbon credits in following years have not yet been decided . plan under fire from us , environmentalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel said do n't listen to the us on environmental matters environmentalists have warned that the trading scheme does n't go far enough . " this is a christmas gift to the aviation industry which should be required to do its fair share in tackling climate change , " said delia villagrasa from the world wildlife fund . the aviation sector is also fiercely opposed .
the industry warned earlier this year that it would have to spend over 45 billion euros between 2011 and 2022 to buy up credits in order to meet emissions quotas . the united states , which has consistently supported voluntary participation in ecological programs instead of enforced quotas , has threatened the eu with litigation should the trading plan go through . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

block b went back online earlier this month , while block a is expected to be turned back on in early january .
it had originally been scheduled to go back online this week . in a separate incident , an instrument used to measure neutron levels broke down at the brokdorf plant in the northern state of schleswig-holstein on dec .

huge benefits for germany germany has been heavily involved in the nato-led isaf peacekeeping mission to afghanistan since 2002 .
it has around 3,000 troops in the relatively calmer north of the country , who are largely responsible for civilian reconstruction projects and peacekeeping .
karzai emphasised that germany stood to benefit hugely from its engagement in afghanistan .
" when people in afghanistan today take care of their own lives , it means security for europe and germany , " he said .
" in places where terrorists and our neighbors try to -lsb- steer things -rsb- , it means disaster - even for germany .

" we do n't want to let that happen .
we will stand by the people of afghanistan and help them to continue along the mapped-out path . "

though sales are up , profits are n't competitive with other carmakers . " several thousand jobs " will disappear in the next few months , said a spokesman from the munich-based auto manufacturer on friday . no specific numbers were given by the company , but a report by spiegel online estimated the anticipated layoffs at around 8,000 .
an industrial source confirmed the figure . cuts are to focus on blue-collar positions within germany and will specifically involve not renewing part-time contracts , said the spokesman .
contracted , non-union workers would thus be targeted . a bmw factory at leipzig in eastern germany makes extensive use of such casual staff . the spokesman said some of bmw 's 107,700 own employees would also be retired or not replaced , but layoffs in this category were not contemplated . in frankfurt trading , bmw stock bolted higher on the news , trading at 42.16 euros -lrb- $ 60.68 -rrb- on friday afternoon , 4.3 percent higher than its thursday close . necessary cuts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw ceo norbert reithofer wants to boost his company 's profitability despite strong sales , particularly of its luxury models , bmw chief norbert reithofer told employees that the cuts were necessary due to a constant decline in the company 's earning ratio . reithofer has said he would like to whittle six billion euros off of future budgets . although bmw is expected to report record sales this year , exceeding the level of 3.75 billion euros , the company 's profit margin ranks behind other premium car manufacturers . bmw 's main labor union , ig metall , said on friday that it believed the cuts had to do with a lull in production ahead of releasing a new 7-series model . dw staf -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the plan has irked both eu lawmakers and environmentalists and brought on litigation threats from the us . the proposal calls for european airlines , as well as those with flights to and from the 27-member bloc , to have to meet emissions quotas by either reducing their co2 output or purchasing carbon dioxide credits from other less pollutant industries . " our decision is of utmost importance in our fight against climate change , " said portuguese environment minister francisco nunes correia , who chaired the talks held on thursday , dec .
20 , in brussels .
his country holds the rotating eu presidency through the end of the year . germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel said that " air traffic must contribute to climate protection , there 's no alternative . "
gabriel has long pushed for airlines to be included in the bloc 's carbon trading program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal is part of a larger eu emissions trading plan that includes other industrial sectors he told reporters on the sidelines of the conference that the proposal could make long-distance flights 30 euros to 40 euros -lrb- $ 43 to $ 57 -rrb- more expensive for travelers .
however , airlines could avoid a price hike by using environmentally-friendly technology , added gabriel . ministers water down eu plan the european parliament , which has to agree to the ministers ' plan for it to take effect , had originally advocated a 2011 start to emissions trading in the aviation industry .
eu lawmakers ' disappointment over thursday 's deal cast doubts on the likelihood that it will find approval in parliament . " it is regrettable that the council wants to start so late with emissions trading in aviation , " said conservative german mep peter liese .
" the european parliament as co-legislator will not accept that this weak decision comes into force unchanged . " ministers on thursday capped the sector 's total carbon dioxide output at 100 percent of average emissions between 2004 and 2006 , while parliament had proposed a 90 percent limit in relation to the same period . thursday 's agreement also sees the airlines purchasing 10 percent of available emissions permits when first issued ; the european parliament had set the amount at 25 percent .

" we will actually have an increase in security , not a decrease " said german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , referring to the mobile police units that have now replaced stationary border checks .

the nine new schengen states - the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia - all joined the european union in 2004 . bulgarian prime minister ivaylo kalfin said on friday that bulgaria and romania , which became eu members on jan .
1 , 2007 , may join schengen within the next several years , reported afp news service . " the realistic date for entering the schengen treaty zone is 2010 to 2011 , " he said at a press conference .
" but that depends on how prepared romania will be , since it would be odd for bulgaria to join but to have a schengen border with romania . " switzerland , a non-eu member , has expressed interest in adopting the schengen treaty in nov .

huge benefits for germany germany has been heavily involved in the nato-led isaf peacekeeping mission to afghanistan since 2002 .
it has around 3,000 troops in the relatively calmer north of the country , who are largely responsible for civilian reconstruction projects and peacekeeping .

" when people in afghanistan today take care of their own lives , it means security for europe and germany , " he said .
" in places where terrorists and our neighbors try to -lsb- steer things -rsb- , it means disaster - even for germany .

" we do n't want to let that happen .
we will stand by the people of afghanistan and help them to continue along the mapped-out path . "
underscoring the importance of germany 's involvement in afghanistan , karzai spoke about berlin 's readiness to help a young afghan girl who was seriously wounded during a bomb attack in kandahar , in southern afghanistan , three years ago .

though sales are up , profits are n't competitive with other carmakers . " several thousand jobs " will disappear in the next few months , said a spokesman from the munich-based auto manufacturer on friday . no specific numbers were given by the company , but a report by spiegel online estimated the anticipated layoffs at around 8,000 .
an industrial source confirmed the figure . cuts are to focus on blue-collar positions within germany and will specifically involve not renewing part-time contracts , said the spokesman .

the plan has irked both eu lawmakers and environmentalists and brought on litigation threats from the us . the proposal calls for european airlines , as well as those with flights to and from the 27-member bloc , to have to meet emissions quotas by either reducing their co2 output or purchasing carbon dioxide credits from other less pollutant industries .

however , airlines could avoid a price hike by using environmentally-friendly technology , added gabriel . ministers water down eu plan the european parliament , which has to agree to the ministers ' plan for it to take effect , had originally advocated a 2011 start to emissions trading in the aviation industry .

" the european parliament as co-legislator will not accept that this weak decision comes into force unchanged . " ministers on thursday capped the sector 's total carbon dioxide output at 100 percent of average emissions between 2004 and 2006 , while parliament had proposed a 90 percent limit in relation to the same period . thursday 's agreement also sees the airlines purchasing 10 percent of available emissions permits when first issued ; the european parliament had set the amount at 25 percent .

the industry warned earlier this year that it would have to spend over 45 billion euros between 2011 and 2022 to buy up credits in order to meet emissions quotas . the united states , which has consistently supported voluntary participation in ecological programs instead of enforced quotas , has threatened the eu with litigation should the trading plan go through . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 .
some also recalled their own pasts behind the iron curtain . german chancellor angela merkel , polish prime minister donald tusk and czech prime minister mirek topolanek all grew up in the communist east bloc , where foreign travel was forbidden and contact with the west was closely monitored by the secret service . for them , the accession of nine additional european states to the free-movement schengen treaty at midnight on friday took on personal significance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for angela merkel -lrb- right -rrb- , the schengen expansion had a special meaning " we now have a europe where passport controls from sweden to italy , from portugal to the baltic no longer take place , " merkel said at a ceremony later in the morning in zittau , located where the polish , czech and german borders meet . " for those of us who are a bit older , this is not simply a matter of course . " tusk , who assumed state leadership in october following early national elections , called the event a " triumph of freedom . "
he and topolanek symbolically sawed through a now obsolete border post . even polish president lech kaczynski , known for his anti-european stance , called the occasion a " huge success " while speaking at a separate celebration on the polish-lithuanian border .
ceremonies were held throughout the night at former border points , with midnight firework displays in some locations . critics fear crime wave " we have now succeeded in overcoming the most difficult border - that of fear and anxiety , " said tusk in his speech in zittau . the schengen expansion , however , has raised concerns among critics about a possible increase in crime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the schengen area may continue to grow over the next few years allowing free travel between germany and its eastern neighbors is " an invitation to criminals , " said federal police union chief josef scheuring on thursday .
union members held demonstrations against the border-opening last month . frontex , the eu 's border watchdog , has also warned that illegal immigration would increase as a result of lifting border checks . politicians have countered opponents by saying that security will be tighter and reminding that preparations for the expansions have been underway for two years . " we will actually have an increase in security , not a decrease " said german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , referring to the mobile police units that have now replaced stationary border checks . " the abolition of the border controls is of symbolic importance because we are turning the page on the division of europe , " he added , speaking from the site of a new joint german-polish police center in the polish border town of swiecko . further expansion ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian prime minister wants his country to join schengen the area is now made up of 22 eu member states plus iceland and norway .
the nine new schengen states - the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia - all joined the european union in 2004 . bulgarian prime minister ivaylo kalfin said on friday that bulgaria and romania , which became eu members on jan .
1 , 2007 , may join schengen within the next several years , reported afp news service . " the realistic date for entering the schengen treaty zone is 2010 to 2011 , " he said at a press conference .
" but that depends on how prepared romania will be , since it would be odd for bulgaria to join but to have a schengen border with romania . " switzerland , a non-eu member , has expressed interest in adopting the schengen treaty in nov .

21 , karzai asked the germans to be patient with their peacekeeping mission .
" we need more time , " he told the paper .
" rebuilding will take longer than we expected .
i suspect it could take a further 10 years - at least 10 years . "
huge benefits for germany germany has been heavily involved in the nato-led isaf peacekeeping mission to afghanistan since 2002 .
it has around 3,000 troops in the relatively calmer north of the country , who are largely responsible for civilian reconstruction projects and peacekeeping .
karzai emphasised that germany stood to benefit hugely from its engagement in afghanistan .
" when people in afghanistan today take care of their own lives , it means security for europe and germany , " he said .
" in places where terrorists and our neighbors try to -lsb- steer things -rsb- , it means disaster - even for germany .

as he reflected on his political career and looked forward towards its end , he pinpointed the miners ' buy-out of tower colliery in south wales as a pivotal moment in national self-confidence .
in his christmas interview for my weekly bbc radio cymru podcast , mr morgan also looked back at a momentous political year in 2007 with the formation of the labour-plaid coalition government .
he still has ambitions before he plans to step down in 2009 .
with tower , at hirwaun , closing in the next few months , he hoped miners who did not want to retire could find jobs in the aberpergwm drift mine in the neath valley .
he also hoped to see the 550 acres developed as an urban village and business park .
tower colliery was bought out by miners in 1994 this is unlikely to be finished during mr morgan 's term of office , but he would like to see it established so that the mine is never forgotten .
he argued that the referendum in favour of devolution in 1997 would not have been won without the self-confidence shown by the 239 miners who bought tower .
" if it was n't for the fact that the tower colliers decided to take their future - and their children 's future - into their own hands , i do n't think we as a nation would have won the battle for the referendum .
" it was such a boost to our national self-confidence - if they could do it , we could do it . "
another milestone mr morgan would like to see is the second phase of the children 's hospital for wales .
i 'm trying to lead the process of bringing together the democracy and bureaucracy first minister rhodri morgan " we wo n't see it open until 2010 but i would like to see the building work start ... "
talking about the administrative centre of the welsh assembly government , mr morgan said there was a marked difference in the way the place worked since he started work for the old welsh office as a young civil servant in 1966 .
but he felt the three miles between this seat of government in cathays park and the home of the elected politicians in the senedd in cardiff bay was inconvenient .
" the civil servants who work here do n't feel close enough to the democratic process happening in the assembly .
" whilst the people in the bay , the politicians and their researchers - and the government staff working on the fifth floor in crickhowell house - do n't feel close enough to the 2,000-3,000 staff working here in the bureaucratic headquarters .
" i 'm trying to lead the process of bringing together the democracy and bureaucracy , and spend time up here so that we do n't lose the connection . "
' work hard ' mr morgan went on to talk about the political events of 2007 and the labour party 's unlikely entry into coalition government with plaid .
" it 's been an astounding year , you could n't have written the script and it would have been thrown out as someone 's imagination running wild ... but the conclusion i 've come to is that you should expect the unexpected ... "
he said the labour-plaid coalition had performed better than expected , and the big litmus test was whether a budget could be agreed , and doubly so in a year with a tough financial settlement .
he said : " if we can work together so well and in a mature way , it 's quite significant and it shows that something so stable can last until the next election . "
talking specifically about the current fortunes of the labour party in wales , mr morgan said : " labour 's representation in the west of the country is poor and we 're having to work hard to regain it " to understand why it 's happened , you can look at every country in europe and see some increase in interest in cultural roots and more support for nationalist parties , so we need to swim with the tide , not against it .

as he reflected on his political career and looked forward towards its end , he pinpointed the miners ' buy-out of tower colliery in south wales as a pivotal moment in national self-confidence .
in his christmas interview for my weekly bbc radio cymru podcast , mr morgan also looked back at a momentous political year in 2007 with the formation of the labour-plaid coalition government .
he still has ambitions before he plans to step down in 2009 .
with tower , at hirwaun , closing in the next few months , he hoped miners who did not want to retire could find jobs in the aberpergwm drift mine in the neath valley .
he also hoped to see the 550 acres developed as an urban village and business park .
tower colliery was bought out by miners in 1994 this is unlikely to be finished during mr morgan 's term of office , but he would like to see it established so that the mine is never forgotten .
he argued that the referendum in favour of devolution in 1997 would not have been won without the self-confidence shown by the 239 miners who bought tower .
" if it was n't for the fact that the tower colliers decided to take their future - and their children 's future - into their own hands , i do n't think we as a nation would have won the battle for the referendum .
" it was such a boost to our national self-confidence - if they could do it , we could do it . "
another milestone mr morgan would like to see is the second phase of the children 's hospital for wales .
i 'm trying to lead the process of bringing together the democracy and bureaucracy first minister rhodri morgan " we wo n't see it open until 2010 but i would like to see the building work start ... "
talking about the administrative centre of the welsh assembly government , mr morgan said there was a marked difference in the way the place worked since he started work for the old welsh office as a young civil servant in 1966 .
but he felt the three miles between this seat of government in cathays park and the home of the elected politicians in the senedd in cardiff bay was inconvenient .
" the civil servants who work here do n't feel close enough to the democratic process happening in the assembly .
" whilst the people in the bay , the politicians and their researchers - and the government staff working on the fifth floor in crickhowell house - do n't feel close enough to the 2,000-3,000 staff working here in the bureaucratic headquarters .
" i 'm trying to lead the process of bringing together the democracy and bureaucracy , and spend time up here so that we do n't lose the connection . "
' work hard ' mr morgan went on to talk about the political events of 2007 and the labour party 's unlikely entry into coalition government with plaid .
" it 's been an astounding year , you could n't have written the script and it would have been thrown out as someone 's imagination running wild ... but the conclusion i 've come to is that you should expect the unexpected ... "
he said the labour-plaid coalition had performed better than expected , and the big litmus test was whether a budget could be agreed , and doubly so in a year with a tough financial settlement .
he said : " if we can work together so well and in a mature way , it 's quite significant and it shows that something so stable can last until the next election . "
talking specifically about the current fortunes of the labour party in wales , mr morgan said : " labour 's representation in the west of the country is poor and we 're having to work hard to regain it " to understand why it 's happened , you can look at every country in europe and see some increase in interest in cultural roots and more support for nationalist parties , so we need to swim with the tide , not against it .

today 's st trinian 's pupils are more balls of steel than jolly hockey sticks .
forget catapults made of knicker elastic and smoking as the ultimate sign of rebellion - 21st century st trinians are all about drugs , illegal vodka , bombs and firearms .
the home of british slapstick , ealing studios , has breathed new life into the " young ladies " of the anarchic educational establishment .
and they , explains star gemma arterton , are " st trinians for the heat generation " .
but while playground anarchy may not have the shock value it had in the 1950s , she insists today 's less innocent generation is not immune to the st trinians ' anarchic charm .
" the fact that school girls are running around and doing their own thing is still quite shocking , " explains arterton , " especially in britain where you have the boarding school culture .
" it is quite extreme - st trinian 's is n't exactly a typical school in britain - but it also has that innocence and naughtiness that makes it typically st trinian 's . "
landing the role as sassy , sexy head girl kelly was quite simply a dream come true for arterton , who was fresh out of drama school . "
my breasts were lovely , though .
they had a lovely consistency " rupert everett both sienna miller and amy winehouse had been linked to the part before arterton 's agent called to say it was hers .
" i did n't think i 'd get it and i was absolutely stoked .
i still ca n't believe it , even though i 've seen it now .
" it was a real whirlwind for me because i was one of the last people to be cast and i was really thrown into it . "
she adds : " kelly is the coolest character - very sassy and confident - and she 's the one who makes sure everyone is doing the right crimes and the school is running in the correct way . "
arterton and 22-year-old talulah riley , who plays prim and proper annabel , agree that working on the film was " a big , frolicky knees-up " .
" it was a bit like being back at school with all the girls just having a laugh , " says riley , who was previously seen with keira knightley in 2005 's pride and prejudice .
the film centres on unorthodox headmistress camilla fritton as she struggles to cough up £ 500,000 she owes to the bank , while dealing with stuffy education minister geoffrey thwaites - played by colin firth - who is determined to clean up or close st trinian 's .
responsibility for saving the school falls on the anarchic pupils , who put their cliquey differences aside to stage a daring art heist .
the iconic 1950s films - such as belles of st trinian 's and blue murder at st trinian 's - featured stars like the young barbara windsor , joan sim , beryl reid and george cole , while comedy geniuses like sid james and frankie howerd also had cameo roles .
but the real star was alastair sim who donned unconvincing drag to play the bombastic millicent fritton and , on occasions , her brother clarence .
rupert everett also dons a frock to play the school 's headmistress in the new incarnation .
he admits miss fritton - with her wellington boots , tweed suits , pearls and hermes scarves - was influenced by the duchess of cornwall , with just a dash of everett 's mother .
" the duchess of cornwall is the kind of woman that miss fritton is - a no-nonsense , upper class woman in her wellington boots and tweed suit , " explains everett .
" but the duchess of cornwall is more petite than my camilla , who is a bit of an elephant . "
everett says dressing as a woman quickly lost its initial appeal .
" it was fun for the first couple of days , but then nightmarish because you go on day after day .
you ca n't really move much because you 're covered in make-up and glue , " explains everett .
" and i had a bad back from the boobs , but there was also the wigs , and lashes and teeth - it 's all uncomfortable .
" my breasts were lovely though , " he laughs , " they had a lovely consistency . "
" they were more than a match for me , " agrees firth , miss fritton 's unlikely love interest .
" we had one option towards the end in that love scene of actually having them pop , and it was my job to pop them .
" i just could n't do it .
we tried everything .
we even taped pins to my hands , but they just would n't go .
" i think they got the better of me . "

arterton and 22-year-old talulah riley , who plays prim and proper annabel , agree that working on the film was " a big , frolicky knees-up " .
" it was a bit like being back at school with all the girls just having a laugh , " says riley , who was previously seen with keira knightley in 2005 's pride and prejudice .

responsibility for saving the school falls on the anarchic pupils , who put their cliquey differences aside to stage a daring art heist .
the iconic 1950s films - such as belles of st trinian 's and blue murder at st trinian 's - featured stars like the young barbara windsor , joan sim , beryl reid and george cole , while comedy geniuses like sid james and frankie howerd also had cameo roles .
but the real star was alastair sim who donned unconvincing drag to play the bombastic millicent fritton and , on occasions , her brother clarence .
rupert everett also dons a frock to play the school 's headmistress in the new incarnation .
he admits miss fritton - with her wellington boots , tweed suits , pearls and hermes scarves - was influenced by the duchess of cornwall , with just a dash of everett 's mother .
" the duchess of cornwall is the kind of woman that miss fritton is - a no-nonsense , upper class woman in her wellington boots and tweed suit , " explains everett .
the girls - geeks , goths , posh totty and chavs - put their differences aside " but the duchess of cornwall is more petite than my camilla , who is a bit of an elephant . "
everett says dressing as a woman quickly lost its initial appeal .
" it was fun for the first couple of days , but then nightmarish because you go on day after day .

" we had one option towards the end in that love scene of actually having them pop , and it was my job to pop them .
" i just could n't do it .
we tried everything .
we even taped pins to my hands , but they just would n't go .

the home of british slapstick , ealing studios , has breathed new life into the " young ladies " of the anarchic educational establishment .

but while playground anarchy may not have the shock value it had in the 1950s , she insists today 's less innocent generation is not immune to the st trinians ' anarchic charm .
" the fact that school girls are running around and doing their own thing is still quite shocking , " explains arterton , " especially in britain where you have the boarding school culture .
" it is quite extreme - st trinian 's is n't exactly a typical school in britain - but it also has that innocence and naughtiness that makes it typically st trinian 's . "

behind the scenes today 's st trinian 's pupils are more balls of steel than jolly hockey sticks .
forget catapults made of knicker elastic and smoking as the ultimate sign of rebellion - 21st century st trinians are all about drugs , illegal vodka , bombs and firearms .
the home of british slapstick , ealing studios , has breathed new life into the " young ladies " of the anarchic educational establishment .
and they , explains star gemma arterton , are " st trinians for the heat generation " .
but while playground anarchy may not have the shock value it had in the 1950s , she insists today 's less innocent generation is not immune to the st trinians ' anarchic charm .
" the fact that school girls are running around and doing their own thing is still quite shocking , " explains arterton , " especially in britain where you have the boarding school culture .
" it is quite extreme - st trinian 's is n't exactly a typical school in britain - but it also has that innocence and naughtiness that makes it typically st trinian 's . "
landing the role as sassy , sexy head girl kelly was quite simply a dream come true for arterton , who was fresh out of drama school .
my breasts were lovely , though .
they had a lovely consistency rupert everett both sienna miller and amy winehouse had been linked to the part before arterton 's agent called to say it was hers .
" i did n't think i 'd get it and i was absolutely stoked .
i still ca n't believe it , even though i 've seen it now .
" it was a real whirlwind for me because i was one of the last people to be cast and i was really thrown into it . "
she adds : " kelly is the coolest character - very sassy and confident - and she 's the one who makes sure everyone is doing the right crimes and the school is running in the correct way . "
arterton and 22-year-old talulah riley , who plays prim and proper annabel , agree that working on the film was " a big , frolicky knees-up " .
" it was a bit like being back at school with all the girls just having a laugh , " says riley , who was previously seen with keira knightley in 2005 's pride and prejudice .
talulah riley -lrb- l -rrb- and gemma arterton -lrb- r -rrb- star as schoolgirls the film centres on unorthodox headmistress camilla fritton as she struggles to cough up £ 500,000 she owes to the bank , while dealing with stuffy education minister geoffrey thwaites - played by colin firth - who is determined to clean up or close st trinian 's .
responsibility for saving the school falls on the anarchic pupils , who put their cliquey differences aside to stage a daring art heist .
the iconic 1950s films - such as belles of st trinian 's and blue murder at st trinian 's - featured stars like the young barbara windsor , joan sim , beryl reid and george cole , while comedy geniuses like sid james and frankie howerd also had cameo roles .
but the real star was alastair sim who donned unconvincing drag to play the bombastic millicent fritton and , on occasions , her brother clarence .
rupert everett also dons a frock to play the school 's headmistress in the new incarnation .
he admits miss fritton - with her wellington boots , tweed suits , pearls and hermes scarves - was influenced by the duchess of cornwall , with just a dash of everett 's mother .
" the duchess of cornwall is the kind of woman that miss fritton is - a no-nonsense , upper class woman in her wellington boots and tweed suit , " explains everett .
the girls - geeks , goths , posh totty and chavs - put their differences aside " but the duchess of cornwall is more petite than my camilla , who is a bit of an elephant . "
everett says dressing as a woman quickly lost its initial appeal .
" it was fun for the first couple of days , but then nightmarish because you go on day after day .
you ca n't really move much because you 're covered in make-up and glue , " explains everett .
" and i had a bad back from the boobs , but there was also the wigs , and lashes and teeth - it 's all uncomfortable .
" my breasts were lovely though , " he laughs , " they had a lovely consistency . "
" they were more than a match for me , " agrees firth , miss fritton 's unlikely love interest .
" we had one option towards the end in that love scene of actually having them pop , and it was my job to pop them .
" i just could n't do it .
we tried everything .
we even taped pins to my hands , but they just would n't go .
" i think they got the better of me . "

young people are advised to take an hour of moderate to vigorous exercise each day , such as playing football .
the energy used when playing active wii sports games is not of high enough intensity to contribute towards this , a british medical journal study found .
wii players used only 2 % more energy than players of regular computer games .
this year , the nintendo wii is topping christmas ' " must have " list .
even at the height of summer , almost 90,000 wiis a week were being sold across europe .
time spent in front of television and computer screens has been linked to physical inactivity and obesity .
beating the bulge however , the new generation of wireless-based computer games is meant to stimulate greater interaction and movement during play .
they require the player to move their whole body rather than simply press buttons or move a joystick .

he faced what was widely seen as token competition from five other candidates from the democratic party of turkmenistan , the only registered party .
mr berdymukhamedov had been acting president of oil-rich turkmenistan since 21 december 2006 , after the sudden death of the country 's long-standing authoritarian ruler , saparmurat niyazov .
when he came to power , mr berdymukhamedov pledged to follow the ways of his flamboyant predecessor but correspondents have suggested that some of his early reforms and proposals appeared to contradict niyazov 's decrees .
personal dentist kurbanguly berdymukhamedov was born in 1957 in the village of babaarap in the ashgabat region of the former turkmen soviet socialist republic .
there is little information about his early life , but it is known that he graduated from the dentistry faculty of the turkmen state medical institute in 1979 and later completed his phd in medical sciences in moscow .
he began work as a dentist in 1980 , and in 1995 became head of the dentistry centre of the turkmen ministry of health .
at the same time he was appointed associate professor and dean of the dentistry faculty of the turkmen state medical institute .
he subsequently became president niyazov 's personal dentist .
health reforms mr berdymukhamedov became a public figure in december 1997 when he was appointed minister of health , and in april 2001 he was also named deputy chairman of the council of ministers .
although his time as health minister was fairly uneventful , mr berdymukhamedov made the headlines once in april 2004 , when president niyazov decreed he would not be paid for three months because workers in turkmenistan 's state healthcare sector were also not being paid .
later that year , mr berdymukhamedov was responsible for implementing niyazov 's reforms of the health service , which many observers have blamed for its near collapse .
one of the most controversial of these decrees ordered the closure of all hospitals , except those in the capital ashgabat and in some major regional towns , the sacking of 15,000 healthcare workers and their replacement with untrained army conscripts .
succession in spite of his ministerial positions , however , observers were surprised when mr berdymukhamedov was appointed acting president of turkmenistan after niyazov 's sudden death from a heart attack on 21 december 2006 .
mr berdymukhamedov pledged to follow the ways of niyazov under the turkmen constitution , the post should have gone to owezgeldi atayew , the chairman of the supreme representative body of power , the halk maslahaty , or people 's council .
mr berdymukhamedov told state tv that mr atayew had been sacked after a criminal investigation into his activities .
mr berdymukhamedov 's position was further strengthened on 26 december 2006 , when an extraordinary session of the halk maslahaty amended the constitution to allow the acting president to run , along with five other candidates , for the presidency on 11 february 2007 .
several international media sources reported widespread rumours that mr berdymukhamedov had come to the fore because he was niyazov 's illegitimate son , pointing out a striking physical resemblance between the two men .
others suspected that the unsubstantiated allegations were circulated to legitimise mr berdymukhamedov 's succession claims .
loyalty and reform at the time of his inauguration , correspondents said mr berdymukhamedov 's first political actions indicated a move away from the personality cult style of niyazov .
mr berdymukhamedov has signed major gas deals with russia one of his first decrees was to reintroduce foreign languages to the school curriculum and extend the number of years turkmen children should stay in school .
he also announced the opening of internet cafes in ashgabat .
under niyazov , access to the internet had been strictly controlled .
in march 2007 , mr berdymukhamedov reversed one of his predecessor 's most unpopular decisions by restoring pensions to more than 100,000 elderly citizens .
the new code of social guarantees introduced state child and maternity benefits and increased payments to families of war veterans to one million manat -lrb- $ 40 -rrb- .
in another sign of change , mr berdymukhamedov released thousands of prisoners , including some government officials jailed by niyazov .
gas diplomacy mr berdymukhamedov has also made efforts to improve turkmenistan 's foreign relations , mainly by utilising the country 's abundant gas supplies .
in may 2007 he signed a landmark deal with russia ensuring that most of turkmenistan 's gas supplies would flow through russia for the foreseeable future , going against us and eu proposals for a pipe to be built under the caspian sea , avoiding russian control .
mr berdymukhamedov has also overseen attempts to attract greater numbers of tourists to turkmenistan , including the building of a multi-billion dollar tourist resort on the caspian sea .
however , traces of niyazov 's style can still be seen on occasions .
in december berdymukhamedov ordered the removal of satellite dishes from houses in ashgabat , saying they were " ugly " .
human rights groups have also criticised mr berdymukhamedov for his tight control of the media in turkmenistan and the lack of political diversity .
