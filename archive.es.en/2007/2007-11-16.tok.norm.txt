the deal also presents a challenge to aldi and lidl , germany 's market leaders in the fiercely contested , low-margin discount supermarket business . edeka is already germany 's biggest food retailer and the plan to combine plus with its chain of netto supermarkets depends on regulatory approval .
a decision on the deal is expected within six months . tengelmann is letting go of control over plus after the chain 's sales growth dropped by four-fifths in the latest fiscal year . bigger means more buying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tengelmann boss karl-eriwan haub , right , and alfons frenk , of edeka , are pleased with the deal together , plus and netto would have annual sales of about 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- , enabling them to secure better terms when buying goods .
tengelmann and hamburg-based edeka also agreed to cooperate on purchasing for their other retain chains . " it is important to have big joint purchasing power to get products cheaper from suppliers , " martina noss , an analyst at norddeutsche landesbank in hanover told bloomburg news .
" plus has lost much money by introducing a large non-food assortment , but it is possible to make money with a discount chain .
it is not an accident that the aldi brothers are the richest germans . " edeka chief executive officer alfons frenk declined to say how much the group had paid for its stake at the press conference on friday , nov .
16 .
but he said the deal would put the company in a much stronger position . " together , our market presence is a lot stronger , " said frenk . " we can really raise the pressure . " jobs do not appear to be at threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edeka plans to give aldi and lidl a run for their money in the discount sector frenk said the viability of each individual store would be investigated , but that the takeover was expected to create jobs .
he also predicted the opening of more than 300 new markets a year . tengelmann head karl-erivan haub said the two companies complemented each other well . plus and netto currently have a total of more than 4,100 outlets .
under the plans , just over two-thirds of the plus stores would become netto shops , but some 800 would retain their old name .
a family-owned company , tengelmann is germany 's sixth largest grocer and generates annual sales of nearly 25 billion euros from units in 15 countries including the obi chain of home-improvement stores . edeka is germany 's largest food retailer , with sales of 30.7 billion euros in 2006 , according to the lebensmittelzeitung trade magazine .

the chinese finance ministry cancelled a scheduled meeting with german finance minister peer steinbrück in beijing . despite having the meeting with china 's finance minister arranged for some time as part of his trip to the far east from dec .
1-8 , steinbrück was told that , due to the " very busy schedule of the new chinese finance minister , " xie xuren would have no time to see him .
the german foreign ministry said steinbrück 's trip to china would be rescheduled for the second quarter of next year and that the far east trip , during which he was also scheduled to visit tokyo and seoul , had been cancelled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück has canceled his entire far east trip it is the latest in a series of high-level meetings with german officials that the chinese have delayed or cancelled since chancellor angela merkel held a private meeting with the dalai lama on sept .
29 .
china vigorously protested the tibetan leader 's visit beforehand and reacted sharply afterwards by cutting contact with german officials .
dalia lama visit leads to cooling of relations beijing had previously pulled out of a planned meeting in october of world powers on the iranian nuclear crisis in berlin , forcing its cancellation .
china also axed an annual event scheduled for december in beijing to discuss human rights and called off a germany-china symposium scheduled for late september in munich , citing " technical reasons . "
a chinese foreign ministry spokesman last week said germany bore the responsibility to rectify " the negative impact of its erroneous act . "
china views the dalai lama as a dangerous separatist agitating for independence for tibet and has made clear its disapproval of any world leader holding an audience with him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " dangerous separatist " was welcomed in washington last month , the dalai lama met with us president george w. bush in washington , where the us congress gave him the congressional gold medal - its highest civilian award .
china issued similar threats of damaged ties with australia after prime minister john howard met with the dalai lama in june .
but chinese president hu jintao then travelled to australia , a visit that saw the two nations sign lucrative trade deals .
however , china 's ties with germany appear to have suffered the most .
in addition to the visit of the dalai lama , germany and china have been at odds over allegations of cyber espionage by hackers allegedly in the employ of the people 's republic .
there have also been spats over trade standards and criticism from germany on china 's human rights and environmental record . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after years peddling anglicisms , german advertisers have rediscovered their own language .
if the advertising industry is a barometer of the zeitgeist , what does this say about the state of the nation ? from vodafone 's " make the most of now " to siemens ' " be inspired , " the lingua franca of cutting-edge advertising has long been english , and germany is no exception .
but for a variety of reasons , companies across the board have recently been switching back to german , reflecting both a burgeoning cultural self-confidence and a growing desire to slam the brakes on the rapid spread of " denglish , " as anglicized german has been dubbed . examples include retailer c & a , which replaced " fashion for living " with " preise gut , alles gut " -lrb- the price is right , everything is right -rrb- and mcdonalds , whose advertising campaign morphed from " every time a good time " into " ich liebe es " -lrb- i 'm lovin ' it -rrb- . one reason for this shift is purely practical .
while even native speakers struggle with the double negatives of adidas ' promise that " impossible is nothing , " a study commissioned last year by advertising agency endmark revealed that germans respond to most english-language claims with sheer bewilderment . faced with a dozen anglicisms , only one-third of those questioned in the survey actually knew what the slogans meant .

" some brands consciously play with this lack of understanding , " she said .

" agencies will then simply use words that best convey this emotion . " positioning germany on the world stage is another factor , turner said . " tourists do n't necessarily understand german , whereas english is more international , " he said .
" an english word can provide a better projection surface . " but according to walter krämer , chairman of the german language association , using english as a way to boost an image - turning a corner snack bar into a " city-grill , " for example - is typical of the contemporary habit of watering down the german language . this is symptomatic of germany 's cultural insecurity , he argues , and also a snub to other cultures .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 16.11.2007 putin supporters call for an unconstitutional third term großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one german expert said the election was really a referendum on putin as european election observers were kept from entering russia and gave up their mission , hundreds of russians have demonstrated for president putin to stay on for a third term , even though the constitution forbids it . the movement 's name , pro-putin , says it all .
the group , which was founded in the provincial town of twer this week , claims to have collected 30 million signatures in support of president vladimir putin serving a third term , although the constitution prohibits it . " we see an opportunity for vladimir putin to stay on as head of state , " said pawel astachow , one of the movement 's 600 founding members . and his group is not alone . ever since putin put himself forward as the leading candidate of the united russia party for december 's parliamentary elections , the country has seen the emergence of dozens of groups supporting his bid to remain in power . although under the russian constitution putin can not run for a third term as president , there is nothing to stop him standing for the office of prime minister . putin 's " moral right " to rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenty of russians are " for putin , " just as this massive poster reads falk bomsdorf , head of the moscow office of germany 's liberal friedrich naumann foundation , said the actual election campaigns have been completely overshadowed by the pro-putin demonstrations . " we can no longer talk in terms of a parliamentary election , " he said . " there are no parties putting forward their agendas , no political debates and no alternatives . " thus far there has been no mention of a united russia party program , but that , say critics , is because putin is the program . as the president said earlier this week , a clear win on dec .
2 would give him the " moral right " to determine the path of russian politics even after his term runs out in 2008 . " if the people vote for united russia , it means a clear majority of the people put their trust in me , " putin said . he added that such a display of support would give him the moral right to hold those in the duma and the cabinet responsible for the implementation of the tasks that have already been set .
putin did not explain how he would maintain his grip on power , but said there were " various possibilities . " no european election observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce sent 400 observers to the last duma election the way the election is shaping out , it is set to become a referendum for the president , bomsdorf said . " the kremlin is doing everything it can to prevent proper elections , " he said .
" in my opinion , that is illegal . " on friday , europe 's main elections watchdog , the osce , announced it was calling off its observer mission for the december ballot , on the grounds that moscow has been uncooperative . in a statement , the organization for security and cooperation in europe said that the russian authorities remained unwilling to receive observers in a timely and cooperative manner and cooperate fully with them . the russian foreign ministry said the osce had " invented references to alleged difficulties in obtaining russian visas " in order to cancel its mission .
the european organization , which was originally invited on oct .
31 to send just 70 observers to watch the election - 330 less than for the russian duma election , applied for the visas on nov .
2 , according to german press reports . " it is abundantly clear that the russian election commission does not want any witnesses for their brilliant electoral preparations , " alexander konovalov , head of the institute for strategic studies told the russian nowyje iswestija newspaper . no real alternatives to untied russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin remains popular among large parts of the population moscow has shrugged off criticism that the upcoming vote is being stage-managed to ensure a landslide victory for the ruling united russia party , and meanwhile the well-oiled wheels of putin 's promotional apparatus continue to turn .
television advertisements talk about " russia 's economic well-being " and " putin 's plan , " and the president 's supporters march the streets in the name of promoting putin . thomas kunze , who until recently ran a branch of germany 's konrad-adenauer foundation in moscow , said the russian public genuinely thinks putin is doing a good job .

the group , which was founded in the provincial town of twer this week , claims to have collected 30 million signatures in support of president vladimir putin serving a third term , although the constitution prohibits it . " we see an opportunity for vladimir putin to stay on as head of state , " said pawel astachow , one of the movement 's 600 founding members . and his group is not alone . ever since putin put himself forward as the leading candidate of the united russia party for december 's parliamentary elections , the country has seen the emergence of dozens of groups supporting his bid to remain in power . although under the russian constitution putin can not run for a third term as president , there is nothing to stop him standing for the office of prime minister . putin 's " moral right " to rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenty of russians are " for putin , " just as this massive poster reads falk bomsdorf , head of the moscow office of germany 's liberal friedrich naumann foundation , said the actual election campaigns have been completely overshadowed by the pro-putin demonstrations . " we can no longer talk in terms of a parliamentary election , " he said . " there are no parties putting forward their agendas , no political debates and no alternatives . " thus far there has been no mention of a united russia party program , but that , say critics , is because putin is the program . as the president said earlier this week , a clear win on dec .
2 would give him the " moral right " to determine the path of russian politics even after his term runs out in 2008 . " if the people vote for united russia , it means a clear majority of the people put their trust in me , " putin said . he added that such a display of support would give him the moral right to hold those in the duma and the cabinet responsible for the implementation of the tasks that have already been set .
putin did not explain how he would maintain his grip on power , but said there were " various possibilities . " no european election observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce sent 400 observers to the last duma election the way the election is shaping out , it is set to become a referendum for the president , bomsdorf said . " the kremlin is doing everything it can to prevent proper elections , " he said .
" in my opinion , that is illegal . " on friday , europe 's main elections watchdog , the osce , announced it was calling off its observer mission for the december ballot , on the grounds that moscow has been uncooperative . in a statement , the organization for security and cooperation in europe said that the russian authorities remained unwilling to receive observers in a timely and cooperative manner and cooperate fully with them . the russian foreign ministry said the osce had " invented references to alleged difficulties in obtaining russian visas " in order to cancel its mission .
the european organization , which was originally invited on oct .
31 to send just 70 observers to watch the election - 330 less than for the russian duma election , applied for the visas on nov .
2 , according to german press reports . " it is abundantly clear that the russian election commission does not want any witnesses for their brilliant electoral preparations , " alexander konovalov , head of the institute for strategic studies told the russian nowyje iswestija newspaper . no real alternatives to untied russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin remains popular among large parts of the population moscow has shrugged off criticism that the upcoming vote is being stage-managed to ensure a landslide victory for the ruling united russia party , and meanwhile the well-oiled wheels of putin 's promotional apparatus continue to turn .
television advertisements talk about " russia 's economic well-being " and " putin 's plan , " and the president 's supporters march the streets in the name of promoting putin . thomas kunze , who until recently ran a branch of germany 's konrad-adenauer foundation in moscow , said the russian public genuinely thinks putin is doing a good job . " the middle class has experienced an improved standard of living under putin , and the economic moguls value the stability which putin has brought to russia , " he said . were he allowed to run for a third term as president , putin would currently be in line for between 60 percent and 70 percent of the vote .

it 's the third parliamentary vote since the province , which formally belongs to serbia , came under united nations control in 1999 . the election campaign in kosovo has been dominated by the subject of province 's future status .
with a trio of diplomatic envoys from the european union , the united states and russia facing a dec .

polls have shown well over 90 percent of the kosovar albanian population is in favor of taking this step . russia has remained serbia 's ally in the dispute by blocking a proposal for kosovo 's independence in the united nations security council , where moscow holds veto powers .

politicians argued that the problems could be better tackled once the province had formally split from serbia . but political observer dusan reljic , from the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs , told reuters that ethnic albanians - despite their support for independence - have little faith in their government at least when it comes to fighting corruption . surveys show only 14 percent of the population said they were happy with their political leadership and 70 percent said they were discontented . the population of kosovo is estimated at around 1.9 to 2.2 million .

dw-world.de spoke to the creator of the winning blog , 23-year-old minsk-based journalist xenia awimova . dw-world.de : what inspired you to start a blog ? xenia awimova : blogging is really popular in belarus at the moment .
i know a lot of people who have blogs on sites like livejournal.com , and at some point i became interested in the idea of starting one of my own .
it was a long time before i actually showed anyone my entries , but after a while i felt i 'd like other people to see my photographs so they could comment on them . what role does the blog play in your life ? it is quite simply a platform for me to show my amateur photographs .
it 's a kind of hobby which motivates me to keep taking photos and i can see it staying that way in the future .
i want to improve my photography skills and hope to find a critic among my readers who can tell me what they do n't like about my pictures and suggest ways for improvement .
that would be great . so far i have received very little by way of critical feedback .
i do n't know why .
i 'm really interested in people 's reactions to my work , because it represents my view of the world , and i think it 's interesting to know how others react to what i see . is your blog related to your profession ? it has more to do with what i would like to become , namely a photojournalist .
the blog enables me to practice that .
i am a journalist by profession , but i want to change my specialization .
one could say that my blog is connected to my professional ambition . the entries in your blog are accompanied by numerous commentaries .
why is that ? my blog is part of a relatively small social network which treats its members in a friendly way .
unlike some blogs , there are no rude entries in mine .
people who read my blog seem to be genuinely interested in what i am doing , and even in me as a person . do you read other blogs ?
do you have favorite bloggers ? yes , i subscribe to other blogs .
i like the stories by the blogger " sem ' korov " -lrb- " seven cows " -rrb- , which also appear on livejournal .
and i like the photos by " 365 dnej v godu " -lrb- " 365 days in the year " -rrb- .
his concept is similar to mine : every day he puts up a photograph he has taken that day . what is special about the blog scene in belarus ? there are n't very many independent newspapers or other platforms which allow people to express their opinions in belarus .
many bloggers , particularly those over the age of 20 , write about political subjects .
even opposition politicians keep blogs on livejournal.com in order to get their point across and attract potential supporters . interview : olga sosnytska -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal also presents a challenge to aldi and lidl , germany 's market leaders in the fiercely contested , low-margin discount supermarket business . edeka is already germany 's biggest food retailer and the plan to combine plus with its chain of netto supermarkets depends on regulatory approval .
a decision on the deal is expected within six months . tengelmann is letting go of control over plus after the chain 's sales growth dropped by four-fifths in the latest fiscal year . bigger means more buying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tengelmann boss karl-eriwan haub , right , and alfons frenk , of edeka , are pleased with the deal together , plus and netto would have annual sales of about 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- , enabling them to secure better terms when buying goods .
tengelmann and hamburg-based edeka also agreed to cooperate on purchasing for their other retain chains . " it is important to have big joint purchasing power to get products cheaper from suppliers , " martina noss , an analyst at norddeutsche landesbank in hanover told bloomburg news .
" plus has lost much money by introducing a large non-food assortment , but it is possible to make money with a discount chain .
it is not an accident that the aldi brothers are the richest germans . " edeka chief executive officer alfons frenk declined to say how much the group had paid for its stake at the press conference on friday , nov .
16 .
but he said the deal would put the company in a much stronger position . " together , our market presence is a lot stronger , " said frenk . " we can really raise the pressure . " jobs do not appear to be at threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edeka plans to give aldi and lidl a run for their money in the discount sector frenk said the viability of each individual store would be investigated , but that the takeover was expected to create jobs .
he also predicted the opening of more than 300 new markets a year . tengelmann head karl-erivan haub said the two companies complemented each other well . plus and netto currently have a total of more than 4,100 outlets .
under the plans , just over two-thirds of the plus stores would become netto shops , but some 800 would retain their old name .
a family-owned company , tengelmann is germany 's sixth largest grocer and generates annual sales of nearly 25 billion euros from units in 15 countries including the obi chain of home-improvement stores . edeka is germany 's largest food retailer , with sales of 30.7 billion euros in 2006 , according to the lebensmittelzeitung trade magazine .

berlin said it remained up to tehran to prove that its nuclear ambitions were peaceful and to cooperate with the international nuclear inspectors . the report shows area of light and of shade , but on the whole it is not encouraging , " german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said on friday , nov .
16 .
" iran has not met its commitments and has pursued enrichment work .
it still has to present us with proof that the aims of its nuclear program are purely peaceful . " us president george w. bush said on friday that international pressure on iran " must , and will grow " if tehran refuses to freeze its program . defiant response from iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran appears determined to continue with its nuclear activities but tehran vowed to continue its enrichment plans . " iran will never give up the uranium enrichment technology , which it has mastered , " iran 's ambassador to the iaea ali asghar soltanieh told iran 's official news agency irna . iranian president mahmud ahmadinejad also called on the us government to change its course , saying the iaea had testified to the fact that iran 's nuclear program was peaceful . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said in a report published on thursday that iran had provided " sufficient access " to individuals and responded in a " timely manner " to questions , but described cooperation as " reactive rather than pro-active . " while the watchdog body conceded iran had made some progress in revealing the extent of its nuclear program , it also stated that it was still defying un demands that it suspend enrichment . enough to produce a single nuclear bomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea noted some progress in its report , but continued to express misgivings officials confirmed for the first time that iran had installed 3,000 uranium enriching cartridges , reaching a key milestone in its nuclear program .
that is the number scientists believe is sufficient to create enough of radioactive material of sufficient quality to produce a nuclear bomb in one year . the report warned that the agency 's knowledge of the country 's current nuclear activities was diminishing . washington imposed fresh unilateral sanctions on iran in late october and has vowed in the wake of the report to press ahead with its drive for additional ones . the united states , which accuses iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons and has not ruled out using force against the islamic republic , said the findings in the report proved that iran was just " stringing the iaea along . " dwindling knowledge of what 's going on now " maybe they 've shed some additional light on activities in the 80s and 90s , but we know less and less about what they 're doing in 2007 , " the us ambassador to the iaea , gregory schulte , told the afp news agency . china and russia , which are also permanent members of the un security council , are reluctant about backing the us drive for further sanctions .
tehran has repeatedly said its nuclear program is intended only to generate energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said it is preparing to deliver fuel to an iranian nuclear plant while france has begun probing the possibility of eu sanctions against tehran , germany , which is iran 's largest european trading partner , has argued that ongoing un and european diplomatic efforts should first run their course before further action is taken . berlin has , however , signaled it would be open to additional measures if current sanctions do n't produce a change in iran . " the foreign minister has made clear that if this is the case we would take up this issue in europe and consider together what steps could be taken by europe , " jäger told reporters . russia readying nuclear fuel russia , on friday , announced it was prepared to begin sending nuclear fuel to an iranian station at the end of november . " we are ready to provide iaea specialists with all the conditions they need to do their work , " konstantin grabelnikov , deputy head of russia 's novosibirsk chemical concentrate plant , which is preparing the fuel , said in a statement . russian officials said they had not set a date for delivery , but added that the fuel would be sent six months before the iranian plant being built at bushehr began operation , which is not expected before 2008 . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal also presents a challenge to aldi and lidl , germany 's market leaders in the fiercely contested , low-margin discount supermarket business . edeka is already germany 's biggest food retailer and the plan to combine plus with its chain of netto supermarkets depends on regulatory approval .
a decision on the deal is expected within six months . tengelmann is letting go of control over plus after the chain 's sales growth dropped by four-fifths in the latest fiscal year . bigger means more buying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tengelmann boss karl-eriwan haub , right , and alfons frenk , of edeka , are pleased with the deal together , plus and netto would have annual sales of about 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- , enabling them to secure better terms when buying goods .
tengelmann and hamburg-based edeka also agreed to cooperate on purchasing for their other retain chains . " it is important to have big joint purchasing power to get products cheaper from suppliers , " martina noss , an analyst at norddeutsche landesbank in hanover told bloomburg news .
" plus has lost much money by introducing a large non-food assortment , but it is possible to make money with a discount chain .
it is not an accident that the aldi brothers are the richest germans . " edeka chief executive officer alfons frenk declined to say how much the group had paid for its stake at the press conference on friday , nov .

but he said the deal would put the company in a much stronger position . " together , our market presence is a lot stronger , " said frenk . " we can really raise the pressure . " jobs do not appear to be at threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edeka plans to give aldi and lidl a run for their money in the discount sector frenk said the viability of each individual store would be investigated , but that the takeover was expected to create jobs .
he also predicted the opening of more than 300 new markets a year . tengelmann head karl-erivan haub said the two companies complemented each other well . plus and netto currently have a total of more than 4,100 outlets .
under the plans , just over two-thirds of the plus stores would become netto shops , but some 800 would retain their old name .
a family-owned company , tengelmann is germany 's sixth largest grocer and generates annual sales of nearly 25 billion euros from units in 15 countries including the obi chain of home-improvement stores . edeka is germany 's largest food retailer , with sales of 30.7 billion euros in 2006 , according to the lebensmittelzeitung trade magazine .

christmas is just around the corner , if that fact does n't send you a-caroling along , a new school in germany may help you dump some of your humbug with lessons in how to prepare for the holiday . before throwing ourselves into this year 's festive preparations , perhaps we should all settle down for a moment - with a cup of eggnog , if necessary - and reexamine the hellish memories of last year 's yuletide experience that we 've spent the last 10 months trying to erase . by the time christmas comes round again , most people will have forgotten some or all of the following : the turkey was burnt , your uncle was drunk before lunch , and your parents fought all afternoon over dad 's lack of washing up assistance . your mind also has , thankfully , suppressed the fact that grandma bought you the exact same gift as on your birthday and the cat chewed through the christmas lights , setting fire to the carpet and giving the living room a foul smell until long after new year 's . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animals can contribute to christmas chaos while christmas is a time for reflection , family , and the giving and receiving of gifts ; it is also the time of year where the chances of everything going pear-shaped rapidly increase . academy to teach lessons in christmas well , if you 're german and lucky enough to live in the considerate city of trier , you could be on the verge of waving goodbye to disastrous christmases . the city knows the chances of a christmas actually turning out merry increase exponentially if the circumstances are n't left to chance .

the group , which was founded in the provincial town of twer this week , claims to have collected 30 million signatures in support of president vladimir putin serving a third term , although the constitution prohibits it . " we see an opportunity for vladimir putin to stay on as head of state , " said pawel astachow , one of the movement 's 600 founding members . and his group is not alone . ever since putin put himself forward as the leading candidate of the united russia party for december 's parliamentary elections , the country has seen the emergence of dozens of groups supporting his bid to remain in power . although under the russian constitution putin can not run for a third term as president , there is nothing to stop him standing for the office of prime minister . putin 's " moral right " to rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenty of russians are " for putin , " just as this massive poster reads falk bomsdorf , head of the moscow office of germany 's liberal friedrich naumann foundation , said the actual election campaigns have been completely overshadowed by the pro-putin demonstrations . " we can no longer talk in terms of a parliamentary election , " he said . " there are no parties putting forward their agendas , no political debates and no alternatives . " thus far there has been no mention of a united russia party program , but that , say critics , is because putin is the program . as the president said earlier this week , a clear win on dec .
2 would give him the " moral right " to determine the path of russian politics even after his term runs out in 2008 . " if the people vote for united russia , it means a clear majority of the people put their trust in me , " putin said . he added that such a display of support would give him the moral right to hold those in the duma and the cabinet responsible for the implementation of the tasks that have already been set .
putin did not explain how he would maintain his grip on power , but said there were " various possibilities . " no european election observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce sent 400 observers to the last duma election the way the election is shaping out , it is set to become a referendum for the president , bomsdorf said . " the kremlin is doing everything it can to prevent proper elections , " he said .
" in my opinion , that is illegal . " on friday , europe 's main elections watchdog , the osce , announced it was calling off its observer mission for the december ballot , on the grounds that moscow has been uncooperative . in a statement , the organization for security and cooperation in europe said that the russian authorities remained unwilling to receive observers in a timely and cooperative manner and cooperate fully with them . the russian foreign ministry said the osce had " invented references to alleged difficulties in obtaining russian visas " in order to cancel its mission .
the european organization , which was originally invited on oct .

berlin said it remained up to tehran to prove that its nuclear ambitions were peaceful and to cooperate with the international nuclear inspectors . the report shows area of light and of shade , but on the whole it is not encouraging , " german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said on friday , nov .
16 .
" iran has not met its commitments and has pursued enrichment work .
it still has to present us with proof that the aims of its nuclear program are purely peaceful . " us president george w. bush said on friday that international pressure on iran " must , and will grow " if tehran refuses to freeze its program . defiant response from iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran appears determined to continue with its nuclear activities but tehran vowed to continue its enrichment plans . " iran will never give up the uranium enrichment technology , which it has mastered , " iran 's ambassador to the iaea ali asghar soltanieh told iran 's official news agency irna . iranian president mahmud ahmadinejad also called on the us government to change its course , saying the iaea had testified to the fact that iran 's nuclear program was peaceful . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said in a report published on thursday that iran had provided " sufficient access " to individuals and responded in a " timely manner " to questions , but described cooperation as " reactive rather than pro-active . " while the watchdog body conceded iran had made some progress in revealing the extent of its nuclear program , it also stated that it was still defying un demands that it suspend enrichment . enough to produce a single nuclear bomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea noted some progress in its report , but continued to express misgivings officials confirmed for the first time that iran had installed 3,000 uranium enriching cartridges , reaching a key milestone in its nuclear program .
that is the number scientists believe is sufficient to create enough of radioactive material of sufficient quality to produce a nuclear bomb in one year . the report warned that the agency 's knowledge of the country 's current nuclear activities was diminishing . washington imposed fresh unilateral sanctions on iran in late october and has vowed in the wake of the report to press ahead with its drive for additional ones . the united states , which accuses iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons and has not ruled out using force against the islamic republic , said the findings in the report proved that iran was just " stringing the iaea along . " dwindling knowledge of what 's going on now " maybe they 've shed some additional light on activities in the 80s and 90s , but we know less and less about what they 're doing in 2007 , " the us ambassador to the iaea , gregory schulte , told the afp news agency . china and russia , which are also permanent members of the un security council , are reluctant about backing the us drive for further sanctions .
tehran has repeatedly said its nuclear program is intended only to generate energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said it is preparing to deliver fuel to an iranian nuclear plant while france has begun probing the possibility of eu sanctions against tehran , germany , which is iran 's largest european trading partner , has argued that ongoing un and european diplomatic efforts should first run their course before further action is taken . berlin has , however , signaled it would be open to additional measures if current sanctions do n't produce a change in iran . " the foreign minister has made clear that if this is the case we would take up this issue in europe and consider together what steps could be taken by europe , " jäger told reporters . russia readying nuclear fuel russia , on friday , announced it was prepared to begin sending nuclear fuel to an iranian station at the end of november . " we are ready to provide iaea specialists with all the conditions they need to do their work , " konstantin grabelnikov , deputy head of russia 's novosibirsk chemical concentrate plant , which is preparing the fuel , said in a statement . russian officials said they had not set a date for delivery , but added that the fuel would be sent six months before the iranian plant being built at bushehr began operation , which is not expected before 2008 . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" so help me god , " said tusk , leader of poland 's election-winning liberal party , as he pledged to serve the country , using a formula which , although optional , is traditionally used in government ceremonies in deeply-catholic poland .
his 18 ministers were then sworn in one by one .
tusk said his ministers were " well prepared and decent , " adding " state power should serve the people , not dominate them . "
his government intended to focus on " health , wages and home security , " tusk added .
tusk 's civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- party beat the conservative law and justice party in a snap election on oct .
21 and ended the unprecedented political double act of deposed prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski his identical twin , the president , lech .
the po victory also ended the rule of kaczynski 's fractious three-party coalition which had struggled through two years of in-fighting , scandal and criticism .
tusk hopes for more success with his coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk will lead a moderate coalition government tusk takes over with a new coalition , forced on him due to the fact that civic platform missed its goal of obtaining a parliamentary majority , winning 209 of the total 460 seats .
he forms his government with members of the moderate polish peasants ' party , which won 31 seats in parliament , and has made its leader , waldemar pawlak , his deputy prime minister .
jaroslaw kaczynski , who formally stepped down as prime minister on nov .
5 , has become the leader of the opposition .
tusk has pledged to end the regular tussles with the rest of the european union , and with neighboring germany in particular , which marked law and justice 's rule .
he also promised to ease tensions in relations with russia , which have been at their lowest ebb since poland broke free from the communist bloc in 1989 .
rocky times ahead in relationship with us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk will bring polish troops home from iraq he has said he will withdraw polish troops from iraq , where 900 soldiers are serving in the us-led coalition ; and has warned he will drive a harder bargain in talks with washington on basing part of a us anti-missile system in poland .
on the domestic side , he has promised to slash bureaucracy , revive the stalled privatization process and reform the health service .
he also wants to spur the already robust economy to try to draw home some of the more than a million poles who have emigrated since the country joined the eu in 2004 .
in addition , he wants poland to enter the euro zone .
the conservatives had regularly expressed skepticism about switching from the national currency , the zloty , to the euro .
eu-friendly tusk looking to repair european ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynskis have been thorns in many eu leaders ' side the urbane , amiable tusk is a dyed-in-the-wool champion of european integration - and his premiership will be in stark contrast to that of kaczynski after the fights the brothers picked with eu leaders .
he has also been a confirmed economic liberal since his youth , and has regularly said that poland needs less state interference and more entrepreneurs .
besides being an anti-regime activist during communist rule , when he studied poland 's pre-war history , tusk was a hands-on apprentice in economics , becoming one of the country 's few independent businessmen by setting up a small painting firm .
after 1989 , when communist rule came to an end in poland , tusk and a group of friends in his baltic sea hometown of gdansk founded a political party , the liberal democratic congress -lrb- kld -rrb- , to campaign for a sweeping privatization of the state-run economy .
in elections in 1991 , kld won 37 seats in poland 's 460-seat lower house , but lost them all two years later , and tusk opted to merge his party with the larger freedom union -lrb- uw -rrb- .
after leading a breakaway in 2001 , tusk formed po .
new pm looking to reduce state 's influence on business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business-friendly tusk wants to promote poland in line with his economic thinking , tusk is an avowed admirer of the late us president ronald reagan and former british prime minister margaret thatcher .
he has also been a faithful supporter of lech walesa , the former gdansk shipyard electrician who led the communist-era opposition trade union solidarity and was elected president in 1990 .
walesa also backed the po in the campaign that led to tusk 's victory .
tusk is proud of his cultural background .
he is a kashubian - a slav minority from the gdansk region - and has been at the forefront of a cultural revival which has reversed years of decline .
he only discovered his roots as an adult , prompting him to learn the language and later write the first textbook for would-be kashubian-speakers . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" so help me god , " said tusk , leader of poland 's election-winning liberal party , as he pledged to serve the country , using a formula which , although optional , is traditionally used in government ceremonies in deeply-catholic poland .
his 18 ministers were then sworn in one by one .
tusk said his ministers were " well prepared and decent , " adding " state power should serve the people , not dominate them . "
his government intended to focus on " health , wages and home security , " tusk added .
tusk 's civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- party beat the conservative law and justice party in a snap election on oct .
21 and ended the unprecedented political double act of deposed prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski his identical twin , the president , lech .
the po victory also ended the rule of kaczynski 's fractious three-party coalition which had struggled through two years of in-fighting , scandal and criticism .
tusk hopes for more success with his coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk will lead a moderate coalition government tusk takes over with a new coalition , forced on him due to the fact that civic platform missed its goal of obtaining a parliamentary majority , winning 209 of the total 460 seats .
he forms his government with members of the moderate polish peasants ' party , which won 31 seats in parliament , and has made its leader , waldemar pawlak , his deputy prime minister .
jaroslaw kaczynski , who formally stepped down as prime minister on nov .
5 , has become the leader of the opposition .
tusk has pledged to end the regular tussles with the rest of the european union , and with neighboring germany in particular , which marked law and justice 's rule .
he also promised to ease tensions in relations with russia , which have been at their lowest ebb since poland broke free from the communist bloc in 1989 .
rocky times ahead in relationship with us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk will bring polish troops home from iraq he has said he will withdraw polish troops from iraq , where 900 soldiers are serving in the us-led coalition ; and has warned he will drive a harder bargain in talks with washington on basing part of a us anti-missile system in poland .
on the domestic side , he has promised to slash bureaucracy , revive the stalled privatization process and reform the health service .
he also wants to spur the already robust economy to try to draw home some of the more than a million poles who have emigrated since the country joined the eu in 2004 .
in addition , he wants poland to enter the euro zone .
the conservatives had regularly expressed skepticism about switching from the national currency , the zloty , to the euro .
eu-friendly tusk looking to repair european ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynskis have been thorns in many eu leaders ' side the urbane , amiable tusk is a dyed-in-the-wool champion of european integration - and his premiership will be in stark contrast to that of kaczynski after the fights the brothers picked with eu leaders .
he has also been a confirmed economic liberal since his youth , and has regularly said that poland needs less state interference and more entrepreneurs .
besides being an anti-regime activist during communist rule , when he studied poland 's pre-war history , tusk was a hands-on apprentice in economics , becoming one of the country 's few independent businessmen by setting up a small painting firm .
after 1989 , when communist rule came to an end in poland , tusk and a group of friends in his baltic sea hometown of gdansk founded a political party , the liberal democratic congress -lrb- kld -rrb- , to campaign for a sweeping privatization of the state-run economy .
in elections in 1991 , kld won 37 seats in poland 's 460-seat lower house , but lost them all two years later , and tusk opted to merge his party with the larger freedom union -lrb- uw -rrb- .
after leading a breakaway in 2001 , tusk formed po .
new pm looking to reduce state 's influence on business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business-friendly tusk wants to promote poland in line with his economic thinking , tusk is an avowed admirer of the late us president ronald reagan and former british prime minister margaret thatcher .
he has also been a faithful supporter of lech walesa , the former gdansk shipyard electrician who led the communist-era opposition trade union solidarity and was elected president in 1990 .

berlin said it remained up to tehran to prove that its nuclear ambitions were peaceful and to cooperate with the international nuclear inspectors . the report shows area of light and of shade , but on the whole it is not encouraging , " german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said on friday , nov .
16 .
" iran has not met its commitments and has pursued enrichment work .
it still has to present us with proof that the aims of its nuclear program are purely peaceful . " us president george w. bush said on friday that international pressure on iran " must , and will grow " if tehran refuses to freeze its program . defiant response from iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran appears determined to continue with its nuclear activities but tehran vowed to continue its enrichment plans . " iran will never give up the uranium enrichment technology , which it has mastered , " iran 's ambassador to the iaea ali asghar soltanieh told iran 's official news agency irna . iranian president mahmud ahmadinejad also called on the us government to change its course , saying the iaea had testified to the fact that iran 's nuclear program was peaceful . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said in a report published on thursday that iran had provided " sufficient access " to individuals and responded in a " timely manner " to questions , but described cooperation as " reactive rather than pro-active . " while the watchdog body conceded iran had made some progress in revealing the extent of its nuclear program , it also stated that it was still defying un demands that it suspend enrichment . enough to produce a single nuclear bomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea noted some progress in its report , but continued to express misgivings officials confirmed for the first time that iran had installed 3,000 uranium enriching cartridges , reaching a key milestone in its nuclear program .
that is the number scientists believe is sufficient to create enough of radioactive material of sufficient quality to produce a nuclear bomb in one year . the report warned that the agency 's knowledge of the country 's current nuclear activities was diminishing . washington imposed fresh unilateral sanctions on iran in late october and has vowed in the wake of the report to press ahead with its drive for additional ones . the united states , which accuses iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons and has not ruled out using force against the islamic republic , said the findings in the report proved that iran was just " stringing the iaea along . " dwindling knowledge of what 's going on now " maybe they 've shed some additional light on activities in the 80s and 90s , but we know less and less about what they 're doing in 2007 , " the us ambassador to the iaea , gregory schulte , told the afp news agency . china and russia , which are also permanent members of the un security council , are reluctant about backing the us drive for further sanctions .
tehran has repeatedly said its nuclear program is intended only to generate energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said it is preparing to deliver fuel to an iranian nuclear plant while france has begun probing the possibility of eu sanctions against tehran , germany , which is iran 's largest european trading partner , has argued that ongoing un and european diplomatic efforts should first run their course before further action is taken . berlin has , however , signaled it would be open to additional measures if current sanctions do n't produce a change in iran . " the foreign minister has made clear that if this is the case we would take up this issue in europe and consider together what steps could be taken by europe , " jäger told reporters . russia readying nuclear fuel russia , on friday , announced it was prepared to begin sending nuclear fuel to an iranian station at the end of november . " we are ready to provide iaea specialists with all the conditions they need to do their work , " konstantin grabelnikov , deputy head of russia 's novosibirsk chemical concentrate plant , which is preparing the fuel , said in a statement . russian officials said they had not set a date for delivery , but added that the fuel would be sent six months before the iranian plant being built at bushehr began operation , which is not expected before 2008 . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal also presents a challenge to aldi and lidl , germany 's market leaders in the fiercely contested , low-margin discount supermarket business . edeka is already germany 's biggest food retailer and the plan to combine plus with its chain of netto supermarkets depends on regulatory approval .
a decision on the deal is expected within six months . tengelmann is letting go of control over plus after the chain 's sales growth dropped by four-fifths in the latest fiscal year . bigger means more buying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tengelmann boss karl-eriwan haub , right , and alfons frenk , of edeka , are pleased with the deal together , plus and netto would have annual sales of about 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- , enabling them to secure better terms when buying goods .
tengelmann and hamburg-based edeka also agreed to cooperate on purchasing for their other retain chains . " it is important to have big joint purchasing power to get products cheaper from suppliers , " martina noss , an analyst at norddeutsche landesbank in hanover told bloomburg news .
" plus has lost much money by introducing a large non-food assortment , but it is possible to make money with a discount chain .
it is not an accident that the aldi brothers are the richest germans . " edeka chief executive officer alfons frenk declined to say how much the group had paid for its stake at the press conference on friday , nov .
16 .
but he said the deal would put the company in a much stronger position . " together , our market presence is a lot stronger , " said frenk . " we can really raise the pressure . " jobs do not appear to be at threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edeka plans to give aldi and lidl a run for their money in the discount sector frenk said the viability of each individual store would be investigated , but that the takeover was expected to create jobs .
he also predicted the opening of more than 300 new markets a year . tengelmann head karl-erivan haub said the two companies complemented each other well . plus and netto currently have a total of more than 4,100 outlets .
under the plans , just over two-thirds of the plus stores would become netto shops , but some 800 would retain their old name .
a family-owned company , tengelmann is germany 's sixth largest grocer and generates annual sales of nearly 25 billion euros from units in 15 countries including the obi chain of home-improvement stores . edeka is germany 's largest food retailer , with sales of 30.7 billion euros in 2006 , according to the lebensmittelzeitung trade magazine .

" so help me god , " said tusk , leader of poland 's election-winning liberal party , as he pledged to serve the country , using a formula which , although optional , is traditionally used in government ceremonies in deeply-catholic poland .
his 18 ministers were then sworn in one by one .
tusk said his ministers were " well prepared and decent , " adding " state power should serve the people , not dominate them . "
his government intended to focus on " health , wages and home security , " tusk added .
tusk 's civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- party beat the conservative law and justice party in a snap election on oct .
21 and ended the unprecedented political double act of deposed prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski his identical twin , the president , lech .
the po victory also ended the rule of kaczynski 's fractious three-party coalition which had struggled through two years of in-fighting , scandal and criticism .
tusk hopes for more success with his coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk will lead a moderate coalition government tusk takes over with a new coalition , forced on him due to the fact that civic platform missed its goal of obtaining a parliamentary majority , winning 209 of the total 460 seats .
he forms his government with members of the moderate polish peasants ' party , which won 31 seats in parliament , and has made its leader , waldemar pawlak , his deputy prime minister .
jaroslaw kaczynski , who formally stepped down as prime minister on nov .
5 , has become the leader of the opposition .
tusk has pledged to end the regular tussles with the rest of the european union , and with neighboring germany in particular , which marked law and justice 's rule .

the group , which was founded in the provincial town of twer this week , claims to have collected 30 million signatures in support of president vladimir putin serving a third term , although the constitution prohibits it . " we see an opportunity for vladimir putin to stay on as head of state , " said pawel astachow , one of the movement 's 600 founding members . and his group is not alone . ever since putin put himself forward as the leading candidate of the united russia party for december 's parliamentary elections , the country has seen the emergence of dozens of groups supporting his bid to remain in power . although under the russian constitution putin can not run for a third term as president , there is nothing to stop him standing for the office of prime minister . putin 's " moral right " to rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenty of russians are " for putin , " just as this massive poster reads falk bomsdorf , head of the moscow office of germany 's liberal friedrich naumann foundation , said the actual election campaigns have been completely overshadowed by the pro-putin demonstrations . " we can no longer talk in terms of a parliamentary election , " he said . " there are no parties putting forward their agendas , no political debates and no alternatives . " thus far there has been no mention of a united russia party program , but that , say critics , is because putin is the program . as the president said earlier this week , a clear win on dec .
2 would give him the " moral right " to determine the path of russian politics even after his term runs out in 2008 . " if the people vote for united russia , it means a clear majority of the people put their trust in me , " putin said . he added that such a display of support would give him the moral right to hold those in the duma and the cabinet responsible for the implementation of the tasks that have already been set .
putin did not explain how he would maintain his grip on power , but said there were " various possibilities . " no european election observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce sent 400 observers to the last duma election the way the election is shaping out , it is set to become a referendum for the president , bomsdorf said . " the kremlin is doing everything it can to prevent proper elections , " he said .
" in my opinion , that is illegal . " on friday , europe 's main elections watchdog , the osce , announced it was calling off its observer mission for the december ballot , on the grounds that moscow has been uncooperative . in a statement , the organization for security and cooperation in europe said that the russian authorities remained unwilling to receive observers in a timely and cooperative manner and cooperate fully with them . the russian foreign ministry said the osce had " invented references to alleged difficulties in obtaining russian visas " in order to cancel its mission .
the european organization , which was originally invited on oct .
31 to send just 70 observers to watch the election - 330 less than for the russian duma election , applied for the visas on nov .
2 , according to german press reports . " it is abundantly clear that the russian election commission does not want any witnesses for their brilliant electoral preparations , " alexander konovalov , head of the institute for strategic studies told the russian nowyje iswestija newspaper . no real alternatives to untied russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin remains popular among large parts of the population moscow has shrugged off criticism that the upcoming vote is being stage-managed to ensure a landslide victory for the ruling united russia party , and meanwhile the well-oiled wheels of putin 's promotional apparatus continue to turn .
television advertisements talk about " russia 's economic well-being " and " putin 's plan , " and the president 's supporters march the streets in the name of promoting putin . thomas kunze , who until recently ran a branch of germany 's konrad-adenauer foundation in moscow , said the russian public genuinely thinks putin is doing a good job . " the middle class has experienced an improved standard of living under putin , and the economic moguls value the stability which putin has brought to russia , " he said . were he allowed to run for a third term as president , putin would currently be in line for between 60 percent and 70 percent of the vote .
with that in mind , the pro-putin campaigns seem unnecessary , but bomsdorf said their aim is not to advertise for putin but to inspire the apathetic russian public to the ballot box . " russians do n't bother with elections , and why should they if there are n't any real alternatives , " he said . manfred götzke -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

“ alive in baghdad ” won as the jury 's best videoblog and “ valour-it ” took home the best weblog english .
xenia awimova , a 23-year-old aspiring photojournalist who lives and works in the belarusian capital of minsk , runs " foto-griffoneurei " -lrb- literally " photo-maniac " -rrb- .
the jury said that her collection of photos thoroughly expresses her life and surroundings and thereby fulfils the main purpose of a blog .
" with few words , this excellent blog succeeds in portraying the daily life of people in belarus , " said christian gramsch , program director of dw-world.de and dw-radio .
“ she thereby supplies information from a country that , to a large extent , separates itself from outside views . ”
" in belarus there are not many independent newspapers or other platforms where people can express their opinions , " awimova said after being told of the award .
" that is why a lot of young people write blogs .
these are often about politics .
even oppositional politicians use blogs to present their opinion and as a way to get the attention of potential supporters . "
an anonymous blogger going by the name of jotman won the 2007 reporters without borders award – an inherent part of the bobs .
the blogger 's coverage of the 2006 coup in thailand and more recent reports from protests against the military junta in myanmar , also known as burma , made him stand out , jury members said .
two blogs with different perspectives of the war in iraq also won awards .
alive in baghdad , a videoblog about the daily lives of iraqis , received the jury 's prize in the best videoblog category , and valour-it , a blog that raises money to buy laptops for injured soldiers , won the best english weblog award . award ceremony in berlin the fourth annual best of the blogs 2007 came to an end on the evening of november 15 with an awards ceremony at the museum of communication in berlin .
thirty awards were given out , including users ' -choice awards .
accompanying the event the jury discussed tendencies , characteristics and excellent examples from the international blogosphere .
in her keynote speech on “ blogging in iran and the internet as an alternative medium of the women ’ s movement , ” iranian blogger and feminist farnaz seifi stressed that “ in a society where the government controls the entire media , the internet offers tool for repressed voices to express themselves . ”
the awards ceremony was hosted by the dutch actress and singer ellen ten damme and the “ spreebllick ” blogger johnny haeusler . internationally-established weblog awards more than 7,000 weblogs in 10 different languages were nominated for this year 's competition , 1,500 more than last year .
the international jury made up of journalists , media experts and bloggers preselected 10 candidates for each category .
internet users were allowed to vote for their favorites for three weeks on the official website for the awards .
members of the jury for the bobs include internationally-renown bloggers and experts : kaltmamsell -lrb- germany -rrb- , mark glaser and andrew baron -lrb- usa -rrb- , jean-françois julliard -lrb- reporters without borders , frande -rrb- , ladybird -lrb- iraq -rrb- , ahmad humeid -lrb- jordan -rrb- , farnaz seifi -lrb- iran -rrb- , michael anti -lrb- china -rrb- , josé luis orihuela and hernán casciari -lrb- spain -rrb- , sonia francine -lrb- brazil -rrb- , anton nossik and alexander plushev -lrb- russia -rrb- , gilles klein -lrb- france -rrb- and henk blanken -lrb- netherlands -rrb- .

deutsche welle announces the winners of the “ international weblog awards – the bobs 2007 ” the “ photo-maniac ” blog from belarus is the winner of this year ’ s “ deutsche welle international weblog awards – the bobs . ”
the english-language blog “ jotman ” from thailand was the winner of this year ’ s prestigious reporters without borders award .
“ alive in baghdad ” won as the jury 's best videoblog and “ valour-it ” took home the best weblog english .
xenia awimova , a 23-year-old aspiring photojournalist who lives and works in the belarusian capital of minsk , runs " foto-griffoneurei " -lrb- literally " photo-maniac " -rrb- .
the jury said that her collection of photos thoroughly expresses her life and surroundings and thereby fulfils the main purpose of a blog .
" with few words , this excellent blog succeeds in portraying the daily life of people in belarus , " said christian gramsch , program director of dw-world.de and dw-radio .
“ she thereby supplies information from a country that , to a large extent , separates itself from outside views . ”
" in belarus there are not many independent newspapers or other platforms where people can express their opinions , " awimova said after being told of the award .
" that is why a lot of young people write blogs .
these are often about politics .
even oppositional politicians use blogs to present their opinion and as a way to get the attention of potential supporters . "
an anonymous blogger going by the name of jotman won the 2007 reporters without borders award – an inherent part of the bobs .
the blogger 's coverage of the 2006 coup in thailand and more recent reports from protests against the military junta in myanmar , also known as burma , made him stand out , jury members said .
two blogs with different perspectives of the war in iraq also won awards .
alive in baghdad , a videoblog about the daily lives of iraqis , received the jury 's prize in the best videoblog category , and valour-it , a blog that raises money to buy laptops for injured soldiers , won the best english weblog award . award ceremony in berlin the fourth annual best of the blogs 2007 came to an end on the evening of november 15 with an awards ceremony at the museum of communication in berlin .
thirty awards were given out , including users ' -choice awards .
accompanying the event the jury discussed tendencies , characteristics and excellent examples from the international blogosphere .
in her keynote speech on “ blogging in iran and the internet as an alternative medium of the women ’ s movement , ” iranian blogger and feminist farnaz seifi stressed that “ in a society where the government controls the entire media , the internet offers tool for repressed voices to express themselves . ”
the awards ceremony was hosted by the dutch actress and singer ellen ten damme and the “ spreebllick ” blogger johnny haeusler . internationally-established weblog awards more than 7,000 weblogs in 10 different languages were nominated for this year 's competition , 1,500 more than last year .
the international jury made up of journalists , media experts and bloggers preselected 10 candidates for each category .
internet users were allowed to vote for their favorites for three weeks on the official website for the awards .

" so help me god , " said tusk , leader of poland 's election-winning liberal party , as he pledged to serve the country , using a formula which , although optional , is traditionally used in government ceremonies in deeply-catholic poland .
his 18 ministers were then sworn in one by one .
tusk said his ministers were " well prepared and decent , " adding " state power should serve the people , not dominate them . "
his government intended to focus on " health , wages and home security , " tusk added .
tusk 's civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- party beat the conservative law and justice party in a snap election on oct .
21 and ended the unprecedented political double act of deposed prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski his identical twin , the president , lech .
the po victory also ended the rule of kaczynski 's fractious three-party coalition which had struggled through two years of in-fighting , scandal and criticism .
tusk hopes for more success with his coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk will lead a moderate coalition government tusk takes over with a new coalition , forced on him due to the fact that civic platform missed its goal of obtaining a parliamentary majority , winning 209 of the total 460 seats .
he forms his government with members of the moderate polish peasants ' party , which won 31 seats in parliament , and has made its leader , waldemar pawlak , his deputy prime minister .
jaroslaw kaczynski , who formally stepped down as prime minister on nov .
5 , has become the leader of the opposition .
tusk has pledged to end the regular tussles with the rest of the european union , and with neighboring germany in particular , which marked law and justice 's rule .
he also promised to ease tensions in relations with russia , which have been at their lowest ebb since poland broke free from the communist bloc in 1989 .
rocky times ahead in relationship with us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk will bring polish troops home from iraq he has said he will withdraw polish troops from iraq , where 900 soldiers are serving in the us-led coalition ; and has warned he will drive a harder bargain in talks with washington on basing part of a us anti-missile system in poland .
on the domestic side , he has promised to slash bureaucracy , revive the stalled privatization process and reform the health service .
he also wants to spur the already robust economy to try to draw home some of the more than a million poles who have emigrated since the country joined the eu in 2004 .
in addition , he wants poland to enter the euro zone .
the conservatives had regularly expressed skepticism about switching from the national currency , the zloty , to the euro .
eu-friendly tusk looking to repair european ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynskis have been thorns in many eu leaders ' side the urbane , amiable tusk is a dyed-in-the-wool champion of european integration - and his premiership will be in stark contrast to that of kaczynski after the fights the brothers picked with eu leaders .
he has also been a confirmed economic liberal since his youth , and has regularly said that poland needs less state interference and more entrepreneurs .
besides being an anti-regime activist during communist rule , when he studied poland 's pre-war history , tusk was a hands-on apprentice in economics , becoming one of the country 's few independent businessmen by setting up a small painting firm .
after 1989 , when communist rule came to an end in poland , tusk and a group of friends in his baltic sea hometown of gdansk founded a political party , the liberal democratic congress -lrb- kld -rrb- , to campaign for a sweeping privatization of the state-run economy .
in elections in 1991 , kld won 37 seats in poland 's 460-seat lower house , but lost them all two years later , and tusk opted to merge his party with the larger freedom union -lrb- uw -rrb- .
after leading a breakaway in 2001 , tusk formed po .
new pm looking to reduce state 's influence on business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business-friendly tusk wants to promote poland in line with his economic thinking , tusk is an avowed admirer of the late us president ronald reagan and former british prime minister margaret thatcher .
he has also been a faithful supporter of lech walesa , the former gdansk shipyard electrician who led the communist-era opposition trade union solidarity and was elected president in 1990 .
walesa also backed the po in the campaign that led to tusk 's victory .
tusk is proud of his cultural background .
he is a kashubian - a slav minority from the gdansk region - and has been at the forefront of a cultural revival which has reversed years of decline .
he only discovered his roots as an adult , prompting him to learn the language and later write the first textbook for would-be kashubian-speakers . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" so help me god , " said tusk , leader of poland 's election-winning liberal party , as he pledged to serve the country , using a formula which , although optional , is traditionally used in government ceremonies in deeply-catholic poland .
his 18 ministers were then sworn in one by one .
tusk said his ministers were " well prepared and decent , " adding " state power should serve the people , not dominate them . "
his government intended to focus on " health , wages and home security , " tusk added .
tusk 's civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- party beat the conservative law and justice party in a snap election on oct .
21 and ended the unprecedented political double act of deposed prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski his identical twin , the president , lech .
the po victory also ended the rule of kaczynski 's fractious three-party coalition which had struggled through two years of in-fighting , scandal and criticism .
tusk hopes for more success with his coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk will lead a moderate coalition government tusk takes over with a new coalition , forced on him due to the fact that civic platform missed its goal of obtaining a parliamentary majority , winning 209 of the total 460 seats .
he forms his government with members of the moderate polish peasants ' party , which won 31 seats in parliament , and has made its leader , waldemar pawlak , his deputy prime minister .
jaroslaw kaczynski , who formally stepped down as prime minister on nov .
5 , has become the leader of the opposition .
tusk has pledged to end the regular tussles with the rest of the european union , and with neighboring germany in particular , which marked law and justice 's rule .
he also promised to ease tensions in relations with russia , which have been at their lowest ebb since poland broke free from the communist bloc in 1989 .
rocky times ahead in relationship with us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk will bring polish troops home from iraq he has said he will withdraw polish troops from iraq , where 900 soldiers are serving in the us-led coalition ; and has warned he will drive a harder bargain in talks with washington on basing part of a us anti-missile system in poland .
on the domestic side , he has promised to slash bureaucracy , revive the stalled privatization process and reform the health service .
he also wants to spur the already robust economy to try to draw home some of the more than a million poles who have emigrated since the country joined the eu in 2004 .
in addition , he wants poland to enter the euro zone .
the conservatives had regularly expressed skepticism about switching from the national currency , the zloty , to the euro .
eu-friendly tusk looking to repair european ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynskis have been thorns in many eu leaders ' side the urbane , amiable tusk is a dyed-in-the-wool champion of european integration - and his premiership will be in stark contrast to that of kaczynski after the fights the brothers picked with eu leaders .
he has also been a confirmed economic liberal since his youth , and has regularly said that poland needs less state interference and more entrepreneurs .
besides being an anti-regime activist during communist rule , when he studied poland 's pre-war history , tusk was a hands-on apprentice in economics , becoming one of the country 's few independent businessmen by setting up a small painting firm .
after 1989 , when communist rule came to an end in poland , tusk and a group of friends in his baltic sea hometown of gdansk founded a political party , the liberal democratic congress -lrb- kld -rrb- , to campaign for a sweeping privatization of the state-run economy .
in elections in 1991 , kld won 37 seats in poland 's 460-seat lower house , but lost them all two years later , and tusk opted to merge his party with the larger freedom union -lrb- uw -rrb- .
after leading a breakaway in 2001 , tusk formed po .
new pm looking to reduce state 's influence on business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business-friendly tusk wants to promote poland in line with his economic thinking , tusk is an avowed admirer of the late us president ronald reagan and former british prime minister margaret thatcher .
he has also been a faithful supporter of lech walesa , the former gdansk shipyard electrician who led the communist-era opposition trade union solidarity and was elected president in 1990 .
walesa also backed the po in the campaign that led to tusk 's victory .
tusk is proud of his cultural background .
he is a kashubian - a slav minority from the gdansk region - and has been at the forefront of a cultural revival which has reversed years of decline .
he only discovered his roots as an adult , prompting him to learn the language and later write the first textbook for would-be kashubian-speakers . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin said it remained up to tehran to prove that its nuclear ambitions were peaceful and to cooperate with the international nuclear inspectors . the report shows area of light and of shade , but on the whole it is not encouraging , " german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said on friday , nov .

" iran has not met its commitments and has pursued enrichment work .
it still has to present us with proof that the aims of its nuclear program are purely peaceful . " us president george w. bush said on friday that international pressure on iran " must , and will grow " if tehran refuses to freeze its program . defiant response from iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran appears determined to continue with its nuclear activities but tehran vowed to continue its enrichment plans . " iran will never give up the uranium enrichment technology , which it has mastered , " iran 's ambassador to the iaea ali asghar soltanieh told iran 's official news agency irna . iranian president mahmud ahmadinejad also called on the us government to change its course , saying the iaea had testified to the fact that iran 's nuclear program was peaceful . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said in a report published on thursday that iran had provided " sufficient access " to individuals and responded in a " timely manner " to questions , but described cooperation as " reactive rather than pro-active . " while the watchdog body conceded iran had made some progress in revealing the extent of its nuclear program , it also stated that it was still defying un demands that it suspend enrichment . enough to produce a single nuclear bomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea noted some progress in its report , but continued to express misgivings officials confirmed for the first time that iran had installed 3,000 uranium enriching cartridges , reaching a key milestone in its nuclear program .
that is the number scientists believe is sufficient to create enough of radioactive material of sufficient quality to produce a nuclear bomb in one year . the report warned that the agency 's knowledge of the country 's current nuclear activities was diminishing . washington imposed fresh unilateral sanctions on iran in late october and has vowed in the wake of the report to press ahead with its drive for additional ones . the united states , which accuses iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons and has not ruled out using force against the islamic republic , said the findings in the report proved that iran was just " stringing the iaea along . " dwindling knowledge of what 's going on now " maybe they 've shed some additional light on activities in the 80s and 90s , but we know less and less about what they 're doing in 2007 , " the us ambassador to the iaea , gregory schulte , told the afp news agency . china and russia , which are also permanent members of the un security council , are reluctant about backing the us drive for further sanctions .
tehran has repeatedly said its nuclear program is intended only to generate energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said it is preparing to deliver fuel to an iranian nuclear plant while france has begun probing the possibility of eu sanctions against tehran , germany , which is iran 's largest european trading partner , has argued that ongoing un and european diplomatic efforts should first run their course before further action is taken . berlin has , however , signaled it would be open to additional measures if current sanctions do n't produce a change in iran . " the foreign minister has made clear that if this is the case we would take up this issue in europe and consider together what steps could be taken by europe , " jäger told reporters . russia readying nuclear fuel russia , on friday , announced it was prepared to begin sending nuclear fuel to an iranian station at the end of november . " we are ready to provide iaea specialists with all the conditions they need to do their work , " konstantin grabelnikov , deputy head of russia 's novosibirsk chemical concentrate plant , which is preparing the fuel , said in a statement . russian officials said they had not set a date for delivery , but added that the fuel would be sent six months before the iranian plant being built at bushehr began operation , which is not expected before 2008 . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the group , which was founded in the provincial town of twer this week , claims to have collected 30 million signatures in support of president vladimir putin serving a third term , although the constitution prohibits it . " we see an opportunity for vladimir putin to stay on as head of state , " said pawel astachow , one of the movement 's 600 founding members . and his group is not alone . ever since putin put himself forward as the leading candidate of the united russia party for december 's parliamentary elections , the country has seen the emergence of dozens of groups supporting his bid to remain in power . although under the russian constitution putin can not run for a third term as president , there is nothing to stop him standing for the office of prime minister . putin 's " moral right " to rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenty of russians are " for putin , " just as this massive poster reads falk bomsdorf , head of the moscow office of germany 's liberal friedrich naumann foundation , said the actual election campaigns have been completely overshadowed by the pro-putin demonstrations . " we can no longer talk in terms of a parliamentary election , " he said . " there are no parties putting forward their agendas , no political debates and no alternatives . " thus far there has been no mention of a united russia party program , but that , say critics , is because putin is the program . as the president said earlier this week , a clear win on dec .
2 would give him the " moral right " to determine the path of russian politics even after his term runs out in 2008 . " if the people vote for united russia , it means a clear majority of the people put their trust in me , " putin said . he added that such a display of support would give him the moral right to hold those in the duma and the cabinet responsible for the implementation of the tasks that have already been set .
putin did not explain how he would maintain his grip on power , but said there were " various possibilities . " no european election observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce sent 400 observers to the last duma election the way the election is shaping out , it is set to become a referendum for the president , bomsdorf said . " the kremlin is doing everything it can to prevent proper elections , " he said .
" in my opinion , that is illegal . " on friday , europe 's main elections watchdog , the osce , announced it was calling off its observer mission for the december ballot , on the grounds that moscow has been uncooperative . in a statement , the organization for security and cooperation in europe said that the russian authorities remained unwilling to receive observers in a timely and cooperative manner and cooperate fully with them . the russian foreign ministry said the osce had " invented references to alleged difficulties in obtaining russian visas " in order to cancel its mission .
the european organization , which was originally invited on oct .
31 to send just 70 observers to watch the election - 330 less than for the russian duma election , applied for the visas on nov .
2 , according to german press reports .

the group , which was founded in the provincial town of twer this week , claims to have collected 30 million signatures in support of president vladimir putin serving a third term , although the constitution prohibits it . " we see an opportunity for vladimir putin to stay on as head of state , " said pawel astachow , one of the movement 's 600 founding members . and his group is not alone . ever since putin put himself forward as the leading candidate of the united russia party for december 's parliamentary elections , the country has seen the emergence of dozens of groups supporting his bid to remain in power . although under the russian constitution putin can not run for a third term as president , there is nothing to stop him standing for the office of prime minister . putin 's " moral right " to rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenty of russians are " for putin , " just as this massive poster reads falk bomsdorf , head of the moscow office of germany 's liberal friedrich naumann foundation , said the actual election campaigns have been completely overshadowed by the pro-putin demonstrations . " we can no longer talk in terms of a parliamentary election , " he said . " there are no parties putting forward their agendas , no political debates and no alternatives . " thus far there has been no mention of a united russia party program , but that , say critics , is because putin is the program . as the president said earlier this week , a clear win on dec .
2 would give him the " moral right " to determine the path of russian politics even after his term runs out in 2008 . " if the people vote for united russia , it means a clear majority of the people put their trust in me , " putin said . he added that such a display of support would give him the moral right to hold those in the duma and the cabinet responsible for the implementation of the tasks that have already been set .
putin did not explain how he would maintain his grip on power , but said there were " various possibilities . " no european election observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce sent 400 observers to the last duma election the way the election is shaping out , it is set to become a referendum for the president , bomsdorf said . " the kremlin is doing everything it can to prevent proper elections , " he said .
" in my opinion , that is illegal . " on friday , europe 's main elections watchdog , the osce , announced it was calling off its observer mission for the december ballot , on the grounds that moscow has been uncooperative . in a statement , the organization for security and cooperation in europe said that the russian authorities remained unwilling to receive observers in a timely and cooperative manner and cooperate fully with them . the russian foreign ministry said the osce had " invented references to alleged difficulties in obtaining russian visas " in order to cancel its mission .
the european organization , which was originally invited on oct .
31 to send just 70 observers to watch the election - 330 less than for the russian duma election , applied for the visas on nov .

" it is abundantly clear that the russian election commission does not want any witnesses for their brilliant electoral preparations , " alexander konovalov , head of the institute for strategic studies told the russian nowyje iswestija newspaper . no real alternatives to untied russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin remains popular among large parts of the population moscow has shrugged off criticism that the upcoming vote is being stage-managed to ensure a landslide victory for the ruling united russia party , and meanwhile the well-oiled wheels of putin 's promotional apparatus continue to turn .

after years peddling anglicisms , german advertisers have rediscovered their own language .
if the advertising industry is a barometer of the zeitgeist , what does this say about the state of the nation ? from vodafone 's " make the most of now " to siemens ' " be inspired , " the lingua franca of cutting-edge advertising has long been english , and germany is no exception .
but for a variety of reasons , companies across the board have recently been switching back to german , reflecting both a burgeoning cultural self-confidence and a growing desire to slam the brakes on the rapid spread of " denglish , " as anglicized german has been dubbed . examples include retailer c & a , which replaced " fashion for living " with " preise gut , alles gut " -lrb- the price is right , everything is right -rrb- and mcdonalds , whose advertising campaign morphed from " every time a good time " into " ich liebe es " -lrb- i 'm lovin ' it -rrb- . one reason for this shift is purely practical .
while even native speakers struggle with the double negatives of adidas ' promise that " impossible is nothing , " a study commissioned last year by advertising agency endmark revealed that germans respond to most english-language claims with sheer bewilderment . faced with a dozen anglicisms , only one-third of those questioned in the survey actually knew what the slogans meant .
few grasped the point of " come in and find out , " the ubiquitous promotion for the douglas cosmetics chain .
most consumers , it emerged , thought they were being invited to enter a store and then find the nearest exit . jaguar 's " life by gorgeous " campaign left participants equally bemused , with many laboring under the impression the advertisement was showcasing good times in georgia .
private tv station sat1 's slogan " powered by emotion " must have seemed extremely out of place as most people translated it into german as " kraft durch freude " or " strength through joy " - a favorite motto of hitler 's . perhaps not suprisingly , the offending claims have since been replaced by german ones . sowing the deliberate seeds of confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new sat1 logo according to a recent study carried out by slogans.de , an internet portal for research into advertising , the trend this year has consequently been to more german slogans and fewer anglicisms , with the share of english-language claims slipping down to 18.7 percent compared to 30 percent six years ago . inga wermuth , founder of slogans.de and owner of the hamburg-based advertising agency satelliten media design , said in the past , using english was an easy way to sex up a product - and that an element of linguistic confusion was all part of the strategy . " some brands consciously play with this lack of understanding , " she said .
" the exoticism of a foreign language makes a product seem complex and innovative . " ad man sebastian turner from the scholz & friends agency , one of the top creative addresses in germany , agreed that obfuscation is key . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one douglas ad campaign left consumers wondering where the exits were " when the point is to convey a certain feeling , then precision , function and clarity become secondary , " he said .
" agencies will then simply use words that best convey this emotion . " positioning germany on the world stage is another factor , turner said . " tourists do n't necessarily understand german , whereas english is more international , " he said .
" an english word can provide a better projection surface . " but according to walter krämer , chairman of the german language association , using english as a way to boost an image - turning a corner snack bar into a " city-grill , " for example - is typical of the contemporary habit of watering down the german language . this is symptomatic of germany 's cultural insecurity , he argues , and also a snub to other cultures . " the german fondness for all things american is also an aversion to other nations and cultures , " the association 's web site says . a shift in values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavier naidoo became a music star singing in german now , however , german appears to be making a come-back - and the sea-change could well mean nothing less than a new sense of national pride . " companies have realized that people do n't understand their claims , " krämer said .
" they also realize that english no longer represents higher standards , but , thanks to george bush , lower standards - just as polls in germany show that americans are increasingly less popular . " wermuth also said she feels that the fact german ads are less inclined to use english is a response to globalization . " this return to the german language is rooted in the fear that , in the long run , it may be taken over by foreign influences , " she said .
" in recent years , our identity has become ever less rooted in traditional , regional and family values .
consequently , there is a growing desire to explore our identity .
these days , the german language appeals more to our emotions because it speaks to our roots . " she pointed out that german-language pop music has seen a similar development . " in the past , german artists did n't stand a chance if they sang in german , " she said .
" but in the late 1990s , performers such as rosenstolz , die fantastischen vier , juli and xavier naidoo began conveying different values with their lyrics and stormed the charts .
similarly , advertising slogans in german come across as more honest , and people feel better able to assess their message . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle announces the winners of the “ international weblog awards – the bobs 2007 ” the “ photo-maniac ” blog from belarus is the winner of this year ’ s “ deutsche welle international weblog awards – the bobs . ”
the english-language blog “ jotman ” from thailand was the winner of this year ’ s prestigious reporters without borders award .
“ alive in baghdad ” won as the jury 's best videoblog and “ valour-it ” took home the best weblog english .
xenia awimova , a 23-year-old aspiring photojournalist who lives and works in the belarusian capital of minsk , runs " foto-griffoneurei " -lrb- literally " photo-maniac " -rrb- .
the jury said that her collection of photos thoroughly expresses her life and surroundings and thereby fulfils the main purpose of a blog .
" with few words , this excellent blog succeeds in portraying the daily life of people in belarus , " said christian gramsch , program director of dw-world.de and dw-radio .
“ she thereby supplies information from a country that , to a large extent , separates itself from outside views . ”
" in belarus there are not many independent newspapers or other platforms where people can express their opinions , " awimova said after being told of the award .
" that is why a lot of young people write blogs .
these are often about politics .
even oppositional politicians use blogs to present their opinion and as a way to get the attention of potential supporters . "
an anonymous blogger going by the name of jotman won the 2007 reporters without borders award – an inherent part of the bobs .
the blogger 's coverage of the 2006 coup in thailand and more recent reports from protests against the military junta in myanmar , also known as burma , made him stand out , jury members said .
two blogs with different perspectives of the war in iraq also won awards .
alive in baghdad , a videoblog about the daily lives of iraqis , received the jury 's prize in the best videoblog category , and valour-it , a blog that raises money to buy laptops for injured soldiers , won the best english weblog award . award ceremony in berlin the fourth annual best of the blogs 2007 came to an end on the evening of november 15 with an awards ceremony at the museum of communication in berlin .

the group , which was founded in the provincial town of twer this week , claims to have collected 30 million signatures in support of president vladimir putin serving a third term , although the constitution prohibits it . " we see an opportunity for vladimir putin to stay on as head of state , " said pawel astachow , one of the movement 's 600 founding members . and his group is not alone . ever since putin put himself forward as the leading candidate of the united russia party for december 's parliamentary elections , the country has seen the emergence of dozens of groups supporting his bid to remain in power . although under the russian constitution putin can not run for a third term as president , there is nothing to stop him standing for the office of prime minister . putin 's " moral right " to rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenty of russians are " for putin , " just as this massive poster reads falk bomsdorf , head of the moscow office of germany 's liberal friedrich naumann foundation , said the actual election campaigns have been completely overshadowed by the pro-putin demonstrations . " we can no longer talk in terms of a parliamentary election , " he said . " there are no parties putting forward their agendas , no political debates and no alternatives . " thus far there has been no mention of a united russia party program , but that , say critics , is because putin is the program . as the president said earlier this week , a clear win on dec .
2 would give him the " moral right " to determine the path of russian politics even after his term runs out in 2008 . " if the people vote for united russia , it means a clear majority of the people put their trust in me , " putin said . he added that such a display of support would give him the moral right to hold those in the duma and the cabinet responsible for the implementation of the tasks that have already been set .
putin did not explain how he would maintain his grip on power , but said there were " various possibilities . " no european election observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce sent 400 observers to the last duma election the way the election is shaping out , it is set to become a referendum for the president , bomsdorf said . " the kremlin is doing everything it can to prevent proper elections , " he said .
" in my opinion , that is illegal . " on friday , europe 's main elections watchdog , the osce , announced it was calling off its observer mission for the december ballot , on the grounds that moscow has been uncooperative . in a statement , the organization for security and cooperation in europe said that the russian authorities remained unwilling to receive observers in a timely and cooperative manner and cooperate fully with them . the russian foreign ministry said the osce had " invented references to alleged difficulties in obtaining russian visas " in order to cancel its mission .
the european organization , which was originally invited on oct .
31 to send just 70 observers to watch the election - 330 less than for the russian duma election , applied for the visas on nov .
2 , according to german press reports . " it is abundantly clear that the russian election commission does not want any witnesses for their brilliant electoral preparations , " alexander konovalov , head of the institute for strategic studies told the russian nowyje iswestija newspaper . no real alternatives to untied russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin remains popular among large parts of the population moscow has shrugged off criticism that the upcoming vote is being stage-managed to ensure a landslide victory for the ruling united russia party , and meanwhile the well-oiled wheels of putin 's promotional apparatus continue to turn .
television advertisements talk about " russia 's economic well-being " and " putin 's plan , " and the president 's supporters march the streets in the name of promoting putin . thomas kunze , who until recently ran a branch of germany 's konrad-adenauer foundation in moscow , said the russian public genuinely thinks putin is doing a good job . " the middle class has experienced an improved standard of living under putin , and the economic moguls value the stability which putin has brought to russia , " he said . were he allowed to run for a third term as president , putin would currently be in line for between 60 percent and 70 percent of the vote .
with that in mind , the pro-putin campaigns seem unnecessary , but bomsdorf said their aim is not to advertise for putin but to inspire the apathetic russian public to the ballot box . " russians do n't bother with elections , and why should they if there are n't any real alternatives , " he said . manfred götzke -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chinese finance ministry cancelled a scheduled meeting with german finance minister peer steinbrück in beijing . despite having the meeting with china 's finance minister arranged for some time as part of his trip to the far east from dec .

after years peddling anglicisms , german advertisers have rediscovered their own language .
if the advertising industry is a barometer of the zeitgeist , what does this say about the state of the nation ? from vodafone 's " make the most of now " to siemens ' " be inspired , " the lingua franca of cutting-edge advertising has long been english , and germany is no exception .
but for a variety of reasons , companies across the board have recently been switching back to german , reflecting both a burgeoning cultural self-confidence and a growing desire to slam the brakes on the rapid spread of " denglish , " as anglicized german has been dubbed . examples include retailer c & a , which replaced " fashion for living " with " preise gut , alles gut " -lrb- the price is right , everything is right -rrb- and mcdonalds , whose advertising campaign morphed from " every time a good time " into " ich liebe es " -lrb- i 'm lovin ' it -rrb- . one reason for this shift is purely practical .
while even native speakers struggle with the double negatives of adidas ' promise that " impossible is nothing , " a study commissioned last year by advertising agency endmark revealed that germans respond to most english-language claims with sheer bewilderment . faced with a dozen anglicisms , only one-third of those questioned in the survey actually knew what the slogans meant .
few grasped the point of " come in and find out , " the ubiquitous promotion for the douglas cosmetics chain .
most consumers , it emerged , thought they were being invited to enter a store and then find the nearest exit . jaguar 's " life by gorgeous " campaign left participants equally bemused , with many laboring under the impression the advertisement was showcasing good times in georgia .
private tv station sat1 's slogan " powered by emotion " must have seemed extremely out of place as most people translated it into german as " kraft durch freude " or " strength through joy " - a favorite motto of hitler 's . perhaps not suprisingly , the offending claims have since been replaced by german ones . sowing the deliberate seeds of confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new sat1 logo according to a recent study carried out by slogans.de , an internet portal for research into advertising , the trend this year has consequently been to more german slogans and fewer anglicisms , with the share of english-language claims slipping down to 18.7 percent compared to 30 percent six years ago . inga wermuth , founder of slogans.de and owner of the hamburg-based advertising agency satelliten media design , said in the past , using english was an easy way to sex up a product - and that an element of linguistic confusion was all part of the strategy . " some brands consciously play with this lack of understanding , " she said .
" the exoticism of a foreign language makes a product seem complex and innovative . " ad man sebastian turner from the scholz & friends agency , one of the top creative addresses in germany , agreed that obfuscation is key . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one douglas ad campaign left consumers wondering where the exits were " when the point is to convey a certain feeling , then precision , function and clarity become secondary , " he said .
" agencies will then simply use words that best convey this emotion . " positioning germany on the world stage is another factor , turner said . " tourists do n't necessarily understand german , whereas english is more international , " he said .
" an english word can provide a better projection surface . " but according to walter krämer , chairman of the german language association , using english as a way to boost an image - turning a corner snack bar into a " city-grill , " for example - is typical of the contemporary habit of watering down the german language . this is symptomatic of germany 's cultural insecurity , he argues , and also a snub to other cultures . " the german fondness for all things american is also an aversion to other nations and cultures , " the association 's web site says . a shift in values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavier naidoo became a music star singing in german now , however , german appears to be making a come-back - and the sea-change could well mean nothing less than a new sense of national pride . " companies have realized that people do n't understand their claims , " krämer said .
" they also realize that english no longer represents higher standards , but , thanks to george bush , lower standards - just as polls in germany show that americans are increasingly less popular . " wermuth also said she feels that the fact german ads are less inclined to use english is a response to globalization . " this return to the german language is rooted in the fear that , in the long run , it may be taken over by foreign influences , " she said .
" in recent years , our identity has become ever less rooted in traditional , regional and family values .

the chinese finance ministry cancelled a scheduled meeting with german finance minister peer steinbrück in beijing . despite having the meeting with china 's finance minister arranged for some time as part of his trip to the far east from dec .
1-8 , steinbrück was told that , due to the " very busy schedule of the new chinese finance minister , " xie xuren would have no time to see him .
the german foreign ministry said steinbrück 's trip to china would be rescheduled for the second quarter of next year and that the far east trip , during which he was also scheduled to visit tokyo and seoul , had been cancelled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück has canceled his entire far east trip it is the latest in a series of high-level meetings with german officials that the chinese have delayed or cancelled since chancellor angela merkel held a private meeting with the dalai lama on sept .

china vigorously protested the tibetan leader 's visit beforehand and reacted sharply afterwards by cutting contact with german officials .
dalia lama visit leads to cooling of relations beijing had previously pulled out of a planned meeting in october of world powers on the iranian nuclear crisis in berlin , forcing its cancellation .
china also axed an annual event scheduled for december in beijing to discuss human rights and called off a germany-china symposium scheduled for late september in munich , citing " technical reasons . "
a chinese foreign ministry spokesman last week said germany bore the responsibility to rectify " the negative impact of its erroneous act . "
china views the dalai lama as a dangerous separatist agitating for independence for tibet and has made clear its disapproval of any world leader holding an audience with him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " dangerous separatist " was welcomed in washington last month , the dalai lama met with us president george w. bush in washington , where the us congress gave him the congressional gold medal - its highest civilian award .
china issued similar threats of damaged ties with australia after prime minister john howard met with the dalai lama in june .
but chinese president hu jintao then travelled to australia , a visit that saw the two nations sign lucrative trade deals .
however , china 's ties with germany appear to have suffered the most .
in addition to the visit of the dalai lama , germany and china have been at odds over allegations of cyber espionage by hackers allegedly in the employ of the people 's republic .

17 , in kosovo 's parliamentary elections .
it 's the third parliamentary vote since the province , which formally belongs to serbia , came under united nations control in 1999 . the election campaign in kosovo has been dominated by the subject of province 's future status .
with a trio of diplomatic envoys from the european union , the united states and russia facing a dec .
10 deadline to come up with a plan for the province , the kosovar albanian parties have become increasingly vocal in their calls for independence . members of kosovo 's ethnic serb minority , estimated to total about 120,000 , are not expected to cast their ballots at the weekend .
the serbian government has recommended they boycott the vote , saying that taking part would be tantamount to recognizing the province 's independence , which belgrade opposes . ex-rebel tipped to be next prime minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic issues were secondary in the election campaign former kosovo liberation army leader , hashim thaci is tipped to become the next prime minister .
serbia accuses him of being a terrorist because of his rebel activities .
current prime minister agim ceku is not running for re-election . the latest polls give his democratic party of kosovo -lrb- pdk -rrb- a narrow lead over the democratic league of kosovo -lrb- ldk -rrb- , the party formerly led by ibrahim rugova , seen by many as the " father of the nation . "
he died in 2006 just before talks on kosovo 's future were set to begin .
analysts said they believe the vote will lead to a coalition between the two parties . with the protracted talks on kosovo 's future status having made little apparent progress , ethnic albanian politicians are threatening to declare independence unilaterally .
polls have shown well over 90 percent of the kosovar albanian population is in favor of taking this step . russia has remained serbia 's ally in the dispute by blocking a proposal for kosovo 's independence in the united nations security council , where moscow holds veto powers .
but kosovo 's 2 million albanians are counting on the united states and europe to recognize kosovo as an independent state , should it declare independence . whatever the outcome of the election , the un 's three kosovo mediators are scheduled to hold more talks in brussels on the province on tuesday . economic problems played second fiddle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of mitrovicahas been home to past violence between ethnic albanians and ethnic serbs in kosovo , domestic problems , such as the 60 percent unemployment rate , the lack of direct investment and high levels of corruption , were tied to the issue of independence in the campaign .
politicians argued that the problems could be better tackled once the province had formally split from serbia . but political observer dusan reljic , from the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs , told reuters that ethnic albanians - despite their support for independence - have little faith in their government at least when it comes to fighting corruption . surveys show only 14 percent of the population said they were happy with their political leadership and 70 percent said they were discontented . the population of kosovo is estimated at around 1.9 to 2.2 million .
some 4 percent are ethnic serbs .
ten of the 120 seats in the kosovar parliament are reserved for the serb minority . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" so help me god , " said tusk , leader of poland 's election-winning liberal party , as he pledged to serve the country , using a formula which , although optional , is traditionally used in government ceremonies in deeply-catholic poland .
his 18 ministers were then sworn in one by one .
tusk said his ministers were " well prepared and decent , " adding " state power should serve the people , not dominate them . "
his government intended to focus on " health , wages and home security , " tusk added .
tusk 's civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- party beat the conservative law and justice party in a snap election on oct .
21 and ended the unprecedented political double act of deposed prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski his identical twin , the president , lech .
the po victory also ended the rule of kaczynski 's fractious three-party coalition which had struggled through two years of in-fighting , scandal and criticism .
tusk hopes for more success with his coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk will lead a moderate coalition government tusk takes over with a new coalition , forced on him due to the fact that civic platform missed its goal of obtaining a parliamentary majority , winning 209 of the total 460 seats .
he forms his government with members of the moderate polish peasants ' party , which won 31 seats in parliament , and has made its leader , waldemar pawlak , his deputy prime minister .
jaroslaw kaczynski , who formally stepped down as prime minister on nov .
5 , has become the leader of the opposition .
tusk has pledged to end the regular tussles with the rest of the european union , and with neighboring germany in particular , which marked law and justice 's rule .
he also promised to ease tensions in relations with russia , which have been at their lowest ebb since poland broke free from the communist bloc in 1989 .
rocky times ahead in relationship with us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk will bring polish troops home from iraq he has said he will withdraw polish troops from iraq , where 900 soldiers are serving in the us-led coalition ; and has warned he will drive a harder bargain in talks with washington on basing part of a us anti-missile system in poland .
on the domestic side , he has promised to slash bureaucracy , revive the stalled privatization process and reform the health service .
he also wants to spur the already robust economy to try to draw home some of the more than a million poles who have emigrated since the country joined the eu in 2004 .
in addition , he wants poland to enter the euro zone .
the conservatives had regularly expressed skepticism about switching from the national currency , the zloty , to the euro .
eu-friendly tusk looking to repair european ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynskis have been thorns in many eu leaders ' side the urbane , amiable tusk is a dyed-in-the-wool champion of european integration - and his premiership will be in stark contrast to that of kaczynski after the fights the brothers picked with eu leaders .
he has also been a confirmed economic liberal since his youth , and has regularly said that poland needs less state interference and more entrepreneurs .
besides being an anti-regime activist during communist rule , when he studied poland 's pre-war history , tusk was a hands-on apprentice in economics , becoming one of the country 's few independent businessmen by setting up a small painting firm .
after 1989 , when communist rule came to an end in poland , tusk and a group of friends in his baltic sea hometown of gdansk founded a political party , the liberal democratic congress -lrb- kld -rrb- , to campaign for a sweeping privatization of the state-run economy .
in elections in 1991 , kld won 37 seats in poland 's 460-seat lower house , but lost them all two years later , and tusk opted to merge his party with the larger freedom union -lrb- uw -rrb- .
after leading a breakaway in 2001 , tusk formed po .
new pm looking to reduce state 's influence on business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business-friendly tusk wants to promote poland in line with his economic thinking , tusk is an avowed admirer of the late us president ronald reagan and former british prime minister margaret thatcher .
he has also been a faithful supporter of lech walesa , the former gdansk shipyard electrician who led the communist-era opposition trade union solidarity and was elected president in 1990 .
walesa also backed the po in the campaign that led to tusk 's victory .
tusk is proud of his cultural background .
he is a kashubian - a slav minority from the gdansk region - and has been at the forefront of a cultural revival which has reversed years of decline .
he only discovered his roots as an adult , prompting him to learn the language and later write the first textbook for would-be kashubian-speakers . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" russians do n't bother with elections , and why should they if there are n't any real alternatives , " he said . manfred götzke -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to the creator of the winning blog , 23-year-old minsk-based journalist xenia awimova . dw-world.de : what inspired you to start a blog ? xenia awimova : blogging is really popular in belarus at the moment .
i know a lot of people who have blogs on sites like livejournal.com , and at some point i became interested in the idea of starting one of my own .
it was a long time before i actually showed anyone my entries , but after a while i felt i 'd like other people to see my photographs so they could comment on them . what role does the blog play in your life ? it is quite simply a platform for me to show my amateur photographs .
it 's a kind of hobby which motivates me to keep taking photos and i can see it staying that way in the future .
i want to improve my photography skills and hope to find a critic among my readers who can tell me what they do n't like about my pictures and suggest ways for improvement .
that would be great . so far i have received very little by way of critical feedback .
i do n't know why .
i 'm really interested in people 's reactions to my work , because it represents my view of the world , and i think it 's interesting to know how others react to what i see . is your blog related to your profession ? it has more to do with what i would like to become , namely a photojournalist .
the blog enables me to practice that .
i am a journalist by profession , but i want to change my specialization .
one could say that my blog is connected to my professional ambition . the entries in your blog are accompanied by numerous commentaries .
why is that ? my blog is part of a relatively small social network which treats its members in a friendly way .
unlike some blogs , there are no rude entries in mine .
people who read my blog seem to be genuinely interested in what i am doing , and even in me as a person . do you read other blogs ?

the group , which was founded in the provincial town of twer this week , claims to have collected 30 million signatures in support of president vladimir putin serving a third term , although the constitution prohibits it . " we see an opportunity for vladimir putin to stay on as head of state , " said pawel astachow , one of the movement 's 600 founding members . and his group is not alone . ever since putin put himself forward as the leading candidate of the united russia party for december 's parliamentary elections , the country has seen the emergence of dozens of groups supporting his bid to remain in power . although under the russian constitution putin can not run for a third term as president , there is nothing to stop him standing for the office of prime minister . putin 's " moral right " to rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenty of russians are " for putin , " just as this massive poster reads falk bomsdorf , head of the moscow office of germany 's liberal friedrich naumann foundation , said the actual election campaigns have been completely overshadowed by the pro-putin demonstrations . " we can no longer talk in terms of a parliamentary election , " he said . " there are no parties putting forward their agendas , no political debates and no alternatives . " thus far there has been no mention of a united russia party program , but that , say critics , is because putin is the program . as the president said earlier this week , a clear win on dec .
2 would give him the " moral right " to determine the path of russian politics even after his term runs out in 2008 . " if the people vote for united russia , it means a clear majority of the people put their trust in me , " putin said . he added that such a display of support would give him the moral right to hold those in the duma and the cabinet responsible for the implementation of the tasks that have already been set .
putin did not explain how he would maintain his grip on power , but said there were " various possibilities . " no european election observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce sent 400 observers to the last duma election the way the election is shaping out , it is set to become a referendum for the president , bomsdorf said . " the kremlin is doing everything it can to prevent proper elections , " he said .
" in my opinion , that is illegal . " on friday , europe 's main elections watchdog , the osce , announced it was calling off its observer mission for the december ballot , on the grounds that moscow has been uncooperative . in a statement , the organization for security and cooperation in europe said that the russian authorities remained unwilling to receive observers in a timely and cooperative manner and cooperate fully with them . the russian foreign ministry said the osce had " invented references to alleged difficulties in obtaining russian visas " in order to cancel its mission .
the european organization , which was originally invited on oct .
31 to send just 70 observers to watch the election - 330 less than for the russian duma election , applied for the visas on nov .
2 , according to german press reports . " it is abundantly clear that the russian election commission does not want any witnesses for their brilliant electoral preparations , " alexander konovalov , head of the institute for strategic studies told the russian nowyje iswestija newspaper . no real alternatives to untied russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin remains popular among large parts of the population moscow has shrugged off criticism that the upcoming vote is being stage-managed to ensure a landslide victory for the ruling united russia party , and meanwhile the well-oiled wheels of putin 's promotional apparatus continue to turn .
television advertisements talk about " russia 's economic well-being " and " putin 's plan , " and the president 's supporters march the streets in the name of promoting putin . thomas kunze , who until recently ran a branch of germany 's konrad-adenauer foundation in moscow , said the russian public genuinely thinks putin is doing a good job . " the middle class has experienced an improved standard of living under putin , and the economic moguls value the stability which putin has brought to russia , " he said . were he allowed to run for a third term as president , putin would currently be in line for between 60 percent and 70 percent of the vote .
with that in mind , the pro-putin campaigns seem unnecessary , but bomsdorf said their aim is not to advertise for putin but to inspire the apathetic russian public to the ballot box . " russians do n't bother with elections , and why should they if there are n't any real alternatives , " he said . manfred götzke -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin said it remained up to tehran to prove that its nuclear ambitions were peaceful and to cooperate with the international nuclear inspectors . the report shows area of light and of shade , but on the whole it is not encouraging , " german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said on friday , nov .

" iran has not met its commitments and has pursued enrichment work .
it still has to present us with proof that the aims of its nuclear program are purely peaceful . " us president george w. bush said on friday that international pressure on iran " must , and will grow " if tehran refuses to freeze its program . defiant response from iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran appears determined to continue with its nuclear activities but tehran vowed to continue its enrichment plans . " iran will never give up the uranium enrichment technology , which it has mastered , " iran 's ambassador to the iaea ali asghar soltanieh told iran 's official news agency irna . iranian president mahmud ahmadinejad also called on the us government to change its course , saying the iaea had testified to the fact that iran 's nuclear program was peaceful . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said in a report published on thursday that iran had provided " sufficient access " to individuals and responded in a " timely manner " to questions , but described cooperation as " reactive rather than pro-active . " while the watchdog body conceded iran had made some progress in revealing the extent of its nuclear program , it also stated that it was still defying un demands that it suspend enrichment . enough to produce a single nuclear bomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea noted some progress in its report , but continued to express misgivings officials confirmed for the first time that iran had installed 3,000 uranium enriching cartridges , reaching a key milestone in its nuclear program .
that is the number scientists believe is sufficient to create enough of radioactive material of sufficient quality to produce a nuclear bomb in one year . the report warned that the agency 's knowledge of the country 's current nuclear activities was diminishing . washington imposed fresh unilateral sanctions on iran in late october and has vowed in the wake of the report to press ahead with its drive for additional ones . the united states , which accuses iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons and has not ruled out using force against the islamic republic , said the findings in the report proved that iran was just " stringing the iaea along . " dwindling knowledge of what 's going on now " maybe they 've shed some additional light on activities in the 80s and 90s , but we know less and less about what they 're doing in 2007 , " the us ambassador to the iaea , gregory schulte , told the afp news agency . china and russia , which are also permanent members of the un security council , are reluctant about backing the us drive for further sanctions .
tehran has repeatedly said its nuclear program is intended only to generate energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said it is preparing to deliver fuel to an iranian nuclear plant while france has begun probing the possibility of eu sanctions against tehran , germany , which is iran 's largest european trading partner , has argued that ongoing un and european diplomatic efforts should first run their course before further action is taken . berlin has , however , signaled it would be open to additional measures if current sanctions do n't produce a change in iran . " the foreign minister has made clear that if this is the case we would take up this issue in europe and consider together what steps could be taken by europe , " jäger told reporters . russia readying nuclear fuel russia , on friday , announced it was prepared to begin sending nuclear fuel to an iranian station at the end of november . " we are ready to provide iaea specialists with all the conditions they need to do their work , " konstantin grabelnikov , deputy head of russia 's novosibirsk chemical concentrate plant , which is preparing the fuel , said in a statement . russian officials said they had not set a date for delivery , but added that the fuel would be sent six months before the iranian plant being built at bushehr began operation , which is not expected before 2008 . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also predicted the opening of more than 300 new markets a year . tengelmann head karl-erivan haub said the two companies complemented each other well . plus and netto currently have a total of more than 4,100 outlets .
under the plans , just over two-thirds of the plus stores would become netto shops , but some 800 would retain their old name .
a family-owned company , tengelmann is germany 's sixth largest grocer and generates annual sales of nearly 25 billion euros from units in 15 countries including the obi chain of home-improvement stores . edeka is germany 's largest food retailer , with sales of 30.7 billion euros in 2006 , according to the lebensmittelzeitung trade magazine .

the chinese finance ministry cancelled a scheduled meeting with german finance minister peer steinbrück in beijing . despite having the meeting with china 's finance minister arranged for some time as part of his trip to the far east from dec .
1-8 , steinbrück was told that , due to the " very busy schedule of the new chinese finance minister , " xie xuren would have no time to see him .
the german foreign ministry said steinbrück 's trip to china would be rescheduled for the second quarter of next year and that the far east trip , during which he was also scheduled to visit tokyo and seoul , had been cancelled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück has canceled his entire far east trip it is the latest in a series of high-level meetings with german officials that the chinese have delayed or cancelled since chancellor angela merkel held a private meeting with the dalai lama on sept .

china vigorously protested the tibetan leader 's visit beforehand and reacted sharply afterwards by cutting contact with german officials .
dalia lama visit leads to cooling of relations beijing had previously pulled out of a planned meeting in october of world powers on the iranian nuclear crisis in berlin , forcing its cancellation .
china also axed an annual event scheduled for december in beijing to discuss human rights and called off a germany-china symposium scheduled for late september in munich , citing " technical reasons . "
a chinese foreign ministry spokesman last week said germany bore the responsibility to rectify " the negative impact of its erroneous act . "
china views the dalai lama as a dangerous separatist agitating for independence for tibet and has made clear its disapproval of any world leader holding an audience with him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " dangerous separatist " was welcomed in washington last month , the dalai lama met with us president george w. bush in washington , where the us congress gave him the congressional gold medal - its highest civilian award .
china issued similar threats of damaged ties with australia after prime minister john howard met with the dalai lama in june .
but chinese president hu jintao then travelled to australia , a visit that saw the two nations sign lucrative trade deals .
however , china 's ties with germany appear to have suffered the most .
in addition to the visit of the dalai lama , germany and china have been at odds over allegations of cyber espionage by hackers allegedly in the employ of the people 's republic .

after years peddling anglicisms , german advertisers have rediscovered their own language .
if the advertising industry is a barometer of the zeitgeist , what does this say about the state of the nation ? from vodafone 's " make the most of now " to siemens ' " be inspired , " the lingua franca of cutting-edge advertising has long been english , and germany is no exception .
but for a variety of reasons , companies across the board have recently been switching back to german , reflecting both a burgeoning cultural self-confidence and a growing desire to slam the brakes on the rapid spread of " denglish , " as anglicized german has been dubbed . examples include retailer c & a , which replaced " fashion for living " with " preise gut , alles gut " -lrb- the price is right , everything is right -rrb- and mcdonalds , whose advertising campaign morphed from " every time a good time " into " ich liebe es " -lrb- i 'm lovin ' it -rrb- . one reason for this shift is purely practical .
while even native speakers struggle with the double negatives of adidas ' promise that " impossible is nothing , " a study commissioned last year by advertising agency endmark revealed that germans respond to most english-language claims with sheer bewilderment . faced with a dozen anglicisms , only one-third of those questioned in the survey actually knew what the slogans meant .
few grasped the point of " come in and find out , " the ubiquitous promotion for the douglas cosmetics chain .
most consumers , it emerged , thought they were being invited to enter a store and then find the nearest exit . jaguar 's " life by gorgeous " campaign left participants equally bemused , with many laboring under the impression the advertisement was showcasing good times in georgia .
private tv station sat1 's slogan " powered by emotion " must have seemed extremely out of place as most people translated it into german as " kraft durch freude " or " strength through joy " - a favorite motto of hitler 's . perhaps not suprisingly , the offending claims have since been replaced by german ones . sowing the deliberate seeds of confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new sat1 logo according to a recent study carried out by slogans.de , an internet portal for research into advertising , the trend this year has consequently been to more german slogans and fewer anglicisms , with the share of english-language claims slipping down to 18.7 percent compared to 30 percent six years ago . inga wermuth , founder of slogans.de and owner of the hamburg-based advertising agency satelliten media design , said in the past , using english was an easy way to sex up a product - and that an element of linguistic confusion was all part of the strategy . " some brands consciously play with this lack of understanding , " she said .
" the exoticism of a foreign language makes a product seem complex and innovative . " ad man sebastian turner from the scholz & friends agency , one of the top creative addresses in germany , agreed that obfuscation is key . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one douglas ad campaign left consumers wondering where the exits were " when the point is to convey a certain feeling , then precision , function and clarity become secondary , " he said .
" agencies will then simply use words that best convey this emotion . " positioning germany on the world stage is another factor , turner said . " tourists do n't necessarily understand german , whereas english is more international , " he said .
" an english word can provide a better projection surface . " but according to walter krämer , chairman of the german language association , using english as a way to boost an image - turning a corner snack bar into a " city-grill , " for example - is typical of the contemporary habit of watering down the german language . this is symptomatic of germany 's cultural insecurity , he argues , and also a snub to other cultures . " the german fondness for all things american is also an aversion to other nations and cultures , " the association 's web site says . a shift in values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavier naidoo became a music star singing in german now , however , german appears to be making a come-back - and the sea-change could well mean nothing less than a new sense of national pride . " companies have realized that people do n't understand their claims , " krämer said .
" they also realize that english no longer represents higher standards , but , thanks to george bush , lower standards - just as polls in germany show that americans are increasingly less popular . " wermuth also said she feels that the fact german ads are less inclined to use english is a response to globalization . " this return to the german language is rooted in the fear that , in the long run , it may be taken over by foreign influences , " she said .
" in recent years , our identity has become ever less rooted in traditional , regional and family values .
consequently , there is a growing desire to explore our identity .
these days , the german language appeals more to our emotions because it speaks to our roots . " she pointed out that german-language pop music has seen a similar development . " in the past , german artists did n't stand a chance if they sang in german , " she said .
" but in the late 1990s , performers such as rosenstolz , die fantastischen vier , juli and xavier naidoo began conveying different values with their lyrics and stormed the charts .
similarly , advertising slogans in german come across as more honest , and people feel better able to assess their message . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to the creator of the winning blog , 23-year-old minsk-based journalist xenia awimova . dw-world.de : what inspired you to start a blog ? xenia awimova : blogging is really popular in belarus at the moment .
i know a lot of people who have blogs on sites like livejournal.com , and at some point i became interested in the idea of starting one of my own .
it was a long time before i actually showed anyone my entries , but after a while i felt i 'd like other people to see my photographs so they could comment on them . what role does the blog play in your life ? it is quite simply a platform for me to show my amateur photographs .
it 's a kind of hobby which motivates me to keep taking photos and i can see it staying that way in the future .
i want to improve my photography skills and hope to find a critic among my readers who can tell me what they do n't like about my pictures and suggest ways for improvement .
that would be great . so far i have received very little by way of critical feedback .
i do n't know why .
i 'm really interested in people 's reactions to my work , because it represents my view of the world , and i think it 's interesting to know how others react to what i see . is your blog related to your profession ? it has more to do with what i would like to become , namely a photojournalist .
the blog enables me to practice that .
i am a journalist by profession , but i want to change my specialization .
one could say that my blog is connected to my professional ambition . the entries in your blog are accompanied by numerous commentaries .
why is that ? my blog is part of a relatively small social network which treats its members in a friendly way .
unlike some blogs , there are no rude entries in mine .
people who read my blog seem to be genuinely interested in what i am doing , and even in me as a person . do you read other blogs ?
do you have favorite bloggers ? yes , i subscribe to other blogs .
i like the stories by the blogger " sem ' korov " -lrb- " seven cows " -rrb- , which also appear on livejournal .
and i like the photos by " 365 dnej v godu " -lrb- " 365 days in the year " -rrb- .
his concept is similar to mine : every day he puts up a photograph he has taken that day . what is special about the blog scene in belarus ? there are n't very many independent newspapers or other platforms which allow people to express their opinions in belarus .
many bloggers , particularly those over the age of 20 , write about political subjects .
even opposition politicians keep blogs on livejournal.com in order to get their point across and attract potential supporters . interview : olga sosnytska -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's the third parliamentary vote since the province , which formally belongs to serbia , came under united nations control in 1999 . the election campaign in kosovo has been dominated by the subject of province 's future status .

the serbian government has recommended they boycott the vote , saying that taking part would be tantamount to recognizing the province 's independence , which belgrade opposes . ex-rebel tipped to be next prime minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic issues were secondary in the election campaign former kosovo liberation army leader , hashim thaci is tipped to become the next prime minister .

current prime minister agim ceku is not running for re-election . the latest polls give his democratic party of kosovo -lrb- pdk -rrb- a narrow lead over the democratic league of kosovo -lrb- ldk -rrb- , the party formerly led by ibrahim rugova , seen by many as the " father of the nation . "
he died in 2006 just before talks on kosovo 's future were set to begin .
analysts said they believe the vote will lead to a coalition between the two parties . with the protracted talks on kosovo 's future status having made little apparent progress , ethnic albanian politicians are threatening to declare independence unilaterally .
polls have shown well over 90 percent of the kosovar albanian population is in favor of taking this step . russia has remained serbia 's ally in the dispute by blocking a proposal for kosovo 's independence in the united nations security council , where moscow holds veto powers .
but kosovo 's 2 million albanians are counting on the united states and europe to recognize kosovo as an independent state , should it declare independence . whatever the outcome of the election , the un 's three kosovo mediators are scheduled to hold more talks in brussels on the province on tuesday . economic problems played second fiddle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of mitrovicahas been home to past violence between ethnic albanians and ethnic serbs in kosovo , domestic problems , such as the 60 percent unemployment rate , the lack of direct investment and high levels of corruption , were tied to the issue of independence in the campaign .
politicians argued that the problems could be better tackled once the province had formally split from serbia . but political observer dusan reljic , from the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs , told reuters that ethnic albanians - despite their support for independence - have little faith in their government at least when it comes to fighting corruption . surveys show only 14 percent of the population said they were happy with their political leadership and 70 percent said they were discontented . the population of kosovo is estimated at around 1.9 to 2.2 million .
some 4 percent are ethnic serbs .
ten of the 120 seats in the kosovar parliament are reserved for the serb minority . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chinese finance ministry cancelled a scheduled meeting with german finance minister peer steinbrück in beijing . despite having the meeting with china 's finance minister arranged for some time as part of his trip to the far east from dec .
1-8 , steinbrück was told that , due to the " very busy schedule of the new chinese finance minister , " xie xuren would have no time to see him .
the german foreign ministry said steinbrück 's trip to china would be rescheduled for the second quarter of next year and that the far east trip , during which he was also scheduled to visit tokyo and seoul , had been cancelled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück has canceled his entire far east trip it is the latest in a series of high-level meetings with german officials that the chinese have delayed or cancelled since chancellor angela merkel held a private meeting with the dalai lama on sept .
29 .
china vigorously protested the tibetan leader 's visit beforehand and reacted sharply afterwards by cutting contact with german officials .
dalia lama visit leads to cooling of relations beijing had previously pulled out of a planned meeting in october of world powers on the iranian nuclear crisis in berlin , forcing its cancellation .
china also axed an annual event scheduled for december in beijing to discuss human rights and called off a germany-china symposium scheduled for late september in munich , citing " technical reasons . "
a chinese foreign ministry spokesman last week said germany bore the responsibility to rectify " the negative impact of its erroneous act . "
china views the dalai lama as a dangerous separatist agitating for independence for tibet and has made clear its disapproval of any world leader holding an audience with him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " dangerous separatist " was welcomed in washington last month , the dalai lama met with us president george w. bush in washington , where the us congress gave him the congressional gold medal - its highest civilian award .
china issued similar threats of damaged ties with australia after prime minister john howard met with the dalai lama in june .
but chinese president hu jintao then travelled to australia , a visit that saw the two nations sign lucrative trade deals .
however , china 's ties with germany appear to have suffered the most .
in addition to the visit of the dalai lama , germany and china have been at odds over allegations of cyber espionage by hackers allegedly in the employ of the people 's republic .

the deal also presents a challenge to aldi and lidl , germany 's market leaders in the fiercely contested , low-margin discount supermarket business . edeka is already germany 's biggest food retailer and the plan to combine plus with its chain of netto supermarkets depends on regulatory approval .
a decision on the deal is expected within six months . tengelmann is letting go of control over plus after the chain 's sales growth dropped by four-fifths in the latest fiscal year . bigger means more buying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tengelmann boss karl-eriwan haub , right , and alfons frenk , of edeka , are pleased with the deal together , plus and netto would have annual sales of about 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- , enabling them to secure better terms when buying goods .
tengelmann and hamburg-based edeka also agreed to cooperate on purchasing for their other retain chains . " it is important to have big joint purchasing power to get products cheaper from suppliers , " martina noss , an analyst at norddeutsche landesbank in hanover told bloomburg news .
" plus has lost much money by introducing a large non-food assortment , but it is possible to make money with a discount chain .
it is not an accident that the aldi brothers are the richest germans . " edeka chief executive officer alfons frenk declined to say how much the group had paid for its stake at the press conference on friday , nov .
16 .
but he said the deal would put the company in a much stronger position . " together , our market presence is a lot stronger , " said frenk . " we can really raise the pressure . " jobs do not appear to be at threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edeka plans to give aldi and lidl a run for their money in the discount sector frenk said the viability of each individual store would be investigated , but that the takeover was expected to create jobs .
he also predicted the opening of more than 300 new markets a year . tengelmann head karl-erivan haub said the two companies complemented each other well . plus and netto currently have a total of more than 4,100 outlets .
under the plans , just over two-thirds of the plus stores would become netto shops , but some 800 would retain their old name .
a family-owned company , tengelmann is germany 's sixth largest grocer and generates annual sales of nearly 25 billion euros from units in 15 countries including the obi chain of home-improvement stores . edeka is germany 's largest food retailer , with sales of 30.7 billion euros in 2006 , according to the lebensmittelzeitung trade magazine .

i know a lot of people who have blogs on sites like livejournal.com , and at some point i became interested in the idea of starting one of my own .
it was a long time before i actually showed anyone my entries , but after a while i felt i 'd like other people to see my photographs so they could comment on them . what role does the blog play in your life ? it is quite simply a platform for me to show my amateur photographs .
it 's a kind of hobby which motivates me to keep taking photos and i can see it staying that way in the future .
i want to improve my photography skills and hope to find a critic among my readers who can tell me what they do n't like about my pictures and suggest ways for improvement .
that would be great . so far i have received very little by way of critical feedback .
i do n't know why .
i 'm really interested in people 's reactions to my work , because it represents my view of the world , and i think it 's interesting to know how others react to what i see . is your blog related to your profession ? it has more to do with what i would like to become , namely a photojournalist .

the deal also presents a challenge to aldi and lidl , germany 's market leaders in the fiercely contested , low-margin discount supermarket business . edeka is already germany 's biggest food retailer and the plan to combine plus with its chain of netto supermarkets depends on regulatory approval .
a decision on the deal is expected within six months . tengelmann is letting go of control over plus after the chain 's sales growth dropped by four-fifths in the latest fiscal year . bigger means more buying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tengelmann boss karl-eriwan haub , right , and alfons frenk , of edeka , are pleased with the deal together , plus and netto would have annual sales of about 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- , enabling them to secure better terms when buying goods .
tengelmann and hamburg-based edeka also agreed to cooperate on purchasing for their other retain chains . " it is important to have big joint purchasing power to get products cheaper from suppliers , " martina noss , an analyst at norddeutsche landesbank in hanover told bloomburg news .
" plus has lost much money by introducing a large non-food assortment , but it is possible to make money with a discount chain .
it is not an accident that the aldi brothers are the richest germans . " edeka chief executive officer alfons frenk declined to say how much the group had paid for its stake at the press conference on friday , nov .
16 .
but he said the deal would put the company in a much stronger position . " together , our market presence is a lot stronger , " said frenk . " we can really raise the pressure . " jobs do not appear to be at threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edeka plans to give aldi and lidl a run for their money in the discount sector frenk said the viability of each individual store would be investigated , but that the takeover was expected to create jobs .
he also predicted the opening of more than 300 new markets a year . tengelmann head karl-erivan haub said the two companies complemented each other well . plus and netto currently have a total of more than 4,100 outlets .
under the plans , just over two-thirds of the plus stores would become netto shops , but some 800 would retain their old name .
a family-owned company , tengelmann is germany 's sixth largest grocer and generates annual sales of nearly 25 billion euros from units in 15 countries including the obi chain of home-improvement stores . edeka is germany 's largest food retailer , with sales of 30.7 billion euros in 2006 , according to the lebensmittelzeitung trade magazine .

the group , which was founded in the provincial town of twer this week , claims to have collected 30 million signatures in support of president vladimir putin serving a third term , although the constitution prohibits it . " we see an opportunity for vladimir putin to stay on as head of state , " said pawel astachow , one of the movement 's 600 founding members . and his group is not alone . ever since putin put himself forward as the leading candidate of the united russia party for december 's parliamentary elections , the country has seen the emergence of dozens of groups supporting his bid to remain in power . although under the russian constitution putin can not run for a third term as president , there is nothing to stop him standing for the office of prime minister . putin 's " moral right " to rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenty of russians are " for putin , " just as this massive poster reads falk bomsdorf , head of the moscow office of germany 's liberal friedrich naumann foundation , said the actual election campaigns have been completely overshadowed by the pro-putin demonstrations . " we can no longer talk in terms of a parliamentary election , " he said . " there are no parties putting forward their agendas , no political debates and no alternatives .

" in my opinion , that is illegal . " on friday , europe 's main elections watchdog , the osce , announced it was calling off its observer mission for the december ballot , on the grounds that moscow has been uncooperative . in a statement , the organization for security and cooperation in europe said that the russian authorities remained unwilling to receive observers in a timely and cooperative manner and cooperate fully with them . the russian foreign ministry said the osce had " invented references to alleged difficulties in obtaining russian visas " in order to cancel its mission .

after years peddling anglicisms , german advertisers have rediscovered their own language .
if the advertising industry is a barometer of the zeitgeist , what does this say about the state of the nation ? from vodafone 's " make the most of now " to siemens ' " be inspired , " the lingua franca of cutting-edge advertising has long been english , and germany is no exception .
but for a variety of reasons , companies across the board have recently been switching back to german , reflecting both a burgeoning cultural self-confidence and a growing desire to slam the brakes on the rapid spread of " denglish , " as anglicized german has been dubbed . examples include retailer c & a , which replaced " fashion for living " with " preise gut , alles gut " -lrb- the price is right , everything is right -rrb- and mcdonalds , whose advertising campaign morphed from " every time a good time " into " ich liebe es " -lrb- i 'm lovin ' it -rrb- . one reason for this shift is purely practical .
while even native speakers struggle with the double negatives of adidas ' promise that " impossible is nothing , " a study commissioned last year by advertising agency endmark revealed that germans respond to most english-language claims with sheer bewilderment . faced with a dozen anglicisms , only one-third of those questioned in the survey actually knew what the slogans meant .
few grasped the point of " come in and find out , " the ubiquitous promotion for the douglas cosmetics chain .
most consumers , it emerged , thought they were being invited to enter a store and then find the nearest exit . jaguar 's " life by gorgeous " campaign left participants equally bemused , with many laboring under the impression the advertisement was showcasing good times in georgia .
private tv station sat1 's slogan " powered by emotion " must have seemed extremely out of place as most people translated it into german as " kraft durch freude " or " strength through joy " - a favorite motto of hitler 's . perhaps not suprisingly , the offending claims have since been replaced by german ones . sowing the deliberate seeds of confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new sat1 logo according to a recent study carried out by slogans.de , an internet portal for research into advertising , the trend this year has consequently been to more german slogans and fewer anglicisms , with the share of english-language claims slipping down to 18.7 percent compared to 30 percent six years ago . inga wermuth , founder of slogans.de and owner of the hamburg-based advertising agency satelliten media design , said in the past , using english was an easy way to sex up a product - and that an element of linguistic confusion was all part of the strategy . " some brands consciously play with this lack of understanding , " she said .
" the exoticism of a foreign language makes a product seem complex and innovative . " ad man sebastian turner from the scholz & friends agency , one of the top creative addresses in germany , agreed that obfuscation is key . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one douglas ad campaign left consumers wondering where the exits were " when the point is to convey a certain feeling , then precision , function and clarity become secondary , " he said .
" agencies will then simply use words that best convey this emotion . " positioning germany on the world stage is another factor , turner said . " tourists do n't necessarily understand german , whereas english is more international , " he said .
" an english word can provide a better projection surface . " but according to walter krämer , chairman of the german language association , using english as a way to boost an image - turning a corner snack bar into a " city-grill , " for example - is typical of the contemporary habit of watering down the german language . this is symptomatic of germany 's cultural insecurity , he argues , and also a snub to other cultures . " the german fondness for all things american is also an aversion to other nations and cultures , " the association 's web site says . a shift in values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavier naidoo became a music star singing in german now , however , german appears to be making a come-back - and the sea-change could well mean nothing less than a new sense of national pride . " companies have realized that people do n't understand their claims , " krämer said .
" they also realize that english no longer represents higher standards , but , thanks to george bush , lower standards - just as polls in germany show that americans are increasingly less popular . " wermuth also said she feels that the fact german ads are less inclined to use english is a response to globalization . " this return to the german language is rooted in the fear that , in the long run , it may be taken over by foreign influences , " she said .
" in recent years , our identity has become ever less rooted in traditional , regional and family values .
consequently , there is a growing desire to explore our identity .
these days , the german language appeals more to our emotions because it speaks to our roots . " she pointed out that german-language pop music has seen a similar development . " in the past , german artists did n't stand a chance if they sang in german , " she said .
" but in the late 1990s , performers such as rosenstolz , die fantastischen vier , juli and xavier naidoo began conveying different values with their lyrics and stormed the charts .
similarly , advertising slogans in german come across as more honest , and people feel better able to assess their message . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after years peddling anglicisms , german advertisers have rediscovered their own language .
if the advertising industry is a barometer of the zeitgeist , what does this say about the state of the nation ? from vodafone 's " make the most of now " to siemens ' " be inspired , " the lingua franca of cutting-edge advertising has long been english , and germany is no exception .
but for a variety of reasons , companies across the board have recently been switching back to german , reflecting both a burgeoning cultural self-confidence and a growing desire to slam the brakes on the rapid spread of " denglish , " as anglicized german has been dubbed . examples include retailer c & a , which replaced " fashion for living " with " preise gut , alles gut " -lrb- the price is right , everything is right -rrb- and mcdonalds , whose advertising campaign morphed from " every time a good time " into " ich liebe es " -lrb- i 'm lovin ' it -rrb- . one reason for this shift is purely practical .
while even native speakers struggle with the double negatives of adidas ' promise that " impossible is nothing , " a study commissioned last year by advertising agency endmark revealed that germans respond to most english-language claims with sheer bewilderment . faced with a dozen anglicisms , only one-third of those questioned in the survey actually knew what the slogans meant .
few grasped the point of " come in and find out , " the ubiquitous promotion for the douglas cosmetics chain .
most consumers , it emerged , thought they were being invited to enter a store and then find the nearest exit . jaguar 's " life by gorgeous " campaign left participants equally bemused , with many laboring under the impression the advertisement was showcasing good times in georgia .
private tv station sat1 's slogan " powered by emotion " must have seemed extremely out of place as most people translated it into german as " kraft durch freude " or " strength through joy " - a favorite motto of hitler 's . perhaps not suprisingly , the offending claims have since been replaced by german ones . sowing the deliberate seeds of confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new sat1 logo according to a recent study carried out by slogans.de , an internet portal for research into advertising , the trend this year has consequently been to more german slogans and fewer anglicisms , with the share of english-language claims slipping down to 18.7 percent compared to 30 percent six years ago . inga wermuth , founder of slogans.de and owner of the hamburg-based advertising agency satelliten media design , said in the past , using english was an easy way to sex up a product - and that an element of linguistic confusion was all part of the strategy . " some brands consciously play with this lack of understanding , " she said .
" the exoticism of a foreign language makes a product seem complex and innovative . " ad man sebastian turner from the scholz & friends agency , one of the top creative addresses in germany , agreed that obfuscation is key . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one douglas ad campaign left consumers wondering where the exits were " when the point is to convey a certain feeling , then precision , function and clarity become secondary , " he said .
" agencies will then simply use words that best convey this emotion . " positioning germany on the world stage is another factor , turner said . " tourists do n't necessarily understand german , whereas english is more international , " he said .
" an english word can provide a better projection surface . " but according to walter krämer , chairman of the german language association , using english as a way to boost an image - turning a corner snack bar into a " city-grill , " for example - is typical of the contemporary habit of watering down the german language . this is symptomatic of germany 's cultural insecurity , he argues , and also a snub to other cultures . " the german fondness for all things american is also an aversion to other nations and cultures , " the association 's web site says . a shift in values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavier naidoo became a music star singing in german now , however , german appears to be making a come-back - and the sea-change could well mean nothing less than a new sense of national pride . " companies have realized that people do n't understand their claims , " krämer said .
" they also realize that english no longer represents higher standards , but , thanks to george bush , lower standards - just as polls in germany show that americans are increasingly less popular . " wermuth also said she feels that the fact german ads are less inclined to use english is a response to globalization . " this return to the german language is rooted in the fear that , in the long run , it may be taken over by foreign influences , " she said .
" in recent years , our identity has become ever less rooted in traditional , regional and family values .
consequently , there is a growing desire to explore our identity .
these days , the german language appeals more to our emotions because it speaks to our roots . " she pointed out that german-language pop music has seen a similar development . " in the past , german artists did n't stand a chance if they sang in german , " she said .
" but in the late 1990s , performers such as rosenstolz , die fantastischen vier , juli and xavier naidoo began conveying different values with their lyrics and stormed the charts .
similarly , advertising slogans in german come across as more honest , and people feel better able to assess their message . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , in kosovo 's parliamentary elections .
it 's the third parliamentary vote since the province , which formally belongs to serbia , came under united nations control in 1999 . the election campaign in kosovo has been dominated by the subject of province 's future status .
with a trio of diplomatic envoys from the european union , the united states and russia facing a dec .
10 deadline to come up with a plan for the province , the kosovar albanian parties have become increasingly vocal in their calls for independence . members of kosovo 's ethnic serb minority , estimated to total about 120,000 , are not expected to cast their ballots at the weekend .
the serbian government has recommended they boycott the vote , saying that taking part would be tantamount to recognizing the province 's independence , which belgrade opposes . ex-rebel tipped to be next prime minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic issues were secondary in the election campaign former kosovo liberation army leader , hashim thaci is tipped to become the next prime minister .
serbia accuses him of being a terrorist because of his rebel activities .
current prime minister agim ceku is not running for re-election . the latest polls give his democratic party of kosovo -lrb- pdk -rrb- a narrow lead over the democratic league of kosovo -lrb- ldk -rrb- , the party formerly led by ibrahim rugova , seen by many as the " father of the nation . "
he died in 2006 just before talks on kosovo 's future were set to begin .
analysts said they believe the vote will lead to a coalition between the two parties . with the protracted talks on kosovo 's future status having made little apparent progress , ethnic albanian politicians are threatening to declare independence unilaterally .
polls have shown well over 90 percent of the kosovar albanian population is in favor of taking this step . russia has remained serbia 's ally in the dispute by blocking a proposal for kosovo 's independence in the united nations security council , where moscow holds veto powers .
but kosovo 's 2 million albanians are counting on the united states and europe to recognize kosovo as an independent state , should it declare independence . whatever the outcome of the election , the un 's three kosovo mediators are scheduled to hold more talks in brussels on the province on tuesday . economic problems played second fiddle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of mitrovicahas been home to past violence between ethnic albanians and ethnic serbs in kosovo , domestic problems , such as the 60 percent unemployment rate , the lack of direct investment and high levels of corruption , were tied to the issue of independence in the campaign .
politicians argued that the problems could be better tackled once the province had formally split from serbia . but political observer dusan reljic , from the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs , told reuters that ethnic albanians - despite their support for independence - have little faith in their government at least when it comes to fighting corruption . surveys show only 14 percent of the population said they were happy with their political leadership and 70 percent said they were discontented . the population of kosovo is estimated at around 1.9 to 2.2 million .
some 4 percent are ethnic serbs .
ten of the 120 seats in the kosovar parliament are reserved for the serb minority . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

christmas is just around the corner , if that fact does n't send you a-caroling along , a new school in germany may help you dump some of your humbug with lessons in how to prepare for the holiday . before throwing ourselves into this year 's festive preparations , perhaps we should all settle down for a moment - with a cup of eggnog , if necessary - and reexamine the hellish memories of last year 's yuletide experience that we 've spent the last 10 months trying to erase . by the time christmas comes round again , most people will have forgotten some or all of the following : the turkey was burnt , your uncle was drunk before lunch , and your parents fought all afternoon over dad 's lack of washing up assistance . your mind also has , thankfully , suppressed the fact that grandma bought you the exact same gift as on your birthday and the cat chewed through the christmas lights , setting fire to the carpet and giving the living room a foul smell until long after new year 's . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animals can contribute to christmas chaos while christmas is a time for reflection , family , and the giving and receiving of gifts ; it is also the time of year where the chances of everything going pear-shaped rapidly increase . academy to teach lessons in christmas well , if you 're german and lucky enough to live in the considerate city of trier , you could be on the verge of waving goodbye to disastrous christmases . the city knows the chances of a christmas actually turning out merry increase exponentially if the circumstances are n't left to chance .
that 's why trier has set up a christmas academy where attendees can prepare for the festive season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mum 's wrapping really improved after her lessons children can practice their hymns and get those extended family piano sing-a-longs just right as mum burns her way through a whole flock of poultry on the way to the perfect christmas bird . tree trimming and fir maintenance courses will be available for dads , and parental planning tuition is encouraged for all those catering to a larger brood .

the group , which was founded in the provincial town of twer this week , claims to have collected 30 million signatures in support of president vladimir putin serving a third term , although the constitution prohibits it . " we see an opportunity for vladimir putin to stay on as head of state , " said pawel astachow , one of the movement 's 600 founding members . and his group is not alone . ever since putin put himself forward as the leading candidate of the united russia party for december 's parliamentary elections , the country has seen the emergence of dozens of groups supporting his bid to remain in power . although under the russian constitution putin can not run for a third term as president , there is nothing to stop him standing for the office of prime minister . putin 's " moral right " to rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenty of russians are " for putin , " just as this massive poster reads falk bomsdorf , head of the moscow office of germany 's liberal friedrich naumann foundation , said the actual election campaigns have been completely overshadowed by the pro-putin demonstrations . " we can no longer talk in terms of a parliamentary election , " he said . " there are no parties putting forward their agendas , no political debates and no alternatives . " thus far there has been no mention of a united russia party program , but that , say critics , is because putin is the program . as the president said earlier this week , a clear win on dec .

" if the people vote for united russia , it means a clear majority of the people put their trust in me , " putin said . he added that such a display of support would give him the moral right to hold those in the duma and the cabinet responsible for the implementation of the tasks that have already been set .
putin did not explain how he would maintain his grip on power , but said there were " various possibilities . " no european election observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce sent 400 observers to the last duma election the way the election is shaping out , it is set to become a referendum for the president , bomsdorf said . " the kremlin is doing everything it can to prevent proper elections , " he said .
" in my opinion , that is illegal . " on friday , europe 's main elections watchdog , the osce , announced it was calling off its observer mission for the december ballot , on the grounds that moscow has been uncooperative . in a statement , the organization for security and cooperation in europe said that the russian authorities remained unwilling to receive observers in a timely and cooperative manner and cooperate fully with them . the russian foreign ministry said the osce had " invented references to alleged difficulties in obtaining russian visas " in order to cancel its mission .
the european organization , which was originally invited on oct .
31 to send just 70 observers to watch the election - 330 less than for the russian duma election , applied for the visas on nov .
2 , according to german press reports . " it is abundantly clear that the russian election commission does not want any witnesses for their brilliant electoral preparations , " alexander konovalov , head of the institute for strategic studies told the russian nowyje iswestija newspaper . no real alternatives to untied russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin remains popular among large parts of the population moscow has shrugged off criticism that the upcoming vote is being stage-managed to ensure a landslide victory for the ruling united russia party , and meanwhile the well-oiled wheels of putin 's promotional apparatus continue to turn .
television advertisements talk about " russia 's economic well-being " and " putin 's plan , " and the president 's supporters march the streets in the name of promoting putin . thomas kunze , who until recently ran a branch of germany 's konrad-adenauer foundation in moscow , said the russian public genuinely thinks putin is doing a good job . " the middle class has experienced an improved standard of living under putin , and the economic moguls value the stability which putin has brought to russia , " he said . were he allowed to run for a third term as president , putin would currently be in line for between 60 percent and 70 percent of the vote .
with that in mind , the pro-putin campaigns seem unnecessary , but bomsdorf said their aim is not to advertise for putin but to inspire the apathetic russian public to the ballot box .

17 , in kosovo 's parliamentary elections .
it 's the third parliamentary vote since the province , which formally belongs to serbia , came under united nations control in 1999 . the election campaign in kosovo has been dominated by the subject of province 's future status .
with a trio of diplomatic envoys from the european union , the united states and russia facing a dec .
10 deadline to come up with a plan for the province , the kosovar albanian parties have become increasingly vocal in their calls for independence . members of kosovo 's ethnic serb minority , estimated to total about 120,000 , are not expected to cast their ballots at the weekend .
the serbian government has recommended they boycott the vote , saying that taking part would be tantamount to recognizing the province 's independence , which belgrade opposes . ex-rebel tipped to be next prime minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic issues were secondary in the election campaign former kosovo liberation army leader , hashim thaci is tipped to become the next prime minister .
serbia accuses him of being a terrorist because of his rebel activities .
current prime minister agim ceku is not running for re-election . the latest polls give his democratic party of kosovo -lrb- pdk -rrb- a narrow lead over the democratic league of kosovo -lrb- ldk -rrb- , the party formerly led by ibrahim rugova , seen by many as the " father of the nation . "
he died in 2006 just before talks on kosovo 's future were set to begin .
analysts said they believe the vote will lead to a coalition between the two parties . with the protracted talks on kosovo 's future status having made little apparent progress , ethnic albanian politicians are threatening to declare independence unilaterally .
polls have shown well over 90 percent of the kosovar albanian population is in favor of taking this step . russia has remained serbia 's ally in the dispute by blocking a proposal for kosovo 's independence in the united nations security council , where moscow holds veto powers .
but kosovo 's 2 million albanians are counting on the united states and europe to recognize kosovo as an independent state , should it declare independence . whatever the outcome of the election , the un 's three kosovo mediators are scheduled to hold more talks in brussels on the province on tuesday . economic problems played second fiddle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of mitrovicahas been home to past violence between ethnic albanians and ethnic serbs in kosovo , domestic problems , such as the 60 percent unemployment rate , the lack of direct investment and high levels of corruption , were tied to the issue of independence in the campaign .
politicians argued that the problems could be better tackled once the province had formally split from serbia . but political observer dusan reljic , from the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs , told reuters that ethnic albanians - despite their support for independence - have little faith in their government at least when it comes to fighting corruption . surveys show only 14 percent of the population said they were happy with their political leadership and 70 percent said they were discontented . the population of kosovo is estimated at around 1.9 to 2.2 million .
some 4 percent are ethnic serbs .
ten of the 120 seats in the kosovar parliament are reserved for the serb minority . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" so help me god , " said tusk , leader of poland 's election-winning liberal party , as he pledged to serve the country , using a formula which , although optional , is traditionally used in government ceremonies in deeply-catholic poland .
his 18 ministers were then sworn in one by one .
tusk said his ministers were " well prepared and decent , " adding " state power should serve the people , not dominate them . "
his government intended to focus on " health , wages and home security , " tusk added .
tusk 's civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- party beat the conservative law and justice party in a snap election on oct .
21 and ended the unprecedented political double act of deposed prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski his identical twin , the president , lech .
the po victory also ended the rule of kaczynski 's fractious three-party coalition which had struggled through two years of in-fighting , scandal and criticism .
tusk hopes for more success with his coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk will lead a moderate coalition government tusk takes over with a new coalition , forced on him due to the fact that civic platform missed its goal of obtaining a parliamentary majority , winning 209 of the total 460 seats .
he forms his government with members of the moderate polish peasants ' party , which won 31 seats in parliament , and has made its leader , waldemar pawlak , his deputy prime minister .
jaroslaw kaczynski , who formally stepped down as prime minister on nov .
5 , has become the leader of the opposition .
tusk has pledged to end the regular tussles with the rest of the european union , and with neighboring germany in particular , which marked law and justice 's rule .
he also promised to ease tensions in relations with russia , which have been at their lowest ebb since poland broke free from the communist bloc in 1989 .
rocky times ahead in relationship with us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk will bring polish troops home from iraq he has said he will withdraw polish troops from iraq , where 900 soldiers are serving in the us-led coalition ; and has warned he will drive a harder bargain in talks with washington on basing part of a us anti-missile system in poland .
on the domestic side , he has promised to slash bureaucracy , revive the stalled privatization process and reform the health service .
he also wants to spur the already robust economy to try to draw home some of the more than a million poles who have emigrated since the country joined the eu in 2004 .
in addition , he wants poland to enter the euro zone .
the conservatives had regularly expressed skepticism about switching from the national currency , the zloty , to the euro .

deutsche welle announces the winners of the “ international weblog awards – the bobs 2007 ” the “ photo-maniac ” blog from belarus is the winner of this year ’ s “ deutsche welle international weblog awards – the bobs . ”
the english-language blog “ jotman ” from thailand was the winner of this year ’ s prestigious reporters without borders award .
“ alive in baghdad ” won as the jury 's best videoblog and “ valour-it ” took home the best weblog english .
xenia awimova , a 23-year-old aspiring photojournalist who lives and works in the belarusian capital of minsk , runs " foto-griffoneurei " -lrb- literally " photo-maniac " -rrb- .
the jury said that her collection of photos thoroughly expresses her life and surroundings and thereby fulfils the main purpose of a blog .
" with few words , this excellent blog succeeds in portraying the daily life of people in belarus , " said christian gramsch , program director of dw-world.de and dw-radio .
“ she thereby supplies information from a country that , to a large extent , separates itself from outside views . ”
" in belarus there are not many independent newspapers or other platforms where people can express their opinions , " awimova said after being told of the award .
" that is why a lot of young people write blogs .
these are often about politics .
even oppositional politicians use blogs to present their opinion and as a way to get the attention of potential supporters . "
an anonymous blogger going by the name of jotman won the 2007 reporters without borders award – an inherent part of the bobs .
the blogger 's coverage of the 2006 coup in thailand and more recent reports from protests against the military junta in myanmar , also known as burma , made him stand out , jury members said .
two blogs with different perspectives of the war in iraq also won awards .
alive in baghdad , a videoblog about the daily lives of iraqis , received the jury 's prize in the best videoblog category , and valour-it , a blog that raises money to buy laptops for injured soldiers , won the best english weblog award . award ceremony in berlin the fourth annual best of the blogs 2007 came to an end on the evening of november 15 with an awards ceremony at the museum of communication in berlin .
thirty awards were given out , including users ' -choice awards .
accompanying the event the jury discussed tendencies , characteristics and excellent examples from the international blogosphere .
in her keynote speech on “ blogging in iran and the internet as an alternative medium of the women ’ s movement , ” iranian blogger and feminist farnaz seifi stressed that “ in a society where the government controls the entire media , the internet offers tool for repressed voices to express themselves . ”
the awards ceremony was hosted by the dutch actress and singer ellen ten damme and the “ spreebllick ” blogger johnny haeusler . internationally-established weblog awards more than 7,000 weblogs in 10 different languages were nominated for this year 's competition , 1,500 more than last year .

17 , in kosovo 's parliamentary elections .
it 's the third parliamentary vote since the province , which formally belongs to serbia , came under united nations control in 1999 . the election campaign in kosovo has been dominated by the subject of province 's future status .
with a trio of diplomatic envoys from the european union , the united states and russia facing a dec .
10 deadline to come up with a plan for the province , the kosovar albanian parties have become increasingly vocal in their calls for independence . members of kosovo 's ethnic serb minority , estimated to total about 120,000 , are not expected to cast their ballots at the weekend .
the serbian government has recommended they boycott the vote , saying that taking part would be tantamount to recognizing the province 's independence , which belgrade opposes . ex-rebel tipped to be next prime minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic issues were secondary in the election campaign former kosovo liberation army leader , hashim thaci is tipped to become the next prime minister .
serbia accuses him of being a terrorist because of his rebel activities .
current prime minister agim ceku is not running for re-election . the latest polls give his democratic party of kosovo -lrb- pdk -rrb- a narrow lead over the democratic league of kosovo -lrb- ldk -rrb- , the party formerly led by ibrahim rugova , seen by many as the " father of the nation . "
he died in 2006 just before talks on kosovo 's future were set to begin .
analysts said they believe the vote will lead to a coalition between the two parties . with the protracted talks on kosovo 's future status having made little apparent progress , ethnic albanian politicians are threatening to declare independence unilaterally .
polls have shown well over 90 percent of the kosovar albanian population is in favor of taking this step . russia has remained serbia 's ally in the dispute by blocking a proposal for kosovo 's independence in the united nations security council , where moscow holds veto powers .
but kosovo 's 2 million albanians are counting on the united states and europe to recognize kosovo as an independent state , should it declare independence . whatever the outcome of the election , the un 's three kosovo mediators are scheduled to hold more talks in brussels on the province on tuesday . economic problems played second fiddle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of mitrovicahas been home to past violence between ethnic albanians and ethnic serbs in kosovo , domestic problems , such as the 60 percent unemployment rate , the lack of direct investment and high levels of corruption , were tied to the issue of independence in the campaign .
politicians argued that the problems could be better tackled once the province had formally split from serbia . but political observer dusan reljic , from the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs , told reuters that ethnic albanians - despite their support for independence - have little faith in their government at least when it comes to fighting corruption . surveys show only 14 percent of the population said they were happy with their political leadership and 70 percent said they were discontented . the population of kosovo is estimated at around 1.9 to 2.2 million .
some 4 percent are ethnic serbs .
ten of the 120 seats in the kosovar parliament are reserved for the serb minority . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle announces the winners of the “ international weblog awards – the bobs 2007 ” the “ photo-maniac ” blog from belarus is the winner of this year ’ s “ deutsche welle international weblog awards – the bobs . ”
the english-language blog “ jotman ” from thailand was the winner of this year ’ s prestigious reporters without borders award .
“ alive in baghdad ” won as the jury 's best videoblog and “ valour-it ” took home the best weblog english .
xenia awimova , a 23-year-old aspiring photojournalist who lives and works in the belarusian capital of minsk , runs " foto-griffoneurei " -lrb- literally " photo-maniac " -rrb- .
the jury said that her collection of photos thoroughly expresses her life and surroundings and thereby fulfils the main purpose of a blog .
" with few words , this excellent blog succeeds in portraying the daily life of people in belarus , " said christian gramsch , program director of dw-world.de and dw-radio .
“ she thereby supplies information from a country that , to a large extent , separates itself from outside views . ”
" in belarus there are not many independent newspapers or other platforms where people can express their opinions , " awimova said after being told of the award .
" that is why a lot of young people write blogs .
these are often about politics .
even oppositional politicians use blogs to present their opinion and as a way to get the attention of potential supporters . "
an anonymous blogger going by the name of jotman won the 2007 reporters without borders award – an inherent part of the bobs .
the blogger 's coverage of the 2006 coup in thailand and more recent reports from protests against the military junta in myanmar , also known as burma , made him stand out , jury members said .
two blogs with different perspectives of the war in iraq also won awards .
alive in baghdad , a videoblog about the daily lives of iraqis , received the jury 's prize in the best videoblog category , and valour-it , a blog that raises money to buy laptops for injured soldiers , won the best english weblog award . award ceremony in berlin the fourth annual best of the blogs 2007 came to an end on the evening of november 15 with an awards ceremony at the museum of communication in berlin .
thirty awards were given out , including users ' -choice awards .

after years peddling anglicisms , german advertisers have rediscovered their own language .
if the advertising industry is a barometer of the zeitgeist , what does this say about the state of the nation ? from vodafone 's " make the most of now " to siemens ' " be inspired , " the lingua franca of cutting-edge advertising has long been english , and germany is no exception .
but for a variety of reasons , companies across the board have recently been switching back to german , reflecting both a burgeoning cultural self-confidence and a growing desire to slam the brakes on the rapid spread of " denglish , " as anglicized german has been dubbed . examples include retailer c & a , which replaced " fashion for living " with " preise gut , alles gut " -lrb- the price is right , everything is right -rrb- and mcdonalds , whose advertising campaign morphed from " every time a good time " into " ich liebe es " -lrb- i 'm lovin ' it -rrb- . one reason for this shift is purely practical .
while even native speakers struggle with the double negatives of adidas ' promise that " impossible is nothing , " a study commissioned last year by advertising agency endmark revealed that germans respond to most english-language claims with sheer bewilderment . faced with a dozen anglicisms , only one-third of those questioned in the survey actually knew what the slogans meant .
few grasped the point of " come in and find out , " the ubiquitous promotion for the douglas cosmetics chain .
most consumers , it emerged , thought they were being invited to enter a store and then find the nearest exit . jaguar 's " life by gorgeous " campaign left participants equally bemused , with many laboring under the impression the advertisement was showcasing good times in georgia .
private tv station sat1 's slogan " powered by emotion " must have seemed extremely out of place as most people translated it into german as " kraft durch freude " or " strength through joy " - a favorite motto of hitler 's . perhaps not suprisingly , the offending claims have since been replaced by german ones . sowing the deliberate seeds of confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new sat1 logo according to a recent study carried out by slogans.de , an internet portal for research into advertising , the trend this year has consequently been to more german slogans and fewer anglicisms , with the share of english-language claims slipping down to 18.7 percent compared to 30 percent six years ago . inga wermuth , founder of slogans.de and owner of the hamburg-based advertising agency satelliten media design , said in the past , using english was an easy way to sex up a product - and that an element of linguistic confusion was all part of the strategy . " some brands consciously play with this lack of understanding , " she said .
" the exoticism of a foreign language makes a product seem complex and innovative . " ad man sebastian turner from the scholz & friends agency , one of the top creative addresses in germany , agreed that obfuscation is key . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one douglas ad campaign left consumers wondering where the exits were " when the point is to convey a certain feeling , then precision , function and clarity become secondary , " he said .
" agencies will then simply use words that best convey this emotion . " positioning germany on the world stage is another factor , turner said . " tourists do n't necessarily understand german , whereas english is more international , " he said .
" an english word can provide a better projection surface . " but according to walter krämer , chairman of the german language association , using english as a way to boost an image - turning a corner snack bar into a " city-grill , " for example - is typical of the contemporary habit of watering down the german language . this is symptomatic of germany 's cultural insecurity , he argues , and also a snub to other cultures . " the german fondness for all things american is also an aversion to other nations and cultures , " the association 's web site says . a shift in values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavier naidoo became a music star singing in german now , however , german appears to be making a come-back - and the sea-change could well mean nothing less than a new sense of national pride . " companies have realized that people do n't understand their claims , " krämer said .
" they also realize that english no longer represents higher standards , but , thanks to george bush , lower standards - just as polls in germany show that americans are increasingly less popular . " wermuth also said she feels that the fact german ads are less inclined to use english is a response to globalization . " this return to the german language is rooted in the fear that , in the long run , it may be taken over by foreign influences , " she said .
" in recent years , our identity has become ever less rooted in traditional , regional and family values .
consequently , there is a growing desire to explore our identity .
these days , the german language appeals more to our emotions because it speaks to our roots . " she pointed out that german-language pop music has seen a similar development . " in the past , german artists did n't stand a chance if they sang in german , " she said .
" but in the late 1990s , performers such as rosenstolz , die fantastischen vier , juli and xavier naidoo began conveying different values with their lyrics and stormed the charts .
similarly , advertising slogans in german come across as more honest , and people feel better able to assess their message . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , in kosovo 's parliamentary elections .
it 's the third parliamentary vote since the province , which formally belongs to serbia , came under united nations control in 1999 . the election campaign in kosovo has been dominated by the subject of province 's future status .
with a trio of diplomatic envoys from the european union , the united states and russia facing a dec .
10 deadline to come up with a plan for the province , the kosovar albanian parties have become increasingly vocal in their calls for independence . members of kosovo 's ethnic serb minority , estimated to total about 120,000 , are not expected to cast their ballots at the weekend .
the serbian government has recommended they boycott the vote , saying that taking part would be tantamount to recognizing the province 's independence , which belgrade opposes . ex-rebel tipped to be next prime minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic issues were secondary in the election campaign former kosovo liberation army leader , hashim thaci is tipped to become the next prime minister .
serbia accuses him of being a terrorist because of his rebel activities .
current prime minister agim ceku is not running for re-election . the latest polls give his democratic party of kosovo -lrb- pdk -rrb- a narrow lead over the democratic league of kosovo -lrb- ldk -rrb- , the party formerly led by ibrahim rugova , seen by many as the " father of the nation . "
he died in 2006 just before talks on kosovo 's future were set to begin .
analysts said they believe the vote will lead to a coalition between the two parties . with the protracted talks on kosovo 's future status having made little apparent progress , ethnic albanian politicians are threatening to declare independence unilaterally .
polls have shown well over 90 percent of the kosovar albanian population is in favor of taking this step . russia has remained serbia 's ally in the dispute by blocking a proposal for kosovo 's independence in the united nations security council , where moscow holds veto powers .
but kosovo 's 2 million albanians are counting on the united states and europe to recognize kosovo as an independent state , should it declare independence . whatever the outcome of the election , the un 's three kosovo mediators are scheduled to hold more talks in brussels on the province on tuesday . economic problems played second fiddle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of mitrovicahas been home to past violence between ethnic albanians and ethnic serbs in kosovo , domestic problems , such as the 60 percent unemployment rate , the lack of direct investment and high levels of corruption , were tied to the issue of independence in the campaign .
politicians argued that the problems could be better tackled once the province had formally split from serbia . but political observer dusan reljic , from the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs , told reuters that ethnic albanians - despite their support for independence - have little faith in their government at least when it comes to fighting corruption . surveys show only 14 percent of the population said they were happy with their political leadership and 70 percent said they were discontented . the population of kosovo is estimated at around 1.9 to 2.2 million .
some 4 percent are ethnic serbs .
ten of the 120 seats in the kosovar parliament are reserved for the serb minority . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after years peddling anglicisms , german advertisers have rediscovered their own language .
if the advertising industry is a barometer of the zeitgeist , what does this say about the state of the nation ? from vodafone 's " make the most of now " to siemens ' " be inspired , " the lingua franca of cutting-edge advertising has long been english , and germany is no exception .
but for a variety of reasons , companies across the board have recently been switching back to german , reflecting both a burgeoning cultural self-confidence and a growing desire to slam the brakes on the rapid spread of " denglish , " as anglicized german has been dubbed . examples include retailer c & a , which replaced " fashion for living " with " preise gut , alles gut " -lrb- the price is right , everything is right -rrb- and mcdonalds , whose advertising campaign morphed from " every time a good time " into " ich liebe es " -lrb- i 'm lovin ' it -rrb- . one reason for this shift is purely practical .
while even native speakers struggle with the double negatives of adidas ' promise that " impossible is nothing , " a study commissioned last year by advertising agency endmark revealed that germans respond to most english-language claims with sheer bewilderment . faced with a dozen anglicisms , only one-third of those questioned in the survey actually knew what the slogans meant .
few grasped the point of " come in and find out , " the ubiquitous promotion for the douglas cosmetics chain .
most consumers , it emerged , thought they were being invited to enter a store and then find the nearest exit . jaguar 's " life by gorgeous " campaign left participants equally bemused , with many laboring under the impression the advertisement was showcasing good times in georgia .
private tv station sat1 's slogan " powered by emotion " must have seemed extremely out of place as most people translated it into german as " kraft durch freude " or " strength through joy " - a favorite motto of hitler 's . perhaps not suprisingly , the offending claims have since been replaced by german ones . sowing the deliberate seeds of confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new sat1 logo according to a recent study carried out by slogans.de , an internet portal for research into advertising , the trend this year has consequently been to more german slogans and fewer anglicisms , with the share of english-language claims slipping down to 18.7 percent compared to 30 percent six years ago . inga wermuth , founder of slogans.de and owner of the hamburg-based advertising agency satelliten media design , said in the past , using english was an easy way to sex up a product - and that an element of linguistic confusion was all part of the strategy . " some brands consciously play with this lack of understanding , " she said .
" the exoticism of a foreign language makes a product seem complex and innovative . " ad man sebastian turner from the scholz & friends agency , one of the top creative addresses in germany , agreed that obfuscation is key . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one douglas ad campaign left consumers wondering where the exits were " when the point is to convey a certain feeling , then precision , function and clarity become secondary , " he said .
" agencies will then simply use words that best convey this emotion . " positioning germany on the world stage is another factor , turner said . " tourists do n't necessarily understand german , whereas english is more international , " he said .
" an english word can provide a better projection surface . " but according to walter krämer , chairman of the german language association , using english as a way to boost an image - turning a corner snack bar into a " city-grill , " for example - is typical of the contemporary habit of watering down the german language . this is symptomatic of germany 's cultural insecurity , he argues , and also a snub to other cultures .

" companies have realized that people do n't understand their claims , " krämer said .
" they also realize that english no longer represents higher standards , but , thanks to george bush , lower standards - just as polls in germany show that americans are increasingly less popular . " wermuth also said she feels that the fact german ads are less inclined to use english is a response to globalization . " this return to the german language is rooted in the fear that , in the long run , it may be taken over by foreign influences , " she said .
" in recent years , our identity has become ever less rooted in traditional , regional and family values .
consequently , there is a growing desire to explore our identity .
these days , the german language appeals more to our emotions because it speaks to our roots . " she pointed out that german-language pop music has seen a similar development . " in the past , german artists did n't stand a chance if they sang in german , " she said .
" but in the late 1990s , performers such as rosenstolz , die fantastischen vier , juli and xavier naidoo began conveying different values with their lyrics and stormed the charts .
similarly , advertising slogans in german come across as more honest , and people feel better able to assess their message . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the group , which was founded in the provincial town of twer this week , claims to have collected 30 million signatures in support of president vladimir putin serving a third term , although the constitution prohibits it . " we see an opportunity for vladimir putin to stay on as head of state , " said pawel astachow , one of the movement 's 600 founding members . and his group is not alone . ever since putin put himself forward as the leading candidate of the united russia party for december 's parliamentary elections , the country has seen the emergence of dozens of groups supporting his bid to remain in power . although under the russian constitution putin can not run for a third term as president , there is nothing to stop him standing for the office of prime minister . putin 's " moral right " to rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenty of russians are " for putin , " just as this massive poster reads falk bomsdorf , head of the moscow office of germany 's liberal friedrich naumann foundation , said the actual election campaigns have been completely overshadowed by the pro-putin demonstrations . " we can no longer talk in terms of a parliamentary election , " he said . " there are no parties putting forward their agendas , no political debates and no alternatives . " thus far there has been no mention of a united russia party program , but that , say critics , is because putin is the program . as the president said earlier this week , a clear win on dec .
2 would give him the " moral right " to determine the path of russian politics even after his term runs out in 2008 . " if the people vote for united russia , it means a clear majority of the people put their trust in me , " putin said . he added that such a display of support would give him the moral right to hold those in the duma and the cabinet responsible for the implementation of the tasks that have already been set .
putin did not explain how he would maintain his grip on power , but said there were " various possibilities . " no european election observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce sent 400 observers to the last duma election the way the election is shaping out , it is set to become a referendum for the president , bomsdorf said . " the kremlin is doing everything it can to prevent proper elections , " he said .
" in my opinion , that is illegal . " on friday , europe 's main elections watchdog , the osce , announced it was calling off its observer mission for the december ballot , on the grounds that moscow has been uncooperative . in a statement , the organization for security and cooperation in europe said that the russian authorities remained unwilling to receive observers in a timely and cooperative manner and cooperate fully with them . the russian foreign ministry said the osce had " invented references to alleged difficulties in obtaining russian visas " in order to cancel its mission .
the european organization , which was originally invited on oct .
31 to send just 70 observers to watch the election - 330 less than for the russian duma election , applied for the visas on nov .
2 , according to german press reports . " it is abundantly clear that the russian election commission does not want any witnesses for their brilliant electoral preparations , " alexander konovalov , head of the institute for strategic studies told the russian nowyje iswestija newspaper . no real alternatives to untied russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin remains popular among large parts of the population moscow has shrugged off criticism that the upcoming vote is being stage-managed to ensure a landslide victory for the ruling united russia party , and meanwhile the well-oiled wheels of putin 's promotional apparatus continue to turn .
television advertisements talk about " russia 's economic well-being " and " putin 's plan , " and the president 's supporters march the streets in the name of promoting putin . thomas kunze , who until recently ran a branch of germany 's konrad-adenauer foundation in moscow , said the russian public genuinely thinks putin is doing a good job . " the middle class has experienced an improved standard of living under putin , and the economic moguls value the stability which putin has brought to russia , " he said . were he allowed to run for a third term as president , putin would currently be in line for between 60 percent and 70 percent of the vote .
with that in mind , the pro-putin campaigns seem unnecessary , but bomsdorf said their aim is not to advertise for putin but to inspire the apathetic russian public to the ballot box . " russians do n't bother with elections , and why should they if there are n't any real alternatives , " he said . manfred götzke -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to the creator of the winning blog , 23-year-old minsk-based journalist xenia awimova . dw-world.de : what inspired you to start a blog ? xenia awimova : blogging is really popular in belarus at the moment .
i know a lot of people who have blogs on sites like livejournal.com , and at some point i became interested in the idea of starting one of my own .
it was a long time before i actually showed anyone my entries , but after a while i felt i 'd like other people to see my photographs so they could comment on them . what role does the blog play in your life ? it is quite simply a platform for me to show my amateur photographs .
it 's a kind of hobby which motivates me to keep taking photos and i can see it staying that way in the future .
i want to improve my photography skills and hope to find a critic among my readers who can tell me what they do n't like about my pictures and suggest ways for improvement .
that would be great . so far i have received very little by way of critical feedback .
i do n't know why .
i 'm really interested in people 's reactions to my work , because it represents my view of the world , and i think it 's interesting to know how others react to what i see . is your blog related to your profession ? it has more to do with what i would like to become , namely a photojournalist .
the blog enables me to practice that .
i am a journalist by profession , but i want to change my specialization .
one could say that my blog is connected to my professional ambition . the entries in your blog are accompanied by numerous commentaries .
why is that ? my blog is part of a relatively small social network which treats its members in a friendly way .
unlike some blogs , there are no rude entries in mine .
people who read my blog seem to be genuinely interested in what i am doing , and even in me as a person . do you read other blogs ?
do you have favorite bloggers ? yes , i subscribe to other blogs .
i like the stories by the blogger " sem ' korov " -lrb- " seven cows " -rrb- , which also appear on livejournal .
and i like the photos by " 365 dnej v godu " -lrb- " 365 days in the year " -rrb- .
his concept is similar to mine : every day he puts up a photograph he has taken that day . what is special about the blog scene in belarus ? there are n't very many independent newspapers or other platforms which allow people to express their opinions in belarus .
many bloggers , particularly those over the age of 20 , write about political subjects .
even opposition politicians keep blogs on livejournal.com in order to get their point across and attract potential supporters . interview : olga sosnytska -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after years peddling anglicisms , german advertisers have rediscovered their own language .
if the advertising industry is a barometer of the zeitgeist , what does this say about the state of the nation ? from vodafone 's " make the most of now " to siemens ' " be inspired , " the lingua franca of cutting-edge advertising has long been english , and germany is no exception .
but for a variety of reasons , companies across the board have recently been switching back to german , reflecting both a burgeoning cultural self-confidence and a growing desire to slam the brakes on the rapid spread of " denglish , " as anglicized german has been dubbed . examples include retailer c & a , which replaced " fashion for living " with " preise gut , alles gut " -lrb- the price is right , everything is right -rrb- and mcdonalds , whose advertising campaign morphed from " every time a good time " into " ich liebe es " -lrb- i 'm lovin ' it -rrb- . one reason for this shift is purely practical .
while even native speakers struggle with the double negatives of adidas ' promise that " impossible is nothing , " a study commissioned last year by advertising agency endmark revealed that germans respond to most english-language claims with sheer bewilderment . faced with a dozen anglicisms , only one-third of those questioned in the survey actually knew what the slogans meant .
few grasped the point of " come in and find out , " the ubiquitous promotion for the douglas cosmetics chain .
most consumers , it emerged , thought they were being invited to enter a store and then find the nearest exit . jaguar 's " life by gorgeous " campaign left participants equally bemused , with many laboring under the impression the advertisement was showcasing good times in georgia .
private tv station sat1 's slogan " powered by emotion " must have seemed extremely out of place as most people translated it into german as " kraft durch freude " or " strength through joy " - a favorite motto of hitler 's . perhaps not suprisingly , the offending claims have since been replaced by german ones . sowing the deliberate seeds of confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new sat1 logo according to a recent study carried out by slogans.de , an internet portal for research into advertising , the trend this year has consequently been to more german slogans and fewer anglicisms , with the share of english-language claims slipping down to 18.7 percent compared to 30 percent six years ago . inga wermuth , founder of slogans.de and owner of the hamburg-based advertising agency satelliten media design , said in the past , using english was an easy way to sex up a product - and that an element of linguistic confusion was all part of the strategy . " some brands consciously play with this lack of understanding , " she said .
" the exoticism of a foreign language makes a product seem complex and innovative . " ad man sebastian turner from the scholz & friends agency , one of the top creative addresses in germany , agreed that obfuscation is key . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one douglas ad campaign left consumers wondering where the exits were " when the point is to convey a certain feeling , then precision , function and clarity become secondary , " he said .
" agencies will then simply use words that best convey this emotion . " positioning germany on the world stage is another factor , turner said . " tourists do n't necessarily understand german , whereas english is more international , " he said .
" an english word can provide a better projection surface . " but according to walter krämer , chairman of the german language association , using english as a way to boost an image - turning a corner snack bar into a " city-grill , " for example - is typical of the contemporary habit of watering down the german language . this is symptomatic of germany 's cultural insecurity , he argues , and also a snub to other cultures . " the german fondness for all things american is also an aversion to other nations and cultures , " the association 's web site says . a shift in values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavier naidoo became a music star singing in german now , however , german appears to be making a come-back - and the sea-change could well mean nothing less than a new sense of national pride . " companies have realized that people do n't understand their claims , " krämer said .
" they also realize that english no longer represents higher standards , but , thanks to george bush , lower standards - just as polls in germany show that americans are increasingly less popular . " wermuth also said she feels that the fact german ads are less inclined to use english is a response to globalization . " this return to the german language is rooted in the fear that , in the long run , it may be taken over by foreign influences , " she said .
" in recent years , our identity has become ever less rooted in traditional , regional and family values .
consequently , there is a growing desire to explore our identity .
these days , the german language appeals more to our emotions because it speaks to our roots . " she pointed out that german-language pop music has seen a similar development . " in the past , german artists did n't stand a chance if they sang in german , " she said .
" but in the late 1990s , performers such as rosenstolz , die fantastischen vier , juli and xavier naidoo began conveying different values with their lyrics and stormed the charts .
similarly , advertising slogans in german come across as more honest , and people feel better able to assess their message . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after years peddling anglicisms , german advertisers have rediscovered their own language .
if the advertising industry is a barometer of the zeitgeist , what does this say about the state of the nation ? from vodafone 's " make the most of now " to siemens ' " be inspired , " the lingua franca of cutting-edge advertising has long been english , and germany is no exception .
but for a variety of reasons , companies across the board have recently been switching back to german , reflecting both a burgeoning cultural self-confidence and a growing desire to slam the brakes on the rapid spread of " denglish , " as anglicized german has been dubbed . examples include retailer c & a , which replaced " fashion for living " with " preise gut , alles gut " -lrb- the price is right , everything is right -rrb- and mcdonalds , whose advertising campaign morphed from " every time a good time " into " ich liebe es " -lrb- i 'm lovin ' it -rrb- . one reason for this shift is purely practical .
while even native speakers struggle with the double negatives of adidas ' promise that " impossible is nothing , " a study commissioned last year by advertising agency endmark revealed that germans respond to most english-language claims with sheer bewilderment . faced with a dozen anglicisms , only one-third of those questioned in the survey actually knew what the slogans meant .
few grasped the point of " come in and find out , " the ubiquitous promotion for the douglas cosmetics chain .
most consumers , it emerged , thought they were being invited to enter a store and then find the nearest exit . jaguar 's " life by gorgeous " campaign left participants equally bemused , with many laboring under the impression the advertisement was showcasing good times in georgia .
private tv station sat1 's slogan " powered by emotion " must have seemed extremely out of place as most people translated it into german as " kraft durch freude " or " strength through joy " - a favorite motto of hitler 's . perhaps not suprisingly , the offending claims have since been replaced by german ones . sowing the deliberate seeds of confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new sat1 logo according to a recent study carried out by slogans.de , an internet portal for research into advertising , the trend this year has consequently been to more german slogans and fewer anglicisms , with the share of english-language claims slipping down to 18.7 percent compared to 30 percent six years ago . inga wermuth , founder of slogans.de and owner of the hamburg-based advertising agency satelliten media design , said in the past , using english was an easy way to sex up a product - and that an element of linguistic confusion was all part of the strategy . " some brands consciously play with this lack of understanding , " she said .
" the exoticism of a foreign language makes a product seem complex and innovative . " ad man sebastian turner from the scholz & friends agency , one of the top creative addresses in germany , agreed that obfuscation is key . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one douglas ad campaign left consumers wondering where the exits were " when the point is to convey a certain feeling , then precision , function and clarity become secondary , " he said .
" agencies will then simply use words that best convey this emotion . " positioning germany on the world stage is another factor , turner said . " tourists do n't necessarily understand german , whereas english is more international , " he said .
" an english word can provide a better projection surface . " but according to walter krämer , chairman of the german language association , using english as a way to boost an image - turning a corner snack bar into a " city-grill , " for example - is typical of the contemporary habit of watering down the german language . this is symptomatic of germany 's cultural insecurity , he argues , and also a snub to other cultures . " the german fondness for all things american is also an aversion to other nations and cultures , " the association 's web site says . a shift in values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavier naidoo became a music star singing in german now , however , german appears to be making a come-back - and the sea-change could well mean nothing less than a new sense of national pride . " companies have realized that people do n't understand their claims , " krämer said .
" they also realize that english no longer represents higher standards , but , thanks to george bush , lower standards - just as polls in germany show that americans are increasingly less popular . " wermuth also said she feels that the fact german ads are less inclined to use english is a response to globalization . " this return to the german language is rooted in the fear that , in the long run , it may be taken over by foreign influences , " she said .
" in recent years , our identity has become ever less rooted in traditional , regional and family values .
consequently , there is a growing desire to explore our identity .
these days , the german language appeals more to our emotions because it speaks to our roots . " she pointed out that german-language pop music has seen a similar development . " in the past , german artists did n't stand a chance if they sang in german , " she said .
" but in the late 1990s , performers such as rosenstolz , die fantastischen vier , juli and xavier naidoo began conveying different values with their lyrics and stormed the charts .
similarly , advertising slogans in german come across as more honest , and people feel better able to assess their message . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , in kosovo 's parliamentary elections .
it 's the third parliamentary vote since the province , which formally belongs to serbia , came under united nations control in 1999 . the election campaign in kosovo has been dominated by the subject of province 's future status .
with a trio of diplomatic envoys from the european union , the united states and russia facing a dec .
10 deadline to come up with a plan for the province , the kosovar albanian parties have become increasingly vocal in their calls for independence . members of kosovo 's ethnic serb minority , estimated to total about 120,000 , are not expected to cast their ballots at the weekend .
the serbian government has recommended they boycott the vote , saying that taking part would be tantamount to recognizing the province 's independence , which belgrade opposes . ex-rebel tipped to be next prime minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic issues were secondary in the election campaign former kosovo liberation army leader , hashim thaci is tipped to become the next prime minister .
serbia accuses him of being a terrorist because of his rebel activities .
current prime minister agim ceku is not running for re-election . the latest polls give his democratic party of kosovo -lrb- pdk -rrb- a narrow lead over the democratic league of kosovo -lrb- ldk -rrb- , the party formerly led by ibrahim rugova , seen by many as the " father of the nation . "
he died in 2006 just before talks on kosovo 's future were set to begin .
analysts said they believe the vote will lead to a coalition between the two parties . with the protracted talks on kosovo 's future status having made little apparent progress , ethnic albanian politicians are threatening to declare independence unilaterally .
polls have shown well over 90 percent of the kosovar albanian population is in favor of taking this step . russia has remained serbia 's ally in the dispute by blocking a proposal for kosovo 's independence in the united nations security council , where moscow holds veto powers .
but kosovo 's 2 million albanians are counting on the united states and europe to recognize kosovo as an independent state , should it declare independence . whatever the outcome of the election , the un 's three kosovo mediators are scheduled to hold more talks in brussels on the province on tuesday . economic problems played second fiddle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city of mitrovicahas been home to past violence between ethnic albanians and ethnic serbs in kosovo , domestic problems , such as the 60 percent unemployment rate , the lack of direct investment and high levels of corruption , were tied to the issue of independence in the campaign .
politicians argued that the problems could be better tackled once the province had formally split from serbia . but political observer dusan reljic , from the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs , told reuters that ethnic albanians - despite their support for independence - have little faith in their government at least when it comes to fighting corruption . surveys show only 14 percent of the population said they were happy with their political leadership and 70 percent said they were discontented . the population of kosovo is estimated at around 1.9 to 2.2 million .
some 4 percent are ethnic serbs .
ten of the 120 seats in the kosovar parliament are reserved for the serb minority . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" so help me god , " said tusk , leader of poland 's election-winning liberal party , as he pledged to serve the country , using a formula which , although optional , is traditionally used in government ceremonies in deeply-catholic poland .
his 18 ministers were then sworn in one by one .
tusk said his ministers were " well prepared and decent , " adding " state power should serve the people , not dominate them . "
his government intended to focus on " health , wages and home security , " tusk added .
tusk 's civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- party beat the conservative law and justice party in a snap election on oct .
21 and ended the unprecedented political double act of deposed prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski his identical twin , the president , lech .
the po victory also ended the rule of kaczynski 's fractious three-party coalition which had struggled through two years of in-fighting , scandal and criticism .
tusk hopes for more success with his coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk will lead a moderate coalition government tusk takes over with a new coalition , forced on him due to the fact that civic platform missed its goal of obtaining a parliamentary majority , winning 209 of the total 460 seats .
he forms his government with members of the moderate polish peasants ' party , which won 31 seats in parliament , and has made its leader , waldemar pawlak , his deputy prime minister .
jaroslaw kaczynski , who formally stepped down as prime minister on nov .
5 , has become the leader of the opposition .
tusk has pledged to end the regular tussles with the rest of the european union , and with neighboring germany in particular , which marked law and justice 's rule .
he also promised to ease tensions in relations with russia , which have been at their lowest ebb since poland broke free from the communist bloc in 1989 .
rocky times ahead in relationship with us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk will bring polish troops home from iraq he has said he will withdraw polish troops from iraq , where 900 soldiers are serving in the us-led coalition ; and has warned he will drive a harder bargain in talks with washington on basing part of a us anti-missile system in poland .
on the domestic side , he has promised to slash bureaucracy , revive the stalled privatization process and reform the health service .
he also wants to spur the already robust economy to try to draw home some of the more than a million poles who have emigrated since the country joined the eu in 2004 .

the group , which was founded in the provincial town of twer this week , claims to have collected 30 million signatures in support of president vladimir putin serving a third term , although the constitution prohibits it . " we see an opportunity for vladimir putin to stay on as head of state , " said pawel astachow , one of the movement 's 600 founding members . and his group is not alone . ever since putin put himself forward as the leading candidate of the united russia party for december 's parliamentary elections , the country has seen the emergence of dozens of groups supporting his bid to remain in power . although under the russian constitution putin can not run for a third term as president , there is nothing to stop him standing for the office of prime minister . putin 's " moral right " to rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenty of russians are " for putin , " just as this massive poster reads falk bomsdorf , head of the moscow office of germany 's liberal friedrich naumann foundation , said the actual election campaigns have been completely overshadowed by the pro-putin demonstrations . " we can no longer talk in terms of a parliamentary election , " he said . " there are no parties putting forward their agendas , no political debates and no alternatives . " thus far there has been no mention of a united russia party program , but that , say critics , is because putin is the program . as the president said earlier this week , a clear win on dec .
2 would give him the " moral right " to determine the path of russian politics even after his term runs out in 2008 . " if the people vote for united russia , it means a clear majority of the people put their trust in me , " putin said . he added that such a display of support would give him the moral right to hold those in the duma and the cabinet responsible for the implementation of the tasks that have already been set .
putin did not explain how he would maintain his grip on power , but said there were " various possibilities . " no european election observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce sent 400 observers to the last duma election the way the election is shaping out , it is set to become a referendum for the president , bomsdorf said . " the kremlin is doing everything it can to prevent proper elections , " he said .
" in my opinion , that is illegal . " on friday , europe 's main elections watchdog , the osce , announced it was calling off its observer mission for the december ballot , on the grounds that moscow has been uncooperative . in a statement , the organization for security and cooperation in europe said that the russian authorities remained unwilling to receive observers in a timely and cooperative manner and cooperate fully with them . the russian foreign ministry said the osce had " invented references to alleged difficulties in obtaining russian visas " in order to cancel its mission .
the european organization , which was originally invited on oct .
31 to send just 70 observers to watch the election - 330 less than for the russian duma election , applied for the visas on nov .
2 , according to german press reports . " it is abundantly clear that the russian election commission does not want any witnesses for their brilliant electoral preparations , " alexander konovalov , head of the institute for strategic studies told the russian nowyje iswestija newspaper . no real alternatives to untied russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin remains popular among large parts of the population moscow has shrugged off criticism that the upcoming vote is being stage-managed to ensure a landslide victory for the ruling united russia party , and meanwhile the well-oiled wheels of putin 's promotional apparatus continue to turn .
television advertisements talk about " russia 's economic well-being " and " putin 's plan , " and the president 's supporters march the streets in the name of promoting putin . thomas kunze , who until recently ran a branch of germany 's konrad-adenauer foundation in moscow , said the russian public genuinely thinks putin is doing a good job . " the middle class has experienced an improved standard of living under putin , and the economic moguls value the stability which putin has brought to russia , " he said . were he allowed to run for a third term as president , putin would currently be in line for between 60 percent and 70 percent of the vote .
with that in mind , the pro-putin campaigns seem unnecessary , but bomsdorf said their aim is not to advertise for putin but to inspire the apathetic russian public to the ballot box . " russians do n't bother with elections , and why should they if there are n't any real alternatives , " he said . manfred götzke -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

varieties of vegetables and cereals not on the list can ’ t legally be sold by professional farmers .
but some biodiversity activists argue the official seed catalogue reduces the number of fruit and vegetable varieties available to the french consumer and restricts biodiversity .
an association of farming militants is fighting to keep older plant varieties in circulation and alive .
they do this by illegally selling and planting unofficial seeds .
they say only this will preserve food biodiversity and heirloom varieties of vegetables and grains .

varieties of vegetables and cereals not on the list can ’ t legally be sold by professional farmers .
but some biodiversity activists argue the official seed catalogue reduces the number of fruit and vegetable varieties available to the french consumer and restricts biodiversity .
an association of farming militants is fighting to keep older plant varieties in circulation and alive .
they do this by illegally selling and planting unofficial seeds .
they say only this will preserve food biodiversity and heirloom varieties of vegetables and grains .

christmas is just around the corner , if that fact does n't send you a-caroling along , a new school in germany may help you dump some of your humbug with lessons in how to prepare for the holiday . before throwing ourselves into this year 's festive preparations , perhaps we should all settle down for a moment - with a cup of eggnog , if necessary - and reexamine the hellish memories of last year 's yuletide experience that we 've spent the last 10 months trying to erase . by the time christmas comes round again , most people will have forgotten some or all of the following : the turkey was burnt , your uncle was drunk before lunch , and your parents fought all afternoon over dad 's lack of washing up assistance . your mind also has , thankfully , suppressed the fact that grandma bought you the exact same gift as on your birthday and the cat chewed through the christmas lights , setting fire to the carpet and giving the living room a foul smell until long after new year 's . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : animals can contribute to christmas chaos while christmas is a time for reflection , family , and the giving and receiving of gifts ; it is also the time of year where the chances of everything going pear-shaped rapidly increase . academy to teach lessons in christmas well , if you 're german and lucky enough to live in the considerate city of trier , you could be on the verge of waving goodbye to disastrous christmases . the city knows the chances of a christmas actually turning out merry increase exponentially if the circumstances are n't left to chance .
that 's why trier has set up a christmas academy where attendees can prepare for the festive season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mum 's wrapping really improved after her lessons children can practice their hymns and get those extended family piano sing-a-longs just right as mum burns her way through a whole flock of poultry on the way to the perfect christmas bird . tree trimming and fir maintenance courses will be available for dads , and parental planning tuition is encouraged for all those catering to a larger brood .
everything from present buying to post-dinner activities will be touched upon . at press time , there was no news on whether there would be any instruction on how to extricate yourself from the whole sorry event and spend a fortnight on a tropical island without incurring a year 's worth of your mother 's wrath . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle announces the winners of the “ international weblog awards – the bobs 2007 ” the “ photo-maniac ” blog from belarus is the winner of this year ’ s “ deutsche welle international weblog awards – the bobs . ”
the english-language blog “ jotman ” from thailand was the winner of this year ’ s prestigious reporters without borders award .
“ alive in baghdad ” won as the jury 's best videoblog and “ valour-it ” took home the best weblog english .
xenia awimova , a 23-year-old aspiring photojournalist who lives and works in the belarusian capital of minsk , runs " foto-griffoneurei " -lrb- literally " photo-maniac " -rrb- .
the jury said that her collection of photos thoroughly expresses her life and surroundings and thereby fulfils the main purpose of a blog .
" with few words , this excellent blog succeeds in portraying the daily life of people in belarus , " said christian gramsch , program director of dw-world.de and dw-radio .
“ she thereby supplies information from a country that , to a large extent , separates itself from outside views . ”
" in belarus there are not many independent newspapers or other platforms where people can express their opinions , " awimova said after being told of the award .
" that is why a lot of young people write blogs .
these are often about politics .
even oppositional politicians use blogs to present their opinion and as a way to get the attention of potential supporters . "
an anonymous blogger going by the name of jotman won the 2007 reporters without borders award – an inherent part of the bobs .
the blogger 's coverage of the 2006 coup in thailand and more recent reports from protests against the military junta in myanmar , also known as burma , made him stand out , jury members said .
two blogs with different perspectives of the war in iraq also won awards .
alive in baghdad , a videoblog about the daily lives of iraqis , received the jury 's prize in the best videoblog category , and valour-it , a blog that raises money to buy laptops for injured soldiers , won the best english weblog award . award ceremony in berlin the fourth annual best of the blogs 2007 came to an end on the evening of november 15 with an awards ceremony at the museum of communication in berlin .
thirty awards were given out , including users ' -choice awards .
accompanying the event the jury discussed tendencies , characteristics and excellent examples from the international blogosphere .
in her keynote speech on “ blogging in iran and the internet as an alternative medium of the women ’ s movement , ” iranian blogger and feminist farnaz seifi stressed that “ in a society where the government controls the entire media , the internet offers tool for repressed voices to express themselves . ”
the awards ceremony was hosted by the dutch actress and singer ellen ten damme and the “ spreebllick ” blogger johnny haeusler . internationally-established weblog awards more than 7,000 weblogs in 10 different languages were nominated for this year 's competition , 1,500 more than last year .

" so help me god , " said tusk , leader of poland 's election-winning liberal party , as he pledged to serve the country , using a formula which , although optional , is traditionally used in government ceremonies in deeply-catholic poland .
his 18 ministers were then sworn in one by one .
tusk said his ministers were " well prepared and decent , " adding " state power should serve the people , not dominate them . "
his government intended to focus on " health , wages and home security , " tusk added .
tusk 's civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- party beat the conservative law and justice party in a snap election on oct .
21 and ended the unprecedented political double act of deposed prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski his identical twin , the president , lech .
the po victory also ended the rule of kaczynski 's fractious three-party coalition which had struggled through two years of in-fighting , scandal and criticism .
tusk hopes for more success with his coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk will lead a moderate coalition government tusk takes over with a new coalition , forced on him due to the fact that civic platform missed its goal of obtaining a parliamentary majority , winning 209 of the total 460 seats .
he forms his government with members of the moderate polish peasants ' party , which won 31 seats in parliament , and has made its leader , waldemar pawlak , his deputy prime minister .
jaroslaw kaczynski , who formally stepped down as prime minister on nov .
5 , has become the leader of the opposition .
tusk has pledged to end the regular tussles with the rest of the european union , and with neighboring germany in particular , which marked law and justice 's rule .
he also promised to ease tensions in relations with russia , which have been at their lowest ebb since poland broke free from the communist bloc in 1989 .
rocky times ahead in relationship with us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk will bring polish troops home from iraq he has said he will withdraw polish troops from iraq , where 900 soldiers are serving in the us-led coalition ; and has warned he will drive a harder bargain in talks with washington on basing part of a us anti-missile system in poland .
on the domestic side , he has promised to slash bureaucracy , revive the stalled privatization process and reform the health service .
he also wants to spur the already robust economy to try to draw home some of the more than a million poles who have emigrated since the country joined the eu in 2004 .
in addition , he wants poland to enter the euro zone .
the conservatives had regularly expressed skepticism about switching from the national currency , the zloty , to the euro .
eu-friendly tusk looking to repair european ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynskis have been thorns in many eu leaders ' side the urbane , amiable tusk is a dyed-in-the-wool champion of european integration - and his premiership will be in stark contrast to that of kaczynski after the fights the brothers picked with eu leaders .
he has also been a confirmed economic liberal since his youth , and has regularly said that poland needs less state interference and more entrepreneurs .
besides being an anti-regime activist during communist rule , when he studied poland 's pre-war history , tusk was a hands-on apprentice in economics , becoming one of the country 's few independent businessmen by setting up a small painting firm .
after 1989 , when communist rule came to an end in poland , tusk and a group of friends in his baltic sea hometown of gdansk founded a political party , the liberal democratic congress -lrb- kld -rrb- , to campaign for a sweeping privatization of the state-run economy .
in elections in 1991 , kld won 37 seats in poland 's 460-seat lower house , but lost them all two years later , and tusk opted to merge his party with the larger freedom union -lrb- uw -rrb- .
after leading a breakaway in 2001 , tusk formed po .
new pm looking to reduce state 's influence on business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business-friendly tusk wants to promote poland in line with his economic thinking , tusk is an avowed admirer of the late us president ronald reagan and former british prime minister margaret thatcher .
he has also been a faithful supporter of lech walesa , the former gdansk shipyard electrician who led the communist-era opposition trade union solidarity and was elected president in 1990 .
walesa also backed the po in the campaign that led to tusk 's victory .
tusk is proud of his cultural background .
he is a kashubian - a slav minority from the gdansk region - and has been at the forefront of a cultural revival which has reversed years of decline .
he only discovered his roots as an adult , prompting him to learn the language and later write the first textbook for would-be kashubian-speakers . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" so help me god , " said tusk , leader of poland 's election-winning liberal party , as he pledged to serve the country , using a formula which , although optional , is traditionally used in government ceremonies in deeply-catholic poland .
his 18 ministers were then sworn in one by one .
tusk said his ministers were " well prepared and decent , " adding " state power should serve the people , not dominate them . "
his government intended to focus on " health , wages and home security , " tusk added .
tusk 's civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- party beat the conservative law and justice party in a snap election on oct .

jaroslaw kaczynski , who formally stepped down as prime minister on nov .
5 , has become the leader of the opposition .
tusk has pledged to end the regular tussles with the rest of the european union , and with neighboring germany in particular , which marked law and justice 's rule .
he also promised to ease tensions in relations with russia , which have been at their lowest ebb since poland broke free from the communist bloc in 1989 .

berlin said it remained up to tehran to prove that its nuclear ambitions were peaceful and to cooperate with the international nuclear inspectors . the report shows area of light and of shade , but on the whole it is not encouraging , " german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said on friday , nov .

" iran has not met its commitments and has pursued enrichment work .
it still has to present us with proof that the aims of its nuclear program are purely peaceful . " us president george w. bush said on friday that international pressure on iran " must , and will grow " if tehran refuses to freeze its program . defiant response from iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran appears determined to continue with its nuclear activities but tehran vowed to continue its enrichment plans . " iran will never give up the uranium enrichment technology , which it has mastered , " iran 's ambassador to the iaea ali asghar soltanieh told iran 's official news agency irna . iranian president mahmud ahmadinejad also called on the us government to change its course , saying the iaea had testified to the fact that iran 's nuclear program was peaceful . the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said in a report published on thursday that iran had provided " sufficient access " to individuals and responded in a " timely manner " to questions , but described cooperation as " reactive rather than pro-active . " while the watchdog body conceded iran had made some progress in revealing the extent of its nuclear program , it also stated that it was still defying un demands that it suspend enrichment . enough to produce a single nuclear bomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea noted some progress in its report , but continued to express misgivings officials confirmed for the first time that iran had installed 3,000 uranium enriching cartridges , reaching a key milestone in its nuclear program .
that is the number scientists believe is sufficient to create enough of radioactive material of sufficient quality to produce a nuclear bomb in one year . the report warned that the agency 's knowledge of the country 's current nuclear activities was diminishing . washington imposed fresh unilateral sanctions on iran in late october and has vowed in the wake of the report to press ahead with its drive for additional ones . the united states , which accuses iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons and has not ruled out using force against the islamic republic , said the findings in the report proved that iran was just " stringing the iaea along . " dwindling knowledge of what 's going on now " maybe they 've shed some additional light on activities in the 80s and 90s , but we know less and less about what they 're doing in 2007 , " the us ambassador to the iaea , gregory schulte , told the afp news agency . china and russia , which are also permanent members of the un security council , are reluctant about backing the us drive for further sanctions .
tehran has repeatedly said its nuclear program is intended only to generate energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said it is preparing to deliver fuel to an iranian nuclear plant while france has begun probing the possibility of eu sanctions against tehran , germany , which is iran 's largest european trading partner , has argued that ongoing un and european diplomatic efforts should first run their course before further action is taken . berlin has , however , signaled it would be open to additional measures if current sanctions do n't produce a change in iran . " the foreign minister has made clear that if this is the case we would take up this issue in europe and consider together what steps could be taken by europe , " jäger told reporters . russia readying nuclear fuel russia , on friday , announced it was prepared to begin sending nuclear fuel to an iranian station at the end of november . " we are ready to provide iaea specialists with all the conditions they need to do their work , " konstantin grabelnikov , deputy head of russia 's novosibirsk chemical concentrate plant , which is preparing the fuel , said in a statement . russian officials said they had not set a date for delivery , but added that the fuel would be sent six months before the iranian plant being built at bushehr began operation , which is not expected before 2008 . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the group , which was founded in the provincial town of twer this week , claims to have collected 30 million signatures in support of president vladimir putin serving a third term , although the constitution prohibits it . " we see an opportunity for vladimir putin to stay on as head of state , " said pawel astachow , one of the movement 's 600 founding members . and his group is not alone . ever since putin put himself forward as the leading candidate of the united russia party for december 's parliamentary elections , the country has seen the emergence of dozens of groups supporting his bid to remain in power . although under the russian constitution putin can not run for a third term as president , there is nothing to stop him standing for the office of prime minister . putin 's " moral right " to rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenty of russians are " for putin , " just as this massive poster reads falk bomsdorf , head of the moscow office of germany 's liberal friedrich naumann foundation , said the actual election campaigns have been completely overshadowed by the pro-putin demonstrations . " we can no longer talk in terms of a parliamentary election , " he said . " there are no parties putting forward their agendas , no political debates and no alternatives . " thus far there has been no mention of a united russia party program , but that , say critics , is because putin is the program . as the president said earlier this week , a clear win on dec .
2 would give him the " moral right " to determine the path of russian politics even after his term runs out in 2008 . " if the people vote for united russia , it means a clear majority of the people put their trust in me , " putin said . he added that such a display of support would give him the moral right to hold those in the duma and the cabinet responsible for the implementation of the tasks that have already been set .
putin did not explain how he would maintain his grip on power , but said there were " various possibilities . " no european election observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce sent 400 observers to the last duma election the way the election is shaping out , it is set to become a referendum for the president , bomsdorf said . " the kremlin is doing everything it can to prevent proper elections , " he said .
" in my opinion , that is illegal . " on friday , europe 's main elections watchdog , the osce , announced it was calling off its observer mission for the december ballot , on the grounds that moscow has been uncooperative . in a statement , the organization for security and cooperation in europe said that the russian authorities remained unwilling to receive observers in a timely and cooperative manner and cooperate fully with them . the russian foreign ministry said the osce had " invented references to alleged difficulties in obtaining russian visas " in order to cancel its mission .
the european organization , which was originally invited on oct .
31 to send just 70 observers to watch the election - 330 less than for the russian duma election , applied for the visas on nov .
2 , according to german press reports . " it is abundantly clear that the russian election commission does not want any witnesses for their brilliant electoral preparations , " alexander konovalov , head of the institute for strategic studies told the russian nowyje iswestija newspaper . no real alternatives to untied russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin remains popular among large parts of the population moscow has shrugged off criticism that the upcoming vote is being stage-managed to ensure a landslide victory for the ruling united russia party , and meanwhile the well-oiled wheels of putin 's promotional apparatus continue to turn .
television advertisements talk about " russia 's economic well-being " and " putin 's plan , " and the president 's supporters march the streets in the name of promoting putin . thomas kunze , who until recently ran a branch of germany 's konrad-adenauer foundation in moscow , said the russian public genuinely thinks putin is doing a good job . " the middle class has experienced an improved standard of living under putin , and the economic moguls value the stability which putin has brought to russia , " he said . were he allowed to run for a third term as president , putin would currently be in line for between 60 percent and 70 percent of the vote .
with that in mind , the pro-putin campaigns seem unnecessary , but bomsdorf said their aim is not to advertise for putin but to inspire the apathetic russian public to the ballot box .

after years peddling anglicisms , german advertisers have rediscovered their own language .
if the advertising industry is a barometer of the zeitgeist , what does this say about the state of the nation ? from vodafone 's " make the most of now " to siemens ' " be inspired , " the lingua franca of cutting-edge advertising has long been english , and germany is no exception .
but for a variety of reasons , companies across the board have recently been switching back to german , reflecting both a burgeoning cultural self-confidence and a growing desire to slam the brakes on the rapid spread of " denglish , " as anglicized german has been dubbed . examples include retailer c & a , which replaced " fashion for living " with " preise gut , alles gut " -lrb- the price is right , everything is right -rrb- and mcdonalds , whose advertising campaign morphed from " every time a good time " into " ich liebe es " -lrb- i 'm lovin ' it -rrb- . one reason for this shift is purely practical .
while even native speakers struggle with the double negatives of adidas ' promise that " impossible is nothing , " a study commissioned last year by advertising agency endmark revealed that germans respond to most english-language claims with sheer bewilderment . faced with a dozen anglicisms , only one-third of those questioned in the survey actually knew what the slogans meant .
few grasped the point of " come in and find out , " the ubiquitous promotion for the douglas cosmetics chain .
most consumers , it emerged , thought they were being invited to enter a store and then find the nearest exit . jaguar 's " life by gorgeous " campaign left participants equally bemused , with many laboring under the impression the advertisement was showcasing good times in georgia .
private tv station sat1 's slogan " powered by emotion " must have seemed extremely out of place as most people translated it into german as " kraft durch freude " or " strength through joy " - a favorite motto of hitler 's . perhaps not suprisingly , the offending claims have since been replaced by german ones . sowing the deliberate seeds of confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new sat1 logo according to a recent study carried out by slogans.de , an internet portal for research into advertising , the trend this year has consequently been to more german slogans and fewer anglicisms , with the share of english-language claims slipping down to 18.7 percent compared to 30 percent six years ago . inga wermuth , founder of slogans.de and owner of the hamburg-based advertising agency satelliten media design , said in the past , using english was an easy way to sex up a product - and that an element of linguistic confusion was all part of the strategy . " some brands consciously play with this lack of understanding , " she said .
" the exoticism of a foreign language makes a product seem complex and innovative . " ad man sebastian turner from the scholz & friends agency , one of the top creative addresses in germany , agreed that obfuscation is key . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one douglas ad campaign left consumers wondering where the exits were " when the point is to convey a certain feeling , then precision , function and clarity become secondary , " he said .
" agencies will then simply use words that best convey this emotion . " positioning germany on the world stage is another factor , turner said . " tourists do n't necessarily understand german , whereas english is more international , " he said .
" an english word can provide a better projection surface . " but according to walter krämer , chairman of the german language association , using english as a way to boost an image - turning a corner snack bar into a " city-grill , " for example - is typical of the contemporary habit of watering down the german language . this is symptomatic of germany 's cultural insecurity , he argues , and also a snub to other cultures . " the german fondness for all things american is also an aversion to other nations and cultures , " the association 's web site says . a shift in values bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavier naidoo became a music star singing in german now , however , german appears to be making a come-back - and the sea-change could well mean nothing less than a new sense of national pride . " companies have realized that people do n't understand their claims , " krämer said .
" they also realize that english no longer represents higher standards , but , thanks to george bush , lower standards - just as polls in germany show that americans are increasingly less popular . " wermuth also said she feels that the fact german ads are less inclined to use english is a response to globalization . " this return to the german language is rooted in the fear that , in the long run , it may be taken over by foreign influences , " she said .
" in recent years , our identity has become ever less rooted in traditional , regional and family values .
consequently , there is a growing desire to explore our identity .
these days , the german language appeals more to our emotions because it speaks to our roots . " she pointed out that german-language pop music has seen a similar development . " in the past , german artists did n't stand a chance if they sang in german , " she said .
" but in the late 1990s , performers such as rosenstolz , die fantastischen vier , juli and xavier naidoo began conveying different values with their lyrics and stormed the charts .
similarly , advertising slogans in german come across as more honest , and people feel better able to assess their message . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to the creator of the winning blog , 23-year-old minsk-based journalist xenia awimova . dw-world.de : what inspired you to start a blog ? xenia awimova : blogging is really popular in belarus at the moment .
i know a lot of people who have blogs on sites like livejournal.com , and at some point i became interested in the idea of starting one of my own .
it was a long time before i actually showed anyone my entries , but after a while i felt i 'd like other people to see my photographs so they could comment on them . what role does the blog play in your life ? it is quite simply a platform for me to show my amateur photographs .
it 's a kind of hobby which motivates me to keep taking photos and i can see it staying that way in the future .
i want to improve my photography skills and hope to find a critic among my readers who can tell me what they do n't like about my pictures and suggest ways for improvement .
that would be great . so far i have received very little by way of critical feedback .
i do n't know why .
i 'm really interested in people 's reactions to my work , because it represents my view of the world , and i think it 's interesting to know how others react to what i see . is your blog related to your profession ? it has more to do with what i would like to become , namely a photojournalist .
the blog enables me to practice that .
i am a journalist by profession , but i want to change my specialization .
one could say that my blog is connected to my professional ambition . the entries in your blog are accompanied by numerous commentaries .
why is that ? my blog is part of a relatively small social network which treats its members in a friendly way .
unlike some blogs , there are no rude entries in mine .
people who read my blog seem to be genuinely interested in what i am doing , and even in me as a person . do you read other blogs ?
do you have favorite bloggers ? yes , i subscribe to other blogs .
i like the stories by the blogger " sem ' korov " -lrb- " seven cows " -rrb- , which also appear on livejournal .
and i like the photos by " 365 dnej v godu " -lrb- " 365 days in the year " -rrb- .
his concept is similar to mine : every day he puts up a photograph he has taken that day . what is special about the blog scene in belarus ? there are n't very many independent newspapers or other platforms which allow people to express their opinions in belarus .
many bloggers , particularly those over the age of 20 , write about political subjects .
even opposition politicians keep blogs on livejournal.com in order to get their point across and attract potential supporters . interview : olga sosnytska -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chinese finance ministry cancelled a scheduled meeting with german finance minister peer steinbrück in beijing . despite having the meeting with china 's finance minister arranged for some time as part of his trip to the far east from dec .
1-8 , steinbrück was told that , due to the " very busy schedule of the new chinese finance minister , " xie xuren would have no time to see him .
the german foreign ministry said steinbrück 's trip to china would be rescheduled for the second quarter of next year and that the far east trip , during which he was also scheduled to visit tokyo and seoul , had been cancelled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück has canceled his entire far east trip it is the latest in a series of high-level meetings with german officials that the chinese have delayed or cancelled since chancellor angela merkel held a private meeting with the dalai lama on sept .
29 .
china vigorously protested the tibetan leader 's visit beforehand and reacted sharply afterwards by cutting contact with german officials .
dalia lama visit leads to cooling of relations beijing had previously pulled out of a planned meeting in october of world powers on the iranian nuclear crisis in berlin , forcing its cancellation .
china also axed an annual event scheduled for december in beijing to discuss human rights and called off a germany-china symposium scheduled for late september in munich , citing " technical reasons . "
a chinese foreign ministry spokesman last week said germany bore the responsibility to rectify " the negative impact of its erroneous act . "
china views the dalai lama as a dangerous separatist agitating for independence for tibet and has made clear its disapproval of any world leader holding an audience with him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " dangerous separatist " was welcomed in washington last month , the dalai lama met with us president george w. bush in washington , where the us congress gave him the congressional gold medal - its highest civilian award .
china issued similar threats of damaged ties with australia after prime minister john howard met with the dalai lama in june .
but chinese president hu jintao then travelled to australia , a visit that saw the two nations sign lucrative trade deals .
however , china 's ties with germany appear to have suffered the most .
in addition to the visit of the dalai lama , germany and china have been at odds over allegations of cyber espionage by hackers allegedly in the employ of the people 's republic .

after years peddling anglicisms , german advertisers have rediscovered their own language .
if the advertising industry is a barometer of the zeitgeist , what does this say about the state of the nation ? from vodafone 's " make the most of now " to siemens ' " be inspired , " the lingua franca of cutting-edge advertising has long been english , and germany is no exception .
but for a variety of reasons , companies across the board have recently been switching back to german , reflecting both a burgeoning cultural self-confidence and a growing desire to slam the brakes on the rapid spread of " denglish , " as anglicized german has been dubbed . examples include retailer c & a , which replaced " fashion for living " with " preise gut , alles gut " -lrb- the price is right , everything is right -rrb- and mcdonalds , whose advertising campaign morphed from " every time a good time " into " ich liebe es " -lrb- i 'm lovin ' it -rrb- . one reason for this shift is purely practical .
while even native speakers struggle with the double negatives of adidas ' promise that " impossible is nothing , " a study commissioned last year by advertising agency endmark revealed that germans respond to most english-language claims with sheer bewilderment . faced with a dozen anglicisms , only one-third of those questioned in the survey actually knew what the slogans meant .
few grasped the point of " come in and find out , " the ubiquitous promotion for the douglas cosmetics chain .
most consumers , it emerged , thought they were being invited to enter a store and then find the nearest exit . jaguar 's " life by gorgeous " campaign left participants equally bemused , with many laboring under the impression the advertisement was showcasing good times in georgia .
private tv station sat1 's slogan " powered by emotion " must have seemed extremely out of place as most people translated it into german as " kraft durch freude " or " strength through joy " - a favorite motto of hitler 's . perhaps not suprisingly , the offending claims have since been replaced by german ones . sowing the deliberate seeds of confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new sat1 logo according to a recent study carried out by slogans.de , an internet portal for research into advertising , the trend this year has consequently been to more german slogans and fewer anglicisms , with the share of english-language claims slipping down to 18.7 percent compared to 30 percent six years ago . inga wermuth , founder of slogans.de and owner of the hamburg-based advertising agency satelliten media design , said in the past , using english was an easy way to sex up a product - and that an element of linguistic confusion was all part of the strategy . " some brands consciously play with this lack of understanding , " she said .
" the exoticism of a foreign language makes a product seem complex and innovative . " ad man sebastian turner from the scholz & friends agency , one of the top creative addresses in germany , agreed that obfuscation is key . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one douglas ad campaign left consumers wondering where the exits were " when the point is to convey a certain feeling , then precision , function and clarity become secondary , " he said .
" agencies will then simply use words that best convey this emotion . " positioning germany on the world stage is another factor , turner said . " tourists do n't necessarily understand german , whereas english is more international , " he said .
" an english word can provide a better projection surface . " but according to walter krämer , chairman of the german language association , using english as a way to boost an image - turning a corner snack bar into a " city-grill , " for example - is typical of the contemporary habit of watering down the german language . this is symptomatic of germany 's cultural insecurity , he argues , and also a snub to other cultures .

" companies have realized that people do n't understand their claims , " krämer said .
" they also realize that english no longer represents higher standards , but , thanks to george bush , lower standards - just as polls in germany show that americans are increasingly less popular . " wermuth also said she feels that the fact german ads are less inclined to use english is a response to globalization . " this return to the german language is rooted in the fear that , in the long run , it may be taken over by foreign influences , " she said .
" in recent years , our identity has become ever less rooted in traditional , regional and family values .
consequently , there is a growing desire to explore our identity .
these days , the german language appeals more to our emotions because it speaks to our roots . " she pointed out that german-language pop music has seen a similar development . " in the past , german artists did n't stand a chance if they sang in german , " she said .
" but in the late 1990s , performers such as rosenstolz , die fantastischen vier , juli and xavier naidoo began conveying different values with their lyrics and stormed the charts .

varieties of vegetables and cereals not on the list can ’ t legally be sold by professional farmers .
but some biodiversity activists argue the official seed catalogue reduces the number of fruit and vegetable varieties available to the french consumer and restricts biodiversity .
an association of farming militants is fighting to keep older plant varieties in circulation and alive .
they do this by illegally selling and planting unofficial seeds .
they say only this will preserve food biodiversity and heirloom varieties of vegetables and grains .

the group , which was founded in the provincial town of twer this week , claims to have collected 30 million signatures in support of president vladimir putin serving a third term , although the constitution prohibits it . " we see an opportunity for vladimir putin to stay on as head of state , " said pawel astachow , one of the movement 's 600 founding members . and his group is not alone . ever since putin put himself forward as the leading candidate of the united russia party for december 's parliamentary elections , the country has seen the emergence of dozens of groups supporting his bid to remain in power . although under the russian constitution putin can not run for a third term as president , there is nothing to stop him standing for the office of prime minister . putin 's " moral right " to rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenty of russians are " for putin , " just as this massive poster reads falk bomsdorf , head of the moscow office of germany 's liberal friedrich naumann foundation , said the actual election campaigns have been completely overshadowed by the pro-putin demonstrations . " we can no longer talk in terms of a parliamentary election , " he said . " there are no parties putting forward their agendas , no political debates and no alternatives . " thus far there has been no mention of a united russia party program , but that , say critics , is because putin is the program . as the president said earlier this week , a clear win on dec .
2 would give him the " moral right " to determine the path of russian politics even after his term runs out in 2008 . " if the people vote for united russia , it means a clear majority of the people put their trust in me , " putin said . he added that such a display of support would give him the moral right to hold those in the duma and the cabinet responsible for the implementation of the tasks that have already been set .
putin did not explain how he would maintain his grip on power , but said there were " various possibilities . " no european election observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce sent 400 observers to the last duma election the way the election is shaping out , it is set to become a referendum for the president , bomsdorf said . " the kremlin is doing everything it can to prevent proper elections , " he said .
" in my opinion , that is illegal . " on friday , europe 's main elections watchdog , the osce , announced it was calling off its observer mission for the december ballot , on the grounds that moscow has been uncooperative . in a statement , the organization for security and cooperation in europe said that the russian authorities remained unwilling to receive observers in a timely and cooperative manner and cooperate fully with them . the russian foreign ministry said the osce had " invented references to alleged difficulties in obtaining russian visas " in order to cancel its mission .
the european organization , which was originally invited on oct .
31 to send just 70 observers to watch the election - 330 less than for the russian duma election , applied for the visas on nov .
2 , according to german press reports . " it is abundantly clear that the russian election commission does not want any witnesses for their brilliant electoral preparations , " alexander konovalov , head of the institute for strategic studies told the russian nowyje iswestija newspaper . no real alternatives to untied russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin remains popular among large parts of the population moscow has shrugged off criticism that the upcoming vote is being stage-managed to ensure a landslide victory for the ruling united russia party , and meanwhile the well-oiled wheels of putin 's promotional apparatus continue to turn .
television advertisements talk about " russia 's economic well-being " and " putin 's plan , " and the president 's supporters march the streets in the name of promoting putin . thomas kunze , who until recently ran a branch of germany 's konrad-adenauer foundation in moscow , said the russian public genuinely thinks putin is doing a good job . " the middle class has experienced an improved standard of living under putin , and the economic moguls value the stability which putin has brought to russia , " he said . were he allowed to run for a third term as president , putin would currently be in line for between 60 percent and 70 percent of the vote .
with that in mind , the pro-putin campaigns seem unnecessary , but bomsdorf said their aim is not to advertise for putin but to inspire the apathetic russian public to the ballot box . " russians do n't bother with elections , and why should they if there are n't any real alternatives , " he said . manfred götzke -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chinese finance ministry cancelled a scheduled meeting with german finance minister peer steinbrück in beijing . despite having the meeting with china 's finance minister arranged for some time as part of his trip to the far east from dec .
1-8 , steinbrück was told that , due to the " very busy schedule of the new chinese finance minister , " xie xuren would have no time to see him .
the german foreign ministry said steinbrück 's trip to china would be rescheduled for the second quarter of next year and that the far east trip , during which he was also scheduled to visit tokyo and seoul , had been cancelled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück has canceled his entire far east trip it is the latest in a series of high-level meetings with german officials that the chinese have delayed or cancelled since chancellor angela merkel held a private meeting with the dalai lama on sept .
29 .
china vigorously protested the tibetan leader 's visit beforehand and reacted sharply afterwards by cutting contact with german officials .
dalia lama visit leads to cooling of relations beijing had previously pulled out of a planned meeting in october of world powers on the iranian nuclear crisis in berlin , forcing its cancellation .
china also axed an annual event scheduled for december in beijing to discuss human rights and called off a germany-china symposium scheduled for late september in munich , citing " technical reasons . "
a chinese foreign ministry spokesman last week said germany bore the responsibility to rectify " the negative impact of its erroneous act . "
china views the dalai lama as a dangerous separatist agitating for independence for tibet and has made clear its disapproval of any world leader holding an audience with him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " dangerous separatist " was welcomed in washington last month , the dalai lama met with us president george w. bush in washington , where the us congress gave him the congressional gold medal - its highest civilian award .
china issued similar threats of damaged ties with australia after prime minister john howard met with the dalai lama in june .
but chinese president hu jintao then travelled to australia , a visit that saw the two nations sign lucrative trade deals .
however , china 's ties with germany appear to have suffered the most .
in addition to the visit of the dalai lama , germany and china have been at odds over allegations of cyber espionage by hackers allegedly in the employ of the people 's republic .
there have also been spats over trade standards and criticism from germany on china 's human rights and environmental record . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we see an opportunity for vladimir putin to stay on as head of state , " said pawel astachow , one of the movement 's 600 founding members . and his group is not alone . ever since putin put himself forward as the leading candidate of the united russia party for december 's parliamentary elections , the country has seen the emergence of dozens of groups supporting his bid to remain in power . although under the russian constitution putin can not run for a third term as president , there is nothing to stop him standing for the office of prime minister . putin 's " moral right " to rule bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenty of russians are " for putin , " just as this massive poster reads falk bomsdorf , head of the moscow office of germany 's liberal friedrich naumann foundation , said the actual election campaigns have been completely overshadowed by the pro-putin demonstrations . " we can no longer talk in terms of a parliamentary election , " he said . " there are no parties putting forward their agendas , no political debates and no alternatives . " thus far there has been no mention of a united russia party program , but that , say critics , is because putin is the program . as the president said earlier this week , a clear win on dec .
2 would give him the " moral right " to determine the path of russian politics even after his term runs out in 2008 . " if the people vote for united russia , it means a clear majority of the people put their trust in me , " putin said . he added that such a display of support would give him the moral right to hold those in the duma and the cabinet responsible for the implementation of the tasks that have already been set .
putin did not explain how he would maintain his grip on power , but said there were " various possibilities . " no european election observers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the osce sent 400 observers to the last duma election the way the election is shaping out , it is set to become a referendum for the president , bomsdorf said . " the kremlin is doing everything it can to prevent proper elections , " he said .
" in my opinion , that is illegal . " on friday , europe 's main elections watchdog , the osce , announced it was calling off its observer mission for the december ballot , on the grounds that moscow has been uncooperative . in a statement , the organization for security and cooperation in europe said that the russian authorities remained unwilling to receive observers in a timely and cooperative manner and cooperate fully with them . the russian foreign ministry said the osce had " invented references to alleged difficulties in obtaining russian visas " in order to cancel its mission .
the european organization , which was originally invited on oct .
31 to send just 70 observers to watch the election - 330 less than for the russian duma election , applied for the visas on nov .
2 , according to german press reports . " it is abundantly clear that the russian election commission does not want any witnesses for their brilliant electoral preparations , " alexander konovalov , head of the institute for strategic studies told the russian nowyje iswestija newspaper . no real alternatives to untied russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin remains popular among large parts of the population moscow has shrugged off criticism that the upcoming vote is being stage-managed to ensure a landslide victory for the ruling united russia party , and meanwhile the well-oiled wheels of putin 's promotional apparatus continue to turn .
television advertisements talk about " russia 's economic well-being " and " putin 's plan , " and the president 's supporters march the streets in the name of promoting putin . thomas kunze , who until recently ran a branch of germany 's konrad-adenauer foundation in moscow , said the russian public genuinely thinks putin is doing a good job . " the middle class has experienced an improved standard of living under putin , and the economic moguls value the stability which putin has brought to russia , " he said . were he allowed to run for a third term as president , putin would currently be in line for between 60 percent and 70 percent of the vote .
with that in mind , the pro-putin campaigns seem unnecessary , but bomsdorf said their aim is not to advertise for putin but to inspire the apathetic russian public to the ballot box . " russians do n't bother with elections , and why should they if there are n't any real alternatives , " he said . manfred götzke -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

varieties of vegetables and cereals not on the list can ’ t legally be sold by professional farmers .
but some biodiversity activists argue the official seed catalogue reduces the number of fruit and vegetable varieties available to the french consumer and restricts biodiversity .
an association of farming militants is fighting to keep older plant varieties in circulation and alive .
they do this by illegally selling and planting unofficial seeds .
they say only this will preserve food biodiversity and heirloom varieties of vegetables and grains .

but the unity of the security council is wearing thin and the international front against iran could begin to split , with russia and china becoming increasingly unwilling to take significant steps .
the un 's watchdog agency indicated that while iran was being more co-operative about explaining its past activities - including an admission that it went onto the black market to get uranium enrichment technology - it is still defying the security council in its present ones , principally enrichment .
iran says that it intends to make nuclear power not a nuclear bomb .
the path will probably lead to the security council in new york it has also failed to stop construction of a heavy water reactor , as required by the council .
nor has it implemented a more intrusive inspection system to which it had earlier agreed .
the iaea reported that iran had installed 2952 centrifuges , the machines that do the enriching .
the 3000 figure is said to be a " red line " by some observers , after which it would be easy for iran to enrich enough uranium to make a bomb within a year or so .
however , the enrichment plant at natanz is under iaea inspection and it would be impossible for iran to do this secretly .
if it did so publicly , it would have leave or defy the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and expose itself to potentially serious consequences .
the iaea report was to be considered by the five permanent members of the security council - the us , russia , china , britain and france - plus germany on monday , but china has not agreed to this date .
the iaea board meets on 22 november .
the eu 's foreign policy representative javier solana is also expected to meet the iranians again soon .
sanctions path after all these meetings , the path will probably lead to the security council in new york where the us , the uk and france will propose a third round of sanctions on iran .
iran says its nuclear programme is only for peaceful purposes the question then will be whether russia and china will agree , and the answer at the moment must be that it is doubtful .
russia has recently declared that there is no evidence that iran is building a nuclear weapon and china is , according to a senior british official , reluctant to act if its economic relations with iran might be affected .
these would be hit if the council sought to restrict investment in iran 's oil and gas .
china already has extensive contracts with iran in those fields .
if the security council is deadlocked , then the eu , pressed by britain and france , could impose sanctions of its own .
these sanctions could , as the british prime minister gordon brown has proposed , involve the banning of investment in oil and gas , and financial measures - mainly the restriction of export credits for exports to iran .
the united states already imposes wide-ranging sanctions of its own .
military option the further question beyond sanctions is whether the us will seriously consider an attack on iran 's nuclear facilities and / or other targets , mainly the revolutionary guards .
israel is getting increasingly restless about the failure of sanctions to effect a change of direction by iran and is likely to press washington for action at some stage .
however , the us appears reluctant at present to commit itself and admiral william fallon , the head of us central command , said the other day that a strike on iran was not " in the offing " .

but the unity of the security council is wearing thin and the international front against iran could begin to split , with russia and china becoming increasingly unwilling to take significant steps .
the un 's watchdog agency indicated that while iran was being more co-operative about explaining its past activities - including an admission that it went onto the black market to get uranium enrichment technology - it is still defying the security council in its present ones , principally enrichment .
iran says that it intends to make nuclear power not a nuclear bomb .
the path will probably lead to the security council in new york it has also failed to stop construction of a heavy water reactor , as required by the council .
nor has it implemented a more intrusive inspection system to which it had earlier agreed .
the iaea reported that iran had installed 2952 centrifuges , the machines that do the enriching .
the 3000 figure is said to be a " red line " by some observers , after which it would be easy for iran to enrich enough uranium to make a bomb within a year or so .
however , the enrichment plant at natanz is under iaea inspection and it would be impossible for iran to do this secretly .
if it did so publicly , it would have leave or defy the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and expose itself to potentially serious consequences .
the iaea report was to be considered by the five permanent members of the security council - the us , russia , china , britain and france - plus germany on monday , but china has not agreed to this date .
the iaea board meets on 22 november .
the eu 's foreign policy representative javier solana is also expected to meet the iranians again soon .
sanctions path after all these meetings , the path will probably lead to the security council in new york where the us , the uk and france will propose a third round of sanctions on iran .
iran says its nuclear programme is only for peaceful purposes the question then will be whether russia and china will agree , and the answer at the moment must be that it is doubtful .
russia has recently declared that there is no evidence that iran is building a nuclear weapon and china is , according to a senior british official , reluctant to act if its economic relations with iran might be affected .
these would be hit if the council sought to restrict investment in iran 's oil and gas .
china already has extensive contracts with iran in those fields .
if the security council is deadlocked , then the eu , pressed by britain and france , could impose sanctions of its own .
these sanctions could , as the british prime minister gordon brown has proposed , involve the banning of investment in oil and gas , and financial measures - mainly the restriction of export credits for exports to iran .
the united states already imposes wide-ranging sanctions of its own .
military option the further question beyond sanctions is whether the us will seriously consider an attack on iran 's nuclear facilities and / or other targets , mainly the revolutionary guards .
israel is getting increasingly restless about the failure of sanctions to effect a change of direction by iran and is likely to press washington for action at some stage .
however , the us appears reluctant at present to commit itself and admiral william fallon , the head of us central command , said the other day that a strike on iran was not " in the offing " .

critics claimed the turbines proposed near llanfihangel glyn myfyr would have ruined views and had a negative impact on wildlife and tourism .
but the council also received 47 letters from local residents backing the proposals .
the 100m -lrb- 328ft -rrb- turbines at mwdwl eithin would each have generated up to 2.5 megawatts .
nuon , the dutch firm behind the plans , altered their application after objections were raised in september .
originally 13 turbines were planned for the nant bach wind turbine power station but nuon had agreed to remove one from its plans altogether and alter the location of another to a less sensitive heath land habitat .
objections it also agreed to create a footpath around the station to replace one of those affected by the proposed scheme and said it would come up with a habitat management plan .
however , on wednesday council officers advised the committee to refuse planning permission because only some of the reservations highlighted in september had been addressed in their alterations .
a number of organisations and individuals objected to the scheme including community councils , the ramblers association , the british horse society and the all wales energy group .
their objections included doubts over the value , reliability and efficiency of energy produced by wind turbines ; concerns over how it might affect views in the area and a possible negative impact on local businesses and property value .
one campaigner , david insall , claimed mwdwl eithin was foraging ground for the red kite bird of prey , and also that construction of the turbines would threaten a nearby badger set .
but barbara owsianka , senior countryside officer said there was no evidence that the potential nesting grounds of red kites would be disturbed by the wind turbines .
investment in a letter to the council she added that if the application were refused on the grounds that red kites were seen foraging in the area " then much wind turbine development in wales would have to be refused " .
ms owsianka did however recommend that the plans be refused on the grounds that it would have an adverse ecological impact on the area .
letters from local residents backing the proposals argued that the power station would produce clean , renewable energy and result in investment in the local economy .
nuon were asked for their comments but have yet to reply .

on thursday , the two firms had raised the value of their bid approach from 720p per share , but it was rejected .
edinburgh-based s & n , whose brands include newcastle brown ale , accused the two of trying to buy the business " on the cheap " .
the suitors said they believed s & n had misunderstood their intentions .
' misunderstanding ' denmark 's carlsberg and dutch brewer heineken hit back at s & n over the " tone and speed " of its response , in a statement to the london stock exchange .
s & n , which also owns the fosters brand , had called the bidders ' approach " highly conditional " on full due diligence , adding it had no hesitation in rejecting the offer , which it described as " wholly inadequate " .
but the two suitors said that this description of their increased offer " stems from a misunderstanding " .
the two firms argued that the focus of their due diligence would be on s & n 's west european assets and " our key separation assumptions " .
they demanded to meet with s & n 's board to clarify their " limited requirements " .
carlsberg boss jorgen buhl rasmussen said : " we find the board 's intransigence and ill-informed rejection very disappointing .
" the time has come for s & n shareholders to direct their board to engage with us . " '
key asset carlsberg and heineken plan to split up s & n if their bid is successful .
heineken would take control of s & n 's main business in the uk and some other european markets , while carlsberg would take over the operations in france and greece .
carlsberg would also gain full control of russia-based brewer baltic beverages holdings -lrb- bbh -rrb- , which is currently jointly owned by it and s & n. bbh is seen as one of s & n 's key assets , as it controls more than 85 % of baltika , russia 's biggest brewer .

on thursday , the two firms had raised the value of their bid approach from 720p per share , but it was rejected .
edinburgh-based s & n , whose brands include newcastle brown ale , accused the two of trying to buy the business " on the cheap " .
the suitors said they believed s & n had misunderstood their intentions .
' misunderstanding ' denmark 's carlsberg and dutch brewer heineken hit back at s & n over the " tone and speed " of its response , in a statement to the london stock exchange .
s & n , which also owns the fosters brand , had called the bidders ' approach " highly conditional " on full due diligence , adding it had no hesitation in rejecting the offer , which it described as " wholly inadequate " .
but the two suitors said that this description of their increased offer " stems from a misunderstanding " .
the two firms argued that the focus of their due diligence would be on s & n 's west european assets and " our key separation assumptions " .
they demanded to meet with s & n 's board to clarify their " limited requirements " .
carlsberg boss jorgen buhl rasmussen said : " we find the board 's intransigence and ill-informed rejection very disappointing .
" the time has come for s & n shareholders to direct their board to engage with us . " '
key asset carlsberg and heineken plan to split up s & n if their bid is successful .
heineken would take control of s & n 's main business in the uk and some other european markets , while carlsberg would take over the operations in france and greece .
carlsberg would also gain full control of russia-based brewer baltic beverages holdings -lrb- bbh -rrb- , which is currently jointly owned by it and s & n. bbh is seen as one of s & n 's key assets , as it controls more than 85 % of baltika , russia 's biggest brewer .

the cast boasts some of britain 's best-loved and most experienced actresses , including dame judi dench , dame eileen atkins , imelda staunton and francesca annis .
compared with jane austen or charles dickens , gaskell is a relatively unexplored writer when it comes to tv adaptations .
her novel cranford was not thought meaty enough to make a serial , so has been amalgamated with elements of three of the author 's other works to make this five-part drama .
cranford also took more than five years from conception to final cut , going through several rewrites along the way - and a change of director .
imelda staunton 's gossip miss pole takes herself very seriously the resulting drama follows a year in the life of the close-knit , mainly female-populated cheshire village of cranford , based on gaskell 's childhood home of knutsford , in the early 1840s .
the cranford ladies are mostly concerned with small , often comic absurdities , such as social etiquette and village gossip .
but these women - called the amazons by gaskell - are not to be underestimated .
made of strong stuff , they also deal stoically with the tragedies of life .
far more threatening are the looming changes of the industrial revolution , symbolised by the encroachment of the railway from manchester .
' concisely adapted ' dame judi plays gentle spinster miss matty jenkyns , who lives with her elder sister miss deborah , the matron of social correctness , played by dame eileen .
dame judi says she signed up long before filming got under way after reading the script .
it does n't matter whether you are wearing corsets or are in baggy jeans , as long as you can make that person real dame judi dench " from what i understood of mrs gaskell - i 'd read cranford at school - i could never have imagined it to have been so concisely adapted and the people are real , " she says .
" you can only really go by that when choosing a part .
can i understand this person and why they say it ?
" it does n't matter whether you are wearing corsets or are in baggy jeans - as long as you can somehow think that you can make that person real . "
dame judi says she was delighted to find herself among old friends and colleagues , such as dame eileen and annis .
it ended up being a very nurturing and cosy environment - they played a lot of games and got quite silly actor simon woods on his co-stars her daughter also had a part in the drama , as did staunton 's husband and daughter .
many of the cast - 47 in total - worked together every day , adding to the sense of community .
" it was like working on the film mrs brown where we were all working together a lot of the time like in a theatre company , " says dame judi .
gaskell 's cranford novel is written in incident-led episodes , rather like modern-day soap opera .
but the fear of change , present to some extent in all of the books used , is a unifying theme .
and insatiable village gossip miss pole , played by staunton , also proves vital as she rushes from one event to the next .
" she 's very nosey and vain , but she really means what she says and takes her role very seriously , " says staunton , whose character also gives the drama much comedy .
staunton says it was refreshing to have lead characters with a certain maturity .
francesca annis 's lady ludlow can not let go of the past " judi , eileen , francesca and myself , we 're not 19 and having to look a certain way so the main job of the audience is to listen to what we are saying . "
as well as the indomitable cranford ladies , there are men to be found .
michael gambon and greg wise , among others , play leading roles .
simon woods plays the young doctor harrison , newly arrived from manchester and trained in all the latest techniques .
woods says initial nerves over working with " all these grand ladies " soon disappeared .
" it ended up being a very nurturing and cosy environment , " he says .
" they played a lot of games and got quite silly . "
the doctor 's polar opposite in the story is the staunchly traditional aristocrat lady ludlow , played by annis .
" lady ludlow goes through a journey towards change , " annis says .
" it 's a coming to terms with it .
at the beginning , she is definitely resisting .
she is an old benign feudalist . "
the project is political without being " in your face " , the actress explains .
" the industrial revolution was coming , the corn laws and the resistance to the railway - and that mobility would change everything for everyone . "
cranford begins on bbc one on 18 november at 2100 gmt .

the cast boasts some of britain 's best-loved and most experienced actresses , including dame judi dench , dame eileen atkins , imelda staunton and francesca annis .
compared with jane austen or charles dickens , gaskell is a relatively unexplored writer when it comes to tv adaptations .
her novel cranford was not thought meaty enough to make a serial , so has been amalgamated with elements of three of the author 's other works to make this five-part drama .
cranford also took more than five years from conception to final cut , going through several rewrites along the way - and a change of director .
imelda staunton 's gossip miss pole takes herself very seriously the resulting drama follows a year in the life of the close-knit , mainly female-populated cheshire village of cranford , based on gaskell 's childhood home of knutsford , in the early 1840s .
the cranford ladies are mostly concerned with small , often comic absurdities , such as social etiquette and village gossip .
but these women - called the amazons by gaskell - are not to be underestimated .
made of strong stuff , they also deal stoically with the tragedies of life .
far more threatening are the looming changes of the industrial revolution , symbolised by the encroachment of the railway from manchester .
' concisely adapted ' dame judi plays gentle spinster miss matty jenkyns , who lives with her elder sister miss deborah , the matron of social correctness , played by dame eileen .
dame judi says she signed up long before filming got under way after reading the script .
it does n't matter whether you are wearing corsets or are in baggy jeans , as long as you can make that person real dame judi dench " from what i understood of mrs gaskell - i 'd read cranford at school - i could never have imagined it to have been so concisely adapted and the people are real , " she says .
" you can only really go by that when choosing a part .
can i understand this person and why they say it ?
" it does n't matter whether you are wearing corsets or are in baggy jeans - as long as you can somehow think that you can make that person real . "
dame judi says she was delighted to find herself among old friends and colleagues , such as dame eileen and annis .
it ended up being a very nurturing and cosy environment - they played a lot of games and got quite silly actor simon woods on his co-stars her daughter also had a part in the drama , as did staunton 's husband and daughter .
many of the cast - 47 in total - worked together every day , adding to the sense of community .
" it was like working on the film mrs brown where we were all working together a lot of the time like in a theatre company , " says dame judi .
gaskell 's cranford novel is written in incident-led episodes , rather like modern-day soap opera .
but the fear of change , present to some extent in all of the books used , is a unifying theme .
and insatiable village gossip miss pole , played by staunton , also proves vital as she rushes from one event to the next .
" she 's very nosey and vain , but she really means what she says and takes her role very seriously , " says staunton , whose character also gives the drama much comedy .
staunton says it was refreshing to have lead characters with a certain maturity .
francesca annis 's lady ludlow can not let go of the past " judi , eileen , francesca and myself , we 're not 19 and having to look a certain way so the main job of the audience is to listen to what we are saying . "
as well as the indomitable cranford ladies , there are men to be found .
michael gambon and greg wise , among others , play leading roles .
simon woods plays the young doctor harrison , newly arrived from manchester and trained in all the latest techniques .
woods says initial nerves over working with " all these grand ladies " soon disappeared .
" it ended up being a very nurturing and cosy environment , " he says .
" they played a lot of games and got quite silly . "
the doctor 's polar opposite in the story is the staunchly traditional aristocrat lady ludlow , played by annis .
" lady ludlow goes through a journey towards change , " annis says .
" it 's a coming to terms with it .
at the beginning , she is definitely resisting .
she is an old benign feudalist . "
the project is political without being " in your face " , the actress explains .
" the industrial revolution was coming , the corn laws and the resistance to the railway - and that mobility would change everything for everyone . "
cranford begins on bbc one on 18 november at 2100 gmt .

the vast majority of games are still played on pcs rather than consoles ; typically casual games played on cheap desktop machines or online games , such as world of warcraft .
the industry is currently experiencing a renaissance in innovation as the trinity of new hardware , developer ambition and tools come together to improve experiences .
the introduction of chip technology with four cores , effectively quadrupling processing power , graphics cards using directx 10 tools and developers keen to push powerful machines to the limit are resulting in games which set new graphical benchmarks .
in some cases these machines are desktop behemoths ; near supercomputers in a box that are delivering game experiences beyond the wildest dreams of console owners .
the latest games , like crysis and unreal tournament 3 , are taking advantage of quad core processors , and twin graphics cards .
these are the play things of hotrod pc gamers - the enthusiasts who see their machines as customisable dragsters delivering the pinnacle of performance . "
high end games pcs are important to the professional players " michael o 'dell " pc gamers see themselves as the elite gamers , " said michael o 'dell , who runs the professional gaming group team dignitas and manages birmingham salvo , a team in the championship gaming series .
" high end games pcs are important to the professional players and hard core because the extra processing power can make that millisecond of difference between success and failure , and whether you win prize money or not . "
for the hardcore the extra grunt of the most powerful desktops improve the fps -lrb- frames per second -rrb- in fps -lrb- first person shooter -rrb- games .
" my gamers are always moaning about their fps -lrb- frames per second -rrb- .
they always want more and some of the newest games are very demanding on the hardware . "
for these gamers , whose reaction times put them in the superhuman category , more frames per second means a smoother experience .
so how much more powerful are these high-end pcs than the latest generation of consoles ?
" it 's absolute nonsense to think that consoles are at the cutting edge , " said roy taylor , vice president of content relations at nvidia , the world 's biggest manufacturer of graphics cards .
" as good as consoles are , they are so far behind the pc gaming experience that there is no comparison .
" in terms of raw processing power , the high-end pcs are at least three times more powerful . "
nvidia provides the graphics grunt for the playstation 3 , while rival ati provides the imaging hardware for the xbox 360 .
mr taylor points out that the latest graphics cards can draw twice as many pixels , twice the screen resolution , as a playstation 3 or xbox 360 .
the latest games are employing directx 10 tools developed by microsoft , which are used by developers to get the best out of the high-end and middle-range graphics cards .
mr taylor said the new tools and the new hardware had given developers a library of effects to play with .
nvidia 's latest high-end graphics cards , the 8800 series , can easily produce graphical effects that tax the xbox 360 and playstation 3 , such as motion blur , depth of field and volumetric smoke .
mr taylor said : " fog , smoke or mist in games until now have been flat and do n't respond to objects .
volumetric effects mean they are dynamic - a helicopter can now displace cloud or smoke , or a character can step through the fog realistically . "
but these sorts of effects come at a price .
a quadcore intel machine with twin graphics cards and four gigabytes of ram - at the high end of the pc gaming experience - can cost more than £ 2,000 , six times the price of an xbox 360 .
nvidia 's flagship graphics card , the 8800 ultra , costs more than £ 400 although a cut-down version , the 8800 gt , costs from £ 120 , about the same price as a nintendo wii .
rival ati also sends a high-end graphics card which supports directx 10 , costing from about £ 120 .
hardcore pc gamers also specialise in customising their " rigs " , with unique cases and intricate cooling systems .
the gaming experience they deliver can be exceptional .
playing crysis with the screen resolution set at 1920x1200 with all effects switched up to very high and anti-aliasing turned on , the game is breathtaking to look at and puts consoles titles like gears of war and call of duty 4 into the shade .
" we worked really closely with intel and nvidia and even had engineers from nvidia on site for the last year , " said bernd diemer , a producer on crysis at developers crytek .
" we wanted to be an early adopter .
when we started crysis the current hardware was n't available or being planned .
there was no dx10 or the latest graphic cards .
they were not even on the drawing board . "
they went to a special effects company in hollywood to create a render movie of how crysis could look - and that movie has been the benchmark for the firm .
" we got pretty close .
in some areas we even surpassed it , " said mr diemer .
he said pcs gave gamers the " best possible experience " .
crysis boasts realistic breakable environments - a goal of developers for many years .
" in some areas we have managed to set a new standard .
we 've managed to push it a bit further , " he said .
crysis is at the forefront of a wave that is delivering blockbuster titles to pcs and making console owners envious of their pc gaming friends .
" the pc is finally back up where it belongs , " said mr diemer .
he added : " the innovation is happening on the pc ; but that 's always been the case . "

unreal tournament 3 will help hardware sales " in terms of raw processing power , the high-end pcs are at least three times more powerful . "
nvidia provides the graphics grunt for the playstation 3 , while rival ati provides the imaging hardware for the xbox 360 .
mr taylor points out that the latest graphics cards can draw twice as many pixels , twice the screen resolution , as a playstation 3 or xbox 360 .
the latest games are employing directx 10 tools developed by microsoft , which are used by developers to get the best out of the high-end and middle-range graphics cards .
mr taylor said the new tools and the new hardware had given developers a library of effects to play with .
nvidia 's latest high-end graphics cards , the 8800 series , can easily produce graphical effects that tax the xbox 360 and playstation 3 , such as motion blur , depth of field and volumetric smoke .
mr taylor said : " fog , smoke or mist in games until now have been flat and do n't respond to objects .
volumetric effects mean they are dynamic - a helicopter can now displace cloud or smoke , or a character can step through the fog realistically . "
but these sorts of effects come at a price .
a quadcore intel machine with twin graphics cards and four gigabytes of ram - at the high end of the pc gaming experience - can cost more than £ 2,000 , six times the price of an xbox 360 .
nvidia 's flagship graphics card , the 8800 ultra , costs more than £ 400 although a cut-down version , the 8800 gt , costs from £ 120 , about the same price as a nintendo wii .
rival ati also sends a high-end graphics card which supports directx 10 , costing from about £ 120 .
pc gamers love to " mod " their machines hardcore pc gamers also specialise in customising their " rigs " , with unique cases and intricate cooling systems .
the gaming experience they deliver can be exceptional .
playing crysis with the screen resolution set at 1920x1200 with all effects switched up to very high and anti-aliasing turned on , the game is breathtaking to look at and puts consoles titles like gears of war and call of duty 4 into the shade .
" we worked really closely with intel and nvidia and even had engineers from nvidia on site for the last year , " said bernd diemer , a producer on crysis at developers crytek .
" we wanted to be an early adopter .
when we started crysis the current hardware was n't available or being planned .
there was no dx10 or the latest graphic cards .
they were not even on the drawing board . "
they went to a special effects company in hollywood to create a render movie of how crysis could look - and that movie has been the benchmark for the firm .
" we got pretty close .
in some areas we even surpassed it , " said mr diemer .
he said pcs gave gamers the " best possible experience " .
crysis boasts realistic breakable environments - a goal of developers for many years .
" in some areas we have managed to set a new standard .
we 've managed to push it a bit further , " he said .
crysis is at the forefront of a wave that is delivering blockbuster titles to pcs and making console owners envious of their pc gaming friends .
" the pc is finally back up where it belongs , " said mr diemer .
he added : " the innovation is happening on the pc ; but that 's always been the case . "

the vast majority of games are still played on pcs rather than consoles ; typically casual games played on cheap desktop machines or online games , such as world of warcraft .
the industry is currently experiencing a renaissance in innovation as the trinity of new hardware , developer ambition and tools come together to improve experiences .
the introduction of chip technology with four cores , effectively quadrupling processing power , graphics cards using directx 10 tools and developers keen to push powerful machines to the limit are resulting in games which set new graphical benchmarks .
in some cases these machines are desktop behemoths ; near supercomputers in a box that are delivering game experiences beyond the wildest dreams of console owners .
the latest games , like crysis and unreal tournament 3 , are taking advantage of quad core processors , and twin graphics cards .
these are the play things of hotrod pc gamers - the enthusiasts who see their machines as customisable dragsters delivering the pinnacle of performance .
high end games pcs are important to the professional players michael o 'dell " pc gamers see themselves as the elite gamers , " said michael o 'dell , who runs the professional gaming group team dignitas and manages birmingham salvo , a team in the championship gaming series .
" high end games pcs are important to the professional players and hard core because the extra processing power can make that millisecond of difference between success and failure , and whether you win prize money or not . "
for the hardcore the extra grunt of the most powerful desktops improve the fps -lrb- frames per second -rrb- in fps -lrb- first person shooter -rrb- games .
" my gamers are always moaning about their fps -lrb- frames per second -rrb- .
they always want more and some of the newest games are very demanding on the hardware . "
for these gamers , whose reaction times put them in the superhuman category , more frames per second means a smoother experience .
so how much more powerful are these high-end pcs than the latest generation of consoles ?
" it 's absolute nonsense to think that consoles are at the cutting edge , " said roy taylor , vice president of content relations at nvidia , the world 's biggest manufacturer of graphics cards .
" as good as consoles are , they are so far behind the pc gaming experience that there is no comparison .
unreal tournament 3 will help hardware sales " in terms of raw processing power , the high-end pcs are at least three times more powerful . "
nvidia provides the graphics grunt for the playstation 3 , while rival ati provides the imaging hardware for the xbox 360 .
mr taylor points out that the latest graphics cards can draw twice as many pixels , twice the screen resolution , as a playstation 3 or xbox 360 .
the latest games are employing directx 10 tools developed by microsoft , which are used by developers to get the best out of the high-end and middle-range graphics cards .
mr taylor said the new tools and the new hardware had given developers a library of effects to play with .
nvidia 's latest high-end graphics cards , the 8800 series , can easily produce graphical effects that tax the xbox 360 and playstation 3 , such as motion blur , depth of field and volumetric smoke .
mr taylor said : " fog , smoke or mist in games until now have been flat and do n't respond to objects .
volumetric effects mean they are dynamic - a helicopter can now displace cloud or smoke , or a character can step through the fog realistically . "
but these sorts of effects come at a price .
a quadcore intel machine with twin graphics cards and four gigabytes of ram - at the high end of the pc gaming experience - can cost more than £ 2,000 , six times the price of an xbox 360 .
nvidia 's flagship graphics card , the 8800 ultra , costs more than £ 400 although a cut-down version , the 8800 gt , costs from £ 120 , about the same price as a nintendo wii .
rival ati also sends a high-end graphics card which supports directx 10 , costing from about £ 120 .
pc gamers love to " mod " their machines hardcore pc gamers also specialise in customising their " rigs " , with unique cases and intricate cooling systems .
the gaming experience they deliver can be exceptional .
playing crysis with the screen resolution set at 1920x1200 with all effects switched up to very high and anti-aliasing turned on , the game is breathtaking to look at and puts consoles titles like gears of war and call of duty 4 into the shade .
" we worked really closely with intel and nvidia and even had engineers from nvidia on site for the last year , " said bernd diemer , a producer on crysis at developers crytek .
" we wanted to be an early adopter .
when we started crysis the current hardware was n't available or being planned .
there was no dx10 or the latest graphic cards .
they were not even on the drawing board . "
they went to a special effects company in hollywood to create a render movie of how crysis could look - and that movie has been the benchmark for the firm .

bbc news -pipe- europe -pipe- viewpoints : russian elections bbc news / europe graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- friday , 16 november 2007 , 09:40 gmt viewpoints : russian elections six russian panellists give their views on how their country has changed under president vladimir putin , ahead of parliamentary elections in december .
the pro-putin united russia party is expected to emerge as the dominant force in the lower chamber of parliament , the duma .
the opposition says the polls will not be fair , as the electoral system has been engineered to boost parties loyal to the president .
though mr putin steps down as president next year , he has indicated he could remain in politics by applying to become prime minister .
the bbc 's artyom liss in moscow has compiled these viewpoints .
click on the links below to read what they have to say .
andrey volozhanin , taxi-firm owner " people pay their taxes and are more honest " marina litvinovich , opposition politician " my nation ... is a nation of people who are scared " konstantin zhilin , designer " suddenly there 's a new feeling of instability " anton goltsman , student " life has improved .
but it has nothing to do with who runs the country " ella usachyova , student " the country was on the edge of a break-up " sergei markov , pro-kremlin analyst " oligarchs have been brought to heel " andrey volozhanin is a taxi company owner who lives in yekaterinburg , the urals over the last four years , my life as a businessman got a lot easier .
compare this with the 1990s - the difference could n't be greater .
there are no more gangs , there is no more racketeering .
people pay their taxes and are more honest as business partners .
and the reason for this is simple : people feel confident .
they know they live in a stable country .
the government is not going to let them down and the rules of the game are not going to change .
there is still one serious problem though - corruption .
it 's overwhelming in the urals .
i 'm sure if president putin knew , he would have done something about it .
but all this is politics , and i 'm not interested in it .
i 've got my own political party - my wife and my daughters .
my only concern is to make sure they are happy .
i have n't yet decided whether i will vote .
i 'm not sure my vote will really matter .
after all , i 'm just one businessman living in a really big country .
there are enough clever people in power without me .
i want them to ensure the country continues along its present course , and things continue to get better .
it does n't matter much who is in power - everything depends on the economics .
as long as oil prices are high , we should be ok .
what should we do next ?
learn from the arabs .
invest oil profits and develop tourism , technology and the entertainment industry .
i really admire what the sheikhs have done to the emirates .
and i dream of moving there one day .
i 'm sure it 'll all happen if i work hard enough .
russia is an easy place to earn money .
a year ago i was just a driver - now i have my own taxi company .
return to top anton goltsman , a student at the moscow economics school politics in russia is dull .
politics on tv is even duller - its full of relentless praise for the president and minor criticism of his bureaucrats .
sometimes , there 's an odd report on how good life in the new russia has become .
do n't get me wrong : life in russia really has improved in the past four years .
but this has nothing to do with who runs the country .
the only achievement of the present government - indeed , of the single person who matters in it , vladimir putin - is that some of the money brought to the county by high oil prices has n't been stolen .
there is some investment and it seems to be paying off .
but the economy would have grown anyway .
the reforms of the 1990s ensured this would happen - it 's just a coincidence that the growth is taking place now .
mr putin 's critics say there 's little or no democracy in russia today .
they might be right .
but russia was falling apart when mr putin came to power .
the country needed a strong leader , and it 's to mr putin 's credit that russia survives as a geographic entity .
he has also achieved another important victory .
russians are now proud to be living in their country , which few people could say in the 1990s .
but the well-being of ordinary people , like my family , has nothing to do with mr putin 's policies .
three years ago i entered university , not because the government helped me out but because i worked hard on my exam papers .
if people want to be successful , to earn good money , to do the jobs they like , it should n't matter to them who sits in the kremlin .
they should be thanking themselves , not the president .
after all , russia is still full of poor people and the president seems to be unable to help them .
return to top marina litvinovich is an opposition politician from moscow i could give you a list of recent changes in russia 's public life - extremism laws are now a lot tougher , party laws have become much stricter , and the word " election " is now little more than an empty shell .
i could also tell you about attacks against the opposition , journalists and human rights activists .
some of them are now in jail , some have been beaten up and even killed .
i 've lost count of all attacks against me .
i was beaten up in a street after i started investigating the beslan tragedy .
i was detained in st petersburg three times , and six times in nizhny novgorod .
i travelled to those cities to set up dissenters ' marches or hold opposition conferences .
my office and my car have been searched on numerous occasions .
i remember being on a st petersburg-moscow train once when the police came after me .
there were three officers guarding our compartment door .
both doors of the carriage were sealed .
even the conductor was screaming : " they 've caught a terrorist ! "
i was escorted off the train by armed police officers , like a criminal .
and what did i do ?
nothing but try to set up a peaceful opposition rally - surely the russian constitution allows that ?
but the constitution is now worth little more than the paper it 's printed on .
the laws have changed .
they are unwritten and undemocratic .
and my nation has changed , too .
it 's now a nation of people who are scared .
people do all they can to distance themselves from politics , to lock themselves up in their " little worlds " of family and friends .
and they are likely to give this regime a new lease of life on 2 december .
the propaganda machine will present the result , whatever it is , as " the unanimous approval of the president 's course " .
i 'm afraid after the election things will only get worse .
but i 'm also sure the number of our supporters is only going to grow .
the russian people are very patient .
but even for them , there is a point of no return .
return to top ella usachyova is a student at the moscow international relations institute mr putin came to power in 2000 when we had a very weak state riddled with serious problems , and political leaders were highly unpopular .
russia was on the edge of a break-up .
people pinned their hopes on a miracle .
but since then , we have witnessed a miracle .
mr putin managed to stabilise the situation .
his second term in office has been marked by the launch of a number of far-reaching political reforms .
as a result , a party of power has emerged .
oligarchs are no longer able to use russia 's resources to their own advantage .
the edifice of " managed democracy " erected in mr putin 's first four years has undergone major renovations .
there have been significant changes in the election law , both federally and locally .
there have also been some changes in russia 's foreign policy .
mr putin 's approach has not marked the beginning of a " new cold war " between the west and russia .
but it has meant that after 15 years of shuffling along as the ruined remnant of the collapsed soviet superpower , russia is returning to the international arena to pursue its own interests .
however , the gist of russia 's strength is shifting from the military potential to natural resources .
within the last three years , russia 's status as an energy superpower has become a means to protect sovereignty and exert influence abroad .
it 's unlikely that the next president will share mr putin 's appeal and popular support .
mr putin has laid down certain grounds for his successor that will be followed in terms of domestic and foreign policy .
return to top konstantin zhilin , a designer who lives in moscow we got lucky when we were starting our business four years ago because the government had just brought in a new , simpler tax code .
and up until very recently , things were going really well .
all our customers - mostly small or medium businesses - seemed to be making good progress .
there was this euphoria about the future .
i 'm now amazed at what some of them have achieved .
but since last august , things seem to have been changing .
people are cutting advertising budgets which makes life difficult for us .
i think suddenly there 's a new feeling of instability .
maybe it 's linked to the election - i do n't know .
one of our customers told me he had a feeling the country 's economic boom simply would not last that long .
look at all these mercedes and porsches out on the streets of moscow .
some people might say they show how rich and powerful russia has become .
but i also see this as a sign of instability .
if you are building a long-term business model , you wo n't be buying porsches - you 'll be investing in your company .
your children and grandchildren will need a solid source of income , not a photograph of you and your sports car .
many people are feeling uneasy - what if the government turns around and decides to nationalise everything ?
so they 're enjoying life while they can .
nobody knows what 's going to happen to them or to the country .
if there is one thing the government should learn , it 's that the business people are not there to rip the country off .
we create jobs , we help people earn their money .
we are building this country .
return to top sergei markov is a pro-kremlin political analyst and united russia member who lives in moscow during his second term in office , mr putin continued along the course he had set for himself and the country when he first came to power .
his main goal has been to restore the power of the russian state , which has now become a major player in the key oil and gas sectors .
this has vastly improved the financial situation in russia .
the north caucasus has been largely pacified .
in chechnya , the new power system has been established , improving the security situation and providing for more human rights .
however , radical islamism still remains a threat - as shown by the beslan tragedy .
economically , russia is moving towards a free-market system - but reforms have been a lot slower than expected .
where once liberalism ruled unrivalled , there is now more belief in the benefits of state involvement .
domestically , oligarchs have been brought to heel .
tycoons like boris berezovsky or mikhail khodorkovsky are no longer as serious a threat to the kremlin as they used to be .
but there are new threats .
the kremlin is facing the danger of " people 's revolutions " , similar to upheavals in georgia and ukraine .
however , in this sphere , too , mr putin seems to be in control .
moscow has been approaching the issue by setting up patriotic youth movements which support mr putin 's policies .
diplomatically , there are now new tensions between russia and the west .
the main cause is washington 's desire to control some of the post-soviet countries , such as ukraine , georgia , azerbaijan and to some extent , kazakhstan and tajikistan .
over the next four years , we are likely to see the trends of 2000-2008 continuing .
the united russia party promises voters it will carry out " putin 's plan " for the country .
this party 's role will be crucial in resolving russia 's key dilemma - whether president putin should leave office , as required by the constitution , or stay on , as most russians want him to .
in this period of transition , the united russia party will serve as a bridge between russia as we know it today - and russia " after putin " .
whoever rules the state after the election will face some unresolved problems , including how to tackle corruption .
their task , ultimately , will be to ensure the transition to a new russia , where stability will be provided not by one person at the top , but by a well-run and well-adjusted system of state institutions .

i 'm sure if president putin knew , he would have done something about it .
but all this is politics , and i 'm not interested in it .
i 've got my own political party - my wife and my daughters .
my only concern is to make sure they are happy .
i have n't yet decided whether i will vote .
i 'm not sure my vote will really matter .
after all , i 'm just one businessman living in a really big country .
there are enough clever people in power without me .
i want them to ensure the country continues along its present course , and things continue to get better .
it does n't matter much who is in power - everything depends on the economics .
as long as oil prices are high , we should be ok .
what should we do next ?
learn from the arabs .
invest oil profits and develop tourism , technology and the entertainment industry .
i really admire what the sheikhs have done to the emirates .
and i dream of moving there one day .
i 'm sure it 'll all happen if i work hard enough .
russia is an easy place to earn money .
a year ago i was just a driver - now i have my own taxi company .
return to top anton goltsman , a student at the moscow economics school politics in russia is dull .
politics on tv is even duller - its full of relentless praise for the president and minor criticism of his bureaucrats .
sometimes , there 's an odd report on how good life in the new russia has become .
mr goltsman says his well-being has nothing to do with mr putin do n't get me wrong : life in russia really has improved in the past four years .
but this has nothing to do with who runs the country .
the only achievement of the present government - indeed , of the single person who matters in it , vladimir putin - is that some of the money brought to the county by high oil prices has n't been stolen .
there is some investment and it seems to be paying off .
but the economy would have grown anyway .
the reforms of the 1990s ensured this would happen - it 's just a coincidence that the growth is taking place now .
mr putin 's critics say there 's little or no democracy in russia today .
they might be right .
but russia was falling apart when mr putin came to power .
the country needed a strong leader , and it 's to mr putin 's credit that russia survives as a geographic entity .
he has also achieved another important victory .
russians are now proud to be living in their country , which few people could say in the 1990s .
but the well-being of ordinary people , like my family , has nothing to do with mr putin 's policies .
three years ago i entered university , not because the government helped me out but because i worked hard on my exam papers .
if people want to be successful , to earn good money , to do the jobs they like , it should n't matter to them who sits in the kremlin .
they should be thanking themselves , not the president .
after all , russia is still full of poor people and the president seems to be unable to help them .
return to top marina litvinovich is an opposition politician from moscow i could give you a list of recent changes in russia 's public life - extremism laws are now a lot tougher , party laws have become much stricter , and the word " election " is now little more than an empty shell .
russia 's laws are unwritten and undemocratic , ms litvinovich argues i could also tell you about attacks against the opposition , journalists and human rights activists .
some of them are now in jail , some have been beaten up and even killed .
i 've lost count of all attacks against me .
i was beaten up in a street after i started investigating the beslan tragedy .
i was detained in st petersburg three times , and six times in nizhny novgorod .
i travelled to those cities to set up dissenters ' marches or hold opposition conferences .
my office and my car have been searched on numerous occasions .
i remember being on a st petersburg-moscow train once when the police came after me .
there were three officers guarding our compartment door .
both doors of the carriage were sealed .
even the conductor was screaming : " they 've caught a terrorist ! "
i was escorted off the train by armed police officers , like a criminal .
and what did i do ?
nothing but try to set up a peaceful opposition rally - surely the russian constitution allows that ?
but the constitution is now worth little more than the paper it 's printed on .
the laws have changed .
they are unwritten and undemocratic .
and my nation has changed , too .
it 's now a nation of people who are scared .
people do all they can to distance themselves from politics , to lock themselves up in their " little worlds " of family and friends .
and they are likely to give this regime a new lease of life on 2 december .
the propaganda machine will present the result , whatever it is , as " the unanimous approval of the president 's course " .
i 'm afraid after the election things will only get worse .
but i 'm also sure the number of our supporters is only going to grow .
the russian people are very patient .
but even for them , there is a point of no return .
return to top ella usachyova is a student at the moscow international relations institute mr putin came to power in 2000 when we had a very weak state riddled with serious problems , and political leaders were highly unpopular .
russia was on the edge of a break-up .
people pinned their hopes on a miracle .
many russians believe that russia is a superpower again but since then , we have witnessed a miracle .
mr putin managed to stabilise the situation .
his second term in office has been marked by the launch of a number of far-reaching political reforms .
as a result , a party of power has emerged .
oligarchs are no longer able to use russia 's resources to their own advantage .
the edifice of " managed democracy " erected in mr putin 's first four years has undergone major renovations .
there have been significant changes in the election law , both federally and locally .
there have also been some changes in russia 's foreign policy .
mr putin 's approach has not marked the beginning of a " new cold war " between the west and russia .
but it has meant that after 15 years of shuffling along as the ruined remnant of the collapsed soviet superpower , russia is returning to the international arena to pursue its own interests .
however , the gist of russia 's strength is shifting from the military potential to natural resources .
within the last three years , russia 's status as an energy superpower has become a means to protect sovereignty and exert influence abroad .
it 's unlikely that the next president will share mr putin 's appeal and popular support .
mr putin has laid down certain grounds for his successor that will be followed in terms of domestic and foreign policy .
return to top konstantin zhilin , a designer who lives in moscow we got lucky when we were starting our business four years ago because the government had just brought in a new , simpler tax code .
and up until very recently , things were going really well .
some businessmen predict uncertain times after the putin era all our customers - mostly small or medium businesses - seemed to be making good progress .
there was this euphoria about the future .
i 'm now amazed at what some of them have achieved .
but since last august , things seem to have been changing .
people are cutting advertising budgets which makes life difficult for us .
i think suddenly there 's a new feeling of instability .
maybe it 's linked to the election - i do n't know .
one of our customers told me he had a feeling the country 's economic boom simply would not last that long .
look at all these mercedes and porsches out on the streets of moscow .
some people might say they show how rich and powerful russia has become .
but i also see this as a sign of instability .
if you are building a long-term business model , you wo n't be buying porsches - you 'll be investing in your company .
your children and grandchildren will need a solid source of income , not a photograph of you and your sports car .
many people are feeling uneasy - what if the government turns around and decides to nationalise everything ?
so they 're enjoying life while they can .
nobody knows what 's going to happen to them or to the country .
if there is one thing the government should learn , it 's that the business people are not there to rip the country off .
we create jobs , we help people earn their money .
we are building this country .
return to top sergei markov is a pro-kremlin political analyst and united russia member who lives in moscow during his second term in office , mr putin continued along the course he had set for himself and the country when he first came to power .
russia is immune from " people 's revolutions " , mr markov argues his main goal has been to restore the power of the russian state , which has now become a major player in the key oil and gas sectors .
this has vastly improved the financial situation in russia .
the north caucasus has been largely pacified .
in chechnya , the new power system has been established , improving the security situation and providing for more human rights .
however , radical islamism still remains a threat - as shown by the beslan tragedy .
economically , russia is moving towards a free-market system - but reforms have been a lot slower than expected .
where once liberalism ruled unrivalled , there is now more belief in the benefits of state involvement .
domestically , oligarchs have been brought to heel .
tycoons like boris berezovsky or mikhail khodorkovsky are no longer as serious a threat to the kremlin as they used to be .
but there are new threats .
the kremlin is facing the danger of " people 's revolutions " , similar to upheavals in georgia and ukraine .
however , in this sphere , too , mr putin seems to be in control .
moscow has been approaching the issue by setting up patriotic youth movements which support mr putin 's policies .
diplomatically , there are now new tensions between russia and the west .
the main cause is washington 's desire to control some of the post-soviet countries , such as ukraine , georgia , azerbaijan and to some extent , kazakhstan and tajikistan .
over the next four years , we are likely to see the trends of 2000-2008 continuing .
the united russia party promises voters it will carry out " putin 's plan " for the country .
this party 's role will be crucial in resolving russia 's key dilemma - whether president putin should leave office , as required by the constitution , or stay on , as most russians want him to .
in this period of transition , the united russia party will serve as a bridge between russia as we know it today - and russia " after putin " .
whoever rules the state after the election will face some unresolved problems , including how to tackle corruption .
their task , ultimately , will be to ensure the transition to a new russia , where stability will be provided not by one person at the top , but by a well-run and well-adjusted system of state institutions .

the pro-putin united russia party is expected to emerge as the dominant force in the lower chamber of parliament , the duma .
the opposition says the polls will not be fair , as the electoral system has been engineered to boost parties loyal to the president .
though mr putin steps down as president next year , he has indicated he could remain in politics by applying to become prime minister .
the bbc 's artyom liss in moscow has compiled these viewpoints .

andrey volozhanin , taxi-firm owner " people pay their taxes and are more honest " marina litvinovich , opposition politician " my nation ... is a nation of people who are scared " konstantin zhilin , designer " suddenly there 's a new feeling of instability " anton goltsman , student " life has improved .

compare this with the 1990s - the difference could n't be greater .
there are no more gangs , there is no more racketeering .
people pay their taxes and are more honest as business partners .
mr volozhanin says russia is now an easy place to make money and the reason for this is simple : people feel confident .
they know they live in a stable country .
the government is not going to let them down and the rules of the game are not going to change .

my office and my car have been searched on numerous occasions .
i remember being on a st petersburg-moscow train once when the police came after me .
there were three officers guarding our compartment door .
both doors of the carriage were sealed .
even the conductor was screaming : " they 've caught a terrorist ! "
i was escorted off the train by armed police officers , like a criminal .
and what did i do ?
nothing but try to set up a peaceful opposition rally - surely the russian constitution allows that ?
but the constitution is now worth little more than the paper it 's printed on .
the laws have changed .
they are unwritten and undemocratic .
and my nation has changed , too .
it 's now a nation of people who are scared .
people do all they can to distance themselves from politics , to lock themselves up in their " little worlds " of family and friends .
and they are likely to give this regime a new lease of life on 2 december .
the propaganda machine will present the result , whatever it is , as " the unanimous approval of the president 's course " .
i 'm afraid after the election things will only get worse .
but i 'm also sure the number of our supporters is only going to grow .
the russian people are very patient .
but even for them , there is a point of no return .
return to top ella usachyova is a student at the moscow international relations institute mr putin came to power in 2000 when we had a very weak state riddled with serious problems , and political leaders were highly unpopular .
russia was on the edge of a break-up .
people pinned their hopes on a miracle .
many russians believe that russia is a superpower again but since then , we have witnessed a miracle .
mr putin managed to stabilise the situation .
his second term in office has been marked by the launch of a number of far-reaching political reforms .
as a result , a party of power has emerged .
oligarchs are no longer able to use russia 's resources to their own advantage .
the edifice of " managed democracy " erected in mr putin 's first four years has undergone major renovations .
there have been significant changes in the election law , both federally and locally .
there have also been some changes in russia 's foreign policy .
mr putin 's approach has not marked the beginning of a " new cold war " between the west and russia .
but it has meant that after 15 years of shuffling along as the ruined remnant of the collapsed soviet superpower , russia is returning to the international arena to pursue its own interests .
however , the gist of russia 's strength is shifting from the military potential to natural resources .
within the last three years , russia 's status as an energy superpower has become a means to protect sovereignty and exert influence abroad .
it 's unlikely that the next president will share mr putin 's appeal and popular support .
mr putin has laid down certain grounds for his successor that will be followed in terms of domestic and foreign policy .
return to top konstantin zhilin , a designer who lives in moscow we got lucky when we were starting our business four years ago because the government had just brought in a new , simpler tax code .
and up until very recently , things were going really well .
some businessmen predict uncertain times after the putin era all our customers - mostly small or medium businesses - seemed to be making good progress .
there was this euphoria about the future .
i 'm now amazed at what some of them have achieved .
but since last august , things seem to have been changing .
people are cutting advertising budgets which makes life difficult for us .
i think suddenly there 's a new feeling of instability .
maybe it 's linked to the election - i do n't know .
one of our customers told me he had a feeling the country 's economic boom simply would not last that long .
look at all these mercedes and porsches out on the streets of moscow .
some people might say they show how rich and powerful russia has become .
but i also see this as a sign of instability .
if you are building a long-term business model , you wo n't be buying porsches - you 'll be investing in your company .
your children and grandchildren will need a solid source of income , not a photograph of you and your sports car .
many people are feeling uneasy - what if the government turns around and decides to nationalise everything ?
so they 're enjoying life while they can .
nobody knows what 's going to happen to them or to the country .
if there is one thing the government should learn , it 's that the business people are not there to rip the country off .
we create jobs , we help people earn their money .
we are building this country .
return to top sergei markov is a pro-kremlin political analyst and united russia member who lives in moscow during his second term in office , mr putin continued along the course he had set for himself and the country when he first came to power .
russia is immune from " people 's revolutions " , mr markov argues his main goal has been to restore the power of the russian state , which has now become a major player in the key oil and gas sectors .
this has vastly improved the financial situation in russia .
the north caucasus has been largely pacified .
in chechnya , the new power system has been established , improving the security situation and providing for more human rights .
however , radical islamism still remains a threat - as shown by the beslan tragedy .
economically , russia is moving towards a free-market system - but reforms have been a lot slower than expected .
where once liberalism ruled unrivalled , there is now more belief in the benefits of state involvement .
domestically , oligarchs have been brought to heel .
tycoons like boris berezovsky or mikhail khodorkovsky are no longer as serious a threat to the kremlin as they used to be .
but there are new threats .
the kremlin is facing the danger of " people 's revolutions " , similar to upheavals in georgia and ukraine .
however , in this sphere , too , mr putin seems to be in control .
moscow has been approaching the issue by setting up patriotic youth movements which support mr putin 's policies .
diplomatically , there are now new tensions between russia and the west .
the main cause is washington 's desire to control some of the post-soviet countries , such as ukraine , georgia , azerbaijan and to some extent , kazakhstan and tajikistan .
over the next four years , we are likely to see the trends of 2000-2008 continuing .
the united russia party promises voters it will carry out " putin 's plan " for the country .
this party 's role will be crucial in resolving russia 's key dilemma - whether president putin should leave office , as required by the constitution , or stay on , as most russians want him to .
in this period of transition , the united russia party will serve as a bridge between russia as we know it today - and russia " after putin " .
whoever rules the state after the election will face some unresolved problems , including how to tackle corruption .
their task , ultimately , will be to ensure the transition to a new russia , where stability will be provided not by one person at the top , but by a well-run and well-adjusted system of state institutions .

the pro-putin united russia party is expected to emerge as the dominant force in the lower chamber of parliament , the duma .
the opposition says the polls will not be fair , as the electoral system has been engineered to boost parties loyal to the president .
though mr putin steps down as president next year , he has indicated he could remain in politics by applying to become prime minister .
the bbc 's artyom liss in moscow has compiled these viewpoints .
click on the links below to read what they have to say .
andrey volozhanin , taxi-firm owner " people pay their taxes and are more honest " marina litvinovich , opposition politician " my nation ... is a nation of people who are scared " konstantin zhilin , designer " suddenly there 's a new feeling of instability " anton goltsman , student " life has improved .
but it has nothing to do with who runs the country " ella usachyova , student " the country was on the edge of a break-up " sergei markov , pro-kremlin analyst " oligarchs have been brought to heel " andrey volozhanin is a taxi company owner who lives in yekaterinburg , the urals over the last four years , my life as a businessman got a lot easier .
compare this with the 1990s - the difference could n't be greater .
there are no more gangs , there is no more racketeering .
people pay their taxes and are more honest as business partners .
mr volozhanin says russia is now an easy place to make money and the reason for this is simple : people feel confident .
they know they live in a stable country .
the government is not going to let them down and the rules of the game are not going to change .
there is still one serious problem though - corruption .
it 's overwhelming in the urals .
i 'm sure if president putin knew , he would have done something about it .
but all this is politics , and i 'm not interested in it .
i 've got my own political party - my wife and my daughters .
my only concern is to make sure they are happy .
i have n't yet decided whether i will vote .
i 'm not sure my vote will really matter .
after all , i 'm just one businessman living in a really big country .
there are enough clever people in power without me .
i want them to ensure the country continues along its present course , and things continue to get better .
it does n't matter much who is in power - everything depends on the economics .
as long as oil prices are high , we should be ok .
what should we do next ?
learn from the arabs .
invest oil profits and develop tourism , technology and the entertainment industry .
i really admire what the sheikhs have done to the emirates .
and i dream of moving there one day .
i 'm sure it 'll all happen if i work hard enough .
russia is an easy place to earn money .
a year ago i was just a driver - now i have my own taxi company .
return to top anton goltsman , a student at the moscow economics school politics in russia is dull .
politics on tv is even duller - its full of relentless praise for the president and minor criticism of his bureaucrats .
sometimes , there 's an odd report on how good life in the new russia has become .
mr goltsman says his well-being has nothing to do with mr putin do n't get me wrong : life in russia really has improved in the past four years .
but this has nothing to do with who runs the country .
the only achievement of the present government - indeed , of the single person who matters in it , vladimir putin - is that some of the money brought to the county by high oil prices has n't been stolen .
there is some investment and it seems to be paying off .
but the economy would have grown anyway .
the reforms of the 1990s ensured this would happen - it 's just a coincidence that the growth is taking place now .
mr putin 's critics say there 's little or no democracy in russia today .
they might be right .
but russia was falling apart when mr putin came to power .
the country needed a strong leader , and it 's to mr putin 's credit that russia survives as a geographic entity .
he has also achieved another important victory .
russians are now proud to be living in their country , which few people could say in the 1990s .
but the well-being of ordinary people , like my family , has nothing to do with mr putin 's policies .
three years ago i entered university , not because the government helped me out but because i worked hard on my exam papers .
if people want to be successful , to earn good money , to do the jobs they like , it should n't matter to them who sits in the kremlin .
they should be thanking themselves , not the president .
after all , russia is still full of poor people and the president seems to be unable to help them .
return to top marina litvinovich is an opposition politician from moscow i could give you a list of recent changes in russia 's public life - extremism laws are now a lot tougher , party laws have become much stricter , and the word " election " is now little more than an empty shell .
russia 's laws are unwritten and undemocratic , ms litvinovich argues i could also tell you about attacks against the opposition , journalists and human rights activists .
some of them are now in jail , some have been beaten up and even killed .
i 've lost count of all attacks against me .
i was beaten up in a street after i started investigating the beslan tragedy .
i was detained in st petersburg three times , and six times in nizhny novgorod .
i travelled to those cities to set up dissenters ' marches or hold opposition conferences .
my office and my car have been searched on numerous occasions .

but i also see this as a sign of instability .
if you are building a long-term business model , you wo n't be buying porsches - you 'll be investing in your company .
your children and grandchildren will need a solid source of income , not a photograph of you and your sports car .
many people are feeling uneasy - what if the government turns around and decides to nationalise everything ?
so they 're enjoying life while they can .
nobody knows what 's going to happen to them or to the country .
if there is one thing the government should learn , it 's that the business people are not there to rip the country off .
we create jobs , we help people earn their money .
we are building this country .
return to top sergei markov is a pro-kremlin political analyst and united russia member who lives in moscow during his second term in office , mr putin continued along the course he had set for himself and the country when he first came to power .
russia is immune from " people 's revolutions " , mr markov argues his main goal has been to restore the power of the russian state , which has now become a major player in the key oil and gas sectors .
this has vastly improved the financial situation in russia .
the north caucasus has been largely pacified .
in chechnya , the new power system has been established , improving the security situation and providing for more human rights .
however , radical islamism still remains a threat - as shown by the beslan tragedy .
economically , russia is moving towards a free-market system - but reforms have been a lot slower than expected .
where once liberalism ruled unrivalled , there is now more belief in the benefits of state involvement .
domestically , oligarchs have been brought to heel .
tycoons like boris berezovsky or mikhail khodorkovsky are no longer as serious a threat to the kremlin as they used to be .
but there are new threats .
the kremlin is facing the danger of " people 's revolutions " , similar to upheavals in georgia and ukraine .
however , in this sphere , too , mr putin seems to be in control .
moscow has been approaching the issue by setting up patriotic youth movements which support mr putin 's policies .
diplomatically , there are now new tensions between russia and the west .
the main cause is washington 's desire to control some of the post-soviet countries , such as ukraine , georgia , azerbaijan and to some extent , kazakhstan and tajikistan .
over the next four years , we are likely to see the trends of 2000-2008 continuing .
the united russia party promises voters it will carry out " putin 's plan " for the country .
this party 's role will be crucial in resolving russia 's key dilemma - whether president putin should leave office , as required by the constitution , or stay on , as most russians want him to .
in this period of transition , the united russia party will serve as a bridge between russia as we know it today - and russia " after putin " .
whoever rules the state after the election will face some unresolved problems , including how to tackle corruption .
their task , ultimately , will be to ensure the transition to a new russia , where stability will be provided not by one person at the top , but by a well-run and well-adjusted system of state institutions .

the pro-putin united russia party is expected to emerge as the dominant force in the lower chamber of parliament , the duma .
the opposition says the polls will not be fair , as the electoral system has been engineered to boost parties loyal to the president .
though mr putin steps down as president next year , he has indicated he could remain in politics by applying to become prime minister .
the bbc 's artyom liss in moscow has compiled these viewpoints .
click on the links below to read what they have to say .
andrey volozhanin , taxi-firm owner " people pay their taxes and are more honest " marina litvinovich , opposition politician " my nation ... is a nation of people who are scared " konstantin zhilin , designer " suddenly there 's a new feeling of instability " anton goltsman , student " life has improved .
but it has nothing to do with who runs the country " ella usachyova , student " the country was on the edge of a break-up " sergei markov , pro-kremlin analyst " oligarchs have been brought to heel " andrey volozhanin is a taxi company owner who lives in yekaterinburg , the urals over the last four years , my life as a businessman got a lot easier .
compare this with the 1990s - the difference could n't be greater .
there are no more gangs , there is no more racketeering .
people pay their taxes and are more honest as business partners .
mr volozhanin says russia is now an easy place to make money and the reason for this is simple : people feel confident .
they know they live in a stable country .
the government is not going to let them down and the rules of the game are not going to change .
there is still one serious problem though - corruption .
it 's overwhelming in the urals .
i 'm sure if president putin knew , he would have done something about it .
but all this is politics , and i 'm not interested in it .
i 've got my own political party - my wife and my daughters .
my only concern is to make sure they are happy .
i have n't yet decided whether i will vote .
i 'm not sure my vote will really matter .
after all , i 'm just one businessman living in a really big country .
there are enough clever people in power without me .
i want them to ensure the country continues along its present course , and things continue to get better .
it does n't matter much who is in power - everything depends on the economics .
as long as oil prices are high , we should be ok .
what should we do next ?
learn from the arabs .
invest oil profits and develop tourism , technology and the entertainment industry .
i really admire what the sheikhs have done to the emirates .
and i dream of moving there one day .
i 'm sure it 'll all happen if i work hard enough .
russia is an easy place to earn money .
a year ago i was just a driver - now i have my own taxi company .
return to top anton goltsman , a student at the moscow economics school politics in russia is dull .
politics on tv is even duller - its full of relentless praise for the president and minor criticism of his bureaucrats .
sometimes , there 's an odd report on how good life in the new russia has become .
mr goltsman says his well-being has nothing to do with mr putin do n't get me wrong : life in russia really has improved in the past four years .
but this has nothing to do with who runs the country .
the only achievement of the present government - indeed , of the single person who matters in it , vladimir putin - is that some of the money brought to the county by high oil prices has n't been stolen .
there is some investment and it seems to be paying off .
but the economy would have grown anyway .
the reforms of the 1990s ensured this would happen - it 's just a coincidence that the growth is taking place now .
mr putin 's critics say there 's little or no democracy in russia today .
they might be right .
but russia was falling apart when mr putin came to power .
the country needed a strong leader , and it 's to mr putin 's credit that russia survives as a geographic entity .
he has also achieved another important victory .
russians are now proud to be living in their country , which few people could say in the 1990s .
but the well-being of ordinary people , like my family , has nothing to do with mr putin 's policies .
three years ago i entered university , not because the government helped me out but because i worked hard on my exam papers .
if people want to be successful , to earn good money , to do the jobs they like , it should n't matter to them who sits in the kremlin .
they should be thanking themselves , not the president .
after all , russia is still full of poor people and the president seems to be unable to help them .
return to top marina litvinovich is an opposition politician from moscow i could give you a list of recent changes in russia 's public life - extremism laws are now a lot tougher , party laws have become much stricter , and the word " election " is now little more than an empty shell .
russia 's laws are unwritten and undemocratic , ms litvinovich argues i could also tell you about attacks against the opposition , journalists and human rights activists .
some of them are now in jail , some have been beaten up and even killed .
i 've lost count of all attacks against me .
i was beaten up in a street after i started investigating the beslan tragedy .
i was detained in st petersburg three times , and six times in nizhny novgorod .
i travelled to those cities to set up dissenters ' marches or hold opposition conferences .
my office and my car have been searched on numerous occasions .
i remember being on a st petersburg-moscow train once when the police came after me .
there were three officers guarding our compartment door .
both doors of the carriage were sealed .
even the conductor was screaming : " they 've caught a terrorist ! "
i was escorted off the train by armed police officers , like a criminal .
and what did i do ?
nothing but try to set up a peaceful opposition rally - surely the russian constitution allows that ?
but the constitution is now worth little more than the paper it 's printed on .
the laws have changed .
they are unwritten and undemocratic .
and my nation has changed , too .
it 's now a nation of people who are scared .
people do all they can to distance themselves from politics , to lock themselves up in their " little worlds " of family and friends .
and they are likely to give this regime a new lease of life on 2 december .
the propaganda machine will present the result , whatever it is , as " the unanimous approval of the president 's course " .
i 'm afraid after the election things will only get worse .
but i 'm also sure the number of our supporters is only going to grow .
the russian people are very patient .
but even for them , there is a point of no return .
return to top ella usachyova is a student at the moscow international relations institute mr putin came to power in 2000 when we had a very weak state riddled with serious problems , and political leaders were highly unpopular .
russia was on the edge of a break-up .
people pinned their hopes on a miracle .
many russians believe that russia is a superpower again but since then , we have witnessed a miracle .
mr putin managed to stabilise the situation .
his second term in office has been marked by the launch of a number of far-reaching political reforms .
as a result , a party of power has emerged .
oligarchs are no longer able to use russia 's resources to their own advantage .
the edifice of " managed democracy " erected in mr putin 's first four years has undergone major renovations .
there have been significant changes in the election law , both federally and locally .
there have also been some changes in russia 's foreign policy .
mr putin 's approach has not marked the beginning of a " new cold war " between the west and russia .
but it has meant that after 15 years of shuffling along as the ruined remnant of the collapsed soviet superpower , russia is returning to the international arena to pursue its own interests .
however , the gist of russia 's strength is shifting from the military potential to natural resources .
within the last three years , russia 's status as an energy superpower has become a means to protect sovereignty and exert influence abroad .
it 's unlikely that the next president will share mr putin 's appeal and popular support .
mr putin has laid down certain grounds for his successor that will be followed in terms of domestic and foreign policy .
return to top konstantin zhilin , a designer who lives in moscow we got lucky when we were starting our business four years ago because the government had just brought in a new , simpler tax code .
and up until very recently , things were going really well .
some businessmen predict uncertain times after the putin era all our customers - mostly small or medium businesses - seemed to be making good progress .
there was this euphoria about the future .
i 'm now amazed at what some of them have achieved .
but since last august , things seem to have been changing .
people are cutting advertising budgets which makes life difficult for us .
i think suddenly there 's a new feeling of instability .
maybe it 's linked to the election - i do n't know .
one of our customers told me he had a feeling the country 's economic boom simply would not last that long .
look at all these mercedes and porsches out on the streets of moscow .
some people might say they show how rich and powerful russia has become .
but i also see this as a sign of instability .
if you are building a long-term business model , you wo n't be buying porsches - you 'll be investing in your company .
your children and grandchildren will need a solid source of income , not a photograph of you and your sports car .
many people are feeling uneasy - what if the government turns around and decides to nationalise everything ?

forty blackberrys will be used in broxtowe from january to allow officers patrolling the streets to store and record information .
the machines will also be able to access police databases to check the background of suspects .
a police spokesman said the aim was to allow officers to stay on patrol rather than checking records in the office .
nottinghamshire police spokesman martin hanson said often a suspect had to be taken back to the station to be checked out .
unauthorised access he admitted they had been looking at using blackberry 's for some time .
" what takes the time and effort in design is getting our very sophisticated systems to be available and useful to an officer in a busy situation on a very small screen .
" the way we have done this and the design used is something we are keeping under wraps at the moment . "
he confirmed there were security measures built into the system to prevent unauthorised access .
