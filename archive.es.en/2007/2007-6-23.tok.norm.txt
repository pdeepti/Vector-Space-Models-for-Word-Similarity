experts fear that immigrant sufferers in particular are likely to fall through the net . in germany , some one million people are diagnosed with dementia , and the figure is expected to double by 2050 , experts say .
patients require a specialist diagnosis in order to claim insurance , which all too often fails to secure them the support they need .
up to 40 percent of dementia cases end up falling through the net . many of the patients have immigrant backgrounds . in 2004 , the workers ' welfare organization -lrb- awo -rrb- in gelsenkirchen set up a specialist department for migrants , offering information and advice and pushing for change within the country 's hospitals and care homes .
its long-term goal is to see german health care adapt to the needs of immigrants with dementia . the difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking cultural sensitivities into account these needs can be unpredictable .
one of the first symptoms of dementia is a loss of short-term memory . the recollections that remain tend to be of events that happened in the patients ' childhoods . so when the patient comes from another country , their carers often find themselves unable to help . " many of the immigrants in this country only arrived here at the age of 18 , 19 or 20 , " said reinhard streibel from the awo . " they came here to work , and now they 're in their 60s and 70s . even though they might have learnt to speak german at work , or by getting to know their neighbors and so on , as soon as they begin to show the symptoms of dementia , they will start to forget the german language . " most treatment and support so far provided by the health services is tailored to the needs of german patients .
streibel said it is high time more culturally diverse services were made available , and his department - with its official name " you are not alone " - aims to take a first step towards a gradual improvement .
the project is funded by north rhine-westphalia 's ministry for integration , and so far , is the only one of its kind on germany . " we field queries about -lrb- the department -rrb- from all over the country , " streibel said .
" to begin with , most of the interest came from the turkish community , but over time we 've seen growing interest from polish and russian families . " the department prints information leaflets on the illness and how to seek help in germany .
it also provides memory cards and a dvd about coping with dementia . this was developed in cooperation with the turkish alzheimer 's ' society based in ankara and was originally broadcast on turkish tv to mark world alzheimer 's ' day . tradition and taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's retirement home for turks according to the experts , the issue has long been taboo in turkey .
turkish-born bedia torun , a consultant with " you are not alone , " said this is partly because dementia is only now becoming more common in the country . " the average life expectancy used to be lower in turkey than in other european nations , " she said . " that means that people tended to die before they reached the age when dementia usually hits . " on average , this happens at 65 .
but now that life expectancy in turkey has risen to 71.3 - according to the turkish statistics office - dementia has become more widespread . rare as it has been , many still feel the illness is shrouded in shame .
cultural and religious prejudice often stand in the way of appropriate treatment , and the gelsenkirchen department wants to do what it can to change these mindsets . " among muslims there are people who believe that a person suffering from dementia is being punished by allah , " torun said .
" when others hear that sort of thing they try to hide the member of the family with the illness and keep them out of sight . " also difficult for turkish families is dealing with parents who need looking after .
traditionally , they are the head of the family - and shown due respect .
a sudden onset of dementia , with the loss of dignity it usually entails , can be traumatic for families used to unbending hierarchies . " family members can have trouble adjusting to the fact that their father is no longer able to be in charge , " torun said .
" suddenly he needs looking after , he no longer recognizes his own children . " but like many other countries , turkey has also seen a shift in family values .
often , children have grown up and moved away .
then , care of ailing relatives has to be done by professionals in the absence of nearby family members .
this is another reason why germany has to improve its support programs . " we need to be able to provide more turkish-language services for migrants struck by dementia , " streibel said .

respected economists from the world 's leading industrialized nations have criticized germany for basking in its current economic upswing .
they claim that the reforms taken so far will by no means be sustainable . during a discussion in berlin this week , economists argued that german policymakers were too focused on budget consolidation and reducing the welfare state and less about finding the right instruments for long-term economic growth .
adam posen , from the institute for international economics in washington , dc , said he understands that germans are happy about domestic annual growth rates of about three percent .
but he added that he doubts that the current upswing is a direct result of what he calls the mini-reforms taken by the previous and the current governments .
" the current recovery is what we used to call in financial markets a dead cat bounce , " he said .
" if germany was flat on its back for 15 years , the idea that when the world is booming for several years straight at a level that has n't been seen since the 50s , it somehow manages to get off its back for a couple of years , should not be so surprising . "
the female factor richard freeman from harvard university said germany is far from having done its homework on the labor market .
he noted for instance that german women find it much harder to pursue a job than their peers in the united states . this is because german policymakers have n't really understood the huge economic potential of women here , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two many women are still stuck at home in germany " the difference between the two economies is that the americans work full time and the german women work part time , " he said .
" the americans have day care centers that people use extensively .
it 's also the american day care centers are all-day affairs .
half of your people are women .
they have to play a major role in the economy . "
neglecting seniors if women here have a hard time on the labor market , then so do older workers and pensioners , added david soskice from the australian national university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many older germans leave the worforce far too early " mid-career labor markets and late-career labor markets are very , very illiquid in the german economy , " he said . " if you 're a highly skilled person and lose your job in your mid-forties or early fifties , you ca n't just very easily get another job . "
the export trap adam posen agreed and added that germany 's preoccupation with remaining the world export champion is also quite misleading .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's only one dirk nowitzki " the dirk nowitzki fallacy is : people say , ' because dirk nowitzki won the mvp , all german people are really good basketball players , " ' he said . " similarly , if we look at the companies in germany , there is this tendency to reason backwards from exports .
because there is a couple of little machine tool companies in baden-württemberg that happen to make some exports to china , we can fly the flag and say : ' deutschland exportweltmeister ' -lrb- export champion -rrb- and everything is okay .
but this does n't really mean anything .
there is no correlation between how much you export over the long term and how much you grow . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if you 're a highly skilled person and lose your job in your mid-forties or early fifties , you ca n't just very easily get another job . "
the export trap adam posen agreed and added that germany 's preoccupation with remaining the world export champion is also quite misleading .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's only one dirk nowitzki " the dirk nowitzki fallacy is : people say , ' because dirk nowitzki won the mvp , all german people are really good basketball players , " ' he said . " similarly , if we look at the companies in germany , there is this tendency to reason backwards from exports .
because there is a couple of little machine tool companies in baden-württemberg that happen to make some exports to china , we can fly the flag and say : ' deutschland exportweltmeister ' -lrb- export champion -rrb- and everything is okay .
but this does n't really mean anything .

experts fear that immigrant sufferers in particular are likely to fall through the net . in germany , some one million people are diagnosed with dementia , and the figure is expected to double by 2050 , experts say .
patients require a specialist diagnosis in order to claim insurance , which all too often fails to secure them the support they need .
up to 40 percent of dementia cases end up falling through the net . many of the patients have immigrant backgrounds . in 2004 , the workers ' welfare organization -lrb- awo -rrb- in gelsenkirchen set up a specialist department for migrants , offering information and advice and pushing for change within the country 's hospitals and care homes .
its long-term goal is to see german health care adapt to the needs of immigrants with dementia . the difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking cultural sensitivities into account these needs can be unpredictable .
one of the first symptoms of dementia is a loss of short-term memory . the recollections that remain tend to be of events that happened in the patients ' childhoods . so when the patient comes from another country , their carers often find themselves unable to help . " many of the immigrants in this country only arrived here at the age of 18 , 19 or 20 , " said reinhard streibel from the awo . " they came here to work , and now they 're in their 60s and 70s . even though they might have learnt to speak german at work , or by getting to know their neighbors and so on , as soon as they begin to show the symptoms of dementia , they will start to forget the german language . " most treatment and support so far provided by the health services is tailored to the needs of german patients .
streibel said it is high time more culturally diverse services were made available , and his department - with its official name " you are not alone " - aims to take a first step towards a gradual improvement .
the project is funded by north rhine-westphalia 's ministry for integration , and so far , is the only one of its kind on germany . " we field queries about -lrb- the department -rrb- from all over the country , " streibel said .
" to begin with , most of the interest came from the turkish community , but over time we 've seen growing interest from polish and russian families . " the department prints information leaflets on the illness and how to seek help in germany .
it also provides memory cards and a dvd about coping with dementia . this was developed in cooperation with the turkish alzheimer 's ' society based in ankara and was originally broadcast on turkish tv to mark world alzheimer 's ' day . tradition and taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's retirement home for turks according to the experts , the issue has long been taboo in turkey .
turkish-born bedia torun , a consultant with " you are not alone , " said this is partly because dementia is only now becoming more common in the country . " the average life expectancy used to be lower in turkey than in other european nations , " she said . " that means that people tended to die before they reached the age when dementia usually hits . " on average , this happens at 65 .
but now that life expectancy in turkey has risen to 71.3 - according to the turkish statistics office - dementia has become more widespread . rare as it has been , many still feel the illness is shrouded in shame .
cultural and religious prejudice often stand in the way of appropriate treatment , and the gelsenkirchen department wants to do what it can to change these mindsets . " among muslims there are people who believe that a person suffering from dementia is being punished by allah , " torun said .
" when others hear that sort of thing they try to hide the member of the family with the illness and keep them out of sight . " also difficult for turkish families is dealing with parents who need looking after .
traditionally , they are the head of the family - and shown due respect .
a sudden onset of dementia , with the loss of dignity it usually entails , can be traumatic for families used to unbending hierarchies . " family members can have trouble adjusting to the fact that their father is no longer able to be in charge , " torun said .
" suddenly he needs looking after , he no longer recognizes his own children . " but like many other countries , turkey has also seen a shift in family values .
often , children have grown up and moved away .
then , care of ailing relatives has to be done by professionals in the absence of nearby family members .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 23.06.2007 international economic pundits give germany a bashing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is germany 's economic upswing a bubble that 's bound to burst ?
respected economists from the world 's leading industrialized nations have criticized germany for basking in its current economic upswing .
they claim that the reforms taken so far will by no means be sustainable . during a discussion in berlin this week , economists argued that german policymakers were too focused on budget consolidation and reducing the welfare state and less about finding the right instruments for long-term economic growth .
adam posen , from the institute for international economics in washington , dc , said he understands that germans are happy about domestic annual growth rates of about three percent .
but he added that he doubts that the current upswing is a direct result of what he calls the mini-reforms taken by the previous and the current governments .
" the current recovery is what we used to call in financial markets a dead cat bounce , " he said .
" if germany was flat on its back for 15 years , the idea that when the world is booming for several years straight at a level that has n't been seen since the 50s , it somehow manages to get off its back for a couple of years , should not be so surprising . "
the female factor richard freeman from harvard university said germany is far from having done its homework on the labor market .
he noted for instance that german women find it much harder to pursue a job than their peers in the united states . this is because german policymakers have n't really understood the huge economic potential of women here , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two many women are still stuck at home in germany " the difference between the two economies is that the americans work full time and the german women work part time , " he said .
" the americans have day care centers that people use extensively .
it 's also the american day care centers are all-day affairs .
half of your people are women .
they have to play a major role in the economy . "
neglecting seniors if women here have a hard time on the labor market , then so do older workers and pensioners , added david soskice from the australian national university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many older germans leave the worforce far too early " mid-career labor markets and late-career labor markets are very , very illiquid in the german economy , " he said . " if you 're a highly skilled person and lose your job in your mid-forties or early fifties , you ca n't just very easily get another job . "
the export trap adam posen agreed and added that germany 's preoccupation with remaining the world export champion is also quite misleading .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's only one dirk nowitzki " the dirk nowitzki fallacy is : people say , ' because dirk nowitzki won the mvp , all german people are really good basketball players , " ' he said . " similarly , if we look at the companies in germany , there is this tendency to reason backwards from exports .
because there is a couple of little machine tool companies in baden-württemberg that happen to make some exports to china , we can fly the flag and say : ' deutschland exportweltmeister ' -lrb- export champion -rrb- and everything is okay .
but this does n't really mean anything .
there is no correlation between how much you export over the long term and how much you grow . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

respected economists from the world 's leading industrialized nations have criticized germany for basking in its current economic upswing .
they claim that the reforms taken so far will by no means be sustainable . during a discussion in berlin this week , economists argued that german policymakers were too focused on budget consolidation and reducing the welfare state and less about finding the right instruments for long-term economic growth .
adam posen , from the institute for international economics in washington , dc , said he understands that germans are happy about domestic annual growth rates of about three percent .
but he added that he doubts that the current upswing is a direct result of what he calls the mini-reforms taken by the previous and the current governments .
" the current recovery is what we used to call in financial markets a dead cat bounce , " he said .
" if germany was flat on its back for 15 years , the idea that when the world is booming for several years straight at a level that has n't been seen since the 50s , it somehow manages to get off its back for a couple of years , should not be so surprising . "
the female factor richard freeman from harvard university said germany is far from having done its homework on the labor market .
he noted for instance that german women find it much harder to pursue a job than their peers in the united states . this is because german policymakers have n't really understood the huge economic potential of women here , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two many women are still stuck at home in germany " the difference between the two economies is that the americans work full time and the german women work part time , " he said .

it 's also the american day care centers are all-day affairs .
half of your people are women .
they have to play a major role in the economy . "
neglecting seniors if women here have a hard time on the labor market , then so do older workers and pensioners , added david soskice from the australian national university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many older germans leave the worforce far too early " mid-career labor markets and late-career labor markets are very , very illiquid in the german economy , " he said . " if you 're a highly skilled person and lose your job in your mid-forties or early fifties , you ca n't just very easily get another job . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 23.06.2007 experts : german health care fails immigrants with dementia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant patients often fall through the cracks of the health care system better support for patients with dementia is among a slew of hotly debated reforms to the german health care system .
experts fear that immigrant sufferers in particular are likely to fall through the net . in germany , some one million people are diagnosed with dementia , and the figure is expected to double by 2050 , experts say .
patients require a specialist diagnosis in order to claim insurance , which all too often fails to secure them the support they need .
up to 40 percent of dementia cases end up falling through the net . many of the patients have immigrant backgrounds . in 2004 , the workers ' welfare organization -lrb- awo -rrb- in gelsenkirchen set up a specialist department for migrants , offering information and advice and pushing for change within the country 's hospitals and care homes .
its long-term goal is to see german health care adapt to the needs of immigrants with dementia . the difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking cultural sensitivities into account these needs can be unpredictable .
one of the first symptoms of dementia is a loss of short-term memory . the recollections that remain tend to be of events that happened in the patients ' childhoods . so when the patient comes from another country , their carers often find themselves unable to help . " many of the immigrants in this country only arrived here at the age of 18 , 19 or 20 , " said reinhard streibel from the awo . " they came here to work , and now they 're in their 60s and 70s . even though they might have learnt to speak german at work , or by getting to know their neighbors and so on , as soon as they begin to show the symptoms of dementia , they will start to forget the german language . " most treatment and support so far provided by the health services is tailored to the needs of german patients .
streibel said it is high time more culturally diverse services were made available , and his department - with its official name " you are not alone " - aims to take a first step towards a gradual improvement .
the project is funded by north rhine-westphalia 's ministry for integration , and so far , is the only one of its kind on germany . " we field queries about -lrb- the department -rrb- from all over the country , " streibel said .
" to begin with , most of the interest came from the turkish community , but over time we 've seen growing interest from polish and russian families . " the department prints information leaflets on the illness and how to seek help in germany .
it also provides memory cards and a dvd about coping with dementia . this was developed in cooperation with the turkish alzheimer 's ' society based in ankara and was originally broadcast on turkish tv to mark world alzheimer 's ' day . tradition and taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's retirement home for turks according to the experts , the issue has long been taboo in turkey .
turkish-born bedia torun , a consultant with " you are not alone , " said this is partly because dementia is only now becoming more common in the country . " the average life expectancy used to be lower in turkey than in other european nations , " she said . " that means that people tended to die before they reached the age when dementia usually hits . " on average , this happens at 65 .
but now that life expectancy in turkey has risen to 71.3 - according to the turkish statistics office - dementia has become more widespread . rare as it has been , many still feel the illness is shrouded in shame .
cultural and religious prejudice often stand in the way of appropriate treatment , and the gelsenkirchen department wants to do what it can to change these mindsets . " among muslims there are people who believe that a person suffering from dementia is being punished by allah , " torun said .
" when others hear that sort of thing they try to hide the member of the family with the illness and keep them out of sight . " also difficult for turkish families is dealing with parents who need looking after .
traditionally , they are the head of the family - and shown due respect .
a sudden onset of dementia , with the loss of dignity it usually entails , can be traumatic for families used to unbending hierarchies . " family members can have trouble adjusting to the fact that their father is no longer able to be in charge , " torun said .
" suddenly he needs looking after , he no longer recognizes his own children . " but like many other countries , turkey has also seen a shift in family values .
often , children have grown up and moved away .
then , care of ailing relatives has to be done by professionals in the absence of nearby family members .
this is another reason why germany has to improve its support programs . " we need to be able to provide more turkish-language services for migrants struck by dementia , " streibel said .
" so far these are completely unavailable . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts fear that immigrant sufferers in particular are likely to fall through the net . in germany , some one million people are diagnosed with dementia , and the figure is expected to double by 2050 , experts say .
patients require a specialist diagnosis in order to claim insurance , which all too often fails to secure them the support they need .
up to 40 percent of dementia cases end up falling through the net . many of the patients have immigrant backgrounds . in 2004 , the workers ' welfare organization -lrb- awo -rrb- in gelsenkirchen set up a specialist department for migrants , offering information and advice and pushing for change within the country 's hospitals and care homes .
its long-term goal is to see german health care adapt to the needs of immigrants with dementia . the difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking cultural sensitivities into account these needs can be unpredictable .
one of the first symptoms of dementia is a loss of short-term memory . the recollections that remain tend to be of events that happened in the patients ' childhoods . so when the patient comes from another country , their carers often find themselves unable to help . " many of the immigrants in this country only arrived here at the age of 18 , 19 or 20 , " said reinhard streibel from the awo . " they came here to work , and now they 're in their 60s and 70s . even though they might have learnt to speak german at work , or by getting to know their neighbors and so on , as soon as they begin to show the symptoms of dementia , they will start to forget the german language . " most treatment and support so far provided by the health services is tailored to the needs of german patients .
streibel said it is high time more culturally diverse services were made available , and his department - with its official name " you are not alone " - aims to take a first step towards a gradual improvement .
the project is funded by north rhine-westphalia 's ministry for integration , and so far , is the only one of its kind on germany . " we field queries about -lrb- the department -rrb- from all over the country , " streibel said .
" to begin with , most of the interest came from the turkish community , but over time we 've seen growing interest from polish and russian families . " the department prints information leaflets on the illness and how to seek help in germany .
it also provides memory cards and a dvd about coping with dementia . this was developed in cooperation with the turkish alzheimer 's ' society based in ankara and was originally broadcast on turkish tv to mark world alzheimer 's ' day . tradition and taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's retirement home for turks according to the experts , the issue has long been taboo in turkey .
turkish-born bedia torun , a consultant with " you are not alone , " said this is partly because dementia is only now becoming more common in the country . " the average life expectancy used to be lower in turkey than in other european nations , " she said . " that means that people tended to die before they reached the age when dementia usually hits . " on average , this happens at 65 .
but now that life expectancy in turkey has risen to 71.3 - according to the turkish statistics office - dementia has become more widespread . rare as it has been , many still feel the illness is shrouded in shame .
cultural and religious prejudice often stand in the way of appropriate treatment , and the gelsenkirchen department wants to do what it can to change these mindsets . " among muslims there are people who believe that a person suffering from dementia is being punished by allah , " torun said .
" when others hear that sort of thing they try to hide the member of the family with the illness and keep them out of sight . " also difficult for turkish families is dealing with parents who need looking after .
traditionally , they are the head of the family - and shown due respect .
a sudden onset of dementia , with the loss of dignity it usually entails , can be traumatic for families used to unbending hierarchies . " family members can have trouble adjusting to the fact that their father is no longer able to be in charge , " torun said .
" suddenly he needs looking after , he no longer recognizes his own children . " but like many other countries , turkey has also seen a shift in family values .
often , children have grown up and moved away .
then , care of ailing relatives has to be done by professionals in the absence of nearby family members .
this is another reason why germany has to improve its support programs . " we need to be able to provide more turkish-language services for migrants struck by dementia , " streibel said .
" so far these are completely unavailable . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

respected economists from the world 's leading industrialized nations have criticized germany for basking in its current economic upswing .
they claim that the reforms taken so far will by no means be sustainable . during a discussion in berlin this week , economists argued that german policymakers were too focused on budget consolidation and reducing the welfare state and less about finding the right instruments for long-term economic growth .
adam posen , from the institute for international economics in washington , dc , said he understands that germans are happy about domestic annual growth rates of about three percent .
but he added that he doubts that the current upswing is a direct result of what he calls the mini-reforms taken by the previous and the current governments .
" the current recovery is what we used to call in financial markets a dead cat bounce , " he said .
" if germany was flat on its back for 15 years , the idea that when the world is booming for several years straight at a level that has n't been seen since the 50s , it somehow manages to get off its back for a couple of years , should not be so surprising . "
the female factor richard freeman from harvard university said germany is far from having done its homework on the labor market .
he noted for instance that german women find it much harder to pursue a job than their peers in the united states . this is because german policymakers have n't really understood the huge economic potential of women here , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two many women are still stuck at home in germany " the difference between the two economies is that the americans work full time and the german women work part time , " he said .
" the americans have day care centers that people use extensively .
it 's also the american day care centers are all-day affairs .
half of your people are women .
they have to play a major role in the economy . "
neglecting seniors if women here have a hard time on the labor market , then so do older workers and pensioners , added david soskice from the australian national university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many older germans leave the worforce far too early " mid-career labor markets and late-career labor markets are very , very illiquid in the german economy , " he said . " if you 're a highly skilled person and lose your job in your mid-forties or early fifties , you ca n't just very easily get another job . "
the export trap adam posen agreed and added that germany 's preoccupation with remaining the world export champion is also quite misleading .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's only one dirk nowitzki " the dirk nowitzki fallacy is : people say , ' because dirk nowitzki won the mvp , all german people are really good basketball players , " ' he said . " similarly , if we look at the companies in germany , there is this tendency to reason backwards from exports .
because there is a couple of little machine tool companies in baden-württemberg that happen to make some exports to china , we can fly the flag and say : ' deutschland exportweltmeister ' -lrb- export champion -rrb- and everything is okay .

experts fear that immigrant sufferers in particular are likely to fall through the net . in germany , some one million people are diagnosed with dementia , and the figure is expected to double by 2050 , experts say .
patients require a specialist diagnosis in order to claim insurance , which all too often fails to secure them the support they need .
up to 40 percent of dementia cases end up falling through the net . many of the patients have immigrant backgrounds . in 2004 , the workers ' welfare organization -lrb- awo -rrb- in gelsenkirchen set up a specialist department for migrants , offering information and advice and pushing for change within the country 's hospitals and care homes .
its long-term goal is to see german health care adapt to the needs of immigrants with dementia . the difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking cultural sensitivities into account these needs can be unpredictable .
one of the first symptoms of dementia is a loss of short-term memory . the recollections that remain tend to be of events that happened in the patients ' childhoods . so when the patient comes from another country , their carers often find themselves unable to help . " many of the immigrants in this country only arrived here at the age of 18 , 19 or 20 , " said reinhard streibel from the awo . " they came here to work , and now they 're in their 60s and 70s . even though they might have learnt to speak german at work , or by getting to know their neighbors and so on , as soon as they begin to show the symptoms of dementia , they will start to forget the german language . " most treatment and support so far provided by the health services is tailored to the needs of german patients .
streibel said it is high time more culturally diverse services were made available , and his department - with its official name " you are not alone " - aims to take a first step towards a gradual improvement .
the project is funded by north rhine-westphalia 's ministry for integration , and so far , is the only one of its kind on germany . " we field queries about -lrb- the department -rrb- from all over the country , " streibel said .
" to begin with , most of the interest came from the turkish community , but over time we 've seen growing interest from polish and russian families . " the department prints information leaflets on the illness and how to seek help in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 23.06.2007 international economic pundits give germany a bashing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is germany 's economic upswing a bubble that 's bound to burst ?
respected economists from the world 's leading industrialized nations have criticized germany for basking in its current economic upswing .
they claim that the reforms taken so far will by no means be sustainable . during a discussion in berlin this week , economists argued that german policymakers were too focused on budget consolidation and reducing the welfare state and less about finding the right instruments for long-term economic growth .
adam posen , from the institute for international economics in washington , dc , said he understands that germans are happy about domestic annual growth rates of about three percent .
but he added that he doubts that the current upswing is a direct result of what he calls the mini-reforms taken by the previous and the current governments .
" the current recovery is what we used to call in financial markets a dead cat bounce , " he said .
" if germany was flat on its back for 15 years , the idea that when the world is booming for several years straight at a level that has n't been seen since the 50s , it somehow manages to get off its back for a couple of years , should not be so surprising . "
the female factor richard freeman from harvard university said germany is far from having done its homework on the labor market .
he noted for instance that german women find it much harder to pursue a job than their peers in the united states . this is because german policymakers have n't really understood the huge economic potential of women here , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two many women are still stuck at home in germany " the difference between the two economies is that the americans work full time and the german women work part time , " he said .
" the americans have day care centers that people use extensively .
it 's also the american day care centers are all-day affairs .
half of your people are women .
they have to play a major role in the economy . "
neglecting seniors if women here have a hard time on the labor market , then so do older workers and pensioners , added david soskice from the australian national university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many older germans leave the worforce far too early " mid-career labor markets and late-career labor markets are very , very illiquid in the german economy , " he said . " if you 're a highly skilled person and lose your job in your mid-forties or early fifties , you ca n't just very easily get another job . "
the export trap adam posen agreed and added that germany 's preoccupation with remaining the world export champion is also quite misleading .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's only one dirk nowitzki " the dirk nowitzki fallacy is : people say , ' because dirk nowitzki won the mvp , all german people are really good basketball players , " ' he said . " similarly , if we look at the companies in germany , there is this tendency to reason backwards from exports .
because there is a couple of little machine tool companies in baden-württemberg that happen to make some exports to china , we can fly the flag and say : ' deutschland exportweltmeister ' -lrb- export champion -rrb- and everything is okay .
but this does n't really mean anything .
there is no correlation between how much you export over the long term and how much you grow . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel said the agreement would make a bloc which has grown from 15 member states to 27 since 2004 better able to act .
the new treaty will replace the union 's failed constitution , which was torpedoed after voters in france and the netherlands rejected it in 2005 .
" i was sure that if we had not achieved this today we would have ended up in a rather disastrous situation as many would have thought they had been pushed too far , " said merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency till the end of the month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signs were not looking good for success until the last minute " we have managed to organize things so that no one can go home and feel they have been put in the corner , " she said .
frustrated by stonewalling on the part of poland 's leaders , merkel threatened to move ahead on a new treaty with or without their blessing .
the move spurred a revolt by warsaw 's friends but also triggered a flurry of mediation that ultimately convinced poland to compromise .
the agreement means the full introduction of decision-making rules poland had vehemently opposed will be postponed from 2009 until 2017 .
britain is allowed a exemption from a binding set of human rights provisions other states signed up to .
' solidarity ' polish president lech kaczynski thanked france and britain for their " solidarity " in helping to broker a deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if no agreement had been reached , many wondered about the bloc 's future british prime minister tony blair , in his final summit before leaving office next week , and newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy , had both engaged in attempts in the early hours of saturday to persuade the polish president and his twin brother , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , to drop their opposition .
the kaczynskis had shocked european diplomats ahead of the summit by evoking their country 's mass destruction at the hands of the nazis in world war two as an argument for it to get its way on the voting issue .
spelling out the compromise , merkel said the double majority voting system - which poland strongly opposed because it fears it will give big countries too much decision-making power - would not be introduced until 2014 and would then be phased in over the next three years .
the chancellor said the compromise on the voting mechanism was " what poland desired . "
sarkozy acknowledged the talks had come close to failure , but hailed the deal as " very good news for europe . "
in a reference to poland , he said : " it was not possible to ignore the biggest country in eastern europe . "
blair 's swansong prime minister tony blair ended his swansong appearance on the international stage on a high note .
his last eu stand was a triumphant one - he stands down as prime minister next week - secured all the key points without which he said he would not do a deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was tony blair 's last eu summit as british prime minister blair said the accord was a " chance to move on " after the " bind " which the european union had got itself into with the doomed constitutional treaty .
" the most important thing is that it allows us to move on to things that are ultimately far more important , " he told reporters after the deal was clinched .
" it gives us a chance to concentrate on the issues to do with the economy , organized crime , terrorism , immigration , defense , climate change , the environment , energy , the problems that really concern the citizens of europe . "
blair largely succeeded in sticking to the four " red line " conditions he set for agreement on the new treaty - that britain would not cede control over foreign policy , its judicial and police system , tax and social security rules , and an eu charter of fundamental rights .
" i am sorry that mr. blair is going ; he has always been a man who sought compromise in europe , " said sarkozy .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen paid a warm tribute , saying blair " has contributed in a very valuable way to european cooperation , " adding : " he 's really a pro-european . "
chancellor merkel said that the late finish to the negotiations meant " i was only able to utter a few warm words and express thanks to him . "
merkel said the agreement reached at the summit meant there was a " good chance " that a new treaty could go into force in 2009 when elections to the european parliament take place . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 23.06.2007 experts : german health care fails immigrants with dementia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant patients often fall through the cracks of the health care system better support for patients with dementia is among a slew of hotly debated reforms to the german health care system .
experts fear that immigrant sufferers in particular are likely to fall through the net . in germany , some one million people are diagnosed with dementia , and the figure is expected to double by 2050 , experts say .
patients require a specialist diagnosis in order to claim insurance , which all too often fails to secure them the support they need .
up to 40 percent of dementia cases end up falling through the net . many of the patients have immigrant backgrounds . in 2004 , the workers ' welfare organization -lrb- awo -rrb- in gelsenkirchen set up a specialist department for migrants , offering information and advice and pushing for change within the country 's hospitals and care homes .
its long-term goal is to see german health care adapt to the needs of immigrants with dementia . the difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking cultural sensitivities into account these needs can be unpredictable .
one of the first symptoms of dementia is a loss of short-term memory . the recollections that remain tend to be of events that happened in the patients ' childhoods . so when the patient comes from another country , their carers often find themselves unable to help . " many of the immigrants in this country only arrived here at the age of 18 , 19 or 20 , " said reinhard streibel from the awo . " they came here to work , and now they 're in their 60s and 70s . even though they might have learnt to speak german at work , or by getting to know their neighbors and so on , as soon as they begin to show the symptoms of dementia , they will start to forget the german language . " most treatment and support so far provided by the health services is tailored to the needs of german patients .
streibel said it is high time more culturally diverse services were made available , and his department - with its official name " you are not alone " - aims to take a first step towards a gradual improvement .
the project is funded by north rhine-westphalia 's ministry for integration , and so far , is the only one of its kind on germany . " we field queries about -lrb- the department -rrb- from all over the country , " streibel said .
" to begin with , most of the interest came from the turkish community , but over time we 've seen growing interest from polish and russian families . " the department prints information leaflets on the illness and how to seek help in germany .
it also provides memory cards and a dvd about coping with dementia . this was developed in cooperation with the turkish alzheimer 's ' society based in ankara and was originally broadcast on turkish tv to mark world alzheimer 's ' day . tradition and taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's retirement home for turks according to the experts , the issue has long been taboo in turkey .
turkish-born bedia torun , a consultant with " you are not alone , " said this is partly because dementia is only now becoming more common in the country . " the average life expectancy used to be lower in turkey than in other european nations , " she said . " that means that people tended to die before they reached the age when dementia usually hits . " on average , this happens at 65 .
but now that life expectancy in turkey has risen to 71.3 - according to the turkish statistics office - dementia has become more widespread . rare as it has been , many still feel the illness is shrouded in shame .
cultural and religious prejudice often stand in the way of appropriate treatment , and the gelsenkirchen department wants to do what it can to change these mindsets . " among muslims there are people who believe that a person suffering from dementia is being punished by allah , " torun said .
" when others hear that sort of thing they try to hide the member of the family with the illness and keep them out of sight . " also difficult for turkish families is dealing with parents who need looking after .
traditionally , they are the head of the family - and shown due respect .
a sudden onset of dementia , with the loss of dignity it usually entails , can be traumatic for families used to unbending hierarchies . " family members can have trouble adjusting to the fact that their father is no longer able to be in charge , " torun said .
" suddenly he needs looking after , he no longer recognizes his own children . " but like many other countries , turkey has also seen a shift in family values .
often , children have grown up and moved away .
then , care of ailing relatives has to be done by professionals in the absence of nearby family members .
this is another reason why germany has to improve its support programs . " we need to be able to provide more turkish-language services for migrants struck by dementia , " streibel said .
" so far these are completely unavailable . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they main points are listed below : to some it is another step on the slippery slope towards a european superstate , to others it is a watered-down compromise designed to assuage polish and british misgivings .
the main points of the package , the details of which are still to be thrashed out by an intergovernmental conference , are clear : treaty , not constitution the " reform treaty " will amend the eu 's existing treaty building blocks -lrb- rome 1957 , maastricht 1992 -rrb- as the treaties of amsterdam -lrb- 1996 -rrb- and nice -lrb- 2000 -rrb- did .
the constitutional project , scuppered by ' no ' votes at french and dutch elections would have replaced all of them .
therefore the new text will be much shorter than the weighty 480-page constitution but just as incomprehensible to the layman .
it will steer clear of such controversial terms as " federal state , " and " constitution " itself , as well as eu symbols such as the flag , anthem and motto " strength in diversity , " although , as german chancellor angela merkel said , " despite that i suspect the european anthem will be played and the european flag will fly .
they just wo n't be mentioned in this treaty . "
the existing eu charter of fundamental rights -lrb- 54 articles on political and social rights in europe -rrb- will be referred to in the treaty , rather than be reprised in full .
it will not be binding on britain , which had made it one of its " red lines " for agreeing the deal .
voting system the treaty guidelines includes the constitution 's plan for a " qualified majority voting " system , also called a double majority system , whereby decisions need the support of 55 percent member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's objections to the voting system almost torpedoed the summit to overcome poland 's objection that the system would penalise it to the advantage of large states such as germany , a compromise deal was hastily cobbled together under which the new system will not come into use until 2014 and will then by gradually phased in until 2017 .
after that date if there are not enough states to form a blocking majority , but almost enough , then the measure can be re-examined .
scope of double majority voting the scope of decisions to be taken by the double majority voting system is extended to 40 new areas , mainly in the police and judicial fields .
however britain will be allowed an opt-in exemption on criminal matters and police cooperation .
national vetoes will still be available for foreign policy , fiscal matters , and social policy among other areas .
institutional changes a new post of president of the european council -lrb- which comprises all eu national leaders -rrb- will be created .
the president will be elected to a two-and-a-half-year term in place of the current system whereby the eu presidency rotates between member states every six months .
the president will organize and chair summits .
the envisaged creation of an eu foreign minister post has morphed into an eu high representative for foreign affairs and security policy , who will have the same powers to lead the eu 's external affairs and will be a vice-president of the european commission , the eu 's executive arm .
the current practice of each member states getting a place on the european commission , the eu 's executive arm will end in 2014 .
after that the number of commissioners will be equal to two-thirds of the member states .
the countries represented will changed by rotation .
reinforcement of national parliaments the dutch obtained a reinforcement of the powers of national parliaments which may demand , if a certain threshold is reached , that the european commission re-examine a draft act which they judge it to impinge on their national competences .
additions various provisions have been bolted on , including a reference to solidarity in the event of an energy supply problem , a point much sought by lithuania and poland , concerned at their own high dependence on russian hydrocarbons .
at the netherlands ' insistence , a reference to criteria for new eu members was added . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

respected economists from the world 's leading industrialized nations have criticized germany for basking in its current economic upswing .
they claim that the reforms taken so far will by no means be sustainable . during a discussion in berlin this week , economists argued that german policymakers were too focused on budget consolidation and reducing the welfare state and less about finding the right instruments for long-term economic growth .
adam posen , from the institute for international economics in washington , dc , said he understands that germans are happy about domestic annual growth rates of about three percent .
but he added that he doubts that the current upswing is a direct result of what he calls the mini-reforms taken by the previous and the current governments .
" the current recovery is what we used to call in financial markets a dead cat bounce , " he said .
" if germany was flat on its back for 15 years , the idea that when the world is booming for several years straight at a level that has n't been seen since the 50s , it somehow manages to get off its back for a couple of years , should not be so surprising . "
the female factor richard freeman from harvard university said germany is far from having done its homework on the labor market .
he noted for instance that german women find it much harder to pursue a job than their peers in the united states . this is because german policymakers have n't really understood the huge economic potential of women here , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two many women are still stuck at home in germany " the difference between the two economies is that the americans work full time and the german women work part time , " he said .
" the americans have day care centers that people use extensively .
it 's also the american day care centers are all-day affairs .
half of your people are women .
they have to play a major role in the economy . "
neglecting seniors if women here have a hard time on the labor market , then so do older workers and pensioners , added david soskice from the australian national university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many older germans leave the worforce far too early " mid-career labor markets and late-career labor markets are very , very illiquid in the german economy , " he said . " if you 're a highly skilled person and lose your job in your mid-forties or early fifties , you ca n't just very easily get another job . "
the export trap adam posen agreed and added that germany 's preoccupation with remaining the world export champion is also quite misleading .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's only one dirk nowitzki " the dirk nowitzki fallacy is : people say , ' because dirk nowitzki won the mvp , all german people are really good basketball players , " ' he said . " similarly , if we look at the companies in germany , there is this tendency to reason backwards from exports .
because there is a couple of little machine tool companies in baden-württemberg that happen to make some exports to china , we can fly the flag and say : ' deutschland exportweltmeister ' -lrb- export champion -rrb- and everything is okay .
but this does n't really mean anything .

he noted for instance that german women find it much harder to pursue a job than their peers in the united states . this is because german policymakers have n't really understood the huge economic potential of women here , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two many women are still stuck at home in germany " the difference between the two economies is that the americans work full time and the german women work part time , " he said .
" the americans have day care centers that people use extensively .
it 's also the american day care centers are all-day affairs .
half of your people are women .
they have to play a major role in the economy . "
neglecting seniors if women here have a hard time on the labor market , then so do older workers and pensioners , added david soskice from the australian national university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many older germans leave the worforce far too early " mid-career labor markets and late-career labor markets are very , very illiquid in the german economy , " he said . " if you 're a highly skilled person and lose your job in your mid-forties or early fifties , you ca n't just very easily get another job . "
the export trap adam posen agreed and added that germany 's preoccupation with remaining the world export champion is also quite misleading .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's only one dirk nowitzki " the dirk nowitzki fallacy is : people say , ' because dirk nowitzki won the mvp , all german people are really good basketball players , " ' he said . " similarly , if we look at the companies in germany , there is this tendency to reason backwards from exports .
because there is a couple of little machine tool companies in baden-württemberg that happen to make some exports to china , we can fly the flag and say : ' deutschland exportweltmeister ' -lrb- export champion -rrb- and everything is okay .
but this does n't really mean anything .
there is no correlation between how much you export over the long term and how much you grow . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts fear that immigrant sufferers in particular are likely to fall through the net . in germany , some one million people are diagnosed with dementia , and the figure is expected to double by 2050 , experts say .
patients require a specialist diagnosis in order to claim insurance , which all too often fails to secure them the support they need .
up to 40 percent of dementia cases end up falling through the net . many of the patients have immigrant backgrounds . in 2004 , the workers ' welfare organization -lrb- awo -rrb- in gelsenkirchen set up a specialist department for migrants , offering information and advice and pushing for change within the country 's hospitals and care homes .
its long-term goal is to see german health care adapt to the needs of immigrants with dementia . the difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking cultural sensitivities into account these needs can be unpredictable .
one of the first symptoms of dementia is a loss of short-term memory . the recollections that remain tend to be of events that happened in the patients ' childhoods . so when the patient comes from another country , their carers often find themselves unable to help . " many of the immigrants in this country only arrived here at the age of 18 , 19 or 20 , " said reinhard streibel from the awo . " they came here to work , and now they 're in their 60s and 70s . even though they might have learnt to speak german at work , or by getting to know their neighbors and so on , as soon as they begin to show the symptoms of dementia , they will start to forget the german language . " most treatment and support so far provided by the health services is tailored to the needs of german patients .
streibel said it is high time more culturally diverse services were made available , and his department - with its official name " you are not alone " - aims to take a first step towards a gradual improvement .
the project is funded by north rhine-westphalia 's ministry for integration , and so far , is the only one of its kind on germany . " we field queries about -lrb- the department -rrb- from all over the country , " streibel said .
" to begin with , most of the interest came from the turkish community , but over time we 've seen growing interest from polish and russian families . " the department prints information leaflets on the illness and how to seek help in germany .
it also provides memory cards and a dvd about coping with dementia . this was developed in cooperation with the turkish alzheimer 's ' society based in ankara and was originally broadcast on turkish tv to mark world alzheimer 's ' day . tradition and taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's retirement home for turks according to the experts , the issue has long been taboo in turkey .
turkish-born bedia torun , a consultant with " you are not alone , " said this is partly because dementia is only now becoming more common in the country . " the average life expectancy used to be lower in turkey than in other european nations , " she said . " that means that people tended to die before they reached the age when dementia usually hits . " on average , this happens at 65 .
but now that life expectancy in turkey has risen to 71.3 - according to the turkish statistics office - dementia has become more widespread . rare as it has been , many still feel the illness is shrouded in shame .
cultural and religious prejudice often stand in the way of appropriate treatment , and the gelsenkirchen department wants to do what it can to change these mindsets . " among muslims there are people who believe that a person suffering from dementia is being punished by allah , " torun said .
" when others hear that sort of thing they try to hide the member of the family with the illness and keep them out of sight . " also difficult for turkish families is dealing with parents who need looking after .
traditionally , they are the head of the family - and shown due respect .
a sudden onset of dementia , with the loss of dignity it usually entails , can be traumatic for families used to unbending hierarchies . " family members can have trouble adjusting to the fact that their father is no longer able to be in charge , " torun said .
" suddenly he needs looking after , he no longer recognizes his own children . " but like many other countries , turkey has also seen a shift in family values .
often , children have grown up and moved away .
then , care of ailing relatives has to be done by professionals in the absence of nearby family members .
this is another reason why germany has to improve its support programs . " we need to be able to provide more turkish-language services for migrants struck by dementia , " streibel said .
" so far these are completely unavailable . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 23.06.2007 eu treaty blueprint : the central points großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treaty agreed upon replaces the constitution , which was voted down in 2005 the 27 eu member states on saturday agreed on the main contents of a new treaty to replace the bloc 's failed constitution .
they main points are listed below : to some it is another step on the slippery slope towards a european superstate , to others it is a watered-down compromise designed to assuage polish and british misgivings .
the main points of the package , the details of which are still to be thrashed out by an intergovernmental conference , are clear : treaty , not constitution the " reform treaty " will amend the eu 's existing treaty building blocks -lrb- rome 1957 , maastricht 1992 -rrb- as the treaties of amsterdam -lrb- 1996 -rrb- and nice -lrb- 2000 -rrb- did .
the constitutional project , scuppered by ' no ' votes at french and dutch elections would have replaced all of them .
therefore the new text will be much shorter than the weighty 480-page constitution but just as incomprehensible to the layman .
it will steer clear of such controversial terms as " federal state , " and " constitution " itself , as well as eu symbols such as the flag , anthem and motto " strength in diversity , " although , as german chancellor angela merkel said , " despite that i suspect the european anthem will be played and the european flag will fly .
they just wo n't be mentioned in this treaty . "
the existing eu charter of fundamental rights -lrb- 54 articles on political and social rights in europe -rrb- will be referred to in the treaty , rather than be reprised in full .
it will not be binding on britain , which had made it one of its " red lines " for agreeing the deal .
voting system the treaty guidelines includes the constitution 's plan for a " qualified majority voting " system , also called a double majority system , whereby decisions need the support of 55 percent member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's objections to the voting system almost torpedoed the summit to overcome poland 's objection that the system would penalise it to the advantage of large states such as germany , a compromise deal was hastily cobbled together under which the new system will not come into use until 2014 and will then by gradually phased in until 2017 .
after that date if there are not enough states to form a blocking majority , but almost enough , then the measure can be re-examined .
scope of double majority voting the scope of decisions to be taken by the double majority voting system is extended to 40 new areas , mainly in the police and judicial fields .
however britain will be allowed an opt-in exemption on criminal matters and police cooperation .
national vetoes will still be available for foreign policy , fiscal matters , and social policy among other areas .
institutional changes a new post of president of the european council -lrb- which comprises all eu national leaders -rrb- will be created .
the president will be elected to a two-and-a-half-year term in place of the current system whereby the eu presidency rotates between member states every six months .
the president will organize and chair summits .
the envisaged creation of an eu foreign minister post has morphed into an eu high representative for foreign affairs and security policy , who will have the same powers to lead the eu 's external affairs and will be a vice-president of the european commission , the eu 's executive arm .
the current practice of each member states getting a place on the european commission , the eu 's executive arm will end in 2014 .
after that the number of commissioners will be equal to two-thirds of the member states .
the countries represented will changed by rotation .
reinforcement of national parliaments the dutch obtained a reinforcement of the powers of national parliaments which may demand , if a certain threshold is reached , that the european commission re-examine a draft act which they judge it to impinge on their national competences .
additions various provisions have been bolted on , including a reference to solidarity in the event of an energy supply problem , a point much sought by lithuania and poland , concerned at their own high dependence on russian hydrocarbons .
at the netherlands ' insistence , a reference to criteria for new eu members was added . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is a good and a new treaty .
holland and europe can use it to move on , " balkenende said , adding that " the treaty has been changed and the discussion about the constitution has been closed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finnish president tarja halonen , center , gives the thumbs up as she leaves an eu summit in brussels danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said : " i am very , very pleased .
now we can concentrate our efforts once more on the daily problems that really mean something . " " we have avoided a crisis , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in an interview due to appear on sunday in german newspaper bild am sonntag .
" uncertainty about our future treaty has cast a shadow of doubt over our ability to act .
now those doubts have been removed . " ' efficient ' at least " maybe it was not the most beautiful lyrics we have adopted , said barroso immediately after the deal was clinched shortly before daybreak , but it is " efficient prose . " these views were echoed by belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , who complained that the text had been " disfigured " by footnotes and annexes designed to make it easier for leaders to sell at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's prime minister guy verhofstadt " the constitutional treaty was an easily understandable treaty .
this is a simplified treaty which is very complicated , " said luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker . italian prime minister romano prodi said the treaty agreement had made europe " stronger " but criticized britain for " pulling the breaks " on a more ambitious deal . the former eu commission head accused prime minister tony blair 's government of promoting " a different idea of europe " and hinted that a two-speed eu might emerge in the future . britain was granted opt-outs of a charter setting out citizens ' social and economic rights as well as taking part in eu cooperation on police and judicial matters . praise for merkel german chancellor angela merkel was praised for her handling of the tense and often difficult negotiations , which saw a threat by poland to use its veto if it did n't get its way on voting rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel receives flowers and a kiss from european commission president barroso " she took into consideration the special wishes of several countries in an elegant manner , " said finnish president matti vanhanen after the marathon talks ended in brussels . " without her this result would not have been possible , " hans-gert pöttering , president of the eu parliament , was quoted as telling german sunday newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . pöttering said the new eu treaty preserved much of the substance of the draft buried after its rejection in referendums in the netherlands and france in 2005 . approvals the new treaty , designed to make the eu more effective , drops the word constitution as well as any references to statehood such as a national anthem and flag .
it also incudes a new majority voting system as well as the post of eu president and a high representative in charge of foreign affairs . under the timetable agreed at the brussels summit , leaders of the 27-nation bloc will hold an intergovernmental conference later this year to give formal approval to the treaty .

merkel said the agreement would make a bloc which has grown from 15 member states to 27 since 2004 better able to act .
the new treaty will replace the union 's failed constitution , which was torpedoed after voters in france and the netherlands rejected it in 2005 .
" i was sure that if we had not achieved this today we would have ended up in a rather disastrous situation as many would have thought they had been pushed too far , " said merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency till the end of the month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signs were not looking good for success until the last minute " we have managed to organize things so that no one can go home and feel they have been put in the corner , " she said .
frustrated by stonewalling on the part of poland 's leaders , merkel threatened to move ahead on a new treaty with or without their blessing .
the move spurred a revolt by warsaw 's friends but also triggered a flurry of mediation that ultimately convinced poland to compromise .
the agreement means the full introduction of decision-making rules poland had vehemently opposed will be postponed from 2009 until 2017 .
britain is allowed a exemption from a binding set of human rights provisions other states signed up to .
' solidarity ' polish president lech kaczynski thanked france and britain for their " solidarity " in helping to broker a deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if no agreement had been reached , many wondered about the bloc 's future british prime minister tony blair , in his final summit before leaving office next week , and newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy , had both engaged in attempts in the early hours of saturday to persuade the polish president and his twin brother , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , to drop their opposition .
the kaczynskis had shocked european diplomats ahead of the summit by evoking their country 's mass destruction at the hands of the nazis in world war two as an argument for it to get its way on the voting issue .
spelling out the compromise , merkel said the double majority voting system - which poland strongly opposed because it fears it will give big countries too much decision-making power - would not be introduced until 2014 and would then be phased in over the next three years .
the chancellor said the compromise on the voting mechanism was " what poland desired . "
sarkozy acknowledged the talks had come close to failure , but hailed the deal as " very good news for europe . "
in a reference to poland , he said : " it was not possible to ignore the biggest country in eastern europe . "
blair 's swansong prime minister tony blair ended his swansong appearance on the international stage on a high note .
his last eu stand was a triumphant one - he stands down as prime minister next week - secured all the key points without which he said he would not do a deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was tony blair 's last eu summit as british prime minister blair said the accord was a " chance to move on " after the " bind " which the european union had got itself into with the doomed constitutional treaty .
" the most important thing is that it allows us to move on to things that are ultimately far more important , " he told reporters after the deal was clinched .
" it gives us a chance to concentrate on the issues to do with the economy , organized crime , terrorism , immigration , defense , climate change , the environment , energy , the problems that really concern the citizens of europe . "
blair largely succeeded in sticking to the four " red line " conditions he set for agreement on the new treaty - that britain would not cede control over foreign policy , its judicial and police system , tax and social security rules , and an eu charter of fundamental rights .
" i am sorry that mr. blair is going ; he has always been a man who sought compromise in europe , " said sarkozy .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen paid a warm tribute , saying blair " has contributed in a very valuable way to european cooperation , " adding : " he 's really a pro-european . "
chancellor merkel said that the late finish to the negotiations meant " i was only able to utter a few warm words and express thanks to him . "

merkel said the agreement would make a bloc which has grown from 15 member states to 27 since 2004 better able to act .
the new treaty will replace the union 's failed constitution , which was torpedoed after voters in france and the netherlands rejected it in 2005 .
" i was sure that if we had not achieved this today we would have ended up in a rather disastrous situation as many would have thought they had been pushed too far , " said merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency till the end of the month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signs were not looking good for success until the last minute " we have managed to organize things so that no one can go home and feel they have been put in the corner , " she said .
frustrated by stonewalling on the part of poland 's leaders , merkel threatened to move ahead on a new treaty with or without their blessing .
the move spurred a revolt by warsaw 's friends but also triggered a flurry of mediation that ultimately convinced poland to compromise .
the agreement means the full introduction of decision-making rules poland had vehemently opposed will be postponed from 2009 until 2017 .
britain is allowed a exemption from a binding set of human rights provisions other states signed up to .
' solidarity ' polish president lech kaczynski thanked france and britain for their " solidarity " in helping to broker a deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if no agreement had been reached , many wondered about the bloc 's future british prime minister tony blair , in his final summit before leaving office next week , and newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy , had both engaged in attempts in the early hours of saturday to persuade the polish president and his twin brother , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , to drop their opposition .
the kaczynskis had shocked european diplomats ahead of the summit by evoking their country 's mass destruction at the hands of the nazis in world war two as an argument for it to get its way on the voting issue .
spelling out the compromise , merkel said the double majority voting system - which poland strongly opposed because it fears it will give big countries too much decision-making power - would not be introduced until 2014 and would then be phased in over the next three years .
the chancellor said the compromise on the voting mechanism was " what poland desired . "
sarkozy acknowledged the talks had come close to failure , but hailed the deal as " very good news for europe . "
in a reference to poland , he said : " it was not possible to ignore the biggest country in eastern europe . "
blair 's swansong prime minister tony blair ended his swansong appearance on the international stage on a high note .
his last eu stand was a triumphant one - he stands down as prime minister next week - secured all the key points without which he said he would not do a deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was tony blair 's last eu summit as british prime minister blair said the accord was a " chance to move on " after the " bind " which the european union had got itself into with the doomed constitutional treaty .
" the most important thing is that it allows us to move on to things that are ultimately far more important , " he told reporters after the deal was clinched .
" it gives us a chance to concentrate on the issues to do with the economy , organized crime , terrorism , immigration , defense , climate change , the environment , energy , the problems that really concern the citizens of europe . "
blair largely succeeded in sticking to the four " red line " conditions he set for agreement on the new treaty - that britain would not cede control over foreign policy , its judicial and police system , tax and social security rules , and an eu charter of fundamental rights .
" i am sorry that mr. blair is going ; he has always been a man who sought compromise in europe , " said sarkozy .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen paid a warm tribute , saying blair " has contributed in a very valuable way to european cooperation , " adding : " he 's really a pro-european . "
chancellor merkel said that the late finish to the negotiations meant " i was only able to utter a few warm words and express thanks to him . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 23.06.2007 experts : german health care fails immigrants with dementia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant patients often fall through the cracks of the health care system better support for patients with dementia is among a slew of hotly debated reforms to the german health care system .
experts fear that immigrant sufferers in particular are likely to fall through the net . in germany , some one million people are diagnosed with dementia , and the figure is expected to double by 2050 , experts say .
patients require a specialist diagnosis in order to claim insurance , which all too often fails to secure them the support they need .
up to 40 percent of dementia cases end up falling through the net . many of the patients have immigrant backgrounds . in 2004 , the workers ' welfare organization -lrb- awo -rrb- in gelsenkirchen set up a specialist department for migrants , offering information and advice and pushing for change within the country 's hospitals and care homes .
its long-term goal is to see german health care adapt to the needs of immigrants with dementia . the difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking cultural sensitivities into account these needs can be unpredictable .
one of the first symptoms of dementia is a loss of short-term memory . the recollections that remain tend to be of events that happened in the patients ' childhoods . so when the patient comes from another country , their carers often find themselves unable to help . " many of the immigrants in this country only arrived here at the age of 18 , 19 or 20 , " said reinhard streibel from the awo . " they came here to work , and now they 're in their 60s and 70s . even though they might have learnt to speak german at work , or by getting to know their neighbors and so on , as soon as they begin to show the symptoms of dementia , they will start to forget the german language . " most treatment and support so far provided by the health services is tailored to the needs of german patients .
streibel said it is high time more culturally diverse services were made available , and his department - with its official name " you are not alone " - aims to take a first step towards a gradual improvement .
the project is funded by north rhine-westphalia 's ministry for integration , and so far , is the only one of its kind on germany . " we field queries about -lrb- the department -rrb- from all over the country , " streibel said .
" to begin with , most of the interest came from the turkish community , but over time we 've seen growing interest from polish and russian families . " the department prints information leaflets on the illness and how to seek help in germany .
it also provides memory cards and a dvd about coping with dementia . this was developed in cooperation with the turkish alzheimer 's ' society based in ankara and was originally broadcast on turkish tv to mark world alzheimer 's ' day . tradition and taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's retirement home for turks according to the experts , the issue has long been taboo in turkey .
turkish-born bedia torun , a consultant with " you are not alone , " said this is partly because dementia is only now becoming more common in the country . " the average life expectancy used to be lower in turkey than in other european nations , " she said . " that means that people tended to die before they reached the age when dementia usually hits . " on average , this happens at 65 .
but now that life expectancy in turkey has risen to 71.3 - according to the turkish statistics office - dementia has become more widespread . rare as it has been , many still feel the illness is shrouded in shame .
cultural and religious prejudice often stand in the way of appropriate treatment , and the gelsenkirchen department wants to do what it can to change these mindsets . " among muslims there are people who believe that a person suffering from dementia is being punished by allah , " torun said .
" when others hear that sort of thing they try to hide the member of the family with the illness and keep them out of sight . " also difficult for turkish families is dealing with parents who need looking after .
traditionally , they are the head of the family - and shown due respect .
a sudden onset of dementia , with the loss of dignity it usually entails , can be traumatic for families used to unbending hierarchies . " family members can have trouble adjusting to the fact that their father is no longer able to be in charge , " torun said .
" suddenly he needs looking after , he no longer recognizes his own children . " but like many other countries , turkey has also seen a shift in family values .
often , children have grown up and moved away .
then , care of ailing relatives has to be done by professionals in the absence of nearby family members .
this is another reason why germany has to improve its support programs . " we need to be able to provide more turkish-language services for migrants struck by dementia , " streibel said .

they main points are listed below : to some it is another step on the slippery slope towards a european superstate , to others it is a watered-down compromise designed to assuage polish and british misgivings .
the main points of the package , the details of which are still to be thrashed out by an intergovernmental conference , are clear : treaty , not constitution the " reform treaty " will amend the eu 's existing treaty building blocks -lrb- rome 1957 , maastricht 1992 -rrb- as the treaties of amsterdam -lrb- 1996 -rrb- and nice -lrb- 2000 -rrb- did .
the constitutional project , scuppered by ' no ' votes at french and dutch elections would have replaced all of them .
therefore the new text will be much shorter than the weighty 480-page constitution but just as incomprehensible to the layman .
it will steer clear of such controversial terms as " federal state , " and " constitution " itself , as well as eu symbols such as the flag , anthem and motto " strength in diversity , " although , as german chancellor angela merkel said , " despite that i suspect the european anthem will be played and the european flag will fly .
they just wo n't be mentioned in this treaty . "
the existing eu charter of fundamental rights -lrb- 54 articles on political and social rights in europe -rrb- will be referred to in the treaty , rather than be reprised in full .
it will not be binding on britain , which had made it one of its " red lines " for agreeing the deal .
voting system the treaty guidelines includes the constitution 's plan for a " qualified majority voting " system , also called a double majority system , whereby decisions need the support of 55 percent member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's objections to the voting system almost torpedoed the summit to overcome poland 's objection that the system would penalise it to the advantage of large states such as germany , a compromise deal was hastily cobbled together under which the new system will not come into use until 2014 and will then by gradually phased in until 2017 .
after that date if there are not enough states to form a blocking majority , but almost enough , then the measure can be re-examined .
scope of double majority voting the scope of decisions to be taken by the double majority voting system is extended to 40 new areas , mainly in the police and judicial fields .
however britain will be allowed an opt-in exemption on criminal matters and police cooperation .
national vetoes will still be available for foreign policy , fiscal matters , and social policy among other areas .
institutional changes a new post of president of the european council -lrb- which comprises all eu national leaders -rrb- will be created .
the president will be elected to a two-and-a-half-year term in place of the current system whereby the eu presidency rotates between member states every six months .
the president will organize and chair summits .
the envisaged creation of an eu foreign minister post has morphed into an eu high representative for foreign affairs and security policy , who will have the same powers to lead the eu 's external affairs and will be a vice-president of the european commission , the eu 's executive arm .
the current practice of each member states getting a place on the european commission , the eu 's executive arm will end in 2014 .
after that the number of commissioners will be equal to two-thirds of the member states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 23.06.2007 international economic pundits give germany a bashing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is germany 's economic upswing a bubble that 's bound to burst ?
respected economists from the world 's leading industrialized nations have criticized germany for basking in its current economic upswing .
they claim that the reforms taken so far will by no means be sustainable . during a discussion in berlin this week , economists argued that german policymakers were too focused on budget consolidation and reducing the welfare state and less about finding the right instruments for long-term economic growth .
adam posen , from the institute for international economics in washington , dc , said he understands that germans are happy about domestic annual growth rates of about three percent .
but he added that he doubts that the current upswing is a direct result of what he calls the mini-reforms taken by the previous and the current governments .
" the current recovery is what we used to call in financial markets a dead cat bounce , " he said .
" if germany was flat on its back for 15 years , the idea that when the world is booming for several years straight at a level that has n't been seen since the 50s , it somehow manages to get off its back for a couple of years , should not be so surprising . "
the female factor richard freeman from harvard university said germany is far from having done its homework on the labor market .

merkel said the agreement would make a bloc which has grown from 15 member states to 27 since 2004 better able to act .
the new treaty will replace the union 's failed constitution , which was torpedoed after voters in france and the netherlands rejected it in 2005 .
" i was sure that if we had not achieved this today we would have ended up in a rather disastrous situation as many would have thought they had been pushed too far , " said merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency till the end of the month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signs were not looking good for success until the last minute " we have managed to organize things so that no one can go home and feel they have been put in the corner , " she said .
frustrated by stonewalling on the part of poland 's leaders , merkel threatened to move ahead on a new treaty with or without their blessing .
the move spurred a revolt by warsaw 's friends but also triggered a flurry of mediation that ultimately convinced poland to compromise .
the agreement means the full introduction of decision-making rules poland had vehemently opposed will be postponed from 2009 until 2017 .
britain is allowed a exemption from a binding set of human rights provisions other states signed up to .
' solidarity ' polish president lech kaczynski thanked france and britain for their " solidarity " in helping to broker a deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if no agreement had been reached , many wondered about the bloc 's future british prime minister tony blair , in his final summit before leaving office next week , and newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy , had both engaged in attempts in the early hours of saturday to persuade the polish president and his twin brother , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , to drop their opposition .
the kaczynskis had shocked european diplomats ahead of the summit by evoking their country 's mass destruction at the hands of the nazis in world war two as an argument for it to get its way on the voting issue .
spelling out the compromise , merkel said the double majority voting system - which poland strongly opposed because it fears it will give big countries too much decision-making power - would not be introduced until 2014 and would then be phased in over the next three years .
the chancellor said the compromise on the voting mechanism was " what poland desired . "
sarkozy acknowledged the talks had come close to failure , but hailed the deal as " very good news for europe . "
in a reference to poland , he said : " it was not possible to ignore the biggest country in eastern europe . "
blair 's swansong prime minister tony blair ended his swansong appearance on the international stage on a high note .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was tony blair 's last eu summit as british prime minister blair said the accord was a " chance to move on " after the " bind " which the european union had got itself into with the doomed constitutional treaty .
" the most important thing is that it allows us to move on to things that are ultimately far more important , " he told reporters after the deal was clinched .
" it gives us a chance to concentrate on the issues to do with the economy , organized crime , terrorism , immigration , defense , climate change , the environment , energy , the problems that really concern the citizens of europe . "
blair largely succeeded in sticking to the four " red line " conditions he set for agreement on the new treaty - that britain would not cede control over foreign policy , its judicial and police system , tax and social security rules , and an eu charter of fundamental rights .
" i am sorry that mr. blair is going ; he has always been a man who sought compromise in europe , " said sarkozy .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen paid a warm tribute , saying blair " has contributed in a very valuable way to european cooperation , " adding : " he 's really a pro-european . "
chancellor merkel said that the late finish to the negotiations meant " i was only able to utter a few warm words and express thanks to him . "

respected economists from the world 's leading industrialized nations have criticized germany for basking in its current economic upswing .
they claim that the reforms taken so far will by no means be sustainable . during a discussion in berlin this week , economists argued that german policymakers were too focused on budget consolidation and reducing the welfare state and less about finding the right instruments for long-term economic growth .
adam posen , from the institute for international economics in washington , dc , said he understands that germans are happy about domestic annual growth rates of about three percent .
but he added that he doubts that the current upswing is a direct result of what he calls the mini-reforms taken by the previous and the current governments .
" the current recovery is what we used to call in financial markets a dead cat bounce , " he said .
" if germany was flat on its back for 15 years , the idea that when the world is booming for several years straight at a level that has n't been seen since the 50s , it somehow manages to get off its back for a couple of years , should not be so surprising . "
the female factor richard freeman from harvard university said germany is far from having done its homework on the labor market .
he noted for instance that german women find it much harder to pursue a job than their peers in the united states . this is because german policymakers have n't really understood the huge economic potential of women here , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two many women are still stuck at home in germany " the difference between the two economies is that the americans work full time and the german women work part time , " he said .
" the americans have day care centers that people use extensively .
it 's also the american day care centers are all-day affairs .
half of your people are women .
they have to play a major role in the economy . "
neglecting seniors if women here have a hard time on the labor market , then so do older workers and pensioners , added david soskice from the australian national university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many older germans leave the worforce far too early " mid-career labor markets and late-career labor markets are very , very illiquid in the german economy , " he said . " if you 're a highly skilled person and lose your job in your mid-forties or early fifties , you ca n't just very easily get another job . "
the export trap adam posen agreed and added that germany 's preoccupation with remaining the world export champion is also quite misleading .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's only one dirk nowitzki " the dirk nowitzki fallacy is : people say , ' because dirk nowitzki won the mvp , all german people are really good basketball players , " ' he said . " similarly , if we look at the companies in germany , there is this tendency to reason backwards from exports .
because there is a couple of little machine tool companies in baden-württemberg that happen to make some exports to china , we can fly the flag and say : ' deutschland exportweltmeister ' -lrb- export champion -rrb- and everything is okay .

" it is a good and a new treaty .
holland and europe can use it to move on , " balkenende said , adding that " the treaty has been changed and the discussion about the constitution has been closed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finnish president tarja halonen , center , gives the thumbs up as she leaves an eu summit in brussels danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said : " i am very , very pleased .
now we can concentrate our efforts once more on the daily problems that really mean something . " " we have avoided a crisis , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in an interview due to appear on sunday in german newspaper bild am sonntag .
" uncertainty about our future treaty has cast a shadow of doubt over our ability to act .
now those doubts have been removed . " ' efficient ' at least " maybe it was not the most beautiful lyrics we have adopted , said barroso immediately after the deal was clinched shortly before daybreak , but it is " efficient prose . " these views were echoed by belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , who complained that the text had been " disfigured " by footnotes and annexes designed to make it easier for leaders to sell at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's prime minister guy verhofstadt " the constitutional treaty was an easily understandable treaty .
this is a simplified treaty which is very complicated , " said luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker . italian prime minister romano prodi said the treaty agreement had made europe " stronger " but criticized britain for " pulling the breaks " on a more ambitious deal . the former eu commission head accused prime minister tony blair 's government of promoting " a different idea of europe " and hinted that a two-speed eu might emerge in the future . britain was granted opt-outs of a charter setting out citizens ' social and economic rights as well as taking part in eu cooperation on police and judicial matters . praise for merkel german chancellor angela merkel was praised for her handling of the tense and often difficult negotiations , which saw a threat by poland to use its veto if it did n't get its way on voting rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel receives flowers and a kiss from european commission president barroso " she took into consideration the special wishes of several countries in an elegant manner , " said finnish president matti vanhanen after the marathon talks ended in brussels . " without her this result would not have been possible , " hans-gert pöttering , president of the eu parliament , was quoted as telling german sunday newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . pöttering said the new eu treaty preserved much of the substance of the draft buried after its rejection in referendums in the netherlands and france in 2005 . approvals the new treaty , designed to make the eu more effective , drops the word constitution as well as any references to statehood such as a national anthem and flag .
it also incudes a new majority voting system as well as the post of eu president and a high representative in charge of foreign affairs . under the timetable agreed at the brussels summit , leaders of the 27-nation bloc will hold an intergovernmental conference later this year to give formal approval to the treaty .
portgual , which takes on the eu presidency in july , says it would like to approve the treaty at an october summit . after that the ratification process will begin so that the treaty can be in place to coincide with elections to the european parliament in the summer of 2009 . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they main points are listed below : to some it is another step on the slippery slope towards a european superstate , to others it is a watered-down compromise designed to assuage polish and british misgivings .
the main points of the package , the details of which are still to be thrashed out by an intergovernmental conference , are clear : treaty , not constitution the " reform treaty " will amend the eu 's existing treaty building blocks -lrb- rome 1957 , maastricht 1992 -rrb- as the treaties of amsterdam -lrb- 1996 -rrb- and nice -lrb- 2000 -rrb- did .
the constitutional project , scuppered by ' no ' votes at french and dutch elections would have replaced all of them .
therefore the new text will be much shorter than the weighty 480-page constitution but just as incomprehensible to the layman .
it will steer clear of such controversial terms as " federal state , " and " constitution " itself , as well as eu symbols such as the flag , anthem and motto " strength in diversity , " although , as german chancellor angela merkel said , " despite that i suspect the european anthem will be played and the european flag will fly .
they just wo n't be mentioned in this treaty . "
the existing eu charter of fundamental rights -lrb- 54 articles on political and social rights in europe -rrb- will be referred to in the treaty , rather than be reprised in full .
it will not be binding on britain , which had made it one of its " red lines " for agreeing the deal .
voting system the treaty guidelines includes the constitution 's plan for a " qualified majority voting " system , also called a double majority system , whereby decisions need the support of 55 percent member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's objections to the voting system almost torpedoed the summit to overcome poland 's objection that the system would penalise it to the advantage of large states such as germany , a compromise deal was hastily cobbled together under which the new system will not come into use until 2014 and will then by gradually phased in until 2017 .
after that date if there are not enough states to form a blocking majority , but almost enough , then the measure can be re-examined .
scope of double majority voting the scope of decisions to be taken by the double majority voting system is extended to 40 new areas , mainly in the police and judicial fields .
however britain will be allowed an opt-in exemption on criminal matters and police cooperation .
national vetoes will still be available for foreign policy , fiscal matters , and social policy among other areas .
institutional changes a new post of president of the european council -lrb- which comprises all eu national leaders -rrb- will be created .
the president will be elected to a two-and-a-half-year term in place of the current system whereby the eu presidency rotates between member states every six months .
the president will organize and chair summits .
the envisaged creation of an eu foreign minister post has morphed into an eu high representative for foreign affairs and security policy , who will have the same powers to lead the eu 's external affairs and will be a vice-president of the european commission , the eu 's executive arm .
the current practice of each member states getting a place on the european commission , the eu 's executive arm will end in 2014 .
after that the number of commissioners will be equal to two-thirds of the member states .

" it is a good and a new treaty .
holland and europe can use it to move on , " balkenende said , adding that " the treaty has been changed and the discussion about the constitution has been closed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finnish president tarja halonen , center , gives the thumbs up as she leaves an eu summit in brussels danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said : " i am very , very pleased .
now we can concentrate our efforts once more on the daily problems that really mean something . " " we have avoided a crisis , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in an interview due to appear on sunday in german newspaper bild am sonntag .
" uncertainty about our future treaty has cast a shadow of doubt over our ability to act .
now those doubts have been removed . " ' efficient ' at least " maybe it was not the most beautiful lyrics we have adopted , said barroso immediately after the deal was clinched shortly before daybreak , but it is " efficient prose . " these views were echoed by belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , who complained that the text had been " disfigured " by footnotes and annexes designed to make it easier for leaders to sell at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's prime minister guy verhofstadt " the constitutional treaty was an easily understandable treaty .
this is a simplified treaty which is very complicated , " said luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker . italian prime minister romano prodi said the treaty agreement had made europe " stronger " but criticized britain for " pulling the breaks " on a more ambitious deal . the former eu commission head accused prime minister tony blair 's government of promoting " a different idea of europe " and hinted that a two-speed eu might emerge in the future . britain was granted opt-outs of a charter setting out citizens ' social and economic rights as well as taking part in eu cooperation on police and judicial matters . praise for merkel german chancellor angela merkel was praised for her handling of the tense and often difficult negotiations , which saw a threat by poland to use its veto if it did n't get its way on voting rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel receives flowers and a kiss from european commission president barroso " she took into consideration the special wishes of several countries in an elegant manner , " said finnish president matti vanhanen after the marathon talks ended in brussels . " without her this result would not have been possible , " hans-gert pöttering , president of the eu parliament , was quoted as telling german sunday newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . pöttering said the new eu treaty preserved much of the substance of the draft buried after its rejection in referendums in the netherlands and france in 2005 . approvals the new treaty , designed to make the eu more effective , drops the word constitution as well as any references to statehood such as a national anthem and flag .
it also incudes a new majority voting system as well as the post of eu president and a high representative in charge of foreign affairs . under the timetable agreed at the brussels summit , leaders of the 27-nation bloc will hold an intergovernmental conference later this year to give formal approval to the treaty .
portgual , which takes on the eu presidency in july , says it would like to approve the treaty at an october summit . after that the ratification process will begin so that the treaty can be in place to coincide with elections to the european parliament in the summer of 2009 . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it also incudes a new majority voting system as well as the post of eu president and a high representative in charge of foreign affairs . under the timetable agreed at the brussels summit , leaders of the 27-nation bloc will hold an intergovernmental conference later this year to give formal approval to the treaty .
portgual , which takes on the eu presidency in july , says it would like to approve the treaty at an october summit . after that the ratification process will begin so that the treaty can be in place to coincide with elections to the european parliament in the summer of 2009 . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they main points are listed below : to some it is another step on the slippery slope towards a european superstate , to others it is a watered-down compromise designed to assuage polish and british misgivings .
the main points of the package , the details of which are still to be thrashed out by an intergovernmental conference , are clear : treaty , not constitution the " reform treaty " will amend the eu 's existing treaty building blocks -lrb- rome 1957 , maastricht 1992 -rrb- as the treaties of amsterdam -lrb- 1996 -rrb- and nice -lrb- 2000 -rrb- did .
the constitutional project , scuppered by ' no ' votes at french and dutch elections would have replaced all of them .
therefore the new text will be much shorter than the weighty 480-page constitution but just as incomprehensible to the layman .
it will steer clear of such controversial terms as " federal state , " and " constitution " itself , as well as eu symbols such as the flag , anthem and motto " strength in diversity , " although , as german chancellor angela merkel said , " despite that i suspect the european anthem will be played and the european flag will fly .

the existing eu charter of fundamental rights -lrb- 54 articles on political and social rights in europe -rrb- will be referred to in the treaty , rather than be reprised in full .

after that date if there are not enough states to form a blocking majority , but almost enough , then the measure can be re-examined .
scope of double majority voting the scope of decisions to be taken by the double majority voting system is extended to 40 new areas , mainly in the police and judicial fields .

" it is a good and a new treaty .
holland and europe can use it to move on , " balkenende said , adding that " the treaty has been changed and the discussion about the constitution has been closed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finnish president tarja halonen , center , gives the thumbs up as she leaves an eu summit in brussels danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said : " i am very , very pleased .
now we can concentrate our efforts once more on the daily problems that really mean something . " " we have avoided a crisis , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in an interview due to appear on sunday in german newspaper bild am sonntag .
" uncertainty about our future treaty has cast a shadow of doubt over our ability to act .
now those doubts have been removed . " ' efficient ' at least " maybe it was not the most beautiful lyrics we have adopted , said barroso immediately after the deal was clinched shortly before daybreak , but it is " efficient prose .

merkel said the agreement would make a bloc which has grown from 15 member states to 27 since 2004 better able to act .
the new treaty will replace the union 's failed constitution , which was torpedoed after voters in france and the netherlands rejected it in 2005 .
" i was sure that if we had not achieved this today we would have ended up in a rather disastrous situation as many would have thought they had been pushed too far , " said merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency till the end of the month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signs were not looking good for success until the last minute " we have managed to organize things so that no one can go home and feel they have been put in the corner , " she said .
frustrated by stonewalling on the part of poland 's leaders , merkel threatened to move ahead on a new treaty with or without their blessing .
the move spurred a revolt by warsaw 's friends but also triggered a flurry of mediation that ultimately convinced poland to compromise .
the agreement means the full introduction of decision-making rules poland had vehemently opposed will be postponed from 2009 until 2017 .
britain is allowed a exemption from a binding set of human rights provisions other states signed up to .
' solidarity ' polish president lech kaczynski thanked france and britain for their " solidarity " in helping to broker a deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if no agreement had been reached , many wondered about the bloc 's future british prime minister tony blair , in his final summit before leaving office next week , and newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy , had both engaged in attempts in the early hours of saturday to persuade the polish president and his twin brother , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , to drop their opposition .
the kaczynskis had shocked european diplomats ahead of the summit by evoking their country 's mass destruction at the hands of the nazis in world war two as an argument for it to get its way on the voting issue .
spelling out the compromise , merkel said the double majority voting system - which poland strongly opposed because it fears it will give big countries too much decision-making power - would not be introduced until 2014 and would then be phased in over the next three years .
the chancellor said the compromise on the voting mechanism was " what poland desired . "
sarkozy acknowledged the talks had come close to failure , but hailed the deal as " very good news for europe . "
in a reference to poland , he said : " it was not possible to ignore the biggest country in eastern europe . "
blair 's swansong prime minister tony blair ended his swansong appearance on the international stage on a high note .
his last eu stand was a triumphant one - he stands down as prime minister next week - secured all the key points without which he said he would not do a deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was tony blair 's last eu summit as british prime minister blair said the accord was a " chance to move on " after the " bind " which the european union had got itself into with the doomed constitutional treaty .
" the most important thing is that it allows us to move on to things that are ultimately far more important , " he told reporters after the deal was clinched .
" it gives us a chance to concentrate on the issues to do with the economy , organized crime , terrorism , immigration , defense , climate change , the environment , energy , the problems that really concern the citizens of europe . "
blair largely succeeded in sticking to the four " red line " conditions he set for agreement on the new treaty - that britain would not cede control over foreign policy , its judicial and police system , tax and social security rules , and an eu charter of fundamental rights .
" i am sorry that mr. blair is going ; he has always been a man who sought compromise in europe , " said sarkozy .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen paid a warm tribute , saying blair " has contributed in a very valuable way to european cooperation , " adding : " he 's really a pro-european . "
chancellor merkel said that the late finish to the negotiations meant " i was only able to utter a few warm words and express thanks to him . "
merkel said the agreement reached at the summit meant there was a " good chance " that a new treaty could go into force in 2009 when elections to the european parliament take place . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts fear that immigrant sufferers in particular are likely to fall through the net . in germany , some one million people are diagnosed with dementia , and the figure is expected to double by 2050 , experts say .
patients require a specialist diagnosis in order to claim insurance , which all too often fails to secure them the support they need .
up to 40 percent of dementia cases end up falling through the net . many of the patients have immigrant backgrounds . in 2004 , the workers ' welfare organization -lrb- awo -rrb- in gelsenkirchen set up a specialist department for migrants , offering information and advice and pushing for change within the country 's hospitals and care homes .
its long-term goal is to see german health care adapt to the needs of immigrants with dementia . the difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking cultural sensitivities into account these needs can be unpredictable .
one of the first symptoms of dementia is a loss of short-term memory . the recollections that remain tend to be of events that happened in the patients ' childhoods . so when the patient comes from another country , their carers often find themselves unable to help . " many of the immigrants in this country only arrived here at the age of 18 , 19 or 20 , " said reinhard streibel from the awo . " they came here to work , and now they 're in their 60s and 70s . even though they might have learnt to speak german at work , or by getting to know their neighbors and so on , as soon as they begin to show the symptoms of dementia , they will start to forget the german language . " most treatment and support so far provided by the health services is tailored to the needs of german patients .
streibel said it is high time more culturally diverse services were made available , and his department - with its official name " you are not alone " - aims to take a first step towards a gradual improvement .
the project is funded by north rhine-westphalia 's ministry for integration , and so far , is the only one of its kind on germany . " we field queries about -lrb- the department -rrb- from all over the country , " streibel said .
" to begin with , most of the interest came from the turkish community , but over time we 've seen growing interest from polish and russian families . " the department prints information leaflets on the illness and how to seek help in germany .
it also provides memory cards and a dvd about coping with dementia . this was developed in cooperation with the turkish alzheimer 's ' society based in ankara and was originally broadcast on turkish tv to mark world alzheimer 's ' day . tradition and taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's retirement home for turks according to the experts , the issue has long been taboo in turkey .
turkish-born bedia torun , a consultant with " you are not alone , " said this is partly because dementia is only now becoming more common in the country . " the average life expectancy used to be lower in turkey than in other european nations , " she said . " that means that people tended to die before they reached the age when dementia usually hits . " on average , this happens at 65 .
but now that life expectancy in turkey has risen to 71.3 - according to the turkish statistics office - dementia has become more widespread . rare as it has been , many still feel the illness is shrouded in shame .
cultural and religious prejudice often stand in the way of appropriate treatment , and the gelsenkirchen department wants to do what it can to change these mindsets . " among muslims there are people who believe that a person suffering from dementia is being punished by allah , " torun said .
" when others hear that sort of thing they try to hide the member of the family with the illness and keep them out of sight . " also difficult for turkish families is dealing with parents who need looking after .
traditionally , they are the head of the family - and shown due respect .
a sudden onset of dementia , with the loss of dignity it usually entails , can be traumatic for families used to unbending hierarchies . " family members can have trouble adjusting to the fact that their father is no longer able to be in charge , " torun said .
" suddenly he needs looking after , he no longer recognizes his own children . " but like many other countries , turkey has also seen a shift in family values .
often , children have grown up and moved away .
then , care of ailing relatives has to be done by professionals in the absence of nearby family members .
this is another reason why germany has to improve its support programs . " we need to be able to provide more turkish-language services for migrants struck by dementia , " streibel said .

experts fear that immigrant sufferers in particular are likely to fall through the net . in germany , some one million people are diagnosed with dementia , and the figure is expected to double by 2050 , experts say .
patients require a specialist diagnosis in order to claim insurance , which all too often fails to secure them the support they need .
up to 40 percent of dementia cases end up falling through the net . many of the patients have immigrant backgrounds . in 2004 , the workers ' welfare organization -lrb- awo -rrb- in gelsenkirchen set up a specialist department for migrants , offering information and advice and pushing for change within the country 's hospitals and care homes .
its long-term goal is to see german health care adapt to the needs of immigrants with dementia . the difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking cultural sensitivities into account these needs can be unpredictable .
one of the first symptoms of dementia is a loss of short-term memory . the recollections that remain tend to be of events that happened in the patients ' childhoods . so when the patient comes from another country , their carers often find themselves unable to help . " many of the immigrants in this country only arrived here at the age of 18 , 19 or 20 , " said reinhard streibel from the awo . " they came here to work , and now they 're in their 60s and 70s . even though they might have learnt to speak german at work , or by getting to know their neighbors and so on , as soon as they begin to show the symptoms of dementia , they will start to forget the german language . " most treatment and support so far provided by the health services is tailored to the needs of german patients .
streibel said it is high time more culturally diverse services were made available , and his department - with its official name " you are not alone " - aims to take a first step towards a gradual improvement .
the project is funded by north rhine-westphalia 's ministry for integration , and so far , is the only one of its kind on germany . " we field queries about -lrb- the department -rrb- from all over the country , " streibel said .
" to begin with , most of the interest came from the turkish community , but over time we 've seen growing interest from polish and russian families . " the department prints information leaflets on the illness and how to seek help in germany .
it also provides memory cards and a dvd about coping with dementia . this was developed in cooperation with the turkish alzheimer 's ' society based in ankara and was originally broadcast on turkish tv to mark world alzheimer 's ' day . tradition and taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's retirement home for turks according to the experts , the issue has long been taboo in turkey .
turkish-born bedia torun , a consultant with " you are not alone , " said this is partly because dementia is only now becoming more common in the country . " the average life expectancy used to be lower in turkey than in other european nations , " she said . " that means that people tended to die before they reached the age when dementia usually hits . " on average , this happens at 65 .
but now that life expectancy in turkey has risen to 71.3 - according to the turkish statistics office - dementia has become more widespread . rare as it has been , many still feel the illness is shrouded in shame .
cultural and religious prejudice often stand in the way of appropriate treatment , and the gelsenkirchen department wants to do what it can to change these mindsets . " among muslims there are people who believe that a person suffering from dementia is being punished by allah , " torun said .
" when others hear that sort of thing they try to hide the member of the family with the illness and keep them out of sight . " also difficult for turkish families is dealing with parents who need looking after .
traditionally , they are the head of the family - and shown due respect .
a sudden onset of dementia , with the loss of dignity it usually entails , can be traumatic for families used to unbending hierarchies . " family members can have trouble adjusting to the fact that their father is no longer able to be in charge , " torun said .
" suddenly he needs looking after , he no longer recognizes his own children . " but like many other countries , turkey has also seen a shift in family values .
often , children have grown up and moved away .
then , care of ailing relatives has to be done by professionals in the absence of nearby family members .

merkel said the agreement would make a bloc which has grown from 15 member states to 27 since 2004 better able to act .
the new treaty will replace the union 's failed constitution , which was torpedoed after voters in france and the netherlands rejected it in 2005 .

the kaczynskis had shocked european diplomats ahead of the summit by evoking their country 's mass destruction at the hands of the nazis in world war two as an argument for it to get its way on the voting issue .
spelling out the compromise , merkel said the double majority voting system - which poland strongly opposed because it fears it will give big countries too much decision-making power - would not be introduced until 2014 and would then be phased in over the next three years .
the chancellor said the compromise on the voting mechanism was " what poland desired . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 23.06.2007 experts : german health care fails immigrants with dementia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant patients often fall through the cracks of the health care system better support for patients with dementia is among a slew of hotly debated reforms to the german health care system .
experts fear that immigrant sufferers in particular are likely to fall through the net . in germany , some one million people are diagnosed with dementia , and the figure is expected to double by 2050 , experts say .
patients require a specialist diagnosis in order to claim insurance , which all too often fails to secure them the support they need .
up to 40 percent of dementia cases end up falling through the net . many of the patients have immigrant backgrounds . in 2004 , the workers ' welfare organization -lrb- awo -rrb- in gelsenkirchen set up a specialist department for migrants , offering information and advice and pushing for change within the country 's hospitals and care homes .
its long-term goal is to see german health care adapt to the needs of immigrants with dementia . the difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking cultural sensitivities into account these needs can be unpredictable .
one of the first symptoms of dementia is a loss of short-term memory . the recollections that remain tend to be of events that happened in the patients ' childhoods . so when the patient comes from another country , their carers often find themselves unable to help . " many of the immigrants in this country only arrived here at the age of 18 , 19 or 20 , " said reinhard streibel from the awo . " they came here to work , and now they 're in their 60s and 70s . even though they might have learnt to speak german at work , or by getting to know their neighbors and so on , as soon as they begin to show the symptoms of dementia , they will start to forget the german language . " most treatment and support so far provided by the health services is tailored to the needs of german patients .
streibel said it is high time more culturally diverse services were made available , and his department - with its official name " you are not alone " - aims to take a first step towards a gradual improvement .
the project is funded by north rhine-westphalia 's ministry for integration , and so far , is the only one of its kind on germany . " we field queries about -lrb- the department -rrb- from all over the country , " streibel said .
" to begin with , most of the interest came from the turkish community , but over time we 've seen growing interest from polish and russian families . " the department prints information leaflets on the illness and how to seek help in germany .
it also provides memory cards and a dvd about coping with dementia . this was developed in cooperation with the turkish alzheimer 's ' society based in ankara and was originally broadcast on turkish tv to mark world alzheimer 's ' day . tradition and taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's retirement home for turks according to the experts , the issue has long been taboo in turkey .
turkish-born bedia torun , a consultant with " you are not alone , " said this is partly because dementia is only now becoming more common in the country . " the average life expectancy used to be lower in turkey than in other european nations , " she said . " that means that people tended to die before they reached the age when dementia usually hits . " on average , this happens at 65 .
but now that life expectancy in turkey has risen to 71.3 - according to the turkish statistics office - dementia has become more widespread . rare as it has been , many still feel the illness is shrouded in shame .
cultural and religious prejudice often stand in the way of appropriate treatment , and the gelsenkirchen department wants to do what it can to change these mindsets . " among muslims there are people who believe that a person suffering from dementia is being punished by allah , " torun said .
" when others hear that sort of thing they try to hide the member of the family with the illness and keep them out of sight . " also difficult for turkish families is dealing with parents who need looking after .
traditionally , they are the head of the family - and shown due respect .
a sudden onset of dementia , with the loss of dignity it usually entails , can be traumatic for families used to unbending hierarchies . " family members can have trouble adjusting to the fact that their father is no longer able to be in charge , " torun said .
" suddenly he needs looking after , he no longer recognizes his own children . " but like many other countries , turkey has also seen a shift in family values .
often , children have grown up and moved away .
then , care of ailing relatives has to be done by professionals in the absence of nearby family members .
this is another reason why germany has to improve its support programs . " we need to be able to provide more turkish-language services for migrants struck by dementia , " streibel said .
" so far these are completely unavailable . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts fear that immigrant sufferers in particular are likely to fall through the net . in germany , some one million people are diagnosed with dementia , and the figure is expected to double by 2050 , experts say .
patients require a specialist diagnosis in order to claim insurance , which all too often fails to secure them the support they need .
up to 40 percent of dementia cases end up falling through the net . many of the patients have immigrant backgrounds . in 2004 , the workers ' welfare organization -lrb- awo -rrb- in gelsenkirchen set up a specialist department for migrants , offering information and advice and pushing for change within the country 's hospitals and care homes .
its long-term goal is to see german health care adapt to the needs of immigrants with dementia . the difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking cultural sensitivities into account these needs can be unpredictable .
one of the first symptoms of dementia is a loss of short-term memory . the recollections that remain tend to be of events that happened in the patients ' childhoods . so when the patient comes from another country , their carers often find themselves unable to help . " many of the immigrants in this country only arrived here at the age of 18 , 19 or 20 , " said reinhard streibel from the awo . " they came here to work , and now they 're in their 60s and 70s . even though they might have learnt to speak german at work , or by getting to know their neighbors and so on , as soon as they begin to show the symptoms of dementia , they will start to forget the german language . " most treatment and support so far provided by the health services is tailored to the needs of german patients .
streibel said it is high time more culturally diverse services were made available , and his department - with its official name " you are not alone " - aims to take a first step towards a gradual improvement .
the project is funded by north rhine-westphalia 's ministry for integration , and so far , is the only one of its kind on germany . " we field queries about -lrb- the department -rrb- from all over the country , " streibel said .
" to begin with , most of the interest came from the turkish community , but over time we 've seen growing interest from polish and russian families . " the department prints information leaflets on the illness and how to seek help in germany .
it also provides memory cards and a dvd about coping with dementia . this was developed in cooperation with the turkish alzheimer 's ' society based in ankara and was originally broadcast on turkish tv to mark world alzheimer 's ' day . tradition and taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's retirement home for turks according to the experts , the issue has long been taboo in turkey .
turkish-born bedia torun , a consultant with " you are not alone , " said this is partly because dementia is only now becoming more common in the country . " the average life expectancy used to be lower in turkey than in other european nations , " she said . " that means that people tended to die before they reached the age when dementia usually hits . " on average , this happens at 65 .
but now that life expectancy in turkey has risen to 71.3 - according to the turkish statistics office - dementia has become more widespread . rare as it has been , many still feel the illness is shrouded in shame .
cultural and religious prejudice often stand in the way of appropriate treatment , and the gelsenkirchen department wants to do what it can to change these mindsets . " among muslims there are people who believe that a person suffering from dementia is being punished by allah , " torun said .
" when others hear that sort of thing they try to hide the member of the family with the illness and keep them out of sight . " also difficult for turkish families is dealing with parents who need looking after .
traditionally , they are the head of the family - and shown due respect .
a sudden onset of dementia , with the loss of dignity it usually entails , can be traumatic for families used to unbending hierarchies . " family members can have trouble adjusting to the fact that their father is no longer able to be in charge , " torun said .
" suddenly he needs looking after , he no longer recognizes his own children . " but like many other countries , turkey has also seen a shift in family values .
often , children have grown up and moved away .
then , care of ailing relatives has to be done by professionals in the absence of nearby family members .
this is another reason why germany has to improve its support programs . " we need to be able to provide more turkish-language services for migrants struck by dementia , " streibel said .

respected economists from the world 's leading industrialized nations have criticized germany for basking in its current economic upswing .
they claim that the reforms taken so far will by no means be sustainable . during a discussion in berlin this week , economists argued that german policymakers were too focused on budget consolidation and reducing the welfare state and less about finding the right instruments for long-term economic growth .
adam posen , from the institute for international economics in washington , dc , said he understands that germans are happy about domestic annual growth rates of about three percent .
but he added that he doubts that the current upswing is a direct result of what he calls the mini-reforms taken by the previous and the current governments .
" the current recovery is what we used to call in financial markets a dead cat bounce , " he said .
" if germany was flat on its back for 15 years , the idea that when the world is booming for several years straight at a level that has n't been seen since the 50s , it somehow manages to get off its back for a couple of years , should not be so surprising . "
the female factor richard freeman from harvard university said germany is far from having done its homework on the labor market .
he noted for instance that german women find it much harder to pursue a job than their peers in the united states . this is because german policymakers have n't really understood the huge economic potential of women here , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two many women are still stuck at home in germany " the difference between the two economies is that the americans work full time and the german women work part time , " he said .
" the americans have day care centers that people use extensively .
it 's also the american day care centers are all-day affairs .
half of your people are women .
they have to play a major role in the economy . "
neglecting seniors if women here have a hard time on the labor market , then so do older workers and pensioners , added david soskice from the australian national university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many older germans leave the worforce far too early " mid-career labor markets and late-career labor markets are very , very illiquid in the german economy , " he said . " if you 're a highly skilled person and lose your job in your mid-forties or early fifties , you ca n't just very easily get another job . "
the export trap adam posen agreed and added that germany 's preoccupation with remaining the world export champion is also quite misleading .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's only one dirk nowitzki " the dirk nowitzki fallacy is : people say , ' because dirk nowitzki won the mvp , all german people are really good basketball players , " ' he said . " similarly , if we look at the companies in germany , there is this tendency to reason backwards from exports .
because there is a couple of little machine tool companies in baden-württemberg that happen to make some exports to china , we can fly the flag and say : ' deutschland exportweltmeister ' -lrb- export champion -rrb- and everything is okay .
but this does n't really mean anything .
there is no correlation between how much you export over the long term and how much you grow . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

adam posen , from the institute for international economics in washington , dc , said he understands that germans are happy about domestic annual growth rates of about three percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 23.06.2007 experts : german health care fails immigrants with dementia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrant patients often fall through the cracks of the health care system better support for patients with dementia is among a slew of hotly debated reforms to the german health care system .
experts fear that immigrant sufferers in particular are likely to fall through the net . in germany , some one million people are diagnosed with dementia , and the figure is expected to double by 2050 , experts say .
patients require a specialist diagnosis in order to claim insurance , which all too often fails to secure them the support they need .
up to 40 percent of dementia cases end up falling through the net . many of the patients have immigrant backgrounds . in 2004 , the workers ' welfare organization -lrb- awo -rrb- in gelsenkirchen set up a specialist department for migrants , offering information and advice and pushing for change within the country 's hospitals and care homes .
its long-term goal is to see german health care adapt to the needs of immigrants with dementia . the difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking cultural sensitivities into account these needs can be unpredictable .
one of the first symptoms of dementia is a loss of short-term memory . the recollections that remain tend to be of events that happened in the patients ' childhoods . so when the patient comes from another country , their carers often find themselves unable to help . " many of the immigrants in this country only arrived here at the age of 18 , 19 or 20 , " said reinhard streibel from the awo . " they came here to work , and now they 're in their 60s and 70s . even though they might have learnt to speak german at work , or by getting to know their neighbors and so on , as soon as they begin to show the symptoms of dementia , they will start to forget the german language . " most treatment and support so far provided by the health services is tailored to the needs of german patients .
streibel said it is high time more culturally diverse services were made available , and his department - with its official name " you are not alone " - aims to take a first step towards a gradual improvement .
the project is funded by north rhine-westphalia 's ministry for integration , and so far , is the only one of its kind on germany . " we field queries about -lrb- the department -rrb- from all over the country , " streibel said .
" to begin with , most of the interest came from the turkish community , but over time we 've seen growing interest from polish and russian families . " the department prints information leaflets on the illness and how to seek help in germany .
it also provides memory cards and a dvd about coping with dementia . this was developed in cooperation with the turkish alzheimer 's ' society based in ankara and was originally broadcast on turkish tv to mark world alzheimer 's ' day . tradition and taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's retirement home for turks according to the experts , the issue has long been taboo in turkey .
turkish-born bedia torun , a consultant with " you are not alone , " said this is partly because dementia is only now becoming more common in the country . " the average life expectancy used to be lower in turkey than in other european nations , " she said . " that means that people tended to die before they reached the age when dementia usually hits . " on average , this happens at 65 .
but now that life expectancy in turkey has risen to 71.3 - according to the turkish statistics office - dementia has become more widespread . rare as it has been , many still feel the illness is shrouded in shame .
cultural and religious prejudice often stand in the way of appropriate treatment , and the gelsenkirchen department wants to do what it can to change these mindsets . " among muslims there are people who believe that a person suffering from dementia is being punished by allah , " torun said .
" when others hear that sort of thing they try to hide the member of the family with the illness and keep them out of sight . " also difficult for turkish families is dealing with parents who need looking after .
traditionally , they are the head of the family - and shown due respect .
a sudden onset of dementia , with the loss of dignity it usually entails , can be traumatic for families used to unbending hierarchies . " family members can have trouble adjusting to the fact that their father is no longer able to be in charge , " torun said .
" suddenly he needs looking after , he no longer recognizes his own children . " but like many other countries , turkey has also seen a shift in family values .
often , children have grown up and moved away .
then , care of ailing relatives has to be done by professionals in the absence of nearby family members .
this is another reason why germany has to improve its support programs . " we need to be able to provide more turkish-language services for migrants struck by dementia , " streibel said .
" so far these are completely unavailable . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the main points of the package , the details of which are still to be thrashed out by an intergovernmental conference , are clear : treaty , not constitution the " reform treaty " will amend the eu 's existing treaty building blocks -lrb- rome 1957 , maastricht 1992 -rrb- as the treaties of amsterdam -lrb- 1996 -rrb- and nice -lrb- 2000 -rrb- did .
the constitutional project , scuppered by ' no ' votes at french and dutch elections would have replaced all of them .
therefore the new text will be much shorter than the weighty 480-page constitution but just as incomprehensible to the layman .
it will steer clear of such controversial terms as " federal state , " and " constitution " itself , as well as eu symbols such as the flag , anthem and motto " strength in diversity , " although , as german chancellor angela merkel said , " despite that i suspect the european anthem will be played and the european flag will fly .
they just wo n't be mentioned in this treaty . "
the existing eu charter of fundamental rights -lrb- 54 articles on political and social rights in europe -rrb- will be referred to in the treaty , rather than be reprised in full .
it will not be binding on britain , which had made it one of its " red lines " for agreeing the deal .
voting system the treaty guidelines includes the constitution 's plan for a " qualified majority voting " system , also called a double majority system , whereby decisions need the support of 55 percent member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's objections to the voting system almost torpedoed the summit to overcome poland 's objection that the system would penalise it to the advantage of large states such as germany , a compromise deal was hastily cobbled together under which the new system will not come into use until 2014 and will then by gradually phased in until 2017 .
after that date if there are not enough states to form a blocking majority , but almost enough , then the measure can be re-examined .
scope of double majority voting the scope of decisions to be taken by the double majority voting system is extended to 40 new areas , mainly in the police and judicial fields .
however britain will be allowed an opt-in exemption on criminal matters and police cooperation .
national vetoes will still be available for foreign policy , fiscal matters , and social policy among other areas .

the president will be elected to a two-and-a-half-year term in place of the current system whereby the eu presidency rotates between member states every six months .
the president will organize and chair summits .
the envisaged creation of an eu foreign minister post has morphed into an eu high representative for foreign affairs and security policy , who will have the same powers to lead the eu 's external affairs and will be a vice-president of the european commission , the eu 's executive arm .
the current practice of each member states getting a place on the european commission , the eu 's executive arm will end in 2014 .

" it is a good and a new treaty .
holland and europe can use it to move on , " balkenende said , adding that " the treaty has been changed and the discussion about the constitution has been closed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finnish president tarja halonen , center , gives the thumbs up as she leaves an eu summit in brussels danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said : " i am very , very pleased .
now we can concentrate our efforts once more on the daily problems that really mean something . " " we have avoided a crisis , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in an interview due to appear on sunday in german newspaper bild am sonntag .
" uncertainty about our future treaty has cast a shadow of doubt over our ability to act .
now those doubts have been removed . " ' efficient ' at least " maybe it was not the most beautiful lyrics we have adopted , said barroso immediately after the deal was clinched shortly before daybreak , but it is " efficient prose .

merkel said the agreement would make a bloc which has grown from 15 member states to 27 since 2004 better able to act .
the new treaty will replace the union 's failed constitution , which was torpedoed after voters in france and the netherlands rejected it in 2005 .
" i was sure that if we had not achieved this today we would have ended up in a rather disastrous situation as many would have thought they had been pushed too far , " said merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency till the end of the month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signs were not looking good for success until the last minute " we have managed to organize things so that no one can go home and feel they have been put in the corner , " she said .
frustrated by stonewalling on the part of poland 's leaders , merkel threatened to move ahead on a new treaty with or without their blessing .
the move spurred a revolt by warsaw 's friends but also triggered a flurry of mediation that ultimately convinced poland to compromise .
the agreement means the full introduction of decision-making rules poland had vehemently opposed will be postponed from 2009 until 2017 .
britain is allowed a exemption from a binding set of human rights provisions other states signed up to .
' solidarity ' polish president lech kaczynski thanked france and britain for their " solidarity " in helping to broker a deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if no agreement had been reached , many wondered about the bloc 's future british prime minister tony blair , in his final summit before leaving office next week , and newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy , had both engaged in attempts in the early hours of saturday to persuade the polish president and his twin brother , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , to drop their opposition .
the kaczynskis had shocked european diplomats ahead of the summit by evoking their country 's mass destruction at the hands of the nazis in world war two as an argument for it to get its way on the voting issue .
spelling out the compromise , merkel said the double majority voting system - which poland strongly opposed because it fears it will give big countries too much decision-making power - would not be introduced until 2014 and would then be phased in over the next three years .
the chancellor said the compromise on the voting mechanism was " what poland desired . "
sarkozy acknowledged the talks had come close to failure , but hailed the deal as " very good news for europe . "
in a reference to poland , he said : " it was not possible to ignore the biggest country in eastern europe . "
blair 's swansong prime minister tony blair ended his swansong appearance on the international stage on a high note .
his last eu stand was a triumphant one - he stands down as prime minister next week - secured all the key points without which he said he would not do a deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was tony blair 's last eu summit as british prime minister blair said the accord was a " chance to move on " after the " bind " which the european union had got itself into with the doomed constitutional treaty .
" the most important thing is that it allows us to move on to things that are ultimately far more important , " he told reporters after the deal was clinched .
" it gives us a chance to concentrate on the issues to do with the economy , organized crime , terrorism , immigration , defense , climate change , the environment , energy , the problems that really concern the citizens of europe . "
blair largely succeeded in sticking to the four " red line " conditions he set for agreement on the new treaty - that britain would not cede control over foreign policy , its judicial and police system , tax and social security rules , and an eu charter of fundamental rights .
" i am sorry that mr. blair is going ; he has always been a man who sought compromise in europe , " said sarkozy .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen paid a warm tribute , saying blair " has contributed in a very valuable way to european cooperation , " adding : " he 's really a pro-european . "
chancellor merkel said that the late finish to the negotiations meant " i was only able to utter a few warm words and express thanks to him . "

merkel said the agreement would make a bloc which has grown from 15 member states to 27 since 2004 better able to act .
the new treaty will replace the union 's failed constitution , which was torpedoed after voters in france and the netherlands rejected it in 2005 .
" i was sure that if we had not achieved this today we would have ended up in a rather disastrous situation as many would have thought they had been pushed too far , " said merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency till the end of the month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signs were not looking good for success until the last minute " we have managed to organize things so that no one can go home and feel they have been put in the corner , " she said .
frustrated by stonewalling on the part of poland 's leaders , merkel threatened to move ahead on a new treaty with or without their blessing .
the move spurred a revolt by warsaw 's friends but also triggered a flurry of mediation that ultimately convinced poland to compromise .
the agreement means the full introduction of decision-making rules poland had vehemently opposed will be postponed from 2009 until 2017 .
britain is allowed a exemption from a binding set of human rights provisions other states signed up to .
' solidarity ' polish president lech kaczynski thanked france and britain for their " solidarity " in helping to broker a deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if no agreement had been reached , many wondered about the bloc 's future british prime minister tony blair , in his final summit before leaving office next week , and newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy , had both engaged in attempts in the early hours of saturday to persuade the polish president and his twin brother , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , to drop their opposition .
the kaczynskis had shocked european diplomats ahead of the summit by evoking their country 's mass destruction at the hands of the nazis in world war two as an argument for it to get its way on the voting issue .
spelling out the compromise , merkel said the double majority voting system - which poland strongly opposed because it fears it will give big countries too much decision-making power - would not be introduced until 2014 and would then be phased in over the next three years .
the chancellor said the compromise on the voting mechanism was " what poland desired . "
sarkozy acknowledged the talks had come close to failure , but hailed the deal as " very good news for europe . "
in a reference to poland , he said : " it was not possible to ignore the biggest country in eastern europe . "
blair 's swansong prime minister tony blair ended his swansong appearance on the international stage on a high note .
his last eu stand was a triumphant one - he stands down as prime minister next week - secured all the key points without which he said he would not do a deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was tony blair 's last eu summit as british prime minister blair said the accord was a " chance to move on " after the " bind " which the european union had got itself into with the doomed constitutional treaty .
" the most important thing is that it allows us to move on to things that are ultimately far more important , " he told reporters after the deal was clinched .
" it gives us a chance to concentrate on the issues to do with the economy , organized crime , terrorism , immigration , defense , climate change , the environment , energy , the problems that really concern the citizens of europe . "
blair largely succeeded in sticking to the four " red line " conditions he set for agreement on the new treaty - that britain would not cede control over foreign policy , its judicial and police system , tax and social security rules , and an eu charter of fundamental rights .
" i am sorry that mr. blair is going ; he has always been a man who sought compromise in europe , " said sarkozy .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen paid a warm tribute , saying blair " has contributed in a very valuable way to european cooperation , " adding : " he 's really a pro-european . "
chancellor merkel said that the late finish to the negotiations meant " i was only able to utter a few warm words and express thanks to him . "
merkel said the agreement reached at the summit meant there was a " good chance " that a new treaty could go into force in 2009 when elections to the european parliament take place . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they main points are listed below : to some it is another step on the slippery slope towards a european superstate , to others it is a watered-down compromise designed to assuage polish and british misgivings .
the main points of the package , the details of which are still to be thrashed out by an intergovernmental conference , are clear : treaty , not constitution the " reform treaty " will amend the eu 's existing treaty building blocks -lrb- rome 1957 , maastricht 1992 -rrb- as the treaties of amsterdam -lrb- 1996 -rrb- and nice -lrb- 2000 -rrb- did .
the constitutional project , scuppered by ' no ' votes at french and dutch elections would have replaced all of them .
therefore the new text will be much shorter than the weighty 480-page constitution but just as incomprehensible to the layman .
it will steer clear of such controversial terms as " federal state , " and " constitution " itself , as well as eu symbols such as the flag , anthem and motto " strength in diversity , " although , as german chancellor angela merkel said , " despite that i suspect the european anthem will be played and the european flag will fly .
they just wo n't be mentioned in this treaty . "
the existing eu charter of fundamental rights -lrb- 54 articles on political and social rights in europe -rrb- will be referred to in the treaty , rather than be reprised in full .
it will not be binding on britain , which had made it one of its " red lines " for agreeing the deal .
voting system the treaty guidelines includes the constitution 's plan for a " qualified majority voting " system , also called a double majority system , whereby decisions need the support of 55 percent member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's objections to the voting system almost torpedoed the summit to overcome poland 's objection that the system would penalise it to the advantage of large states such as germany , a compromise deal was hastily cobbled together under which the new system will not come into use until 2014 and will then by gradually phased in until 2017 .
after that date if there are not enough states to form a blocking majority , but almost enough , then the measure can be re-examined .
scope of double majority voting the scope of decisions to be taken by the double majority voting system is extended to 40 new areas , mainly in the police and judicial fields .
however britain will be allowed an opt-in exemption on criminal matters and police cooperation .
national vetoes will still be available for foreign policy , fiscal matters , and social policy among other areas .

the president will be elected to a two-and-a-half-year term in place of the current system whereby the eu presidency rotates between member states every six months .
the president will organize and chair summits .
the envisaged creation of an eu foreign minister post has morphed into an eu high representative for foreign affairs and security policy , who will have the same powers to lead the eu 's external affairs and will be a vice-president of the european commission , the eu 's executive arm .

" it is a good and a new treaty .
holland and europe can use it to move on , " balkenende said , adding that " the treaty has been changed and the discussion about the constitution has been closed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finnish president tarja halonen , center , gives the thumbs up as she leaves an eu summit in brussels danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said : " i am very , very pleased .
now we can concentrate our efforts once more on the daily problems that really mean something . " " we have avoided a crisis , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in an interview due to appear on sunday in german newspaper bild am sonntag .
" uncertainty about our future treaty has cast a shadow of doubt over our ability to act .
now those doubts have been removed . " ' efficient ' at least " maybe it was not the most beautiful lyrics we have adopted , said barroso immediately after the deal was clinched shortly before daybreak , but it is " efficient prose . " these views were echoed by belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , who complained that the text had been " disfigured " by footnotes and annexes designed to make it easier for leaders to sell at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's prime minister guy verhofstadt " the constitutional treaty was an easily understandable treaty .
this is a simplified treaty which is very complicated , " said luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker . italian prime minister romano prodi said the treaty agreement had made europe " stronger " but criticized britain for " pulling the breaks " on a more ambitious deal . the former eu commission head accused prime minister tony blair 's government of promoting " a different idea of europe " and hinted that a two-speed eu might emerge in the future . britain was granted opt-outs of a charter setting out citizens ' social and economic rights as well as taking part in eu cooperation on police and judicial matters . praise for merkel german chancellor angela merkel was praised for her handling of the tense and often difficult negotiations , which saw a threat by poland to use its veto if it did n't get its way on voting rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel receives flowers and a kiss from european commission president barroso " she took into consideration the special wishes of several countries in an elegant manner , " said finnish president matti vanhanen after the marathon talks ended in brussels . " without her this result would not have been possible , " hans-gert pöttering , president of the eu parliament , was quoted as telling german sunday newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . pöttering said the new eu treaty preserved much of the substance of the draft buried after its rejection in referendums in the netherlands and france in 2005 . approvals the new treaty , designed to make the eu more effective , drops the word constitution as well as any references to statehood such as a national anthem and flag .
it also incudes a new majority voting system as well as the post of eu president and a high representative in charge of foreign affairs . under the timetable agreed at the brussels summit , leaders of the 27-nation bloc will hold an intergovernmental conference later this year to give formal approval to the treaty .
portgual , which takes on the eu presidency in july , says it would like to approve the treaty at an october summit . after that the ratification process will begin so that the treaty can be in place to coincide with elections to the european parliament in the summer of 2009 . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they main points are listed below : to some it is another step on the slippery slope towards a european superstate , to others it is a watered-down compromise designed to assuage polish and british misgivings .
the main points of the package , the details of which are still to be thrashed out by an intergovernmental conference , are clear : treaty , not constitution the " reform treaty " will amend the eu 's existing treaty building blocks -lrb- rome 1957 , maastricht 1992 -rrb- as the treaties of amsterdam -lrb- 1996 -rrb- and nice -lrb- 2000 -rrb- did .
the constitutional project , scuppered by ' no ' votes at french and dutch elections would have replaced all of them .
therefore the new text will be much shorter than the weighty 480-page constitution but just as incomprehensible to the layman .
it will steer clear of such controversial terms as " federal state , " and " constitution " itself , as well as eu symbols such as the flag , anthem and motto " strength in diversity , " although , as german chancellor angela merkel said , " despite that i suspect the european anthem will be played and the european flag will fly .
they just wo n't be mentioned in this treaty . "
the existing eu charter of fundamental rights -lrb- 54 articles on political and social rights in europe -rrb- will be referred to in the treaty , rather than be reprised in full .
it will not be binding on britain , which had made it one of its " red lines " for agreeing the deal .
voting system the treaty guidelines includes the constitution 's plan for a " qualified majority voting " system , also called a double majority system , whereby decisions need the support of 55 percent member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's objections to the voting system almost torpedoed the summit to overcome poland 's objection that the system would penalise it to the advantage of large states such as germany , a compromise deal was hastily cobbled together under which the new system will not come into use until 2014 and will then by gradually phased in until 2017 .
after that date if there are not enough states to form a blocking majority , but almost enough , then the measure can be re-examined .
scope of double majority voting the scope of decisions to be taken by the double majority voting system is extended to 40 new areas , mainly in the police and judicial fields .
however britain will be allowed an opt-in exemption on criminal matters and police cooperation .
national vetoes will still be available for foreign policy , fiscal matters , and social policy among other areas .
institutional changes a new post of president of the european council -lrb- which comprises all eu national leaders -rrb- will be created .
the president will be elected to a two-and-a-half-year term in place of the current system whereby the eu presidency rotates between member states every six months .
the president will organize and chair summits .
the envisaged creation of an eu foreign minister post has morphed into an eu high representative for foreign affairs and security policy , who will have the same powers to lead the eu 's external affairs and will be a vice-president of the european commission , the eu 's executive arm .
the current practice of each member states getting a place on the european commission , the eu 's executive arm will end in 2014 .
after that the number of commissioners will be equal to two-thirds of the member states .
the countries represented will changed by rotation .
reinforcement of national parliaments the dutch obtained a reinforcement of the powers of national parliaments which may demand , if a certain threshold is reached , that the european commission re-examine a draft act which they judge it to impinge on their national competences .
additions various provisions have been bolted on , including a reference to solidarity in the event of an energy supply problem , a point much sought by lithuania and poland , concerned at their own high dependence on russian hydrocarbons .

" it is a good and a new treaty .
holland and europe can use it to move on , " balkenende said , adding that " the treaty has been changed and the discussion about the constitution has been closed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finnish president tarja halonen , center , gives the thumbs up as she leaves an eu summit in brussels danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said : " i am very , very pleased .
now we can concentrate our efforts once more on the daily problems that really mean something . " " we have avoided a crisis , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in an interview due to appear on sunday in german newspaper bild am sonntag .
" uncertainty about our future treaty has cast a shadow of doubt over our ability to act .
now those doubts have been removed . " ' efficient ' at least " maybe it was not the most beautiful lyrics we have adopted , said barroso immediately after the deal was clinched shortly before daybreak , but it is " efficient prose . " these views were echoed by belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , who complained that the text had been " disfigured " by footnotes and annexes designed to make it easier for leaders to sell at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's prime minister guy verhofstadt " the constitutional treaty was an easily understandable treaty .
this is a simplified treaty which is very complicated , " said luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker . italian prime minister romano prodi said the treaty agreement had made europe " stronger " but criticized britain for " pulling the breaks " on a more ambitious deal . the former eu commission head accused prime minister tony blair 's government of promoting " a different idea of europe " and hinted that a two-speed eu might emerge in the future . britain was granted opt-outs of a charter setting out citizens ' social and economic rights as well as taking part in eu cooperation on police and judicial matters . praise for merkel german chancellor angela merkel was praised for her handling of the tense and often difficult negotiations , which saw a threat by poland to use its veto if it did n't get its way on voting rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel receives flowers and a kiss from european commission president barroso " she took into consideration the special wishes of several countries in an elegant manner , " said finnish president matti vanhanen after the marathon talks ended in brussels . " without her this result would not have been possible , " hans-gert pöttering , president of the eu parliament , was quoted as telling german sunday newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . pöttering said the new eu treaty preserved much of the substance of the draft buried after its rejection in referendums in the netherlands and france in 2005 . approvals the new treaty , designed to make the eu more effective , drops the word constitution as well as any references to statehood such as a national anthem and flag .
it also incudes a new majority voting system as well as the post of eu president and a high representative in charge of foreign affairs . under the timetable agreed at the brussels summit , leaders of the 27-nation bloc will hold an intergovernmental conference later this year to give formal approval to the treaty .
portgual , which takes on the eu presidency in july , says it would like to approve the treaty at an october summit . after that the ratification process will begin so that the treaty can be in place to coincide with elections to the european parliament in the summer of 2009 . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they main points are listed below : to some it is another step on the slippery slope towards a european superstate , to others it is a watered-down compromise designed to assuage polish and british misgivings .
the main points of the package , the details of which are still to be thrashed out by an intergovernmental conference , are clear : treaty , not constitution the " reform treaty " will amend the eu 's existing treaty building blocks -lrb- rome 1957 , maastricht 1992 -rrb- as the treaties of amsterdam -lrb- 1996 -rrb- and nice -lrb- 2000 -rrb- did .
the constitutional project , scuppered by ' no ' votes at french and dutch elections would have replaced all of them .
therefore the new text will be much shorter than the weighty 480-page constitution but just as incomprehensible to the layman .
it will steer clear of such controversial terms as " federal state , " and " constitution " itself , as well as eu symbols such as the flag , anthem and motto " strength in diversity , " although , as german chancellor angela merkel said , " despite that i suspect the european anthem will be played and the european flag will fly .
they just wo n't be mentioned in this treaty . "
the existing eu charter of fundamental rights -lrb- 54 articles on political and social rights in europe -rrb- will be referred to in the treaty , rather than be reprised in full .
it will not be binding on britain , which had made it one of its " red lines " for agreeing the deal .
voting system the treaty guidelines includes the constitution 's plan for a " qualified majority voting " system , also called a double majority system , whereby decisions need the support of 55 percent member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's objections to the voting system almost torpedoed the summit to overcome poland 's objection that the system would penalise it to the advantage of large states such as germany , a compromise deal was hastily cobbled together under which the new system will not come into use until 2014 and will then by gradually phased in until 2017 .
after that date if there are not enough states to form a blocking majority , but almost enough , then the measure can be re-examined .
scope of double majority voting the scope of decisions to be taken by the double majority voting system is extended to 40 new areas , mainly in the police and judicial fields .
however britain will be allowed an opt-in exemption on criminal matters and police cooperation .
national vetoes will still be available for foreign policy , fiscal matters , and social policy among other areas .
institutional changes a new post of president of the european council -lrb- which comprises all eu national leaders -rrb- will be created .
the president will be elected to a two-and-a-half-year term in place of the current system whereby the eu presidency rotates between member states every six months .
the president will organize and chair summits .
the envisaged creation of an eu foreign minister post has morphed into an eu high representative for foreign affairs and security policy , who will have the same powers to lead the eu 's external affairs and will be a vice-president of the european commission , the eu 's executive arm .
the current practice of each member states getting a place on the european commission , the eu 's executive arm will end in 2014 .
after that the number of commissioners will be equal to two-thirds of the member states .
the countries represented will changed by rotation .
reinforcement of national parliaments the dutch obtained a reinforcement of the powers of national parliaments which may demand , if a certain threshold is reached , that the european commission re-examine a draft act which they judge it to impinge on their national competences .
additions various provisions have been bolted on , including a reference to solidarity in the event of an energy supply problem , a point much sought by lithuania and poland , concerned at their own high dependence on russian hydrocarbons .

merkel said the agreement would make a bloc which has grown from 15 member states to 27 since 2004 better able to act .
the new treaty will replace the union 's failed constitution , which was torpedoed after voters in france and the netherlands rejected it in 2005 .
" i was sure that if we had not achieved this today we would have ended up in a rather disastrous situation as many would have thought they had been pushed too far , " said merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency till the end of the month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signs were not looking good for success until the last minute " we have managed to organize things so that no one can go home and feel they have been put in the corner , " she said .
frustrated by stonewalling on the part of poland 's leaders , merkel threatened to move ahead on a new treaty with or without their blessing .
the move spurred a revolt by warsaw 's friends but also triggered a flurry of mediation that ultimately convinced poland to compromise .
the agreement means the full introduction of decision-making rules poland had vehemently opposed will be postponed from 2009 until 2017 .
britain is allowed a exemption from a binding set of human rights provisions other states signed up to .
' solidarity ' polish president lech kaczynski thanked france and britain for their " solidarity " in helping to broker a deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if no agreement had been reached , many wondered about the bloc 's future british prime minister tony blair , in his final summit before leaving office next week , and newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy , had both engaged in attempts in the early hours of saturday to persuade the polish president and his twin brother , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , to drop their opposition .
the kaczynskis had shocked european diplomats ahead of the summit by evoking their country 's mass destruction at the hands of the nazis in world war two as an argument for it to get its way on the voting issue .
spelling out the compromise , merkel said the double majority voting system - which poland strongly opposed because it fears it will give big countries too much decision-making power - would not be introduced until 2014 and would then be phased in over the next three years .
the chancellor said the compromise on the voting mechanism was " what poland desired . "
sarkozy acknowledged the talks had come close to failure , but hailed the deal as " very good news for europe . "
in a reference to poland , he said : " it was not possible to ignore the biggest country in eastern europe . "
blair 's swansong prime minister tony blair ended his swansong appearance on the international stage on a high note .
his last eu stand was a triumphant one - he stands down as prime minister next week - secured all the key points without which he said he would not do a deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was tony blair 's last eu summit as british prime minister blair said the accord was a " chance to move on " after the " bind " which the european union had got itself into with the doomed constitutional treaty .
" the most important thing is that it allows us to move on to things that are ultimately far more important , " he told reporters after the deal was clinched .
" it gives us a chance to concentrate on the issues to do with the economy , organized crime , terrorism , immigration , defense , climate change , the environment , energy , the problems that really concern the citizens of europe . "
blair largely succeeded in sticking to the four " red line " conditions he set for agreement on the new treaty - that britain would not cede control over foreign policy , its judicial and police system , tax and social security rules , and an eu charter of fundamental rights .
" i am sorry that mr. blair is going ; he has always been a man who sought compromise in europe , " said sarkozy .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen paid a warm tribute , saying blair " has contributed in a very valuable way to european cooperation , " adding : " he 's really a pro-european . "
chancellor merkel said that the late finish to the negotiations meant " i was only able to utter a few warm words and express thanks to him . "
merkel said the agreement reached at the summit meant there was a " good chance " that a new treaty could go into force in 2009 when elections to the european parliament take place . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel said the agreement would make a bloc which has grown from 15 member states to 27 since 2004 better able to act .
the new treaty will replace the union 's failed constitution , which was torpedoed after voters in france and the netherlands rejected it in 2005 .
" i was sure that if we had not achieved this today we would have ended up in a rather disastrous situation as many would have thought they had been pushed too far , " said merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency till the end of the month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signs were not looking good for success until the last minute " we have managed to organize things so that no one can go home and feel they have been put in the corner , " she said .
frustrated by stonewalling on the part of poland 's leaders , merkel threatened to move ahead on a new treaty with or without their blessing .
the move spurred a revolt by warsaw 's friends but also triggered a flurry of mediation that ultimately convinced poland to compromise .
the agreement means the full introduction of decision-making rules poland had vehemently opposed will be postponed from 2009 until 2017 .
britain is allowed a exemption from a binding set of human rights provisions other states signed up to .
' solidarity ' polish president lech kaczynski thanked france and britain for their " solidarity " in helping to broker a deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if no agreement had been reached , many wondered about the bloc 's future british prime minister tony blair , in his final summit before leaving office next week , and newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy , had both engaged in attempts in the early hours of saturday to persuade the polish president and his twin brother , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , to drop their opposition .
the kaczynskis had shocked european diplomats ahead of the summit by evoking their country 's mass destruction at the hands of the nazis in world war two as an argument for it to get its way on the voting issue .
spelling out the compromise , merkel said the double majority voting system - which poland strongly opposed because it fears it will give big countries too much decision-making power - would not be introduced until 2014 and would then be phased in over the next three years .
the chancellor said the compromise on the voting mechanism was " what poland desired . "
sarkozy acknowledged the talks had come close to failure , but hailed the deal as " very good news for europe . "
in a reference to poland , he said : " it was not possible to ignore the biggest country in eastern europe . "
blair 's swansong prime minister tony blair ended his swansong appearance on the international stage on a high note .
his last eu stand was a triumphant one - he stands down as prime minister next week - secured all the key points without which he said he would not do a deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was tony blair 's last eu summit as british prime minister blair said the accord was a " chance to move on " after the " bind " which the european union had got itself into with the doomed constitutional treaty .
" the most important thing is that it allows us to move on to things that are ultimately far more important , " he told reporters after the deal was clinched .
" it gives us a chance to concentrate on the issues to do with the economy , organized crime , terrorism , immigration , defense , climate change , the environment , energy , the problems that really concern the citizens of europe . "
blair largely succeeded in sticking to the four " red line " conditions he set for agreement on the new treaty - that britain would not cede control over foreign policy , its judicial and police system , tax and social security rules , and an eu charter of fundamental rights .
" i am sorry that mr. blair is going ; he has always been a man who sought compromise in europe , " said sarkozy .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen paid a warm tribute , saying blair " has contributed in a very valuable way to european cooperation , " adding : " he 's really a pro-european . "
chancellor merkel said that the late finish to the negotiations meant " i was only able to utter a few warm words and express thanks to him . "

" it is a good and a new treaty .
holland and europe can use it to move on , " balkenende said , adding that " the treaty has been changed and the discussion about the constitution has been closed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finnish president tarja halonen , center , gives the thumbs up as she leaves an eu summit in brussels danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said : " i am very , very pleased .
now we can concentrate our efforts once more on the daily problems that really mean something . " " we have avoided a crisis , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in an interview due to appear on sunday in german newspaper bild am sonntag .
" uncertainty about our future treaty has cast a shadow of doubt over our ability to act .
now those doubts have been removed . " ' efficient ' at least " maybe it was not the most beautiful lyrics we have adopted , said barroso immediately after the deal was clinched shortly before daybreak , but it is " efficient prose . " these views were echoed by belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , who complained that the text had been " disfigured " by footnotes and annexes designed to make it easier for leaders to sell at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's prime minister guy verhofstadt " the constitutional treaty was an easily understandable treaty .
this is a simplified treaty which is very complicated , " said luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker . italian prime minister romano prodi said the treaty agreement had made europe " stronger " but criticized britain for " pulling the breaks " on a more ambitious deal . the former eu commission head accused prime minister tony blair 's government of promoting " a different idea of europe " and hinted that a two-speed eu might emerge in the future . britain was granted opt-outs of a charter setting out citizens ' social and economic rights as well as taking part in eu cooperation on police and judicial matters . praise for merkel german chancellor angela merkel was praised for her handling of the tense and often difficult negotiations , which saw a threat by poland to use its veto if it did n't get its way on voting rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel receives flowers and a kiss from european commission president barroso " she took into consideration the special wishes of several countries in an elegant manner , " said finnish president matti vanhanen after the marathon talks ended in brussels . " without her this result would not have been possible , " hans-gert pöttering , president of the eu parliament , was quoted as telling german sunday newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . pöttering said the new eu treaty preserved much of the substance of the draft buried after its rejection in referendums in the netherlands and france in 2005 . approvals the new treaty , designed to make the eu more effective , drops the word constitution as well as any references to statehood such as a national anthem and flag .
it also incudes a new majority voting system as well as the post of eu president and a high representative in charge of foreign affairs . under the timetable agreed at the brussels summit , leaders of the 27-nation bloc will hold an intergovernmental conference later this year to give formal approval to the treaty .
portgual , which takes on the eu presidency in july , says it would like to approve the treaty at an october summit . after that the ratification process will begin so that the treaty can be in place to coincide with elections to the european parliament in the summer of 2009 . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel said the agreement would make a bloc which has grown from 15 member states to 27 since 2004 better able to act .
the new treaty will replace the union 's failed constitution , which was torpedoed after voters in france and the netherlands rejected it in 2005 .
" i was sure that if we had not achieved this today we would have ended up in a rather disastrous situation as many would have thought they had been pushed too far , " said merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency till the end of the month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signs were not looking good for success until the last minute " we have managed to organize things so that no one can go home and feel they have been put in the corner , " she said .
frustrated by stonewalling on the part of poland 's leaders , merkel threatened to move ahead on a new treaty with or without their blessing .
the move spurred a revolt by warsaw 's friends but also triggered a flurry of mediation that ultimately convinced poland to compromise .
the agreement means the full introduction of decision-making rules poland had vehemently opposed will be postponed from 2009 until 2017 .
britain is allowed a exemption from a binding set of human rights provisions other states signed up to .
' solidarity ' polish president lech kaczynski thanked france and britain for their " solidarity " in helping to broker a deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if no agreement had been reached , many wondered about the bloc 's future british prime minister tony blair , in his final summit before leaving office next week , and newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy , had both engaged in attempts in the early hours of saturday to persuade the polish president and his twin brother , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , to drop their opposition .
the kaczynskis had shocked european diplomats ahead of the summit by evoking their country 's mass destruction at the hands of the nazis in world war two as an argument for it to get its way on the voting issue .
spelling out the compromise , merkel said the double majority voting system - which poland strongly opposed because it fears it will give big countries too much decision-making power - would not be introduced until 2014 and would then be phased in over the next three years .
the chancellor said the compromise on the voting mechanism was " what poland desired . "
sarkozy acknowledged the talks had come close to failure , but hailed the deal as " very good news for europe . "
in a reference to poland , he said : " it was not possible to ignore the biggest country in eastern europe . "
blair 's swansong prime minister tony blair ended his swansong appearance on the international stage on a high note .
his last eu stand was a triumphant one - he stands down as prime minister next week - secured all the key points without which he said he would not do a deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was tony blair 's last eu summit as british prime minister blair said the accord was a " chance to move on " after the " bind " which the european union had got itself into with the doomed constitutional treaty .
" the most important thing is that it allows us to move on to things that are ultimately far more important , " he told reporters after the deal was clinched .
" it gives us a chance to concentrate on the issues to do with the economy , organized crime , terrorism , immigration , defense , climate change , the environment , energy , the problems that really concern the citizens of europe . "
blair largely succeeded in sticking to the four " red line " conditions he set for agreement on the new treaty - that britain would not cede control over foreign policy , its judicial and police system , tax and social security rules , and an eu charter of fundamental rights .
" i am sorry that mr. blair is going ; he has always been a man who sought compromise in europe , " said sarkozy .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen paid a warm tribute , saying blair " has contributed in a very valuable way to european cooperation , " adding : " he 's really a pro-european . "
chancellor merkel said that the late finish to the negotiations meant " i was only able to utter a few warm words and express thanks to him . "
merkel said the agreement reached at the summit meant there was a " good chance " that a new treaty could go into force in 2009 when elections to the european parliament take place . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel said the agreement would make a bloc which has grown from 15 member states to 27 since 2004 better able to act .
the new treaty will replace the union 's failed constitution , which was torpedoed after voters in france and the netherlands rejected it in 2005 .
" i was sure that if we had not achieved this today we would have ended up in a rather disastrous situation as many would have thought they had been pushed too far , " said merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency till the end of the month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signs were not looking good for success until the last minute " we have managed to organize things so that no one can go home and feel they have been put in the corner , " she said .
frustrated by stonewalling on the part of poland 's leaders , merkel threatened to move ahead on a new treaty with or without their blessing .
the move spurred a revolt by warsaw 's friends but also triggered a flurry of mediation that ultimately convinced poland to compromise .
the agreement means the full introduction of decision-making rules poland had vehemently opposed will be postponed from 2009 until 2017 .
britain is allowed a exemption from a binding set of human rights provisions other states signed up to .
' solidarity ' polish president lech kaczynski thanked france and britain for their " solidarity " in helping to broker a deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if no agreement had been reached , many wondered about the bloc 's future british prime minister tony blair , in his final summit before leaving office next week , and newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy , had both engaged in attempts in the early hours of saturday to persuade the polish president and his twin brother , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , to drop their opposition .
the kaczynskis had shocked european diplomats ahead of the summit by evoking their country 's mass destruction at the hands of the nazis in world war two as an argument for it to get its way on the voting issue .
spelling out the compromise , merkel said the double majority voting system - which poland strongly opposed because it fears it will give big countries too much decision-making power - would not be introduced until 2014 and would then be phased in over the next three years .
the chancellor said the compromise on the voting mechanism was " what poland desired . "
sarkozy acknowledged the talks had come close to failure , but hailed the deal as " very good news for europe . "
in a reference to poland , he said : " it was not possible to ignore the biggest country in eastern europe . "
blair 's swansong prime minister tony blair ended his swansong appearance on the international stage on a high note .
his last eu stand was a triumphant one - he stands down as prime minister next week - secured all the key points without which he said he would not do a deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was tony blair 's last eu summit as british prime minister blair said the accord was a " chance to move on " after the " bind " which the european union had got itself into with the doomed constitutional treaty .
" the most important thing is that it allows us to move on to things that are ultimately far more important , " he told reporters after the deal was clinched .
" it gives us a chance to concentrate on the issues to do with the economy , organized crime , terrorism , immigration , defense , climate change , the environment , energy , the problems that really concern the citizens of europe . "
blair largely succeeded in sticking to the four " red line " conditions he set for agreement on the new treaty - that britain would not cede control over foreign policy , its judicial and police system , tax and social security rules , and an eu charter of fundamental rights .
" i am sorry that mr. blair is going ; he has always been a man who sought compromise in europe , " said sarkozy .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen paid a warm tribute , saying blair " has contributed in a very valuable way to european cooperation , " adding : " he 's really a pro-european . "
chancellor merkel said that the late finish to the negotiations meant " i was only able to utter a few warm words and express thanks to him . "

" it is a good and a new treaty .
holland and europe can use it to move on , " balkenende said , adding that " the treaty has been changed and the discussion about the constitution has been closed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finnish president tarja halonen , center , gives the thumbs up as she leaves an eu summit in brussels danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said : " i am very , very pleased .
now we can concentrate our efforts once more on the daily problems that really mean something . " " we have avoided a crisis , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said in an interview due to appear on sunday in german newspaper bild am sonntag .
" uncertainty about our future treaty has cast a shadow of doubt over our ability to act .
now those doubts have been removed . " ' efficient ' at least " maybe it was not the most beautiful lyrics we have adopted , said barroso immediately after the deal was clinched shortly before daybreak , but it is " efficient prose . " these views were echoed by belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , who complained that the text had been " disfigured " by footnotes and annexes designed to make it easier for leaders to sell at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's prime minister guy verhofstadt " the constitutional treaty was an easily understandable treaty .
this is a simplified treaty which is very complicated , " said luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker . italian prime minister romano prodi said the treaty agreement had made europe " stronger " but criticized britain for " pulling the breaks " on a more ambitious deal . the former eu commission head accused prime minister tony blair 's government of promoting " a different idea of europe " and hinted that a two-speed eu might emerge in the future . britain was granted opt-outs of a charter setting out citizens ' social and economic rights as well as taking part in eu cooperation on police and judicial matters . praise for merkel german chancellor angela merkel was praised for her handling of the tense and often difficult negotiations , which saw a threat by poland to use its veto if it did n't get its way on voting rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel receives flowers and a kiss from european commission president barroso " she took into consideration the special wishes of several countries in an elegant manner , " said finnish president matti vanhanen after the marathon talks ended in brussels . " without her this result would not have been possible , " hans-gert pöttering , president of the eu parliament , was quoted as telling german sunday newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . pöttering said the new eu treaty preserved much of the substance of the draft buried after its rejection in referendums in the netherlands and france in 2005 . approvals the new treaty , designed to make the eu more effective , drops the word constitution as well as any references to statehood such as a national anthem and flag .
it also incudes a new majority voting system as well as the post of eu president and a high representative in charge of foreign affairs . under the timetable agreed at the brussels summit , leaders of the 27-nation bloc will hold an intergovernmental conference later this year to give formal approval to the treaty .
portgual , which takes on the eu presidency in july , says it would like to approve the treaty at an october summit . after that the ratification process will begin so that the treaty can be in place to coincide with elections to the european parliament in the summer of 2009 . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 23.06.2007 eu treaty blueprint : the central points großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treaty agreed upon replaces the constitution , which was voted down in 2005 the 27 eu member states on saturday agreed on the main contents of a new treaty to replace the bloc 's failed constitution .
they main points are listed below : to some it is another step on the slippery slope towards a european superstate , to others it is a watered-down compromise designed to assuage polish and british misgivings .
the main points of the package , the details of which are still to be thrashed out by an intergovernmental conference , are clear : treaty , not constitution the " reform treaty " will amend the eu 's existing treaty building blocks -lrb- rome 1957 , maastricht 1992 -rrb- as the treaties of amsterdam -lrb- 1996 -rrb- and nice -lrb- 2000 -rrb- did .
the constitutional project , scuppered by ' no ' votes at french and dutch elections would have replaced all of them .
therefore the new text will be much shorter than the weighty 480-page constitution but just as incomprehensible to the layman .
it will steer clear of such controversial terms as " federal state , " and " constitution " itself , as well as eu symbols such as the flag , anthem and motto " strength in diversity , " although , as german chancellor angela merkel said , " despite that i suspect the european anthem will be played and the european flag will fly .
they just wo n't be mentioned in this treaty . "
the existing eu charter of fundamental rights -lrb- 54 articles on political and social rights in europe -rrb- will be referred to in the treaty , rather than be reprised in full .
it will not be binding on britain , which had made it one of its " red lines " for agreeing the deal .
voting system the treaty guidelines includes the constitution 's plan for a " qualified majority voting " system , also called a double majority system , whereby decisions need the support of 55 percent member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's objections to the voting system almost torpedoed the summit to overcome poland 's objection that the system would penalise it to the advantage of large states such as germany , a compromise deal was hastily cobbled together under which the new system will not come into use until 2014 and will then by gradually phased in until 2017 .
after that date if there are not enough states to form a blocking majority , but almost enough , then the measure can be re-examined .

they main points are listed below : to some it is another step on the slippery slope towards a european superstate , to others it is a watered-down compromise designed to assuage polish and british misgivings .
the main points of the package , the details of which are still to be thrashed out by an intergovernmental conference , are clear : treaty , not constitution the " reform treaty " will amend the eu 's existing treaty building blocks -lrb- rome 1957 , maastricht 1992 -rrb- as the treaties of amsterdam -lrb- 1996 -rrb- and nice -lrb- 2000 -rrb- did .
the constitutional project , scuppered by ' no ' votes at french and dutch elections would have replaced all of them .
therefore the new text will be much shorter than the weighty 480-page constitution but just as incomprehensible to the layman .
it will steer clear of such controversial terms as " federal state , " and " constitution " itself , as well as eu symbols such as the flag , anthem and motto " strength in diversity , " although , as german chancellor angela merkel said , " despite that i suspect the european anthem will be played and the european flag will fly .
they just wo n't be mentioned in this treaty . "
the existing eu charter of fundamental rights -lrb- 54 articles on political and social rights in europe -rrb- will be referred to in the treaty , rather than be reprised in full .
it will not be binding on britain , which had made it one of its " red lines " for agreeing the deal .
voting system the treaty guidelines includes the constitution 's plan for a " qualified majority voting " system , also called a double majority system , whereby decisions need the support of 55 percent member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's objections to the voting system almost torpedoed the summit to overcome poland 's objection that the system would penalise it to the advantage of large states such as germany , a compromise deal was hastily cobbled together under which the new system will not come into use until 2014 and will then by gradually phased in until 2017 .

they main points are listed below : to some it is another step on the slippery slope towards a european superstate , to others it is a watered-down compromise designed to assuage polish and british misgivings .
the main points of the package , the details of which are still to be thrashed out by an intergovernmental conference , are clear : treaty , not constitution the " reform treaty " will amend the eu 's existing treaty building blocks -lrb- rome 1957 , maastricht 1992 -rrb- as the treaties of amsterdam -lrb- 1996 -rrb- and nice -lrb- 2000 -rrb- did .
the constitutional project , scuppered by ' no ' votes at french and dutch elections would have replaced all of them .
therefore the new text will be much shorter than the weighty 480-page constitution but just as incomprehensible to the layman .
it will steer clear of such controversial terms as " federal state , " and " constitution " itself , as well as eu symbols such as the flag , anthem and motto " strength in diversity , " although , as german chancellor angela merkel said , " despite that i suspect the european anthem will be played and the european flag will fly .
they just wo n't be mentioned in this treaty . "
the existing eu charter of fundamental rights -lrb- 54 articles on political and social rights in europe -rrb- will be referred to in the treaty , rather than be reprised in full .
it will not be binding on britain , which had made it one of its " red lines " for agreeing the deal .
voting system the treaty guidelines includes the constitution 's plan for a " qualified majority voting " system , also called a double majority system , whereby decisions need the support of 55 percent member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's objections to the voting system almost torpedoed the summit to overcome poland 's objection that the system would penalise it to the advantage of large states such as germany , a compromise deal was hastily cobbled together under which the new system will not come into use until 2014 and will then by gradually phased in until 2017 .
after that date if there are not enough states to form a blocking majority , but almost enough , then the measure can be re-examined .
scope of double majority voting the scope of decisions to be taken by the double majority voting system is extended to 40 new areas , mainly in the police and judicial fields .
however britain will be allowed an opt-in exemption on criminal matters and police cooperation .
national vetoes will still be available for foreign policy , fiscal matters , and social policy among other areas .
institutional changes a new post of president of the european council -lrb- which comprises all eu national leaders -rrb- will be created .
the president will be elected to a two-and-a-half-year term in place of the current system whereby the eu presidency rotates between member states every six months .
the president will organize and chair summits .
the envisaged creation of an eu foreign minister post has morphed into an eu high representative for foreign affairs and security policy , who will have the same powers to lead the eu 's external affairs and will be a vice-president of the european commission , the eu 's executive arm .
the current practice of each member states getting a place on the european commission , the eu 's executive arm will end in 2014 .
after that the number of commissioners will be equal to two-thirds of the member states .
the countries represented will changed by rotation .
reinforcement of national parliaments the dutch obtained a reinforcement of the powers of national parliaments which may demand , if a certain threshold is reached , that the european commission re-examine a draft act which they judge it to impinge on their national competences .
additions various provisions have been bolted on , including a reference to solidarity in the event of an energy supply problem , a point much sought by lithuania and poland , concerned at their own high dependence on russian hydrocarbons .
at the netherlands ' insistence , a reference to criteria for new eu members was added . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

respected economists from the world 's leading industrialized nations have criticized germany for basking in its current economic upswing .
they claim that the reforms taken so far will by no means be sustainable . during a discussion in berlin this week , economists argued that german policymakers were too focused on budget consolidation and reducing the welfare state and less about finding the right instruments for long-term economic growth .
adam posen , from the institute for international economics in washington , dc , said he understands that germans are happy about domestic annual growth rates of about three percent .
but he added that he doubts that the current upswing is a direct result of what he calls the mini-reforms taken by the previous and the current governments .
" the current recovery is what we used to call in financial markets a dead cat bounce , " he said .
" if germany was flat on its back for 15 years , the idea that when the world is booming for several years straight at a level that has n't been seen since the 50s , it somehow manages to get off its back for a couple of years , should not be so surprising . "
the female factor richard freeman from harvard university said germany is far from having done its homework on the labor market .
he noted for instance that german women find it much harder to pursue a job than their peers in the united states . this is because german policymakers have n't really understood the huge economic potential of women here , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two many women are still stuck at home in germany " the difference between the two economies is that the americans work full time and the german women work part time , " he said .
" the americans have day care centers that people use extensively .
it 's also the american day care centers are all-day affairs .
half of your people are women .
they have to play a major role in the economy . "
neglecting seniors if women here have a hard time on the labor market , then so do older workers and pensioners , added david soskice from the australian national university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many older germans leave the worforce far too early " mid-career labor markets and late-career labor markets are very , very illiquid in the german economy , " he said . " if you 're a highly skilled person and lose your job in your mid-forties or early fifties , you ca n't just very easily get another job . "
the export trap adam posen agreed and added that germany 's preoccupation with remaining the world export champion is also quite misleading .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's only one dirk nowitzki " the dirk nowitzki fallacy is : people say , ' because dirk nowitzki won the mvp , all german people are really good basketball players , " ' he said . " similarly , if we look at the companies in germany , there is this tendency to reason backwards from exports .
because there is a couple of little machine tool companies in baden-württemberg that happen to make some exports to china , we can fly the flag and say : ' deutschland exportweltmeister ' -lrb- export champion -rrb- and everything is okay .
but this does n't really mean anything .
there is no correlation between how much you export over the long term and how much you grow . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

respected economists from the world 's leading industrialized nations have criticized germany for basking in its current economic upswing .
they claim that the reforms taken so far will by no means be sustainable . during a discussion in berlin this week , economists argued that german policymakers were too focused on budget consolidation and reducing the welfare state and less about finding the right instruments for long-term economic growth .
adam posen , from the institute for international economics in washington , dc , said he understands that germans are happy about domestic annual growth rates of about three percent .
but he added that he doubts that the current upswing is a direct result of what he calls the mini-reforms taken by the previous and the current governments .
" the current recovery is what we used to call in financial markets a dead cat bounce , " he said .
" if germany was flat on its back for 15 years , the idea that when the world is booming for several years straight at a level that has n't been seen since the 50s , it somehow manages to get off its back for a couple of years , should not be so surprising . "

experts fear that immigrant sufferers in particular are likely to fall through the net . in germany , some one million people are diagnosed with dementia , and the figure is expected to double by 2050 , experts say .
patients require a specialist diagnosis in order to claim insurance , which all too often fails to secure them the support they need .
up to 40 percent of dementia cases end up falling through the net . many of the patients have immigrant backgrounds . in 2004 , the workers ' welfare organization -lrb- awo -rrb- in gelsenkirchen set up a specialist department for migrants , offering information and advice and pushing for change within the country 's hospitals and care homes .
its long-term goal is to see german health care adapt to the needs of immigrants with dementia . the difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking cultural sensitivities into account these needs can be unpredictable .

" many of the immigrants in this country only arrived here at the age of 18 , 19 or 20 , " said reinhard streibel from the awo .

the project is funded by north rhine-westphalia 's ministry for integration , and so far , is the only one of its kind on germany . " we field queries about -lrb- the department -rrb- from all over the country , " streibel said .

cultural and religious prejudice often stand in the way of appropriate treatment , and the gelsenkirchen department wants to do what it can to change these mindsets . " among muslims there are people who believe that a person suffering from dementia is being punished by allah , " torun said .
" when others hear that sort of thing they try to hide the member of the family with the illness and keep them out of sight . " also difficult for turkish families is dealing with parents who need looking after .
traditionally , they are the head of the family - and shown due respect .
a sudden onset of dementia , with the loss of dignity it usually entails , can be traumatic for families used to unbending hierarchies . " family members can have trouble adjusting to the fact that their father is no longer able to be in charge , " torun said .
" suddenly he needs looking after , he no longer recognizes his own children . " but like many other countries , turkey has also seen a shift in family values .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 23.06.2007 last-minute compromise saves eu summit from failure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president lech kaczyniski agreed to a compromise on the voting issue the european union on saturday reached agreement on a blueprint for a new treaty of reforms after striking a compromise with poland following tense all-night talks at a crucial summit . german chancellor angela merkel hailed a " good compromise " with poland over the voting system in the proposed treaty , the issue which had prompted poland 's populist leaders to threaten to block a deal .
merkel said the agreement would make a bloc which has grown from 15 member states to 27 since 2004 better able to act .
the new treaty will replace the union 's failed constitution , which was torpedoed after voters in france and the netherlands rejected it in 2005 .
" i was sure that if we had not achieved this today we would have ended up in a rather disastrous situation as many would have thought they had been pushed too far , " said merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency till the end of the month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signs were not looking good for success until the last minute " we have managed to organize things so that no one can go home and feel they have been put in the corner , " she said .
frustrated by stonewalling on the part of poland 's leaders , merkel threatened to move ahead on a new treaty with or without their blessing .
the move spurred a revolt by warsaw 's friends but also triggered a flurry of mediation that ultimately convinced poland to compromise .
the agreement means the full introduction of decision-making rules poland had vehemently opposed will be postponed from 2009 until 2017 .
britain is allowed a exemption from a binding set of human rights provisions other states signed up to .
' solidarity ' polish president lech kaczynski thanked france and britain for their " solidarity " in helping to broker a deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if no agreement had been reached , many wondered about the bloc 's future british prime minister tony blair , in his final summit before leaving office next week , and newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy , had both engaged in attempts in the early hours of saturday to persuade the polish president and his twin brother , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , to drop their opposition .
the kaczynskis had shocked european diplomats ahead of the summit by evoking their country 's mass destruction at the hands of the nazis in world war two as an argument for it to get its way on the voting issue .
spelling out the compromise , merkel said the double majority voting system - which poland strongly opposed because it fears it will give big countries too much decision-making power - would not be introduced until 2014 and would then be phased in over the next three years .
the chancellor said the compromise on the voting mechanism was " what poland desired . "
sarkozy acknowledged the talks had come close to failure , but hailed the deal as " very good news for europe . "
in a reference to poland , he said : " it was not possible to ignore the biggest country in eastern europe . "
blair 's swansong prime minister tony blair ended his swansong appearance on the international stage on a high note .
his last eu stand was a triumphant one - he stands down as prime minister next week - secured all the key points without which he said he would not do a deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was tony blair 's last eu summit as british prime minister blair said the accord was a " chance to move on " after the " bind " which the european union had got itself into with the doomed constitutional treaty .
" the most important thing is that it allows us to move on to things that are ultimately far more important , " he told reporters after the deal was clinched .
" it gives us a chance to concentrate on the issues to do with the economy , organized crime , terrorism , immigration , defense , climate change , the environment , energy , the problems that really concern the citizens of europe . "
blair largely succeeded in sticking to the four " red line " conditions he set for agreement on the new treaty - that britain would not cede control over foreign policy , its judicial and police system , tax and social security rules , and an eu charter of fundamental rights .
" i am sorry that mr. blair is going ; he has always been a man who sought compromise in europe , " said sarkozy .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen paid a warm tribute , saying blair " has contributed in a very valuable way to european cooperation , " adding : " he 's really a pro-european . "
chancellor merkel said that the late finish to the negotiations meant " i was only able to utter a few warm words and express thanks to him . "
merkel said the agreement reached at the summit meant there was a " good chance " that a new treaty could go into force in 2009 when elections to the european parliament take place . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they main points are listed below : to some it is another step on the slippery slope towards a european superstate , to others it is a watered-down compromise designed to assuage polish and british misgivings .
the main points of the package , the details of which are still to be thrashed out by an intergovernmental conference , are clear : treaty , not constitution the " reform treaty " will amend the eu 's existing treaty building blocks -lrb- rome 1957 , maastricht 1992 -rrb- as the treaties of amsterdam -lrb- 1996 -rrb- and nice -lrb- 2000 -rrb- did .
the constitutional project , scuppered by ' no ' votes at french and dutch elections would have replaced all of them .
therefore the new text will be much shorter than the weighty 480-page constitution but just as incomprehensible to the layman .
it will steer clear of such controversial terms as " federal state , " and " constitution " itself , as well as eu symbols such as the flag , anthem and motto " strength in diversity , " although , as german chancellor angela merkel said , " despite that i suspect the european anthem will be played and the european flag will fly .
they just wo n't be mentioned in this treaty . "
the existing eu charter of fundamental rights -lrb- 54 articles on political and social rights in europe -rrb- will be referred to in the treaty , rather than be reprised in full .
it will not be binding on britain , which had made it one of its " red lines " for agreeing the deal .
voting system the treaty guidelines includes the constitution 's plan for a " qualified majority voting " system , also called a double majority system , whereby decisions need the support of 55 percent member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's objections to the voting system almost torpedoed the summit to overcome poland 's objection that the system would penalise it to the advantage of large states such as germany , a compromise deal was hastily cobbled together under which the new system will not come into use until 2014 and will then by gradually phased in until 2017 .
after that date if there are not enough states to form a blocking majority , but almost enough , then the measure can be re-examined .
scope of double majority voting the scope of decisions to be taken by the double majority voting system is extended to 40 new areas , mainly in the police and judicial fields .
however britain will be allowed an opt-in exemption on criminal matters and police cooperation .
national vetoes will still be available for foreign policy , fiscal matters , and social policy among other areas .
institutional changes a new post of president of the european council -lrb- which comprises all eu national leaders -rrb- will be created .
the president will be elected to a two-and-a-half-year term in place of the current system whereby the eu presidency rotates between member states every six months .
the president will organize and chair summits .
the envisaged creation of an eu foreign minister post has morphed into an eu high representative for foreign affairs and security policy , who will have the same powers to lead the eu 's external affairs and will be a vice-president of the european commission , the eu 's executive arm .
the current practice of each member states getting a place on the european commission , the eu 's executive arm will end in 2014 .
after that the number of commissioners will be equal to two-thirds of the member states .
the countries represented will changed by rotation .
reinforcement of national parliaments the dutch obtained a reinforcement of the powers of national parliaments which may demand , if a certain threshold is reached , that the european commission re-examine a draft act which they judge it to impinge on their national competences .

they main points are listed below : to some it is another step on the slippery slope towards a european superstate , to others it is a watered-down compromise designed to assuage polish and british misgivings .
the main points of the package , the details of which are still to be thrashed out by an intergovernmental conference , are clear : treaty , not constitution the " reform treaty " will amend the eu 's existing treaty building blocks -lrb- rome 1957 , maastricht 1992 -rrb- as the treaties of amsterdam -lrb- 1996 -rrb- and nice -lrb- 2000 -rrb- did .
the constitutional project , scuppered by ' no ' votes at french and dutch elections would have replaced all of them .
therefore the new text will be much shorter than the weighty 480-page constitution but just as incomprehensible to the layman .
it will steer clear of such controversial terms as " federal state , " and " constitution " itself , as well as eu symbols such as the flag , anthem and motto " strength in diversity , " although , as german chancellor angela merkel said , " despite that i suspect the european anthem will be played and the european flag will fly .
they just wo n't be mentioned in this treaty . "
the existing eu charter of fundamental rights -lrb- 54 articles on political and social rights in europe -rrb- will be referred to in the treaty , rather than be reprised in full .
it will not be binding on britain , which had made it one of its " red lines " for agreeing the deal .
voting system the treaty guidelines includes the constitution 's plan for a " qualified majority voting " system , also called a double majority system , whereby decisions need the support of 55 percent member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's objections to the voting system almost torpedoed the summit to overcome poland 's objection that the system would penalise it to the advantage of large states such as germany , a compromise deal was hastily cobbled together under which the new system will not come into use until 2014 and will then by gradually phased in until 2017 .
after that date if there are not enough states to form a blocking majority , but almost enough , then the measure can be re-examined .
scope of double majority voting the scope of decisions to be taken by the double majority voting system is extended to 40 new areas , mainly in the police and judicial fields .
however britain will be allowed an opt-in exemption on criminal matters and police cooperation .
national vetoes will still be available for foreign policy , fiscal matters , and social policy among other areas .
institutional changes a new post of president of the european council -lrb- which comprises all eu national leaders -rrb- will be created .
the president will be elected to a two-and-a-half-year term in place of the current system whereby the eu presidency rotates between member states every six months .
the president will organize and chair summits .
the envisaged creation of an eu foreign minister post has morphed into an eu high representative for foreign affairs and security policy , who will have the same powers to lead the eu 's external affairs and will be a vice-president of the european commission , the eu 's executive arm .
the current practice of each member states getting a place on the european commission , the eu 's executive arm will end in 2014 .
after that the number of commissioners will be equal to two-thirds of the member states .
the countries represented will changed by rotation .
reinforcement of national parliaments the dutch obtained a reinforcement of the powers of national parliaments which may demand , if a certain threshold is reached , that the european commission re-examine a draft act which they judge it to impinge on their national competences .
additions various provisions have been bolted on , including a reference to solidarity in the event of an energy supply problem , a point much sought by lithuania and poland , concerned at their own high dependence on russian hydrocarbons .

merkel said the agreement would make a bloc which has grown from 15 member states to 27 since 2004 better able to act .
the new treaty will replace the union 's failed constitution , which was torpedoed after voters in france and the netherlands rejected it in 2005 .
" i was sure that if we had not achieved this today we would have ended up in a rather disastrous situation as many would have thought they had been pushed too far , " said merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency till the end of the month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signs were not looking good for success until the last minute " we have managed to organize things so that no one can go home and feel they have been put in the corner , " she said .
frustrated by stonewalling on the part of poland 's leaders , merkel threatened to move ahead on a new treaty with or without their blessing .
the move spurred a revolt by warsaw 's friends but also triggered a flurry of mediation that ultimately convinced poland to compromise .
the agreement means the full introduction of decision-making rules poland had vehemently opposed will be postponed from 2009 until 2017 .
britain is allowed a exemption from a binding set of human rights provisions other states signed up to .
' solidarity ' polish president lech kaczynski thanked france and britain for their " solidarity " in helping to broker a deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if no agreement had been reached , many wondered about the bloc 's future british prime minister tony blair , in his final summit before leaving office next week , and newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy , had both engaged in attempts in the early hours of saturday to persuade the polish president and his twin brother , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , to drop their opposition .
the kaczynskis had shocked european diplomats ahead of the summit by evoking their country 's mass destruction at the hands of the nazis in world war two as an argument for it to get its way on the voting issue .
spelling out the compromise , merkel said the double majority voting system - which poland strongly opposed because it fears it will give big countries too much decision-making power - would not be introduced until 2014 and would then be phased in over the next three years .
the chancellor said the compromise on the voting mechanism was " what poland desired . "
sarkozy acknowledged the talks had come close to failure , but hailed the deal as " very good news for europe . "
in a reference to poland , he said : " it was not possible to ignore the biggest country in eastern europe . "
blair 's swansong prime minister tony blair ended his swansong appearance on the international stage on a high note .
his last eu stand was a triumphant one - he stands down as prime minister next week - secured all the key points without which he said he would not do a deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was tony blair 's last eu summit as british prime minister blair said the accord was a " chance to move on " after the " bind " which the european union had got itself into with the doomed constitutional treaty .
" the most important thing is that it allows us to move on to things that are ultimately far more important , " he told reporters after the deal was clinched .
" it gives us a chance to concentrate on the issues to do with the economy , organized crime , terrorism , immigration , defense , climate change , the environment , energy , the problems that really concern the citizens of europe . "
blair largely succeeded in sticking to the four " red line " conditions he set for agreement on the new treaty - that britain would not cede control over foreign policy , its judicial and police system , tax and social security rules , and an eu charter of fundamental rights .
" i am sorry that mr. blair is going ; he has always been a man who sought compromise in europe , " said sarkozy .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen paid a warm tribute , saying blair " has contributed in a very valuable way to european cooperation , " adding : " he 's really a pro-european . "
chancellor merkel said that the late finish to the negotiations meant " i was only able to utter a few warm words and express thanks to him . "
merkel said the agreement reached at the summit meant there was a " good chance " that a new treaty could go into force in 2009 when elections to the european parliament take place . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they main points are listed below : to some it is another step on the slippery slope towards a european superstate , to others it is a watered-down compromise designed to assuage polish and british misgivings .
the main points of the package , the details of which are still to be thrashed out by an intergovernmental conference , are clear : treaty , not constitution the " reform treaty " will amend the eu 's existing treaty building blocks -lrb- rome 1957 , maastricht 1992 -rrb- as the treaties of amsterdam -lrb- 1996 -rrb- and nice -lrb- 2000 -rrb- did .
the constitutional project , scuppered by ' no ' votes at french and dutch elections would have replaced all of them .
therefore the new text will be much shorter than the weighty 480-page constitution but just as incomprehensible to the layman .
it will steer clear of such controversial terms as " federal state , " and " constitution " itself , as well as eu symbols such as the flag , anthem and motto " strength in diversity , " although , as german chancellor angela merkel said , " despite that i suspect the european anthem will be played and the european flag will fly .
they just wo n't be mentioned in this treaty . "
the existing eu charter of fundamental rights -lrb- 54 articles on political and social rights in europe -rrb- will be referred to in the treaty , rather than be reprised in full .
it will not be binding on britain , which had made it one of its " red lines " for agreeing the deal .
voting system the treaty guidelines includes the constitution 's plan for a " qualified majority voting " system , also called a double majority system , whereby decisions need the support of 55 percent member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's objections to the voting system almost torpedoed the summit to overcome poland 's objection that the system would penalise it to the advantage of large states such as germany , a compromise deal was hastily cobbled together under which the new system will not come into use until 2014 and will then by gradually phased in until 2017 .
after that date if there are not enough states to form a blocking majority , but almost enough , then the measure can be re-examined .
scope of double majority voting the scope of decisions to be taken by the double majority voting system is extended to 40 new areas , mainly in the police and judicial fields .

" it is a good and a new treaty .
holland and europe can use it to move on , " balkenende said , adding that " the treaty has been changed and the discussion about the constitution has been closed .

" these views were echoed by belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , who complained that the text had been " disfigured " by footnotes and annexes designed to make it easier for leaders to sell at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's prime minister guy verhofstadt " the constitutional treaty was an easily understandable treaty .
this is a simplified treaty which is very complicated , " said luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker . italian prime minister romano prodi said the treaty agreement had made europe " stronger " but criticized britain for " pulling the breaks " on a more ambitious deal . the former eu commission head accused prime minister tony blair 's government of promoting " a different idea of europe " and hinted that a two-speed eu might emerge in the future . britain was granted opt-outs of a charter setting out citizens ' social and economic rights as well as taking part in eu cooperation on police and judicial matters . praise for merkel german chancellor angela merkel was praised for her handling of the tense and often difficult negotiations , which saw a threat by poland to use its veto if it did n't get its way on voting rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel receives flowers and a kiss from european commission president barroso " she took into consideration the special wishes of several countries in an elegant manner , " said finnish president matti vanhanen after the marathon talks ended in brussels . " without her this result would not have been possible , " hans-gert pöttering , president of the eu parliament , was quoted as telling german sunday newspaper frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . pöttering said the new eu treaty preserved much of the substance of the draft buried after its rejection in referendums in the netherlands and france in 2005 . approvals the new treaty , designed to make the eu more effective , drops the word constitution as well as any references to statehood such as a national anthem and flag .
it also incudes a new majority voting system as well as the post of eu president and a high representative in charge of foreign affairs . under the timetable agreed at the brussels summit , leaders of the 27-nation bloc will hold an intergovernmental conference later this year to give formal approval to the treaty .
portgual , which takes on the eu presidency in july , says it would like to approve the treaty at an october summit . after that the ratification process will begin so that the treaty can be in place to coincide with elections to the european parliament in the summer of 2009 . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel said the agreement would make a bloc which has grown from 15 member states to 27 since 2004 better able to act .
the new treaty will replace the union 's failed constitution , which was torpedoed after voters in france and the netherlands rejected it in 2005 .
" i was sure that if we had not achieved this today we would have ended up in a rather disastrous situation as many would have thought they had been pushed too far , " said merkel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency till the end of the month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signs were not looking good for success until the last minute " we have managed to organize things so that no one can go home and feel they have been put in the corner , " she said .
frustrated by stonewalling on the part of poland 's leaders , merkel threatened to move ahead on a new treaty with or without their blessing .
the move spurred a revolt by warsaw 's friends but also triggered a flurry of mediation that ultimately convinced poland to compromise .
the agreement means the full introduction of decision-making rules poland had vehemently opposed will be postponed from 2009 until 2017 .
britain is allowed a exemption from a binding set of human rights provisions other states signed up to .
' solidarity ' polish president lech kaczynski thanked france and britain for their " solidarity " in helping to broker a deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if no agreement had been reached , many wondered about the bloc 's future british prime minister tony blair , in his final summit before leaving office next week , and newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy , had both engaged in attempts in the early hours of saturday to persuade the polish president and his twin brother , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , to drop their opposition .
the kaczynskis had shocked european diplomats ahead of the summit by evoking their country 's mass destruction at the hands of the nazis in world war two as an argument for it to get its way on the voting issue .
spelling out the compromise , merkel said the double majority voting system - which poland strongly opposed because it fears it will give big countries too much decision-making power - would not be introduced until 2014 and would then be phased in over the next three years .
the chancellor said the compromise on the voting mechanism was " what poland desired . "
sarkozy acknowledged the talks had come close to failure , but hailed the deal as " very good news for europe . "
in a reference to poland , he said : " it was not possible to ignore the biggest country in eastern europe . "
blair 's swansong prime minister tony blair ended his swansong appearance on the international stage on a high note .
his last eu stand was a triumphant one - he stands down as prime minister next week - secured all the key points without which he said he would not do a deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was tony blair 's last eu summit as british prime minister blair said the accord was a " chance to move on " after the " bind " which the european union had got itself into with the doomed constitutional treaty .
" the most important thing is that it allows us to move on to things that are ultimately far more important , " he told reporters after the deal was clinched .
" it gives us a chance to concentrate on the issues to do with the economy , organized crime , terrorism , immigration , defense , climate change , the environment , energy , the problems that really concern the citizens of europe . "
blair largely succeeded in sticking to the four " red line " conditions he set for agreement on the new treaty - that britain would not cede control over foreign policy , its judicial and police system , tax and social security rules , and an eu charter of fundamental rights .
" i am sorry that mr. blair is going ; he has always been a man who sought compromise in europe , " said sarkozy .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen paid a warm tribute , saying blair " has contributed in a very valuable way to european cooperation , " adding : " he 's really a pro-european . "
chancellor merkel said that the late finish to the negotiations meant " i was only able to utter a few warm words and express thanks to him . "
merkel said the agreement reached at the summit meant there was a " good chance " that a new treaty could go into force in 2009 when elections to the european parliament take place . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they main points are listed below : to some it is another step on the slippery slope towards a european superstate , to others it is a watered-down compromise designed to assuage polish and british misgivings .
the main points of the package , the details of which are still to be thrashed out by an intergovernmental conference , are clear : treaty , not constitution the " reform treaty " will amend the eu 's existing treaty building blocks -lrb- rome 1957 , maastricht 1992 -rrb- as the treaties of amsterdam -lrb- 1996 -rrb- and nice -lrb- 2000 -rrb- did .
the constitutional project , scuppered by ' no ' votes at french and dutch elections would have replaced all of them .
therefore the new text will be much shorter than the weighty 480-page constitution but just as incomprehensible to the layman .
it will steer clear of such controversial terms as " federal state , " and " constitution " itself , as well as eu symbols such as the flag , anthem and motto " strength in diversity , " although , as german chancellor angela merkel said , " despite that i suspect the european anthem will be played and the european flag will fly .
they just wo n't be mentioned in this treaty . "
the existing eu charter of fundamental rights -lrb- 54 articles on political and social rights in europe -rrb- will be referred to in the treaty , rather than be reprised in full .
it will not be binding on britain , which had made it one of its " red lines " for agreeing the deal .
voting system the treaty guidelines includes the constitution 's plan for a " qualified majority voting " system , also called a double majority system , whereby decisions need the support of 55 percent member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's objections to the voting system almost torpedoed the summit to overcome poland 's objection that the system would penalise it to the advantage of large states such as germany , a compromise deal was hastily cobbled together under which the new system will not come into use until 2014 and will then by gradually phased in until 2017 .
after that date if there are not enough states to form a blocking majority , but almost enough , then the measure can be re-examined .
scope of double majority voting the scope of decisions to be taken by the double majority voting system is extended to 40 new areas , mainly in the police and judicial fields .
however britain will be allowed an opt-in exemption on criminal matters and police cooperation .
national vetoes will still be available for foreign policy , fiscal matters , and social policy among other areas .
institutional changes a new post of president of the european council -lrb- which comprises all eu national leaders -rrb- will be created .
the president will be elected to a two-and-a-half-year term in place of the current system whereby the eu presidency rotates between member states every six months .
the president will organize and chair summits .
the envisaged creation of an eu foreign minister post has morphed into an eu high representative for foreign affairs and security policy , who will have the same powers to lead the eu 's external affairs and will be a vice-president of the european commission , the eu 's executive arm .
the current practice of each member states getting a place on the european commission , the eu 's executive arm will end in 2014 .
after that the number of commissioners will be equal to two-thirds of the member states .
the countries represented will changed by rotation .
reinforcement of national parliaments the dutch obtained a reinforcement of the powers of national parliaments which may demand , if a certain threshold is reached , that the european commission re-examine a draft act which they judge it to impinge on their national competences .
additions various provisions have been bolted on , including a reference to solidarity in the event of an energy supply problem , a point much sought by lithuania and poland , concerned at their own high dependence on russian hydrocarbons .

experts fear that immigrant sufferers in particular are likely to fall through the net . in germany , some one million people are diagnosed with dementia , and the figure is expected to double by 2050 , experts say .
patients require a specialist diagnosis in order to claim insurance , which all too often fails to secure them the support they need .
up to 40 percent of dementia cases end up falling through the net . many of the patients have immigrant backgrounds . in 2004 , the workers ' welfare organization -lrb- awo -rrb- in gelsenkirchen set up a specialist department for migrants , offering information and advice and pushing for change within the country 's hospitals and care homes .
its long-term goal is to see german health care adapt to the needs of immigrants with dementia . the difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking cultural sensitivities into account these needs can be unpredictable .
one of the first symptoms of dementia is a loss of short-term memory . the recollections that remain tend to be of events that happened in the patients ' childhoods . so when the patient comes from another country , their carers often find themselves unable to help . " many of the immigrants in this country only arrived here at the age of 18 , 19 or 20 , " said reinhard streibel from the awo . " they came here to work , and now they 're in their 60s and 70s . even though they might have learnt to speak german at work , or by getting to know their neighbors and so on , as soon as they begin to show the symptoms of dementia , they will start to forget the german language . " most treatment and support so far provided by the health services is tailored to the needs of german patients .
streibel said it is high time more culturally diverse services were made available , and his department - with its official name " you are not alone " - aims to take a first step towards a gradual improvement .
the project is funded by north rhine-westphalia 's ministry for integration , and so far , is the only one of its kind on germany . " we field queries about -lrb- the department -rrb- from all over the country , " streibel said .
" to begin with , most of the interest came from the turkish community , but over time we 've seen growing interest from polish and russian families . " the department prints information leaflets on the illness and how to seek help in germany .
it also provides memory cards and a dvd about coping with dementia . this was developed in cooperation with the turkish alzheimer 's ' society based in ankara and was originally broadcast on turkish tv to mark world alzheimer 's ' day . tradition and taboo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's retirement home for turks according to the experts , the issue has long been taboo in turkey .
turkish-born bedia torun , a consultant with " you are not alone , " said this is partly because dementia is only now becoming more common in the country . " the average life expectancy used to be lower in turkey than in other european nations , " she said . " that means that people tended to die before they reached the age when dementia usually hits . " on average , this happens at 65 .
but now that life expectancy in turkey has risen to 71.3 - according to the turkish statistics office - dementia has become more widespread . rare as it has been , many still feel the illness is shrouded in shame .
cultural and religious prejudice often stand in the way of appropriate treatment , and the gelsenkirchen department wants to do what it can to change these mindsets . " among muslims there are people who believe that a person suffering from dementia is being punished by allah , " torun said .
" when others hear that sort of thing they try to hide the member of the family with the illness and keep them out of sight . " also difficult for turkish families is dealing with parents who need looking after .
traditionally , they are the head of the family - and shown due respect .
a sudden onset of dementia , with the loss of dignity it usually entails , can be traumatic for families used to unbending hierarchies . " family members can have trouble adjusting to the fact that their father is no longer able to be in charge , " torun said .
" suddenly he needs looking after , he no longer recognizes his own children . " but like many other countries , turkey has also seen a shift in family values .
often , children have grown up and moved away .
then , care of ailing relatives has to be done by professionals in the absence of nearby family members .
this is another reason why germany has to improve its support programs . " we need to be able to provide more turkish-language services for migrants struck by dementia , " streibel said .

groups , including greenpeace and the climate justice programme , have been petitioning the global body to list the locations as " in danger " .
nations that have signed the un world heritage convention have a legal duty to cut emissions , the campaigners say .
the convention 's committee is currently meeting in new zealand .
the global agreement was set up to ensure the long-term protection of important cultural and natural sites .
listed locations deemed to be at risk can be added to a " in danger " list , allowing them to be granted extra funding and protection .
to date , 184 nations are signatories of the convention , which was formed in 1972 .
' substantial cuts ' the petitioners hope the 21-nation governing committee will use the gathering in christchurch to acknowledge the threat climate change poses to the sites .
" the committee will discuss a draft policy document on climate change , " explained peter roderick , co-ordinator of the climate justice programme .
" we are asking the committee to recognise the need for substantial emission cuts . "
the sites the groups want added to the " in danger " list are : great barrier reef , australia sagarmatha national park -lrb- which includes mount everest -rrb- , nepal belize barrier reef , belize huascaran national park , peru waterton-glacier international peace park , us / canada border blue mountains , australia the petitions , which began in 2004 , have attracted a number of high-profile signatories , including everest climber sir edmund hillary and bbc film-maker / naturalist sir david attenborough .
at last year 's meeting , the world heritage committee rejected a motion calling for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions .
despite the set back , the campaigners want the governing committee to reconsider its position .
" we can save our world heritage for future generations , but only if we take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas pollution , " said phil freeman of climate action network australia .
the world heritage committee 's annual meeting runs until 2 july .

" the committee will discuss a draft policy document on climate change , " explained peter roderick , co-ordinator of the climate justice programme .
" we are asking the committee to recognise the need for substantial emission cuts . "
the sites the groups want added to the " in danger " list are : great barrier reef , australia sagarmatha national park -lrb- which includes mount everest -rrb- , nepal belize barrier reef , belize huascaran national park , peru waterton-glacier international peace park , us / canada border blue mountains , australia the petitions , which began in 2004 , have attracted a number of high-profile signatories , including everest climber sir edmund hillary and bbc film-maker / naturalist sir david attenborough .
at last year 's meeting , the world heritage committee rejected a motion calling for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions .
despite the set back , the campaigners want the governing committee to reconsider its position .
" we can save our world heritage for future generations , but only if we take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas pollution , " said phil freeman of climate action network australia .

his time in office has not been without controversy , starting with his initial appointment as attorney general in 2001 .
this created a political row , as many mps thought whoever held this office should be in the commons and not the house of lords .
peter henry goldsmith was born on 5 january , 1950 in liverpool , where he was brought up .
he was educated at quarry bank high school , liverpool , before reading law at gonville and caius college cambridge , achieving a double first-class honours degree .
after a master 's degree at university college , london , he was called to the bar in 1972 .
prior to his appointment as attorney general he was co-chairman of the iba 's human rights institute and had a glittering legal career .
he became chairman of the law society by the age of 40 and in 1995 was chairman of the bar of england and wales .
tony blair said that lord goldsmith had " made a huge contribution " to the government 's success in improving the criminal justice system .
gordon brown added that he had given " outstanding service " to the country and that " his contribution to the country and this government has been immense , not least through transforming the crown prosecution service " .
political controversies lord goldsmith ran into controversy once again in 2003 when he was called upon to advise the government on the legalities of the iraq war .
his advice was that the invasion of iraq would be legal under international law but he has had to strongly deny claims that this decision was influenced by political pressure .
he has been vocal in his opposition to the existence of the detainees ' camp at guantanamo bay , describing it as " unacceptable " and calling for it to be closed .
lord goldsmith has also faced criticism over the investigation into alleged bribes paid by bae systems to saudi prince bandar bin sultan .
bae is alleged to have made payments to the prince in connection with the saudi arms deal , with the knowledge of the ministry of defence .
both the prince and bae systems deny receiving any improper payments and lord goldsmith denies claims he concealed payment details from fraud investigators .
legal obligations lord goldsmith 's role in deciding whether any charges should be brought in the cash for honours investigation has also been called into question .
should the crown prosecution service decide to bring charges , some of these would require the personal consent of the attorney general .
critics have said he should stand aside from any involvement , alleging a " conflict of interest " because of his political links to tony blair , who awarded him his peerage and invited him to join cabinet meetings .
but lord goldsmith has insisted he can not avoid his legal obligation .
in the event that is consulted by the cps on the cash-for-honours case , he would appoint an independent senior counsel to advise on prosecutions , he says .
lord goldsmith 's personal life came under the spotlight early in 2007 when he admitted having an extra-marital affair .
the 57-year-old married father-of-four said his wife joy had known about his former affair with kim hollis , the first asian woman to become a qc , " for a long time " .

his time in office has not been without controversy , starting with his initial appointment as attorney general in 2001 .
this created a political row , as many mps thought whoever held this office should be in the commons and not the house of lords .
peter henry goldsmith was born on 5 january , 1950 in liverpool , where he was brought up .
he was educated at quarry bank high school , liverpool , before reading law at gonville and caius college cambridge , achieving a double first-class honours degree .
after a master 's degree at university college , london , he was called to the bar in 1972 .
prior to his appointment as attorney general he was co-chairman of the iba 's human rights institute and had a glittering legal career .
he became chairman of the law society by the age of 40 and in 1995 was chairman of the bar of england and wales .
tony blair said that lord goldsmith had " made a huge contribution " to the government 's success in improving the criminal justice system .
gordon brown added that he had given " outstanding service " to the country and that " his contribution to the country and this government has been immense , not least through transforming the crown prosecution service " .
political controversies lord goldsmith ran into controversy once again in 2003 when he was called upon to advise the government on the legalities of the iraq war .
his advice was that the invasion of iraq would be legal under international law but he has had to strongly deny claims that this decision was influenced by political pressure .
he has been vocal in his opposition to the existence of the detainees ' camp at guantanamo bay , describing it as " unacceptable " and calling for it to be closed .
lord goldsmith has also faced criticism over the investigation into alleged bribes paid by bae systems to saudi prince bandar bin sultan .
bae is alleged to have made payments to the prince in connection with the saudi arms deal , with the knowledge of the ministry of defence .
both the prince and bae systems deny receiving any improper payments and lord goldsmith denies claims he concealed payment details from fraud investigators .
legal obligations lord goldsmith 's role in deciding whether any charges should be brought in the cash for honours investigation has also been called into question .
should the crown prosecution service decide to bring charges , some of these would require the personal consent of the attorney general .
critics have said he should stand aside from any involvement , alleging a " conflict of interest " because of his political links to tony blair , who awarded him his peerage and invited him to join cabinet meetings .
but lord goldsmith has insisted he can not avoid his legal obligation .
in the event that is consulted by the cps on the cash-for-honours case , he would appoint an independent senior counsel to advise on prosecutions , he says .

his time in office has not been without controversy , starting with his initial appointment as attorney general in 2001 .
this created a political row , as many mps thought whoever held this office should be in the commons and not the house of lords .
peter henry goldsmith was born on 5 january , 1950 in liverpool , where he was brought up .
he was educated at quarry bank high school , liverpool , before reading law at gonville and caius college cambridge , achieving a double first-class honours degree .
after a master 's degree at university college , london , he was called to the bar in 1972 .
prior to his appointment as attorney general he was co-chairman of the iba 's human rights institute and had a glittering legal career .
he became chairman of the law society by the age of 40 and in 1995 was chairman of the bar of england and wales .
tony blair said that lord goldsmith had " made a huge contribution " to the government 's success in improving the criminal justice system .
gordon brown added that he had given " outstanding service " to the country and that " his contribution to the country and this government has been immense , not least through transforming the crown prosecution service " .
political controversies lord goldsmith ran into controversy once again in 2003 when he was called upon to advise the government on the legalities of the iraq war .
his advice was that the invasion of iraq would be legal under international law but he has had to strongly deny claims that this decision was influenced by political pressure .
he has been vocal in his opposition to the existence of the detainees ' camp at guantanamo bay , describing it as " unacceptable " and calling for it to be closed .
lord goldsmith has also faced criticism over the investigation into alleged bribes paid by bae systems to saudi prince bandar bin sultan .
bae is alleged to have made payments to the prince in connection with the saudi arms deal , with the knowledge of the ministry of defence .
both the prince and bae systems deny receiving any improper payments and lord goldsmith denies claims he concealed payment details from fraud investigators .
legal obligations lord goldsmith 's role in deciding whether any charges should be brought in the cash for honours investigation has also been called into question .
should the crown prosecution service decide to bring charges , some of these would require the personal consent of the attorney general .
critics have said he should stand aside from any involvement , alleging a " conflict of interest " because of his political links to tony blair , who awarded him his peerage and invited him to join cabinet meetings .
but lord goldsmith has insisted he can not avoid his legal obligation .
in the event that is consulted by the cps on the cash-for-honours case , he would appoint an independent senior counsel to advise on prosecutions , he says .
lord goldsmith 's personal life came under the spotlight early in 2007 when he admitted having an extra-marital affair .
the 57-year-old married father-of-four said his wife joy had known about his former affair with kim hollis , the first asian woman to become a qc , " for a long time " .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- moneybox -pipe- have your say : buy-to-let bbc news / moneybox graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- saturday , 23 june 2007 , 10:00 gmt 11:00 uk have your say : buy-to-let the tax relief offered to buy-to-let owners should be removed , says the president of the chartered institute of housing -lrb- cih -rrb- .
paul diggory has called on the government to tackle the " runaway " market which he says is contributing to problems faced by first-time buyers .
he says buy-to-let owners have a financial advantage over those trying to buy their first home , and push house prices even higher .
we asked for your comments , a selection of which are below .
this debate is now closed .
listen to yourselves .
we have become a nation of greedy , self-centred , something-for-nothing pension and house-price obsessives .
and if you have n't got it , you squeal because someone else has .
being young , healthy and free with loving family and friends beats all the pension nonsense hands down .
f gray , laide i am a buy-to-let landlord but can see no logic at all in mortgage tax relief .
it allows higher prices to be afforded and provides an unfair advantage over first-time buyers .
landlords do not qualify for business capital gains taper relief so why should they get business tax relief on loan interest ?
michael hunt , hungerford brilliant idea !
tax to the hilt the very people who are providing a solution to those that can not afford to buy , so there will be an even worse housing crisis !
sheer genius !
rob cargill , london " to suggest that these buy-to-let landlords are somehow putting themselves out to provide a public service is just ridiculous " brian , glasgow i would be quite happy if some of the buy-to-let landlords had to sell up if they were taxed .
profiting from property for commercial use is one thing , profiting from what is a basic right of society for everyone to have a roof over their heads is just obscene .
to suggest that these buy-to-let landlords are somehow putting themselves out to provide a public service is just ridiculous .
brian , glasgow i own one property which i let out .
if tax relief on mortgage interest was abolished , the only thing this would achieve would be to push up rents by about 40 % - hardly good news for tenants .
mr m , london buy-to-let is just the same as if a small number of speculators bought up all the food , and then when people were hungry enough , sold it back to them at inflated prices .
the practise of btl should be heavily discouraged , it 's the main cause of the misery of high house prices .
tomo redfern , london " believe me , being a landlord creates just as many headaches as any other self-employed job " helen mcginty , birmingham buying houses to rent is my job .
i am a self-employed landlord .
i do n't have another job , this is what i do to earn a living .
for those of you who think most of us are making a fortune out of rental properties , you are sadly wrong ; not to mention all the hassle we have with tenants not paying , trashing our properties , repair work , etc .
believe me , being a landlord creates just as many headaches as any other self-employed job ever could , and at the end of it , when it 's time to sell the property , the chancellor makes a small fortune in capital gains tax .
so , i would suggest you take that in to consideration before you start saying we should be taxed even more .
helen mcginty , birmingham buy-to let landlords provide my family with a rented home .
where will we live if buy-to-let ceases to be a wise investment ?
surely the uk is still a " free " land where we are not forced to buy property to live in a house , or does the government wish to own property again .
i think not .
steven hunt , ashford i suggest if you ca n't afford to buy and you 're in the position of having to pay extortionate rents to private landlords ; join the social housing list and put pressure on them to find you somewhere .
the people i know who rent socially pay about 1/4 of the price of private rents and they have pretty good place .
david , london ninety per cent of those demanding the change in the law are people who wish they were in the position to own a buy-to-let property themselves .
there is no empirical evidence that landlords are crowding out the property market and if anything , demand for rented accommodation is , more often than not , helping to regenerate parts of towns and cities in this country that were totally forgotten .
juan carlos grinan , walton on thames " give mortgage interest relief to all or none " p negi , london all we first-time-buyers ask for is an even field .
give mortgage interest relief to all or none .
why the discrimination ?
if btl left the market , the supply would stay the same and prices would come down - people like us would finally be able to buy rather than pay some guy 's pension .
all we ask for is equality on the mortgage interest relief issue .
p negi , london one way of reducing the number of empty properties is to slash the time taken for planning permission and building regulations approval - in our area the whole process can take six months -lrb- it is wise to wait for planning permission before applying for building regulations -rrb- .
if you buy a house that needs total renovation and extension , it can sit empty for six months before work can start .
this often happens as more people now rent for a few months to break the house purchase chain and to enable them to take on a " project " .
phil ainsworth , st albans the btl investors are a similar breed to those who drove the dot-com bandwagon over the cliff and to those lloyds " names " who lost their shirts a few years back .
they believe that their investment is so sound that they can not possibly lose .
however , in reality , they are gambling money -lrb- often borrowed money that they can not afford to lose -rrb- on a short priced favourite .
paul , devon we 've made the decision not to sell off our farm cottages , instead we have kept them and let them out for shorthold tenants .
we have been offered silly money to sell the houses , but know that they would end up becoming second homes , which would remove even more properties from the housing market .
by keeping them as letting property , we are at least giving a chance to locals to live in the local area , where they are usually pushed out by the second home market .
jason borthwick , burnham deepdale , norfolk " southampton is really suffering from this phenomenon " kathy emmott , southampton not only is buy-to-let pushing up prices , it is also creating streets full of rented properties where no-one cares about the gardens , the rubbish , the neighbours etc and all sense of community is lost as almost all the people living there are entirely transient .
i live in a street like that and it is really depressing as i did save all my money to buy my house and all the landlords think about is making cash from the properties .
it 's not just my street - southampton is really suffering from this phenomenon .
something must be done to halt this - raising the tax would be a good start .
kathy emmott , southampton all these people complaining about landlord 's .
i suggest they try letting a property out .
letting law heavily favours the tenant .
letting property is not something to be done on a whim - a lot of responsibilities come with it .
that 's why a landlord is entitled to make some money in the same way as any other business .
jim , scunthorpe if you want to increase supply - do away with capital gains tax for selling .
many landlords ca n't afford to sell since there is n't enough equity in their properties to pay the taxman .
colin gordon , edinburgh " so far i have been outbid twice by btl landlords " john walters , halifax i am a first time buyer looking to get a foot on the ladder and so far i have been outbid twice by btl landlords .
how am i ever going to buy when blt 'ers are pricing us out of the market going above asking prices for property ?
these houses then stay empty for months .
john walters , halifax once upon a time a btl mortgage was considered as a commercial loan , finance was relatively hard to come by , and the interest rates were considerably higher than for a normal home loan .
now lenders are competing to give money away cheaply for btl mortgages without the traditional income multiples which apply -lrb- especially -rrb- to first-time buyers .
these developments have given the btl investors far too big an advantage and have inflated the house market unnaturally .
richard rogers , cambourne buy-to-let landlords are always wanting to make a profit at the expense of those of us wanting to buy our first home !
i think something should be done soon !
like many , both my husband and i work full time but can not afford a mortgage , let alone raising the money for a deposit , when we are ourselves funding these buy-to-let landlords !
tracey , maidstone i lost a lot of money on buy-to-let and have losses which i can not offset against other income .
these losses are real and are run up on credit cards for which i have to repay out of taxed money .
to disallow interest from tax calculations would be to ignore the economic reality of the venture and would be a huge mistake .
arnie , edinburgh " perhaps gordon brown can provide some tax relief to landlords who sell up ? "
roger , london i want to get out of the housing market .
however , if i sell up i will end up with a big capital gains tax bill and this is a disincentive to sell .
perhaps gordon brown can provide some tax relief to landlords who sell up ?
business owners who do sell up get relief but not residential landlords .
roger , london a fair solution would be to enable first-time buyers to pay interest on their mortgages from their pre-tax salary .
introducing a new tax for buy-to-let landlords wo n't help first-time buyers a bit .
it is just a trick for getting more tax .
nenad , london i hear pension , pension , pension .
property has always been a safe investment but when you get into the situation we are in with massively over-inflated prices we could be in for another pensions crash .
we hear about how we 've had 10 years of growth but it 's all based on debt .
danny , gravesend most btl landlords i have come across do not pay any tax whatsoever .
they remortgaged their properties when prices went up and used the money as new deposits to buy more properties .
if they were honest with the taxman most would not be able to build up a portfolio that fast .
john , london the biggest issue here is about housing being more affordable and not building more affordable housing .
i think the best approach would be for all new-build properties with two bedrooms or under -lrb- first-time buyer properties -rrb- to be sold only for primary occupancy and not to investors .
the new build house we are renting would be perfect for us to buy , we pay £ 600 pcm rent although the current market value of the house would mean we could n't afford to actually purchase it !
john moore , northampton " i have nothing against students , but their landlords do n't seem to care if the gardens look scruffy " ann gowland , farnham i have lived in a close of 24 terraced houses for over 20 years .
during this time , 12 have come on the market , of which nine have been bought by landlords to let to students , and only three have been bought by families .
i have nothing against students , but their landlords do n't seem to care if the gardens look scruffy with overflowing wheelie bins left out on the pavement .
i think buy-to-let landlords should not be exempt from tax on mortgage interest .
also i think they should pay council tax .
i hope gordon brown will address the problem .
rents should be controlled , and tenants should be given more security of tenure .
ann gowland , farnham if tax relief on interest payments will be scrapped , will capital gains tax also be scrapped ? !
paul , manchester people should be allowed to get tax relief on tenancy income on one property , but perhaps it should be abolished for any subsequent rental property after the first one .
this should slow the market slightly by pushing out some existing or prospective multiple buy-to-letters .
lee mccarthy , rainham the solution is really very simple .
restore the rights of sitting tenants .
mortgage companies will only lend so cheaply on buy-to-let because they see no risk - they can repossess at any time and the tenant can not stop them .
meanwhile it is impossible to get anything other than a shorthold tenancy , so tenants have no security .
put back secured tenancies and the market will calm itself down quickly and the lunacy will end .
silas denyer , london " i was under the delusion that left-wing jealousy was a thing of the past in the uk " colin , dubai i have never read so much rubbish .
any business -lrb- and buy-to-let is a business -rrb- is allowed to offset costs against income .
i was under the delusion that left-wing jealousy was a thing of the past in the uk .
clearly it is n't .
colin , dubai my wife and i have been buy-to-let landlords for 3 and a half years .
we have never made any money from our properties - in fact , the running total of our losses over that period stands at over £ 27,000 .
we are currently losing around £ 700 a month .
because the market is so saturated , we have n't made any capital gain , either - our properties are now worth less than when we bought them .
an awful lot of people have been seduced into the idea of buy-to-let as a great money making scheme - it just is n't .
our agent in manchester , where we have one of our flats , told us last year that there were about 25,000 properties available for rent , chasing approximately half that number of prospective tenants - and that 's why properties stay empty .
tony jefferson , oxford though i do not have a buy-to-let property at the moment , i do not think that the government should consider any tax rules to discourage buy-to-let investors .
i know many investors work very hard to put down a very large deposit .
why should people be penalised when they work hard for it ?
many have no confidence in their future pension income so if they have taken steps to build up their property portfolio , leave the investors alone .
comment about investors leaving their properties empty is exaggerated .
who wants to be paying a hefty mortgage and leaving properties empty ?
jan , london " we will never lose our tax relief because it would be lost votes for the government " rupert , gerrards cross this would be a disaster for us landlords .
at the moment yields are only 6 % on my portfolio .
if i lost all my tax relief i would have to sell my portfolio because there would be no financial benefit in keeping it .
even worse , i would then have to pay huge capital gains tax on my profits .
it 's not my problem that youngsters today ca n't afford anything .
we will never lose our tax relief because it would be lost votes for the government .
rupert , gerrards cross this is typical of the way we always look for someone to blame .
i agree with the view that people who buy property and then leave it empty should not benefit , but they can only offset the interest against income from the property .
good landlords rent at affordable market rates .
the real issue is that there is no local authorities building social housing and of course thatcher gave you all the right to buy .
how many people bought up the social housing stock , and have reaped a healthy profit .
that is the real issue .
stop the blame culture and address the issue , we must build more houses .
kris hurman , ashford this argument would not have come about if it was not for the laughable inflation targets set by brown leading to ludicrously low interest rates , and secondly the supply side constraints on house building .
if we build more houses and set interest rates against a basket of measures rather than cpi , the price of houses will fall and many highly speculative and amateur btl landlords will be forced to sell uneconomic so-called investments .
steven farrall , ipswich we need a partnership between local councils and buy-to-let money .
the councils would get the finance to build social housing .
the buy-to-let people would benefit from the councils ' expertise and a greater spread of properties .
there would also be more homes for renting and for buying .
finally , we need to halt the forced sale of council houses at knock down prices , which has already done too much harm .
chris grey , guildford their pension is our homelessness .
all property owners exploit a monopoly position - a monopoly in something everyone needs just to be able to have a settled home somewhere and find work .
their capital gains , like those of any owner , are caused by the relative popularity of a location - something their investment itself does nothing to achieve .
their mortgages , like all mortgages , are the core of our money supply and the root of inflation .
this is n't about buy-to-let per se , but about our relationship to land as a society .
land value tax would encourage such people to put their savings into genuinely wealth-producing assets , not zero sum gains that exclude others from life 's essentials .
jock , oxford " why should the tenant contribute to their pensions ? "
patricia booth , canterbury i think buy-to-let landlords have become very greedy .
as most of us know , landlords can offset much of their expenditure against tax .
so why should the tenant contribute to their pensions ?
there are plenty of other avenues for investment .
also , the greedy landlords make the tenant liable for the council tax .
patricia booth , canterbury the reason for the buy-to-let boom is the ridiculous state pension , the uncertainty of company pensions , the ability of the chancellor to destroy private pensions and the risks as shown by the equitable life debacle .
all these things can be solved by introducing a decent state pension .
john , france the buy-to-let bubble will eventually take down the whole housing market .
in reading all of the comments below it is clear that interest rate rises are already starting to pinch .
more rate rises to come ?
most likely , and when the landlords start to see that they can not even break even there will be a stampede for the exits and prices will drop like a stone .
this is a disaster in the making .
and after that there will no doubt be affordable housing again for the first-time buyers but not before many have lost their shirts .
nicky , southampton the btl industry in the uk is needed , especially in large , high-density urban areas .
getting rid of tax relief is a half-baked idea - it would be insignificant .
it is a highly complex problem to provide enough homes for all and sundry in the south east at the right price .
everybody should have a home in a civilised society but do n't blame btl .
blame gordon brown and co - they run the country and they planned wrong .
joe regan , london maybe if currently insecure pensions were restored and protected again people would n't need to invest in property as an alternative .
my own employers , a blue chip multinational , have followed the market and ended the final salary pension scheme , cutting prospective pensions in half despite making record profits .
buy-to-let is a symptom of this more fundamental disease and taxing such landlords further will only add to the burden of future taxpayers who will have to meet the cost of today 's failed pensions .
deal with the real issue first please and put pensions before shareholder and board greed .
stephen , glasgow interest relief serves to reduce the rents to millions of tenants ... so this is another spun-up non-story .
hugh burnett , london " if there is ever a price crash , a lot of tenants will suffer as their rented accommodation is sold from under them " nick , horncastle i had to move twice in three years due to buy-to-let landlord greed .
first , making the house intolerable by cramming too many people in , then selling the house from under us to cash in their investment .
if there is ever a price crash , a lot of tenants will suffer as their rented accommodation is sold from under them in the scramble to sell .
we desperately need a stock of rented accommodation divorced from speculation , to serve the same purpose as council housing used to do .
nick , horncastle in the past couple of years interest rates have increased dramatically but rents have been stagnant .
as an average investor i am making a loss on my properties .
there is already a charge on empty property -lrb- council tax -rrb- and i would be mad to voluntarily have a property empty , bringing in no income .
unfortunately , sometimes it is difficult to find tenants when you need them .
the " tax-relief " on buy-to-let mortgages is a complete nonsense .
the mortgage interest -lrb- at much higher rates than an a standard mortgage -rrb- is one of the costs that needs to be offset against the income .
colin allinson , munich i assume that those complaining about the supposed unfair tax advantages for landlords will be happy to pay capital gains tax on any gains they make on their own homes .
after all , why should people who have to live in rented houses subsidise potentially " fat cat " home owners ?
yes , the argument is ridiculous but before envy and claims of unfairness are allowed to destroy a vital source of housing for people on benefits , students , older people without pensions and so on , please can we get our facts straight ?
i am amazed that the nla spokesman did not make this point .
john bird , billericay " if tax relief is removed , i , like many others , will be forced to sell up " christine wharton , cornwall would a solution for first-time buyers be to give them income tax relief on their first mortgage ?
like many , i went into buy-to-let because i did n't have a pension .
i remortgaged my own home to build up a small portfolio of properties that provide tenants with comfortable homes - though letting law heavily favours them over landlords .
but the latest interest rate rises mean rents barely cover mortgage repayments , let alone insurance and other costs .
if tax relief is removed , i , like many others , will be forced to sell up .
if a mass sell-off leads to a housing crash , i shall be back to square one : no pension !
christine wharton , cornwall it is not just first-time buyers who are being squeezed out by those looking for investments but also those who need to downsize or even move on the same level .
short-term tenants and second home owners do not contribute towards the community either economically or socially .
investment property owners always seem to have the necessary cash to outbid any owner-occupier buyer in the medium to low-priced property categories particularly in the nicer parts of this town .
julia , eastbourne what a load of rubbish is spoken about investors buying properties and taking them from first-time buyers .
the comments i hear most often are first-time buyers ca n't afford the deposits , therefore if investors can and they buy them - at least that is providing homes that those very people can live in - whereas if they had to save up a deposit , they would not be living in them .
rob cargill , london " the issue of tax relief is an absolute outrage " joy waters , norwich i have children in their 20s whose lives are effectively on hold because of the ludicrous situation in the housing market .
they earn too much for social housing , but not enough to buy a house .
most so-called affordable housing is snapped up by investors and i think the issue of tax relief is an absolute outrage .
what no one ever seems to answer either is the question of security of tenure .
what will happen when all the 20 somethings are having children in a few years time .
my children have both been forced to move simply because the rent has been increased or the property sold .
where is the stability in six month tenancies for families ?
joy waters , norwich offsetting interest against rent is not a " tax break " .
any business making income from owning an asset pays tax on the net income after the costs of running and owning those assets , which includes interest payments incurred as a result of borrowing money to purchase those assets in the first place .
btl is no different .
unlike homeowners , btl landlords will pay capital gains tax on any gain in value when they dispose of the property .
everyone running a business is treated the same -lrb- and fairly so -rrb- , and it is homeowners that get the tax break .
chris baverstock , fareham buy-to-let landlords getting tax breaks is a total disgrace .
it is absolutely clear that first-time buyers are taking out ruinous loans .
the buy-to-let lobby and the mortgage providers have sewn up the uk housing market - it is scandalous .
the so-called " housing market " has become the world 's biggest ever pyramid-selling scam .
it is ruining many , many people 's lives .
houses are already only affordable by average people having to take out loans well over 10 times income .
paul shooter , salisbury affordable housing is quite rightly discussed on numerous occasions on radio and tv - but no one says how much in cash terms they mean by affordable .
anyone willing to come forward with an answer ?
pat bourchier , yateley , hampshire " those buy-to-letters of the borrow-to-let variety are clearly doomed " duncan , milton keynes buy-to-let investors have out-priced many first-time buyers in all areas of the country .
their business model is built on rising prices , low interest rates , loose lending policies and also a preferential tax system .
with many of these in the process of change those buy-to-letters of the borrow-to-let variety are clearly doomed .
yet banks are still signing off loans and some media outlets are shamefully hyping the market .
i think more responsibility should be shown and loans and information relating to buy-to-let should come with a warning as people are unwittingly risking their retirements , and you only get one of them !
duncan , milton keynes we do n't need any more new houses to be built especially on greenfield sites .
what most people do n't realise is that for every person who wants a home there are five empty houses built before 1960 .
quentin williams , bristol buy-to-let owners who leave properties empty are not receiving any rent .
interest tax relief is only allowable against earnings from the rental income .
therefore , mortgages on empty properties do not attract tax relief .
malcolm johnson , stoke-on-trent the buy-to-let landlord 's mantra seems to be : " gordon stole our pensions , so we have to invest in property . "
so one generation gets their pensions stolen , and now the next generation has had affordable housing stolen from them .
what a triumph for our society .

paul diggory has called on the government to tackle the " runaway " market which he says is contributing to problems faced by first-time buyers .
he says buy-to-let owners have a financial advantage over those trying to buy their first home , and push house prices even higher .
we asked for your comments , a selection of which are below .
this debate is now closed .
listen to yourselves .
we have become a nation of greedy , self-centred , something-for-nothing pension and house-price obsessives .
and if you have n't got it , you squeal because someone else has .
being young , healthy and free with loving family and friends beats all the pension nonsense hands down .
f gray , laide i am a buy-to-let landlord but can see no logic at all in mortgage tax relief .
it allows higher prices to be afforded and provides an unfair advantage over first-time buyers .
landlords do not qualify for business capital gains taper relief so why should they get business tax relief on loan interest ?
michael hunt , hungerford brilliant idea !
tax to the hilt the very people who are providing a solution to those that can not afford to buy , so there will be an even worse housing crisis !
sheer genius !
rob cargill , london to suggest that these buy-to-let landlords are somehow putting themselves out to provide a public service is just ridiculous brian , glasgow i would be quite happy if some of the buy-to-let landlords had to sell up if they were taxed .
profiting from property for commercial use is one thing , profiting from what is a basic right of society for everyone to have a roof over their heads is just obscene .
to suggest that these buy-to-let landlords are somehow putting themselves out to provide a public service is just ridiculous .
brian , glasgow i own one property which i let out .
if tax relief on mortgage interest was abolished , the only thing this would achieve would be to push up rents by about 40 % - hardly good news for tenants .
mr m , london buy-to-let is just the same as if a small number of speculators bought up all the food , and then when people were hungry enough , sold it back to them at inflated prices .
the practise of btl should be heavily discouraged , it 's the main cause of the misery of high house prices .
tomo redfern , london believe me , being a landlord creates just as many headaches as any other self-employed job helen mcginty , birmingham buying houses to rent is my job .
i am a self-employed landlord .
i do n't have another job , this is what i do to earn a living .
for those of you who think most of us are making a fortune out of rental properties , you are sadly wrong ; not to mention all the hassle we have with tenants not paying , trashing our properties , repair work , etc .
believe me , being a landlord creates just as many headaches as any other self-employed job ever could , and at the end of it , when it 's time to sell the property , the chancellor makes a small fortune in capital gains tax .
so , i would suggest you take that in to consideration before you start saying we should be taxed even more .
helen mcginty , birmingham buy-to let landlords provide my family with a rented home .
where will we live if buy-to-let ceases to be a wise investment ?
surely the uk is still a " free " land where we are not forced to buy property to live in a house , or does the government wish to own property again .
i think not .
steven hunt , ashford i suggest if you ca n't afford to buy and you 're in the position of having to pay extortionate rents to private landlords ; join the social housing list and put pressure on them to find you somewhere .
the people i know who rent socially pay about 1/4 of the price of private rents and they have pretty good place .
david , london ninety per cent of those demanding the change in the law are people who wish they were in the position to own a buy-to-let property themselves .
there is no empirical evidence that landlords are crowding out the property market and if anything , demand for rented accommodation is , more often than not , helping to regenerate parts of towns and cities in this country that were totally forgotten .
juan carlos grinan , walton on thames give mortgage interest relief to all or none p negi , london all we first-time-buyers ask for is an even field .
give mortgage interest relief to all or none .
why the discrimination ?
if btl left the market , the supply would stay the same and prices would come down - people like us would finally be able to buy rather than pay some guy 's pension .
all we ask for is equality on the mortgage interest relief issue .
p negi , london one way of reducing the number of empty properties is to slash the time taken for planning permission and building regulations approval - in our area the whole process can take six months -lrb- it is wise to wait for planning permission before applying for building regulations -rrb- .
if you buy a house that needs total renovation and extension , it can sit empty for six months before work can start .
this often happens as more people now rent for a few months to break the house purchase chain and to enable them to take on a " project " .
phil ainsworth , st albans the btl investors are a similar breed to those who drove the dot-com bandwagon over the cliff and to those lloyds " names " who lost their shirts a few years back .
they believe that their investment is so sound that they can not possibly lose .
however , in reality , they are gambling money -lrb- often borrowed money that they can not afford to lose -rrb- on a short priced favourite .
paul , devon we 've made the decision not to sell off our farm cottages , instead we have kept them and let them out for shorthold tenants .
we have been offered silly money to sell the houses , but know that they would end up becoming second homes , which would remove even more properties from the housing market .
by keeping them as letting property , we are at least giving a chance to locals to live in the local area , where they are usually pushed out by the second home market .
jason borthwick , burnham deepdale , norfolk southampton is really suffering from this phenomenon kathy emmott , southampton not only is buy-to-let pushing up prices , it is also creating streets full of rented properties where no-one cares about the gardens , the rubbish , the neighbours etc and all sense of community is lost as almost all the people living there are entirely transient .
i live in a street like that and it is really depressing as i did save all my money to buy my house and all the landlords think about is making cash from the properties .
it 's not just my street - southampton is really suffering from this phenomenon .
something must be done to halt this - raising the tax would be a good start .
kathy emmott , southampton all these people complaining about landlord 's .
i suggest they try letting a property out .
letting law heavily favours the tenant .
letting property is not something to be done on a whim - a lot of responsibilities come with it .
that 's why a landlord is entitled to make some money in the same way as any other business .
jim , scunthorpe if you want to increase supply - do away with capital gains tax for selling .
many landlords ca n't afford to sell since there is n't enough equity in their properties to pay the taxman .
colin gordon , edinburgh so far i have been outbid twice by btl landlords john walters , halifax i am a first time buyer looking to get a foot on the ladder and so far i have been outbid twice by btl landlords .
how am i ever going to buy when blt 'ers are pricing us out of the market going above asking prices for property ?
these houses then stay empty for months .
john walters , halifax once upon a time a btl mortgage was considered as a commercial loan , finance was relatively hard to come by , and the interest rates were considerably higher than for a normal home loan .
now lenders are competing to give money away cheaply for btl mortgages without the traditional income multiples which apply -lrb- especially -rrb- to first-time buyers .
these developments have given the btl investors far too big an advantage and have inflated the house market unnaturally .
richard rogers , cambourne buy-to-let landlords are always wanting to make a profit at the expense of those of us wanting to buy our first home !
i think something should be done soon !
like many , both my husband and i work full time but can not afford a mortgage , let alone raising the money for a deposit , when we are ourselves funding these buy-to-let landlords !
tracey , maidstone i lost a lot of money on buy-to-let and have losses which i can not offset against other income .
these losses are real and are run up on credit cards for which i have to repay out of taxed money .
to disallow interest from tax calculations would be to ignore the economic reality of the venture and would be a huge mistake .
arnie , edinburgh perhaps gordon brown can provide some tax relief to landlords who sell up ?
roger , london i want to get out of the housing market .
however , if i sell up i will end up with a big capital gains tax bill and this is a disincentive to sell .
perhaps gordon brown can provide some tax relief to landlords who sell up ?
business owners who do sell up get relief but not residential landlords .
roger , london a fair solution would be to enable first-time buyers to pay interest on their mortgages from their pre-tax salary .
introducing a new tax for buy-to-let landlords wo n't help first-time buyers a bit .
it is just a trick for getting more tax .
nenad , london i hear pension , pension , pension .
property has always been a safe investment but when you get into the situation we are in with massively over-inflated prices we could be in for another pensions crash .
we hear about how we 've had 10 years of growth but it 's all based on debt .
danny , gravesend most btl landlords i have come across do not pay any tax whatsoever .
they remortgaged their properties when prices went up and used the money as new deposits to buy more properties .
if they were honest with the taxman most would not be able to build up a portfolio that fast .
john , london the biggest issue here is about housing being more affordable and not building more affordable housing .
i think the best approach would be for all new-build properties with two bedrooms or under -lrb- first-time buyer properties -rrb- to be sold only for primary occupancy and not to investors .
the new build house we are renting would be perfect for us to buy , we pay £ 600 pcm rent although the current market value of the house would mean we could n't afford to actually purchase it !
john moore , northampton i have nothing against students , but their landlords do n't seem to care if the gardens look scruffy ann gowland , farnham i have lived in a close of 24 terraced houses for over 20 years .
during this time , 12 have come on the market , of which nine have been bought by landlords to let to students , and only three have been bought by families .
i have nothing against students , but their landlords do n't seem to care if the gardens look scruffy with overflowing wheelie bins left out on the pavement .
i think buy-to-let landlords should not be exempt from tax on mortgage interest .
also i think they should pay council tax .
i hope gordon brown will address the problem .
rents should be controlled , and tenants should be given more security of tenure .
ann gowland , farnham if tax relief on interest payments will be scrapped , will capital gains tax also be scrapped ? !
paul , manchester people should be allowed to get tax relief on tenancy income on one property , but perhaps it should be abolished for any subsequent rental property after the first one .
this should slow the market slightly by pushing out some existing or prospective multiple buy-to-letters .
lee mccarthy , rainham the solution is really very simple .
restore the rights of sitting tenants .
mortgage companies will only lend so cheaply on buy-to-let because they see no risk - they can repossess at any time and the tenant can not stop them .
meanwhile it is impossible to get anything other than a shorthold tenancy , so tenants have no security .
put back secured tenancies and the market will calm itself down quickly and the lunacy will end .
silas denyer , london i was under the delusion that left-wing jealousy was a thing of the past in the uk colin , dubai i have never read so much rubbish .
any business -lrb- and buy-to-let is a business -rrb- is allowed to offset costs against income .
i was under the delusion that left-wing jealousy was a thing of the past in the uk .
clearly it is n't .
colin , dubai my wife and i have been buy-to-let landlords for 3 and a half years .
we have never made any money from our properties - in fact , the running total of our losses over that period stands at over £ 27,000 .

because the market is so saturated , we have n't made any capital gain , either - our properties are now worth less than when we bought them .

jan , london we will never lose our tax relief because it would be lost votes for the government rupert , gerrards cross this would be a disaster for us landlords .
at the moment yields are only 6 % on my portfolio .

how many people bought up the social housing stock , and have reaped a healthy profit .
that is the real issue .
stop the blame culture and address the issue , we must build more houses .
kris hurman , ashford this argument would not have come about if it was not for the laughable inflation targets set by brown leading to ludicrously low interest rates , and secondly the supply side constraints on house building .
if we build more houses and set interest rates against a basket of measures rather than cpi , the price of houses will fall and many highly speculative and amateur btl landlords will be forced to sell uneconomic so-called investments .

my own employers , a blue chip multinational , have followed the market and ended the final salary pension scheme , cutting prospective pensions in half despite making record profits .
buy-to-let is a symptom of this more fundamental disease and taxing such landlords further will only add to the burden of future taxpayers who will have to meet the cost of today 's failed pensions .
deal with the real issue first please and put pensions before shareholder and board greed .
stephen , glasgow interest relief serves to reduce the rents to millions of tenants ... so this is another spun-up non-story .
hugh burnett , london if there is ever a price crash , a lot of tenants will suffer as their rented accommodation is sold from under them nick , horncastle i had to move twice in three years due to buy-to-let landlord greed .
first , making the house intolerable by cramming too many people in , then selling the house from under us to cash in their investment .
if there is ever a price crash , a lot of tenants will suffer as their rented accommodation is sold from under them in the scramble to sell .
we desperately need a stock of rented accommodation divorced from speculation , to serve the same purpose as council housing used to do .
nick , horncastle in the past couple of years interest rates have increased dramatically but rents have been stagnant .
as an average investor i am making a loss on my properties .
there is already a charge on empty property -lrb- council tax -rrb- and i would be mad to voluntarily have a property empty , bringing in no income .
unfortunately , sometimes it is difficult to find tenants when you need them .
the " tax-relief " on buy-to-let mortgages is a complete nonsense .
the mortgage interest -lrb- at much higher rates than an a standard mortgage -rrb- is one of the costs that needs to be offset against the income .
colin allinson , munich i assume that those complaining about the supposed unfair tax advantages for landlords will be happy to pay capital gains tax on any gains they make on their own homes .
after all , why should people who have to live in rented houses subsidise potentially " fat cat " home owners ?
yes , the argument is ridiculous but before envy and claims of unfairness are allowed to destroy a vital source of housing for people on benefits , students , older people without pensions and so on , please can we get our facts straight ?
i am amazed that the nla spokesman did not make this point .
john bird , billericay if tax relief is removed , i , like many others , will be forced to sell up christine wharton , cornwall would a solution for first-time buyers be to give them income tax relief on their first mortgage ?
like many , i went into buy-to-let because i did n't have a pension .
i remortgaged my own home to build up a small portfolio of properties that provide tenants with comfortable homes - though letting law heavily favours them over landlords .
but the latest interest rate rises mean rents barely cover mortgage repayments , let alone insurance and other costs .
if tax relief is removed , i , like many others , will be forced to sell up .
if a mass sell-off leads to a housing crash , i shall be back to square one : no pension !
christine wharton , cornwall it is not just first-time buyers who are being squeezed out by those looking for investments but also those who need to downsize or even move on the same level .
short-term tenants and second home owners do not contribute towards the community either economically or socially .
investment property owners always seem to have the necessary cash to outbid any owner-occupier buyer in the medium to low-priced property categories particularly in the nicer parts of this town .
julia , eastbourne what a load of rubbish is spoken about investors buying properties and taking them from first-time buyers .
the comments i hear most often are first-time buyers ca n't afford the deposits , therefore if investors can and they buy them - at least that is providing homes that those very people can live in - whereas if they had to save up a deposit , they would not be living in them .
rob cargill , london the issue of tax relief is an absolute outrage joy waters , norwich i have children in their 20s whose lives are effectively on hold because of the ludicrous situation in the housing market .
they earn too much for social housing , but not enough to buy a house .
most so-called affordable housing is snapped up by investors and i think the issue of tax relief is an absolute outrage .
what no one ever seems to answer either is the question of security of tenure .
what will happen when all the 20 somethings are having children in a few years time .
my children have both been forced to move simply because the rent has been increased or the property sold .
where is the stability in six month tenancies for families ?
joy waters , norwich offsetting interest against rent is not a " tax break " .
any business making income from owning an asset pays tax on the net income after the costs of running and owning those assets , which includes interest payments incurred as a result of borrowing money to purchase those assets in the first place .
btl is no different .
unlike homeowners , btl landlords will pay capital gains tax on any gain in value when they dispose of the property .
everyone running a business is treated the same -lrb- and fairly so -rrb- , and it is homeowners that get the tax break .
chris baverstock , fareham buy-to-let landlords getting tax breaks is a total disgrace .
it is absolutely clear that first-time buyers are taking out ruinous loans .
the buy-to-let lobby and the mortgage providers have sewn up the uk housing market - it is scandalous .
the so-called " housing market " has become the world 's biggest ever pyramid-selling scam .
it is ruining many , many people 's lives .
houses are already only affordable by average people having to take out loans well over 10 times income .
paul shooter , salisbury affordable housing is quite rightly discussed on numerous occasions on radio and tv - but no one says how much in cash terms they mean by affordable .
anyone willing to come forward with an answer ?
pat bourchier , yateley , hampshire those buy-to-letters of the borrow-to-let variety are clearly doomed duncan , milton keynes buy-to-let investors have out-priced many first-time buyers in all areas of the country .
their business model is built on rising prices , low interest rates , loose lending policies and also a preferential tax system .
with many of these in the process of change those buy-to-letters of the borrow-to-let variety are clearly doomed .
yet banks are still signing off loans and some media outlets are shamefully hyping the market .
i think more responsibility should be shown and loans and information relating to buy-to-let should come with a warning as people are unwittingly risking their retirements , and you only get one of them !
duncan , milton keynes we do n't need any more new houses to be built especially on greenfield sites .
what most people do n't realise is that for every person who wants a home there are five empty houses built before 1960 .
quentin williams , bristol buy-to-let owners who leave properties empty are not receiving any rent .
interest tax relief is only allowable against earnings from the rental income .
therefore , mortgages on empty properties do not attract tax relief .
malcolm johnson , stoke-on-trent the buy-to-let landlord 's mantra seems to be : " gordon stole our pensions , so we have to invest in property . "
so one generation gets their pensions stolen , and now the next generation has had affordable housing stolen from them .
what a triumph for our society .

paul diggory has called on the government to tackle the " runaway " market which he says is contributing to problems faced by first-time buyers .
he says buy-to-let owners have a financial advantage over those trying to buy their first home , and push house prices even higher .
we asked for your comments , a selection of which are below .
this debate is now closed .
listen to yourselves .
we have become a nation of greedy , self-centred , something-for-nothing pension and house-price obsessives .
and if you have n't got it , you squeal because someone else has .
being young , healthy and free with loving family and friends beats all the pension nonsense hands down .
f gray , laide i am a buy-to-let landlord but can see no logic at all in mortgage tax relief .
it allows higher prices to be afforded and provides an unfair advantage over first-time buyers .
landlords do not qualify for business capital gains taper relief so why should they get business tax relief on loan interest ?
michael hunt , hungerford brilliant idea !
tax to the hilt the very people who are providing a solution to those that can not afford to buy , so there will be an even worse housing crisis !
sheer genius !
rob cargill , london to suggest that these buy-to-let landlords are somehow putting themselves out to provide a public service is just ridiculous brian , glasgow i would be quite happy if some of the buy-to-let landlords had to sell up if they were taxed .
profiting from property for commercial use is one thing , profiting from what is a basic right of society for everyone to have a roof over their heads is just obscene .
to suggest that these buy-to-let landlords are somehow putting themselves out to provide a public service is just ridiculous .
brian , glasgow i own one property which i let out .
if tax relief on mortgage interest was abolished , the only thing this would achieve would be to push up rents by about 40 % - hardly good news for tenants .
mr m , london buy-to-let is just the same as if a small number of speculators bought up all the food , and then when people were hungry enough , sold it back to them at inflated prices .
the practise of btl should be heavily discouraged , it 's the main cause of the misery of high house prices .
tomo redfern , london believe me , being a landlord creates just as many headaches as any other self-employed job helen mcginty , birmingham buying houses to rent is my job .
i am a self-employed landlord .
i do n't have another job , this is what i do to earn a living .
for those of you who think most of us are making a fortune out of rental properties , you are sadly wrong ; not to mention all the hassle we have with tenants not paying , trashing our properties , repair work , etc .
believe me , being a landlord creates just as many headaches as any other self-employed job ever could , and at the end of it , when it 's time to sell the property , the chancellor makes a small fortune in capital gains tax .
so , i would suggest you take that in to consideration before you start saying we should be taxed even more .
helen mcginty , birmingham buy-to let landlords provide my family with a rented home .
where will we live if buy-to-let ceases to be a wise investment ?
surely the uk is still a " free " land where we are not forced to buy property to live in a house , or does the government wish to own property again .
i think not .
steven hunt , ashford i suggest if you ca n't afford to buy and you 're in the position of having to pay extortionate rents to private landlords ; join the social housing list and put pressure on them to find you somewhere .
the people i know who rent socially pay about 1/4 of the price of private rents and they have pretty good place .
david , london ninety per cent of those demanding the change in the law are people who wish they were in the position to own a buy-to-let property themselves .
there is no empirical evidence that landlords are crowding out the property market and if anything , demand for rented accommodation is , more often than not , helping to regenerate parts of towns and cities in this country that were totally forgotten .
juan carlos grinan , walton on thames give mortgage interest relief to all or none p negi , london all we first-time-buyers ask for is an even field .
give mortgage interest relief to all or none .
why the discrimination ?
if btl left the market , the supply would stay the same and prices would come down - people like us would finally be able to buy rather than pay some guy 's pension .
all we ask for is equality on the mortgage interest relief issue .
p negi , london one way of reducing the number of empty properties is to slash the time taken for planning permission and building regulations approval - in our area the whole process can take six months -lrb- it is wise to wait for planning permission before applying for building regulations -rrb- .
if you buy a house that needs total renovation and extension , it can sit empty for six months before work can start .
this often happens as more people now rent for a few months to break the house purchase chain and to enable them to take on a " project " .
phil ainsworth , st albans the btl investors are a similar breed to those who drove the dot-com bandwagon over the cliff and to those lloyds " names " who lost their shirts a few years back .
they believe that their investment is so sound that they can not possibly lose .
however , in reality , they are gambling money -lrb- often borrowed money that they can not afford to lose -rrb- on a short priced favourite .
paul , devon we 've made the decision not to sell off our farm cottages , instead we have kept them and let them out for shorthold tenants .
we have been offered silly money to sell the houses , but know that they would end up becoming second homes , which would remove even more properties from the housing market .
by keeping them as letting property , we are at least giving a chance to locals to live in the local area , where they are usually pushed out by the second home market .
jason borthwick , burnham deepdale , norfolk southampton is really suffering from this phenomenon kathy emmott , southampton not only is buy-to-let pushing up prices , it is also creating streets full of rented properties where no-one cares about the gardens , the rubbish , the neighbours etc and all sense of community is lost as almost all the people living there are entirely transient .
i live in a street like that and it is really depressing as i did save all my money to buy my house and all the landlords think about is making cash from the properties .
it 's not just my street - southampton is really suffering from this phenomenon .
something must be done to halt this - raising the tax would be a good start .
kathy emmott , southampton all these people complaining about landlord 's .
i suggest they try letting a property out .
letting law heavily favours the tenant .
letting property is not something to be done on a whim - a lot of responsibilities come with it .
that 's why a landlord is entitled to make some money in the same way as any other business .
jim , scunthorpe if you want to increase supply - do away with capital gains tax for selling .
many landlords ca n't afford to sell since there is n't enough equity in their properties to pay the taxman .
colin gordon , edinburgh so far i have been outbid twice by btl landlords john walters , halifax i am a first time buyer looking to get a foot on the ladder and so far i have been outbid twice by btl landlords .
how am i ever going to buy when blt 'ers are pricing us out of the market going above asking prices for property ?
these houses then stay empty for months .
john walters , halifax once upon a time a btl mortgage was considered as a commercial loan , finance was relatively hard to come by , and the interest rates were considerably higher than for a normal home loan .
now lenders are competing to give money away cheaply for btl mortgages without the traditional income multiples which apply -lrb- especially -rrb- to first-time buyers .
these developments have given the btl investors far too big an advantage and have inflated the house market unnaturally .
richard rogers , cambourne buy-to-let landlords are always wanting to make a profit at the expense of those of us wanting to buy our first home !
i think something should be done soon !
like many , both my husband and i work full time but can not afford a mortgage , let alone raising the money for a deposit , when we are ourselves funding these buy-to-let landlords !
tracey , maidstone i lost a lot of money on buy-to-let and have losses which i can not offset against other income .
these losses are real and are run up on credit cards for which i have to repay out of taxed money .
to disallow interest from tax calculations would be to ignore the economic reality of the venture and would be a huge mistake .
arnie , edinburgh perhaps gordon brown can provide some tax relief to landlords who sell up ?
roger , london i want to get out of the housing market .
however , if i sell up i will end up with a big capital gains tax bill and this is a disincentive to sell .
perhaps gordon brown can provide some tax relief to landlords who sell up ?
business owners who do sell up get relief but not residential landlords .
roger , london a fair solution would be to enable first-time buyers to pay interest on their mortgages from their pre-tax salary .
introducing a new tax for buy-to-let landlords wo n't help first-time buyers a bit .
it is just a trick for getting more tax .
nenad , london i hear pension , pension , pension .
property has always been a safe investment but when you get into the situation we are in with massively over-inflated prices we could be in for another pensions crash .
we hear about how we 've had 10 years of growth but it 's all based on debt .
danny , gravesend most btl landlords i have come across do not pay any tax whatsoever .
they remortgaged their properties when prices went up and used the money as new deposits to buy more properties .
if they were honest with the taxman most would not be able to build up a portfolio that fast .
john , london the biggest issue here is about housing being more affordable and not building more affordable housing .
i think the best approach would be for all new-build properties with two bedrooms or under -lrb- first-time buyer properties -rrb- to be sold only for primary occupancy and not to investors .
the new build house we are renting would be perfect for us to buy , we pay £ 600 pcm rent although the current market value of the house would mean we could n't afford to actually purchase it !
john moore , northampton i have nothing against students , but their landlords do n't seem to care if the gardens look scruffy ann gowland , farnham i have lived in a close of 24 terraced houses for over 20 years .
during this time , 12 have come on the market , of which nine have been bought by landlords to let to students , and only three have been bought by families .
i have nothing against students , but their landlords do n't seem to care if the gardens look scruffy with overflowing wheelie bins left out on the pavement .
i think buy-to-let landlords should not be exempt from tax on mortgage interest .
also i think they should pay council tax .
i hope gordon brown will address the problem .
rents should be controlled , and tenants should be given more security of tenure .
ann gowland , farnham if tax relief on interest payments will be scrapped , will capital gains tax also be scrapped ? !
paul , manchester people should be allowed to get tax relief on tenancy income on one property , but perhaps it should be abolished for any subsequent rental property after the first one .
this should slow the market slightly by pushing out some existing or prospective multiple buy-to-letters .
lee mccarthy , rainham the solution is really very simple .
restore the rights of sitting tenants .
mortgage companies will only lend so cheaply on buy-to-let because they see no risk - they can repossess at any time and the tenant can not stop them .
meanwhile it is impossible to get anything other than a shorthold tenancy , so tenants have no security .
put back secured tenancies and the market will calm itself down quickly and the lunacy will end .
silas denyer , london i was under the delusion that left-wing jealousy was a thing of the past in the uk colin , dubai i have never read so much rubbish .
any business -lrb- and buy-to-let is a business -rrb- is allowed to offset costs against income .
i was under the delusion that left-wing jealousy was a thing of the past in the uk .
clearly it is n't .
colin , dubai my wife and i have been buy-to-let landlords for 3 and a half years .
we have never made any money from our properties - in fact , the running total of our losses over that period stands at over £ 27,000 .
we are currently losing around £ 700 a month .
because the market is so saturated , we have n't made any capital gain , either - our properties are now worth less than when we bought them .
an awful lot of people have been seduced into the idea of buy-to-let as a great money making scheme - it just is n't .
our agent in manchester , where we have one of our flats , told us last year that there were about 25,000 properties available for rent , chasing approximately half that number of prospective tenants - and that 's why properties stay empty .
tony jefferson , oxford though i do not have a buy-to-let property at the moment , i do not think that the government should consider any tax rules to discourage buy-to-let investors .
i know many investors work very hard to put down a very large deposit .
why should people be penalised when they work hard for it ?
many have no confidence in their future pension income so if they have taken steps to build up their property portfolio , leave the investors alone .
comment about investors leaving their properties empty is exaggerated .
who wants to be paying a hefty mortgage and leaving properties empty ?
jan , london we will never lose our tax relief because it would be lost votes for the government rupert , gerrards cross this would be a disaster for us landlords .
at the moment yields are only 6 % on my portfolio .
if i lost all my tax relief i would have to sell my portfolio because there would be no financial benefit in keeping it .
even worse , i would then have to pay huge capital gains tax on my profits .
it 's not my problem that youngsters today ca n't afford anything .
we will never lose our tax relief because it would be lost votes for the government .
rupert , gerrards cross this is typical of the way we always look for someone to blame .
i agree with the view that people who buy property and then leave it empty should not benefit , but they can only offset the interest against income from the property .
good landlords rent at affordable market rates .
the real issue is that there is no local authorities building social housing and of course thatcher gave you all the right to buy .
how many people bought up the social housing stock , and have reaped a healthy profit .
that is the real issue .
stop the blame culture and address the issue , we must build more houses .
kris hurman , ashford this argument would not have come about if it was not for the laughable inflation targets set by brown leading to ludicrously low interest rates , and secondly the supply side constraints on house building .
if we build more houses and set interest rates against a basket of measures rather than cpi , the price of houses will fall and many highly speculative and amateur btl landlords will be forced to sell uneconomic so-called investments .
steven farrall , ipswich we need a partnership between local councils and buy-to-let money .
the councils would get the finance to build social housing .
the buy-to-let people would benefit from the councils ' expertise and a greater spread of properties .
there would also be more homes for renting and for buying .
finally , we need to halt the forced sale of council houses at knock down prices , which has already done too much harm .
chris grey , guildford their pension is our homelessness .
all property owners exploit a monopoly position - a monopoly in something everyone needs just to be able to have a settled home somewhere and find work .
their capital gains , like those of any owner , are caused by the relative popularity of a location - something their investment itself does nothing to achieve .
their mortgages , like all mortgages , are the core of our money supply and the root of inflation .
this is n't about buy-to-let per se , but about our relationship to land as a society .
land value tax would encourage such people to put their savings into genuinely wealth-producing assets , not zero sum gains that exclude others from life 's essentials .
jock , oxford why should the tenant contribute to their pensions ?
patricia booth , canterbury i think buy-to-let landlords have become very greedy .
as most of us know , landlords can offset much of their expenditure against tax .
so why should the tenant contribute to their pensions ?
there are plenty of other avenues for investment .
also , the greedy landlords make the tenant liable for the council tax .
patricia booth , canterbury the reason for the buy-to-let boom is the ridiculous state pension , the uncertainty of company pensions , the ability of the chancellor to destroy private pensions and the risks as shown by the equitable life debacle .
all these things can be solved by introducing a decent state pension .
john , france the buy-to-let bubble will eventually take down the whole housing market .
in reading all of the comments below it is clear that interest rate rises are already starting to pinch .
more rate rises to come ?
most likely , and when the landlords start to see that they can not even break even there will be a stampede for the exits and prices will drop like a stone .
this is a disaster in the making .
and after that there will no doubt be affordable housing again for the first-time buyers but not before many have lost their shirts .
nicky , southampton the btl industry in the uk is needed , especially in large , high-density urban areas .
getting rid of tax relief is a half-baked idea - it would be insignificant .
it is a highly complex problem to provide enough homes for all and sundry in the south east at the right price .
everybody should have a home in a civilised society but do n't blame btl .
blame gordon brown and co - they run the country and they planned wrong .
joe regan , london maybe if currently insecure pensions were restored and protected again people would n't need to invest in property as an alternative .
my own employers , a blue chip multinational , have followed the market and ended the final salary pension scheme , cutting prospective pensions in half despite making record profits .
buy-to-let is a symptom of this more fundamental disease and taxing such landlords further will only add to the burden of future taxpayers who will have to meet the cost of today 's failed pensions .
deal with the real issue first please and put pensions before shareholder and board greed .

btl is no different .

their business model is built on rising prices , low interest rates , loose lending policies and also a preferential tax system .
with many of these in the process of change those buy-to-letters of the borrow-to-let variety are clearly doomed .
yet banks are still signing off loans and some media outlets are shamefully hyping the market .
i think more responsibility should be shown and loans and information relating to buy-to-let should come with a warning as people are unwittingly risking their retirements , and you only get one of them !
duncan , milton keynes we do n't need any more new houses to be built especially on greenfield sites .
what most people do n't realise is that for every person who wants a home there are five empty houses built before 1960 .
quentin williams , bristol buy-to-let owners who leave properties empty are not receiving any rent .
interest tax relief is only allowable against earnings from the rental income .
therefore , mortgages on empty properties do not attract tax relief .
malcolm johnson , stoke-on-trent the buy-to-let landlord 's mantra seems to be : " gordon stole our pensions , so we have to invest in property . "
so one generation gets their pensions stolen , and now the next generation has had affordable housing stolen from them .
what a triumph for our society .

paul diggory has called on the government to tackle the " runaway " market which he says is contributing to problems faced by first-time buyers .
he says buy-to-let owners have a financial advantage over those trying to buy their first home , and push house prices even higher .
we asked for your comments , a selection of which are below .
this debate is now closed .
listen to yourselves .
we have become a nation of greedy , self-centred , something-for-nothing pension and house-price obsessives .
and if you have n't got it , you squeal because someone else has .
being young , healthy and free with loving family and friends beats all the pension nonsense hands down .
f gray , laide i am a buy-to-let landlord but can see no logic at all in mortgage tax relief .
it allows higher prices to be afforded and provides an unfair advantage over first-time buyers .
landlords do not qualify for business capital gains taper relief so why should they get business tax relief on loan interest ?
michael hunt , hungerford brilliant idea !
tax to the hilt the very people who are providing a solution to those that can not afford to buy , so there will be an even worse housing crisis !
sheer genius !
rob cargill , london to suggest that these buy-to-let landlords are somehow putting themselves out to provide a public service is just ridiculous brian , glasgow i would be quite happy if some of the buy-to-let landlords had to sell up if they were taxed .
profiting from property for commercial use is one thing , profiting from what is a basic right of society for everyone to have a roof over their heads is just obscene .
to suggest that these buy-to-let landlords are somehow putting themselves out to provide a public service is just ridiculous .
brian , glasgow i own one property which i let out .
if tax relief on mortgage interest was abolished , the only thing this would achieve would be to push up rents by about 40 % - hardly good news for tenants .
mr m , london buy-to-let is just the same as if a small number of speculators bought up all the food , and then when people were hungry enough , sold it back to them at inflated prices .
the practise of btl should be heavily discouraged , it 's the main cause of the misery of high house prices .
tomo redfern , london believe me , being a landlord creates just as many headaches as any other self-employed job helen mcginty , birmingham buying houses to rent is my job .
i am a self-employed landlord .
i do n't have another job , this is what i do to earn a living .
for those of you who think most of us are making a fortune out of rental properties , you are sadly wrong ; not to mention all the hassle we have with tenants not paying , trashing our properties , repair work , etc .
believe me , being a landlord creates just as many headaches as any other self-employed job ever could , and at the end of it , when it 's time to sell the property , the chancellor makes a small fortune in capital gains tax .
so , i would suggest you take that in to consideration before you start saying we should be taxed even more .
helen mcginty , birmingham buy-to let landlords provide my family with a rented home .
where will we live if buy-to-let ceases to be a wise investment ?
surely the uk is still a " free " land where we are not forced to buy property to live in a house , or does the government wish to own property again .
i think not .
steven hunt , ashford i suggest if you ca n't afford to buy and you 're in the position of having to pay extortionate rents to private landlords ; join the social housing list and put pressure on them to find you somewhere .
the people i know who rent socially pay about 1/4 of the price of private rents and they have pretty good place .
david , london ninety per cent of those demanding the change in the law are people who wish they were in the position to own a buy-to-let property themselves .
there is no empirical evidence that landlords are crowding out the property market and if anything , demand for rented accommodation is , more often than not , helping to regenerate parts of towns and cities in this country that were totally forgotten .
juan carlos grinan , walton on thames give mortgage interest relief to all or none p negi , london all we first-time-buyers ask for is an even field .
give mortgage interest relief to all or none .
why the discrimination ?
if btl left the market , the supply would stay the same and prices would come down - people like us would finally be able to buy rather than pay some guy 's pension .
all we ask for is equality on the mortgage interest relief issue .
p negi , london one way of reducing the number of empty properties is to slash the time taken for planning permission and building regulations approval - in our area the whole process can take six months -lrb- it is wise to wait for planning permission before applying for building regulations -rrb- .
if you buy a house that needs total renovation and extension , it can sit empty for six months before work can start .
this often happens as more people now rent for a few months to break the house purchase chain and to enable them to take on a " project " .
phil ainsworth , st albans the btl investors are a similar breed to those who drove the dot-com bandwagon over the cliff and to those lloyds " names " who lost their shirts a few years back .
they believe that their investment is so sound that they can not possibly lose .
however , in reality , they are gambling money -lrb- often borrowed money that they can not afford to lose -rrb- on a short priced favourite .
paul , devon we 've made the decision not to sell off our farm cottages , instead we have kept them and let them out for shorthold tenants .
we have been offered silly money to sell the houses , but know that they would end up becoming second homes , which would remove even more properties from the housing market .
by keeping them as letting property , we are at least giving a chance to locals to live in the local area , where they are usually pushed out by the second home market .
jason borthwick , burnham deepdale , norfolk southampton is really suffering from this phenomenon kathy emmott , southampton not only is buy-to-let pushing up prices , it is also creating streets full of rented properties where no-one cares about the gardens , the rubbish , the neighbours etc and all sense of community is lost as almost all the people living there are entirely transient .
i live in a street like that and it is really depressing as i did save all my money to buy my house and all the landlords think about is making cash from the properties .
it 's not just my street - southampton is really suffering from this phenomenon .
something must be done to halt this - raising the tax would be a good start .
kathy emmott , southampton all these people complaining about landlord 's .
i suggest they try letting a property out .
letting law heavily favours the tenant .
letting property is not something to be done on a whim - a lot of responsibilities come with it .
that 's why a landlord is entitled to make some money in the same way as any other business .
jim , scunthorpe if you want to increase supply - do away with capital gains tax for selling .
many landlords ca n't afford to sell since there is n't enough equity in their properties to pay the taxman .
colin gordon , edinburgh so far i have been outbid twice by btl landlords john walters , halifax i am a first time buyer looking to get a foot on the ladder and so far i have been outbid twice by btl landlords .
how am i ever going to buy when blt 'ers are pricing us out of the market going above asking prices for property ?
these houses then stay empty for months .
john walters , halifax once upon a time a btl mortgage was considered as a commercial loan , finance was relatively hard to come by , and the interest rates were considerably higher than for a normal home loan .
now lenders are competing to give money away cheaply for btl mortgages without the traditional income multiples which apply -lrb- especially -rrb- to first-time buyers .
these developments have given the btl investors far too big an advantage and have inflated the house market unnaturally .
richard rogers , cambourne buy-to-let landlords are always wanting to make a profit at the expense of those of us wanting to buy our first home !
i think something should be done soon !
like many , both my husband and i work full time but can not afford a mortgage , let alone raising the money for a deposit , when we are ourselves funding these buy-to-let landlords !
tracey , maidstone i lost a lot of money on buy-to-let and have losses which i can not offset against other income .
these losses are real and are run up on credit cards for which i have to repay out of taxed money .
to disallow interest from tax calculations would be to ignore the economic reality of the venture and would be a huge mistake .
arnie , edinburgh perhaps gordon brown can provide some tax relief to landlords who sell up ?
roger , london i want to get out of the housing market .
however , if i sell up i will end up with a big capital gains tax bill and this is a disincentive to sell .
perhaps gordon brown can provide some tax relief to landlords who sell up ?
business owners who do sell up get relief but not residential landlords .
roger , london a fair solution would be to enable first-time buyers to pay interest on their mortgages from their pre-tax salary .
introducing a new tax for buy-to-let landlords wo n't help first-time buyers a bit .
it is just a trick for getting more tax .
nenad , london i hear pension , pension , pension .
property has always been a safe investment but when you get into the situation we are in with massively over-inflated prices we could be in for another pensions crash .
we hear about how we 've had 10 years of growth but it 's all based on debt .
danny , gravesend most btl landlords i have come across do not pay any tax whatsoever .
they remortgaged their properties when prices went up and used the money as new deposits to buy more properties .
if they were honest with the taxman most would not be able to build up a portfolio that fast .
john , london the biggest issue here is about housing being more affordable and not building more affordable housing .
i think the best approach would be for all new-build properties with two bedrooms or under -lrb- first-time buyer properties -rrb- to be sold only for primary occupancy and not to investors .
the new build house we are renting would be perfect for us to buy , we pay £ 600 pcm rent although the current market value of the house would mean we could n't afford to actually purchase it !
john moore , northampton i have nothing against students , but their landlords do n't seem to care if the gardens look scruffy ann gowland , farnham i have lived in a close of 24 terraced houses for over 20 years .
during this time , 12 have come on the market , of which nine have been bought by landlords to let to students , and only three have been bought by families .
i have nothing against students , but their landlords do n't seem to care if the gardens look scruffy with overflowing wheelie bins left out on the pavement .
i think buy-to-let landlords should not be exempt from tax on mortgage interest .
also i think they should pay council tax .
i hope gordon brown will address the problem .
rents should be controlled , and tenants should be given more security of tenure .
ann gowland , farnham if tax relief on interest payments will be scrapped , will capital gains tax also be scrapped ? !
paul , manchester people should be allowed to get tax relief on tenancy income on one property , but perhaps it should be abolished for any subsequent rental property after the first one .
this should slow the market slightly by pushing out some existing or prospective multiple buy-to-letters .
lee mccarthy , rainham the solution is really very simple .
restore the rights of sitting tenants .
mortgage companies will only lend so cheaply on buy-to-let because they see no risk - they can repossess at any time and the tenant can not stop them .
meanwhile it is impossible to get anything other than a shorthold tenancy , so tenants have no security .
put back secured tenancies and the market will calm itself down quickly and the lunacy will end .
silas denyer , london i was under the delusion that left-wing jealousy was a thing of the past in the uk colin , dubai i have never read so much rubbish .
any business -lrb- and buy-to-let is a business -rrb- is allowed to offset costs against income .
i was under the delusion that left-wing jealousy was a thing of the past in the uk .
clearly it is n't .
colin , dubai my wife and i have been buy-to-let landlords for 3 and a half years .
we have never made any money from our properties - in fact , the running total of our losses over that period stands at over £ 27,000 .
we are currently losing around £ 700 a month .
because the market is so saturated , we have n't made any capital gain , either - our properties are now worth less than when we bought them .
an awful lot of people have been seduced into the idea of buy-to-let as a great money making scheme - it just is n't .
our agent in manchester , where we have one of our flats , told us last year that there were about 25,000 properties available for rent , chasing approximately half that number of prospective tenants - and that 's why properties stay empty .
tony jefferson , oxford though i do not have a buy-to-let property at the moment , i do not think that the government should consider any tax rules to discourage buy-to-let investors .
i know many investors work very hard to put down a very large deposit .
why should people be penalised when they work hard for it ?
many have no confidence in their future pension income so if they have taken steps to build up their property portfolio , leave the investors alone .
comment about investors leaving their properties empty is exaggerated .
who wants to be paying a hefty mortgage and leaving properties empty ?
jan , london we will never lose our tax relief because it would be lost votes for the government rupert , gerrards cross this would be a disaster for us landlords .
at the moment yields are only 6 % on my portfolio .
if i lost all my tax relief i would have to sell my portfolio because there would be no financial benefit in keeping it .
even worse , i would then have to pay huge capital gains tax on my profits .
it 's not my problem that youngsters today ca n't afford anything .
we will never lose our tax relief because it would be lost votes for the government .
rupert , gerrards cross this is typical of the way we always look for someone to blame .
i agree with the view that people who buy property and then leave it empty should not benefit , but they can only offset the interest against income from the property .
good landlords rent at affordable market rates .
the real issue is that there is no local authorities building social housing and of course thatcher gave you all the right to buy .
how many people bought up the social housing stock , and have reaped a healthy profit .
that is the real issue .
stop the blame culture and address the issue , we must build more houses .
kris hurman , ashford this argument would not have come about if it was not for the laughable inflation targets set by brown leading to ludicrously low interest rates , and secondly the supply side constraints on house building .
if we build more houses and set interest rates against a basket of measures rather than cpi , the price of houses will fall and many highly speculative and amateur btl landlords will be forced to sell uneconomic so-called investments .
steven farrall , ipswich we need a partnership between local councils and buy-to-let money .
the councils would get the finance to build social housing .
the buy-to-let people would benefit from the councils ' expertise and a greater spread of properties .
there would also be more homes for renting and for buying .
finally , we need to halt the forced sale of council houses at knock down prices , which has already done too much harm .
chris grey , guildford their pension is our homelessness .
all property owners exploit a monopoly position - a monopoly in something everyone needs just to be able to have a settled home somewhere and find work .
their capital gains , like those of any owner , are caused by the relative popularity of a location - something their investment itself does nothing to achieve .
their mortgages , like all mortgages , are the core of our money supply and the root of inflation .
this is n't about buy-to-let per se , but about our relationship to land as a society .
land value tax would encourage such people to put their savings into genuinely wealth-producing assets , not zero sum gains that exclude others from life 's essentials .
jock , oxford why should the tenant contribute to their pensions ?
patricia booth , canterbury i think buy-to-let landlords have become very greedy .
as most of us know , landlords can offset much of their expenditure against tax .
so why should the tenant contribute to their pensions ?
there are plenty of other avenues for investment .
also , the greedy landlords make the tenant liable for the council tax .
patricia booth , canterbury the reason for the buy-to-let boom is the ridiculous state pension , the uncertainty of company pensions , the ability of the chancellor to destroy private pensions and the risks as shown by the equitable life debacle .
all these things can be solved by introducing a decent state pension .
john , france the buy-to-let bubble will eventually take down the whole housing market .
in reading all of the comments below it is clear that interest rate rises are already starting to pinch .
more rate rises to come ?
most likely , and when the landlords start to see that they can not even break even there will be a stampede for the exits and prices will drop like a stone .
this is a disaster in the making .
and after that there will no doubt be affordable housing again for the first-time buyers but not before many have lost their shirts .
nicky , southampton the btl industry in the uk is needed , especially in large , high-density urban areas .
getting rid of tax relief is a half-baked idea - it would be insignificant .
it is a highly complex problem to provide enough homes for all and sundry in the south east at the right price .
everybody should have a home in a civilised society but do n't blame btl .
blame gordon brown and co - they run the country and they planned wrong .
joe regan , london maybe if currently insecure pensions were restored and protected again people would n't need to invest in property as an alternative .
my own employers , a blue chip multinational , have followed the market and ended the final salary pension scheme , cutting prospective pensions in half despite making record profits .
buy-to-let is a symptom of this more fundamental disease and taxing such landlords further will only add to the burden of future taxpayers who will have to meet the cost of today 's failed pensions .
deal with the real issue first please and put pensions before shareholder and board greed .
stephen , glasgow interest relief serves to reduce the rents to millions of tenants ... so this is another spun-up non-story .
hugh burnett , london if there is ever a price crash , a lot of tenants will suffer as their rented accommodation is sold from under them nick , horncastle i had to move twice in three years due to buy-to-let landlord greed .
first , making the house intolerable by cramming too many people in , then selling the house from under us to cash in their investment .
if there is ever a price crash , a lot of tenants will suffer as their rented accommodation is sold from under them in the scramble to sell .
we desperately need a stock of rented accommodation divorced from speculation , to serve the same purpose as council housing used to do .
nick , horncastle in the past couple of years interest rates have increased dramatically but rents have been stagnant .
as an average investor i am making a loss on my properties .
there is already a charge on empty property -lrb- council tax -rrb- and i would be mad to voluntarily have a property empty , bringing in no income .
unfortunately , sometimes it is difficult to find tenants when you need them .
the " tax-relief " on buy-to-let mortgages is a complete nonsense .
the mortgage interest -lrb- at much higher rates than an a standard mortgage -rrb- is one of the costs that needs to be offset against the income .
colin allinson , munich i assume that those complaining about the supposed unfair tax advantages for landlords will be happy to pay capital gains tax on any gains they make on their own homes .
after all , why should people who have to live in rented houses subsidise potentially " fat cat " home owners ?
yes , the argument is ridiculous but before envy and claims of unfairness are allowed to destroy a vital source of housing for people on benefits , students , older people without pensions and so on , please can we get our facts straight ?
i am amazed that the nla spokesman did not make this point .
john bird , billericay if tax relief is removed , i , like many others , will be forced to sell up christine wharton , cornwall would a solution for first-time buyers be to give them income tax relief on their first mortgage ?
like many , i went into buy-to-let because i did n't have a pension .
i remortgaged my own home to build up a small portfolio of properties that provide tenants with comfortable homes - though letting law heavily favours them over landlords .
but the latest interest rate rises mean rents barely cover mortgage repayments , let alone insurance and other costs .
if tax relief is removed , i , like many others , will be forced to sell up .
if a mass sell-off leads to a housing crash , i shall be back to square one : no pension !
christine wharton , cornwall it is not just first-time buyers who are being squeezed out by those looking for investments but also those who need to downsize or even move on the same level .
short-term tenants and second home owners do not contribute towards the community either economically or socially .
investment property owners always seem to have the necessary cash to outbid any owner-occupier buyer in the medium to low-priced property categories particularly in the nicer parts of this town .
julia , eastbourne what a load of rubbish is spoken about investors buying properties and taking them from first-time buyers .
the comments i hear most often are first-time buyers ca n't afford the deposits , therefore if investors can and they buy them - at least that is providing homes that those very people can live in - whereas if they had to save up a deposit , they would not be living in them .
rob cargill , london the issue of tax relief is an absolute outrage joy waters , norwich i have children in their 20s whose lives are effectively on hold because of the ludicrous situation in the housing market .
they earn too much for social housing , but not enough to buy a house .
most so-called affordable housing is snapped up by investors and i think the issue of tax relief is an absolute outrage .
what no one ever seems to answer either is the question of security of tenure .
what will happen when all the 20 somethings are having children in a few years time .
my children have both been forced to move simply because the rent has been increased or the property sold .
where is the stability in six month tenancies for families ?
joy waters , norwich offsetting interest against rent is not a " tax break " .
any business making income from owning an asset pays tax on the net income after the costs of running and owning those assets , which includes interest payments incurred as a result of borrowing money to purchase those assets in the first place .
btl is no different .
unlike homeowners , btl landlords will pay capital gains tax on any gain in value when they dispose of the property .
everyone running a business is treated the same -lrb- and fairly so -rrb- , and it is homeowners that get the tax break .
chris baverstock , fareham buy-to-let landlords getting tax breaks is a total disgrace .
it is absolutely clear that first-time buyers are taking out ruinous loans .
the buy-to-let lobby and the mortgage providers have sewn up the uk housing market - it is scandalous .
the so-called " housing market " has become the world 's biggest ever pyramid-selling scam .
it is ruining many , many people 's lives .
houses are already only affordable by average people having to take out loans well over 10 times income .
paul shooter , salisbury affordable housing is quite rightly discussed on numerous occasions on radio and tv - but no one says how much in cash terms they mean by affordable .
anyone willing to come forward with an answer ?
pat bourchier , yateley , hampshire those buy-to-letters of the borrow-to-let variety are clearly doomed duncan , milton keynes buy-to-let investors have out-priced many first-time buyers in all areas of the country .
their business model is built on rising prices , low interest rates , loose lending policies and also a preferential tax system .
with many of these in the process of change those buy-to-letters of the borrow-to-let variety are clearly doomed .
yet banks are still signing off loans and some media outlets are shamefully hyping the market .
i think more responsibility should be shown and loans and information relating to buy-to-let should come with a warning as people are unwittingly risking their retirements , and you only get one of them !
duncan , milton keynes we do n't need any more new houses to be built especially on greenfield sites .
what most people do n't realise is that for every person who wants a home there are five empty houses built before 1960 .
quentin williams , bristol buy-to-let owners who leave properties empty are not receiving any rent .
interest tax relief is only allowable against earnings from the rental income .
therefore , mortgages on empty properties do not attract tax relief .
malcolm johnson , stoke-on-trent the buy-to-let landlord 's mantra seems to be : " gordon stole our pensions , so we have to invest in property . "
so one generation gets their pensions stolen , and now the next generation has had affordable housing stolen from them .
what a triumph for our society .

believe me , being a landlord creates just as many headaches as any other self-employed job ever could , and at the end of it , when it 's time to sell the property , the chancellor makes a small fortune in capital gains tax .
so , i would suggest you take that in to consideration before you start saying we should be taxed even more .
helen mcginty , birmingham buy-to let landlords provide my family with a rented home .
where will we live if buy-to-let ceases to be a wise investment ?
surely the uk is still a " free " land where we are not forced to buy property to live in a house , or does the government wish to own property again .
i think not .
steven hunt , ashford i suggest if you ca n't afford to buy and you 're in the position of having to pay extortionate rents to private landlords ; join the social housing list and put pressure on them to find you somewhere .
the people i know who rent socially pay about 1/4 of the price of private rents and they have pretty good place .
david , london ninety per cent of those demanding the change in the law are people who wish they were in the position to own a buy-to-let property themselves .
there is no empirical evidence that landlords are crowding out the property market and if anything , demand for rented accommodation is , more often than not , helping to regenerate parts of towns and cities in this country that were totally forgotten .
juan carlos grinan , walton on thames give mortgage interest relief to all or none p negi , london all we first-time-buyers ask for is an even field .
give mortgage interest relief to all or none .
why the discrimination ?
if btl left the market , the supply would stay the same and prices would come down - people like us would finally be able to buy rather than pay some guy 's pension .
all we ask for is equality on the mortgage interest relief issue .
p negi , london one way of reducing the number of empty properties is to slash the time taken for planning permission and building regulations approval - in our area the whole process can take six months -lrb- it is wise to wait for planning permission before applying for building regulations -rrb- .
if you buy a house that needs total renovation and extension , it can sit empty for six months before work can start .
this often happens as more people now rent for a few months to break the house purchase chain and to enable them to take on a " project " .
phil ainsworth , st albans the btl investors are a similar breed to those who drove the dot-com bandwagon over the cliff and to those lloyds " names " who lost their shirts a few years back .
they believe that their investment is so sound that they can not possibly lose .
however , in reality , they are gambling money -lrb- often borrowed money that they can not afford to lose -rrb- on a short priced favourite .
paul , devon we 've made the decision not to sell off our farm cottages , instead we have kept them and let them out for shorthold tenants .
we have been offered silly money to sell the houses , but know that they would end up becoming second homes , which would remove even more properties from the housing market .
by keeping them as letting property , we are at least giving a chance to locals to live in the local area , where they are usually pushed out by the second home market .
jason borthwick , burnham deepdale , norfolk southampton is really suffering from this phenomenon kathy emmott , southampton not only is buy-to-let pushing up prices , it is also creating streets full of rented properties where no-one cares about the gardens , the rubbish , the neighbours etc and all sense of community is lost as almost all the people living there are entirely transient .
i live in a street like that and it is really depressing as i did save all my money to buy my house and all the landlords think about is making cash from the properties .
it 's not just my street - southampton is really suffering from this phenomenon .
something must be done to halt this - raising the tax would be a good start .
kathy emmott , southampton all these people complaining about landlord 's .
i suggest they try letting a property out .
letting law heavily favours the tenant .
letting property is not something to be done on a whim - a lot of responsibilities come with it .
that 's why a landlord is entitled to make some money in the same way as any other business .
jim , scunthorpe if you want to increase supply - do away with capital gains tax for selling .
many landlords ca n't afford to sell since there is n't enough equity in their properties to pay the taxman .
colin gordon , edinburgh so far i have been outbid twice by btl landlords john walters , halifax i am a first time buyer looking to get a foot on the ladder and so far i have been outbid twice by btl landlords .
how am i ever going to buy when blt 'ers are pricing us out of the market going above asking prices for property ?
these houses then stay empty for months .
john walters , halifax once upon a time a btl mortgage was considered as a commercial loan , finance was relatively hard to come by , and the interest rates were considerably higher than for a normal home loan .
now lenders are competing to give money away cheaply for btl mortgages without the traditional income multiples which apply -lrb- especially -rrb- to first-time buyers .
these developments have given the btl investors far too big an advantage and have inflated the house market unnaturally .
richard rogers , cambourne buy-to-let landlords are always wanting to make a profit at the expense of those of us wanting to buy our first home !
i think something should be done soon !
like many , both my husband and i work full time but can not afford a mortgage , let alone raising the money for a deposit , when we are ourselves funding these buy-to-let landlords !
tracey , maidstone i lost a lot of money on buy-to-let and have losses which i can not offset against other income .
these losses are real and are run up on credit cards for which i have to repay out of taxed money .
to disallow interest from tax calculations would be to ignore the economic reality of the venture and would be a huge mistake .
arnie , edinburgh perhaps gordon brown can provide some tax relief to landlords who sell up ?
roger , london i want to get out of the housing market .
however , if i sell up i will end up with a big capital gains tax bill and this is a disincentive to sell .
perhaps gordon brown can provide some tax relief to landlords who sell up ?
business owners who do sell up get relief but not residential landlords .
roger , london a fair solution would be to enable first-time buyers to pay interest on their mortgages from their pre-tax salary .
introducing a new tax for buy-to-let landlords wo n't help first-time buyers a bit .
it is just a trick for getting more tax .
nenad , london i hear pension , pension , pension .
property has always been a safe investment but when you get into the situation we are in with massively over-inflated prices we could be in for another pensions crash .
we hear about how we 've had 10 years of growth but it 's all based on debt .
danny , gravesend most btl landlords i have come across do not pay any tax whatsoever .
they remortgaged their properties when prices went up and used the money as new deposits to buy more properties .
if they were honest with the taxman most would not be able to build up a portfolio that fast .
john , london the biggest issue here is about housing being more affordable and not building more affordable housing .
i think the best approach would be for all new-build properties with two bedrooms or under -lrb- first-time buyer properties -rrb- to be sold only for primary occupancy and not to investors .
the new build house we are renting would be perfect for us to buy , we pay £ 600 pcm rent although the current market value of the house would mean we could n't afford to actually purchase it !
john moore , northampton i have nothing against students , but their landlords do n't seem to care if the gardens look scruffy ann gowland , farnham i have lived in a close of 24 terraced houses for over 20 years .
during this time , 12 have come on the market , of which nine have been bought by landlords to let to students , and only three have been bought by families .
i have nothing against students , but their landlords do n't seem to care if the gardens look scruffy with overflowing wheelie bins left out on the pavement .
i think buy-to-let landlords should not be exempt from tax on mortgage interest .
also i think they should pay council tax .
i hope gordon brown will address the problem .
rents should be controlled , and tenants should be given more security of tenure .
ann gowland , farnham if tax relief on interest payments will be scrapped , will capital gains tax also be scrapped ? !
paul , manchester people should be allowed to get tax relief on tenancy income on one property , but perhaps it should be abolished for any subsequent rental property after the first one .
this should slow the market slightly by pushing out some existing or prospective multiple buy-to-letters .
lee mccarthy , rainham the solution is really very simple .
restore the rights of sitting tenants .
mortgage companies will only lend so cheaply on buy-to-let because they see no risk - they can repossess at any time and the tenant can not stop them .
meanwhile it is impossible to get anything other than a shorthold tenancy , so tenants have no security .
put back secured tenancies and the market will calm itself down quickly and the lunacy will end .
silas denyer , london i was under the delusion that left-wing jealousy was a thing of the past in the uk colin , dubai i have never read so much rubbish .
any business -lrb- and buy-to-let is a business -rrb- is allowed to offset costs against income .
i was under the delusion that left-wing jealousy was a thing of the past in the uk .
clearly it is n't .
colin , dubai my wife and i have been buy-to-let landlords for 3 and a half years .
we have never made any money from our properties - in fact , the running total of our losses over that period stands at over £ 27,000 .
we are currently losing around £ 700 a month .
because the market is so saturated , we have n't made any capital gain , either - our properties are now worth less than when we bought them .
an awful lot of people have been seduced into the idea of buy-to-let as a great money making scheme - it just is n't .
our agent in manchester , where we have one of our flats , told us last year that there were about 25,000 properties available for rent , chasing approximately half that number of prospective tenants - and that 's why properties stay empty .
tony jefferson , oxford though i do not have a buy-to-let property at the moment , i do not think that the government should consider any tax rules to discourage buy-to-let investors .
i know many investors work very hard to put down a very large deposit .
why should people be penalised when they work hard for it ?
many have no confidence in their future pension income so if they have taken steps to build up their property portfolio , leave the investors alone .
comment about investors leaving their properties empty is exaggerated .
who wants to be paying a hefty mortgage and leaving properties empty ?
jan , london we will never lose our tax relief because it would be lost votes for the government rupert , gerrards cross this would be a disaster for us landlords .
at the moment yields are only 6 % on my portfolio .
if i lost all my tax relief i would have to sell my portfolio because there would be no financial benefit in keeping it .
even worse , i would then have to pay huge capital gains tax on my profits .
it 's not my problem that youngsters today ca n't afford anything .
we will never lose our tax relief because it would be lost votes for the government .
rupert , gerrards cross this is typical of the way we always look for someone to blame .
i agree with the view that people who buy property and then leave it empty should not benefit , but they can only offset the interest against income from the property .
good landlords rent at affordable market rates .
the real issue is that there is no local authorities building social housing and of course thatcher gave you all the right to buy .
how many people bought up the social housing stock , and have reaped a healthy profit .
that is the real issue .
stop the blame culture and address the issue , we must build more houses .
kris hurman , ashford this argument would not have come about if it was not for the laughable inflation targets set by brown leading to ludicrously low interest rates , and secondly the supply side constraints on house building .
if we build more houses and set interest rates against a basket of measures rather than cpi , the price of houses will fall and many highly speculative and amateur btl landlords will be forced to sell uneconomic so-called investments .
steven farrall , ipswich we need a partnership between local councils and buy-to-let money .
the councils would get the finance to build social housing .
the buy-to-let people would benefit from the councils ' expertise and a greater spread of properties .
there would also be more homes for renting and for buying .
finally , we need to halt the forced sale of council houses at knock down prices , which has already done too much harm .
chris grey , guildford their pension is our homelessness .
all property owners exploit a monopoly position - a monopoly in something everyone needs just to be able to have a settled home somewhere and find work .
their capital gains , like those of any owner , are caused by the relative popularity of a location - something their investment itself does nothing to achieve .
their mortgages , like all mortgages , are the core of our money supply and the root of inflation .
this is n't about buy-to-let per se , but about our relationship to land as a society .
land value tax would encourage such people to put their savings into genuinely wealth-producing assets , not zero sum gains that exclude others from life 's essentials .
jock , oxford why should the tenant contribute to their pensions ?
patricia booth , canterbury i think buy-to-let landlords have become very greedy .
as most of us know , landlords can offset much of their expenditure against tax .
so why should the tenant contribute to their pensions ?
there are plenty of other avenues for investment .
also , the greedy landlords make the tenant liable for the council tax .
patricia booth , canterbury the reason for the buy-to-let boom is the ridiculous state pension , the uncertainty of company pensions , the ability of the chancellor to destroy private pensions and the risks as shown by the equitable life debacle .
all these things can be solved by introducing a decent state pension .
john , france the buy-to-let bubble will eventually take down the whole housing market .
in reading all of the comments below it is clear that interest rate rises are already starting to pinch .
more rate rises to come ?
most likely , and when the landlords start to see that they can not even break even there will be a stampede for the exits and prices will drop like a stone .
this is a disaster in the making .
and after that there will no doubt be affordable housing again for the first-time buyers but not before many have lost their shirts .
nicky , southampton the btl industry in the uk is needed , especially in large , high-density urban areas .
getting rid of tax relief is a half-baked idea - it would be insignificant .
it is a highly complex problem to provide enough homes for all and sundry in the south east at the right price .
everybody should have a home in a civilised society but do n't blame btl .
blame gordon brown and co - they run the country and they planned wrong .
joe regan , london maybe if currently insecure pensions were restored and protected again people would n't need to invest in property as an alternative .
my own employers , a blue chip multinational , have followed the market and ended the final salary pension scheme , cutting prospective pensions in half despite making record profits .
buy-to-let is a symptom of this more fundamental disease and taxing such landlords further will only add to the burden of future taxpayers who will have to meet the cost of today 's failed pensions .
deal with the real issue first please and put pensions before shareholder and board greed .
stephen , glasgow interest relief serves to reduce the rents to millions of tenants ... so this is another spun-up non-story .
hugh burnett , london if there is ever a price crash , a lot of tenants will suffer as their rented accommodation is sold from under them nick , horncastle i had to move twice in three years due to buy-to-let landlord greed .
first , making the house intolerable by cramming too many people in , then selling the house from under us to cash in their investment .
if there is ever a price crash , a lot of tenants will suffer as their rented accommodation is sold from under them in the scramble to sell .
we desperately need a stock of rented accommodation divorced from speculation , to serve the same purpose as council housing used to do .
nick , horncastle in the past couple of years interest rates have increased dramatically but rents have been stagnant .
as an average investor i am making a loss on my properties .
there is already a charge on empty property -lrb- council tax -rrb- and i would be mad to voluntarily have a property empty , bringing in no income .
unfortunately , sometimes it is difficult to find tenants when you need them .
the " tax-relief " on buy-to-let mortgages is a complete nonsense .
the mortgage interest -lrb- at much higher rates than an a standard mortgage -rrb- is one of the costs that needs to be offset against the income .
colin allinson , munich i assume that those complaining about the supposed unfair tax advantages for landlords will be happy to pay capital gains tax on any gains they make on their own homes .
after all , why should people who have to live in rented houses subsidise potentially " fat cat " home owners ?
yes , the argument is ridiculous but before envy and claims of unfairness are allowed to destroy a vital source of housing for people on benefits , students , older people without pensions and so on , please can we get our facts straight ?
i am amazed that the nla spokesman did not make this point .
john bird , billericay if tax relief is removed , i , like many others , will be forced to sell up christine wharton , cornwall would a solution for first-time buyers be to give them income tax relief on their first mortgage ?
like many , i went into buy-to-let because i did n't have a pension .
i remortgaged my own home to build up a small portfolio of properties that provide tenants with comfortable homes - though letting law heavily favours them over landlords .
but the latest interest rate rises mean rents barely cover mortgage repayments , let alone insurance and other costs .
if tax relief is removed , i , like many others , will be forced to sell up .
if a mass sell-off leads to a housing crash , i shall be back to square one : no pension !
christine wharton , cornwall it is not just first-time buyers who are being squeezed out by those looking for investments but also those who need to downsize or even move on the same level .
short-term tenants and second home owners do not contribute towards the community either economically or socially .
investment property owners always seem to have the necessary cash to outbid any owner-occupier buyer in the medium to low-priced property categories particularly in the nicer parts of this town .
julia , eastbourne what a load of rubbish is spoken about investors buying properties and taking them from first-time buyers .
the comments i hear most often are first-time buyers ca n't afford the deposits , therefore if investors can and they buy them - at least that is providing homes that those very people can live in - whereas if they had to save up a deposit , they would not be living in them .
rob cargill , london the issue of tax relief is an absolute outrage joy waters , norwich i have children in their 20s whose lives are effectively on hold because of the ludicrous situation in the housing market .
they earn too much for social housing , but not enough to buy a house .
most so-called affordable housing is snapped up by investors and i think the issue of tax relief is an absolute outrage .
what no one ever seems to answer either is the question of security of tenure .
what will happen when all the 20 somethings are having children in a few years time .
my children have both been forced to move simply because the rent has been increased or the property sold .
where is the stability in six month tenancies for families ?
joy waters , norwich offsetting interest against rent is not a " tax break " .
any business making income from owning an asset pays tax on the net income after the costs of running and owning those assets , which includes interest payments incurred as a result of borrowing money to purchase those assets in the first place .
btl is no different .
unlike homeowners , btl landlords will pay capital gains tax on any gain in value when they dispose of the property .
everyone running a business is treated the same -lrb- and fairly so -rrb- , and it is homeowners that get the tax break .
chris baverstock , fareham buy-to-let landlords getting tax breaks is a total disgrace .
it is absolutely clear that first-time buyers are taking out ruinous loans .
the buy-to-let lobby and the mortgage providers have sewn up the uk housing market - it is scandalous .
the so-called " housing market " has become the world 's biggest ever pyramid-selling scam .
it is ruining many , many people 's lives .
houses are already only affordable by average people having to take out loans well over 10 times income .
paul shooter , salisbury affordable housing is quite rightly discussed on numerous occasions on radio and tv - but no one says how much in cash terms they mean by affordable .
anyone willing to come forward with an answer ?
pat bourchier , yateley , hampshire those buy-to-letters of the borrow-to-let variety are clearly doomed duncan , milton keynes buy-to-let investors have out-priced many first-time buyers in all areas of the country .
their business model is built on rising prices , low interest rates , loose lending policies and also a preferential tax system .
with many of these in the process of change those buy-to-letters of the borrow-to-let variety are clearly doomed .
yet banks are still signing off loans and some media outlets are shamefully hyping the market .
i think more responsibility should be shown and loans and information relating to buy-to-let should come with a warning as people are unwittingly risking their retirements , and you only get one of them !
duncan , milton keynes we do n't need any more new houses to be built especially on greenfield sites .
what most people do n't realise is that for every person who wants a home there are five empty houses built before 1960 .
quentin williams , bristol buy-to-let owners who leave properties empty are not receiving any rent .
interest tax relief is only allowable against earnings from the rental income .
therefore , mortgages on empty properties do not attract tax relief .
malcolm johnson , stoke-on-trent the buy-to-let landlord 's mantra seems to be : " gordon stole our pensions , so we have to invest in property . "
so one generation gets their pensions stolen , and now the next generation has had affordable housing stolen from them .
what a triumph for our society .

paul diggory has called on the government to tackle the " runaway " market which he says is contributing to problems faced by first-time buyers .
he says buy-to-let owners have a financial advantage over those trying to buy their first home , and push house prices even higher .
we asked for your comments , a selection of which are below .
this debate is now closed .
listen to yourselves .
we have become a nation of greedy , self-centred , something-for-nothing pension and house-price obsessives .
and if you have n't got it , you squeal because someone else has .
being young , healthy and free with loving family and friends beats all the pension nonsense hands down .
f gray , laide i am a buy-to-let landlord but can see no logic at all in mortgage tax relief .
it allows higher prices to be afforded and provides an unfair advantage over first-time buyers .
landlords do not qualify for business capital gains taper relief so why should they get business tax relief on loan interest ?
michael hunt , hungerford brilliant idea !
tax to the hilt the very people who are providing a solution to those that can not afford to buy , so there will be an even worse housing crisis !
sheer genius !
rob cargill , london to suggest that these buy-to-let landlords are somehow putting themselves out to provide a public service is just ridiculous brian , glasgow i would be quite happy if some of the buy-to-let landlords had to sell up if they were taxed .
profiting from property for commercial use is one thing , profiting from what is a basic right of society for everyone to have a roof over their heads is just obscene .
to suggest that these buy-to-let landlords are somehow putting themselves out to provide a public service is just ridiculous .
brian , glasgow i own one property which i let out .
if tax relief on mortgage interest was abolished , the only thing this would achieve would be to push up rents by about 40 % - hardly good news for tenants .
mr m , london buy-to-let is just the same as if a small number of speculators bought up all the food , and then when people were hungry enough , sold it back to them at inflated prices .
the practise of btl should be heavily discouraged , it 's the main cause of the misery of high house prices .
tomo redfern , london believe me , being a landlord creates just as many headaches as any other self-employed job helen mcginty , birmingham buying houses to rent is my job .
i am a self-employed landlord .
i do n't have another job , this is what i do to earn a living .
for those of you who think most of us are making a fortune out of rental properties , you are sadly wrong ; not to mention all the hassle we have with tenants not paying , trashing our properties , repair work , etc .
believe me , being a landlord creates just as many headaches as any other self-employed job ever could , and at the end of it , when it 's time to sell the property , the chancellor makes a small fortune in capital gains tax .
so , i would suggest you take that in to consideration before you start saying we should be taxed even more .
helen mcginty , birmingham buy-to let landlords provide my family with a rented home .
where will we live if buy-to-let ceases to be a wise investment ?
surely the uk is still a " free " land where we are not forced to buy property to live in a house , or does the government wish to own property again .
i think not .
steven hunt , ashford i suggest if you ca n't afford to buy and you 're in the position of having to pay extortionate rents to private landlords ; join the social housing list and put pressure on them to find you somewhere .
the people i know who rent socially pay about 1/4 of the price of private rents and they have pretty good place .

many landlords ca n't afford to sell since there is n't enough equity in their properties to pay the taxman .
colin gordon , edinburgh so far i have been outbid twice by btl landlords john walters , halifax i am a first time buyer looking to get a foot on the ladder and so far i have been outbid twice by btl landlords .
how am i ever going to buy when blt 'ers are pricing us out of the market going above asking prices for property ?

to disallow interest from tax calculations would be to ignore the economic reality of the venture and would be a huge mistake .
arnie , edinburgh perhaps gordon brown can provide some tax relief to landlords who sell up ?
roger , london i want to get out of the housing market .
however , if i sell up i will end up with a big capital gains tax bill and this is a disincentive to sell .
perhaps gordon brown can provide some tax relief to landlords who sell up ?
business owners who do sell up get relief but not residential landlords .
roger , london a fair solution would be to enable first-time buyers to pay interest on their mortgages from their pre-tax salary .
introducing a new tax for buy-to-let landlords wo n't help first-time buyers a bit .
it is just a trick for getting more tax .
nenad , london i hear pension , pension , pension .
property has always been a safe investment but when you get into the situation we are in with massively over-inflated prices we could be in for another pensions crash .
we hear about how we 've had 10 years of growth but it 's all based on debt .
danny , gravesend most btl landlords i have come across do not pay any tax whatsoever .
they remortgaged their properties when prices went up and used the money as new deposits to buy more properties .
if they were honest with the taxman most would not be able to build up a portfolio that fast .
john , london the biggest issue here is about housing being more affordable and not building more affordable housing .
i think the best approach would be for all new-build properties with two bedrooms or under -lrb- first-time buyer properties -rrb- to be sold only for primary occupancy and not to investors .
the new build house we are renting would be perfect for us to buy , we pay £ 600 pcm rent although the current market value of the house would mean we could n't afford to actually purchase it !
john moore , northampton i have nothing against students , but their landlords do n't seem to care if the gardens look scruffy ann gowland , farnham i have lived in a close of 24 terraced houses for over 20 years .
during this time , 12 have come on the market , of which nine have been bought by landlords to let to students , and only three have been bought by families .
i have nothing against students , but their landlords do n't seem to care if the gardens look scruffy with overflowing wheelie bins left out on the pavement .
i think buy-to-let landlords should not be exempt from tax on mortgage interest .
also i think they should pay council tax .
i hope gordon brown will address the problem .
rents should be controlled , and tenants should be given more security of tenure .
ann gowland , farnham if tax relief on interest payments will be scrapped , will capital gains tax also be scrapped ? !
paul , manchester people should be allowed to get tax relief on tenancy income on one property , but perhaps it should be abolished for any subsequent rental property after the first one .
this should slow the market slightly by pushing out some existing or prospective multiple buy-to-letters .
lee mccarthy , rainham the solution is really very simple .
restore the rights of sitting tenants .
mortgage companies will only lend so cheaply on buy-to-let because they see no risk - they can repossess at any time and the tenant can not stop them .
meanwhile it is impossible to get anything other than a shorthold tenancy , so tenants have no security .
put back secured tenancies and the market will calm itself down quickly and the lunacy will end .
silas denyer , london i was under the delusion that left-wing jealousy was a thing of the past in the uk colin , dubai i have never read so much rubbish .
any business -lrb- and buy-to-let is a business -rrb- is allowed to offset costs against income .
i was under the delusion that left-wing jealousy was a thing of the past in the uk .
clearly it is n't .
colin , dubai my wife and i have been buy-to-let landlords for 3 and a half years .
we have never made any money from our properties - in fact , the running total of our losses over that period stands at over £ 27,000 .
we are currently losing around £ 700 a month .
because the market is so saturated , we have n't made any capital gain , either - our properties are now worth less than when we bought them .
an awful lot of people have been seduced into the idea of buy-to-let as a great money making scheme - it just is n't .
our agent in manchester , where we have one of our flats , told us last year that there were about 25,000 properties available for rent , chasing approximately half that number of prospective tenants - and that 's why properties stay empty .
tony jefferson , oxford though i do not have a buy-to-let property at the moment , i do not think that the government should consider any tax rules to discourage buy-to-let investors .
i know many investors work very hard to put down a very large deposit .
why should people be penalised when they work hard for it ?
many have no confidence in their future pension income so if they have taken steps to build up their property portfolio , leave the investors alone .
comment about investors leaving their properties empty is exaggerated .
who wants to be paying a hefty mortgage and leaving properties empty ?
jan , london we will never lose our tax relief because it would be lost votes for the government rupert , gerrards cross this would be a disaster for us landlords .
at the moment yields are only 6 % on my portfolio .
if i lost all my tax relief i would have to sell my portfolio because there would be no financial benefit in keeping it .
even worse , i would then have to pay huge capital gains tax on my profits .
it 's not my problem that youngsters today ca n't afford anything .
we will never lose our tax relief because it would be lost votes for the government .
rupert , gerrards cross this is typical of the way we always look for someone to blame .
i agree with the view that people who buy property and then leave it empty should not benefit , but they can only offset the interest against income from the property .
good landlords rent at affordable market rates .
the real issue is that there is no local authorities building social housing and of course thatcher gave you all the right to buy .
how many people bought up the social housing stock , and have reaped a healthy profit .
that is the real issue .
stop the blame culture and address the issue , we must build more houses .
kris hurman , ashford this argument would not have come about if it was not for the laughable inflation targets set by brown leading to ludicrously low interest rates , and secondly the supply side constraints on house building .
if we build more houses and set interest rates against a basket of measures rather than cpi , the price of houses will fall and many highly speculative and amateur btl landlords will be forced to sell uneconomic so-called investments .
steven farrall , ipswich we need a partnership between local councils and buy-to-let money .
the councils would get the finance to build social housing .
the buy-to-let people would benefit from the councils ' expertise and a greater spread of properties .
there would also be more homes for renting and for buying .
finally , we need to halt the forced sale of council houses at knock down prices , which has already done too much harm .
chris grey , guildford their pension is our homelessness .
all property owners exploit a monopoly position - a monopoly in something everyone needs just to be able to have a settled home somewhere and find work .
their capital gains , like those of any owner , are caused by the relative popularity of a location - something their investment itself does nothing to achieve .
their mortgages , like all mortgages , are the core of our money supply and the root of inflation .
this is n't about buy-to-let per se , but about our relationship to land as a society .
land value tax would encourage such people to put their savings into genuinely wealth-producing assets , not zero sum gains that exclude others from life 's essentials .
jock , oxford why should the tenant contribute to their pensions ?
patricia booth , canterbury i think buy-to-let landlords have become very greedy .
as most of us know , landlords can offset much of their expenditure against tax .
so why should the tenant contribute to their pensions ?
there are plenty of other avenues for investment .
also , the greedy landlords make the tenant liable for the council tax .
patricia booth , canterbury the reason for the buy-to-let boom is the ridiculous state pension , the uncertainty of company pensions , the ability of the chancellor to destroy private pensions and the risks as shown by the equitable life debacle .
all these things can be solved by introducing a decent state pension .
john , france the buy-to-let bubble will eventually take down the whole housing market .
in reading all of the comments below it is clear that interest rate rises are already starting to pinch .
more rate rises to come ?
most likely , and when the landlords start to see that they can not even break even there will be a stampede for the exits and prices will drop like a stone .
this is a disaster in the making .
and after that there will no doubt be affordable housing again for the first-time buyers but not before many have lost their shirts .
nicky , southampton the btl industry in the uk is needed , especially in large , high-density urban areas .
getting rid of tax relief is a half-baked idea - it would be insignificant .
it is a highly complex problem to provide enough homes for all and sundry in the south east at the right price .
everybody should have a home in a civilised society but do n't blame btl .
blame gordon brown and co - they run the country and they planned wrong .
joe regan , london maybe if currently insecure pensions were restored and protected again people would n't need to invest in property as an alternative .
my own employers , a blue chip multinational , have followed the market and ended the final salary pension scheme , cutting prospective pensions in half despite making record profits .
buy-to-let is a symptom of this more fundamental disease and taxing such landlords further will only add to the burden of future taxpayers who will have to meet the cost of today 's failed pensions .
deal with the real issue first please and put pensions before shareholder and board greed .
stephen , glasgow interest relief serves to reduce the rents to millions of tenants ... so this is another spun-up non-story .
hugh burnett , london if there is ever a price crash , a lot of tenants will suffer as their rented accommodation is sold from under them nick , horncastle i had to move twice in three years due to buy-to-let landlord greed .
first , making the house intolerable by cramming too many people in , then selling the house from under us to cash in their investment .
if there is ever a price crash , a lot of tenants will suffer as their rented accommodation is sold from under them in the scramble to sell .
we desperately need a stock of rented accommodation divorced from speculation , to serve the same purpose as council housing used to do .
nick , horncastle in the past couple of years interest rates have increased dramatically but rents have been stagnant .
as an average investor i am making a loss on my properties .
there is already a charge on empty property -lrb- council tax -rrb- and i would be mad to voluntarily have a property empty , bringing in no income .
unfortunately , sometimes it is difficult to find tenants when you need them .
the " tax-relief " on buy-to-let mortgages is a complete nonsense .
the mortgage interest -lrb- at much higher rates than an a standard mortgage -rrb- is one of the costs that needs to be offset against the income .
colin allinson , munich i assume that those complaining about the supposed unfair tax advantages for landlords will be happy to pay capital gains tax on any gains they make on their own homes .
after all , why should people who have to live in rented houses subsidise potentially " fat cat " home owners ?
yes , the argument is ridiculous but before envy and claims of unfairness are allowed to destroy a vital source of housing for people on benefits , students , older people without pensions and so on , please can we get our facts straight ?
i am amazed that the nla spokesman did not make this point .
john bird , billericay if tax relief is removed , i , like many others , will be forced to sell up christine wharton , cornwall would a solution for first-time buyers be to give them income tax relief on their first mortgage ?
like many , i went into buy-to-let because i did n't have a pension .
i remortgaged my own home to build up a small portfolio of properties that provide tenants with comfortable homes - though letting law heavily favours them over landlords .
but the latest interest rate rises mean rents barely cover mortgage repayments , let alone insurance and other costs .
if tax relief is removed , i , like many others , will be forced to sell up .
if a mass sell-off leads to a housing crash , i shall be back to square one : no pension !
christine wharton , cornwall it is not just first-time buyers who are being squeezed out by those looking for investments but also those who need to downsize or even move on the same level .
short-term tenants and second home owners do not contribute towards the community either economically or socially .
investment property owners always seem to have the necessary cash to outbid any owner-occupier buyer in the medium to low-priced property categories particularly in the nicer parts of this town .
julia , eastbourne what a load of rubbish is spoken about investors buying properties and taking them from first-time buyers .
the comments i hear most often are first-time buyers ca n't afford the deposits , therefore if investors can and they buy them - at least that is providing homes that those very people can live in - whereas if they had to save up a deposit , they would not be living in them .
rob cargill , london the issue of tax relief is an absolute outrage joy waters , norwich i have children in their 20s whose lives are effectively on hold because of the ludicrous situation in the housing market .
they earn too much for social housing , but not enough to buy a house .
most so-called affordable housing is snapped up by investors and i think the issue of tax relief is an absolute outrage .
what no one ever seems to answer either is the question of security of tenure .
what will happen when all the 20 somethings are having children in a few years time .
my children have both been forced to move simply because the rent has been increased or the property sold .
where is the stability in six month tenancies for families ?
joy waters , norwich offsetting interest against rent is not a " tax break " .
any business making income from owning an asset pays tax on the net income after the costs of running and owning those assets , which includes interest payments incurred as a result of borrowing money to purchase those assets in the first place .
btl is no different .
unlike homeowners , btl landlords will pay capital gains tax on any gain in value when they dispose of the property .
everyone running a business is treated the same -lrb- and fairly so -rrb- , and it is homeowners that get the tax break .
chris baverstock , fareham buy-to-let landlords getting tax breaks is a total disgrace .
it is absolutely clear that first-time buyers are taking out ruinous loans .
the buy-to-let lobby and the mortgage providers have sewn up the uk housing market - it is scandalous .
the so-called " housing market " has become the world 's biggest ever pyramid-selling scam .
it is ruining many , many people 's lives .
houses are already only affordable by average people having to take out loans well over 10 times income .
paul shooter , salisbury affordable housing is quite rightly discussed on numerous occasions on radio and tv - but no one says how much in cash terms they mean by affordable .
anyone willing to come forward with an answer ?
pat bourchier , yateley , hampshire those buy-to-letters of the borrow-to-let variety are clearly doomed duncan , milton keynes buy-to-let investors have out-priced many first-time buyers in all areas of the country .
their business model is built on rising prices , low interest rates , loose lending policies and also a preferential tax system .
with many of these in the process of change those buy-to-letters of the borrow-to-let variety are clearly doomed .
yet banks are still signing off loans and some media outlets are shamefully hyping the market .
i think more responsibility should be shown and loans and information relating to buy-to-let should come with a warning as people are unwittingly risking their retirements , and you only get one of them !
duncan , milton keynes we do n't need any more new houses to be built especially on greenfield sites .
what most people do n't realise is that for every person who wants a home there are five empty houses built before 1960 .
quentin williams , bristol buy-to-let owners who leave properties empty are not receiving any rent .
interest tax relief is only allowable against earnings from the rental income .
therefore , mortgages on empty properties do not attract tax relief .
malcolm johnson , stoke-on-trent the buy-to-let landlord 's mantra seems to be : " gordon stole our pensions , so we have to invest in property . "
so one generation gets their pensions stolen , and now the next generation has had affordable housing stolen from them .
what a triumph for our society .

paul diggory has called on the government to tackle the " runaway " market which he says is contributing to problems faced by first-time buyers .
he says buy-to-let owners have a financial advantage over those trying to buy their first home , and push house prices even higher .
we asked for your comments , a selection of which are below .
this debate is now closed .
listen to yourselves .
we have become a nation of greedy , self-centred , something-for-nothing pension and house-price obsessives .
and if you have n't got it , you squeal because someone else has .
being young , healthy and free with loving family and friends beats all the pension nonsense hands down .
f gray , laide i am a buy-to-let landlord but can see no logic at all in mortgage tax relief .
it allows higher prices to be afforded and provides an unfair advantage over first-time buyers .
landlords do not qualify for business capital gains taper relief so why should they get business tax relief on loan interest ?
michael hunt , hungerford brilliant idea !
tax to the hilt the very people who are providing a solution to those that can not afford to buy , so there will be an even worse housing crisis !
sheer genius !
rob cargill , london to suggest that these buy-to-let landlords are somehow putting themselves out to provide a public service is just ridiculous brian , glasgow i would be quite happy if some of the buy-to-let landlords had to sell up if they were taxed .
profiting from property for commercial use is one thing , profiting from what is a basic right of society for everyone to have a roof over their heads is just obscene .
to suggest that these buy-to-let landlords are somehow putting themselves out to provide a public service is just ridiculous .
brian , glasgow i own one property which i let out .
if tax relief on mortgage interest was abolished , the only thing this would achieve would be to push up rents by about 40 % - hardly good news for tenants .
mr m , london buy-to-let is just the same as if a small number of speculators bought up all the food , and then when people were hungry enough , sold it back to them at inflated prices .
the practise of btl should be heavily discouraged , it 's the main cause of the misery of high house prices .
tomo redfern , london believe me , being a landlord creates just as many headaches as any other self-employed job helen mcginty , birmingham buying houses to rent is my job .
i am a self-employed landlord .
i do n't have another job , this is what i do to earn a living .
for those of you who think most of us are making a fortune out of rental properties , you are sadly wrong ; not to mention all the hassle we have with tenants not paying , trashing our properties , repair work , etc .
believe me , being a landlord creates just as many headaches as any other self-employed job ever could , and at the end of it , when it 's time to sell the property , the chancellor makes a small fortune in capital gains tax .
so , i would suggest you take that in to consideration before you start saying we should be taxed even more .
helen mcginty , birmingham buy-to let landlords provide my family with a rented home .
where will we live if buy-to-let ceases to be a wise investment ?
surely the uk is still a " free " land where we are not forced to buy property to live in a house , or does the government wish to own property again .
i think not .
steven hunt , ashford i suggest if you ca n't afford to buy and you 're in the position of having to pay extortionate rents to private landlords ; join the social housing list and put pressure on them to find you somewhere .
the people i know who rent socially pay about 1/4 of the price of private rents and they have pretty good place .
david , london ninety per cent of those demanding the change in the law are people who wish they were in the position to own a buy-to-let property themselves .
there is no empirical evidence that landlords are crowding out the property market and if anything , demand for rented accommodation is , more often than not , helping to regenerate parts of towns and cities in this country that were totally forgotten .
juan carlos grinan , walton on thames give mortgage interest relief to all or none p negi , london all we first-time-buyers ask for is an even field .
give mortgage interest relief to all or none .
why the discrimination ?
if btl left the market , the supply would stay the same and prices would come down - people like us would finally be able to buy rather than pay some guy 's pension .
all we ask for is equality on the mortgage interest relief issue .
p negi , london one way of reducing the number of empty properties is to slash the time taken for planning permission and building regulations approval - in our area the whole process can take six months -lrb- it is wise to wait for planning permission before applying for building regulations -rrb- .
if you buy a house that needs total renovation and extension , it can sit empty for six months before work can start .
this often happens as more people now rent for a few months to break the house purchase chain and to enable them to take on a " project " .
phil ainsworth , st albans the btl investors are a similar breed to those who drove the dot-com bandwagon over the cliff and to those lloyds " names " who lost their shirts a few years back .
they believe that their investment is so sound that they can not possibly lose .
however , in reality , they are gambling money -lrb- often borrowed money that they can not afford to lose -rrb- on a short priced favourite .
paul , devon we 've made the decision not to sell off our farm cottages , instead we have kept them and let them out for shorthold tenants .
we have been offered silly money to sell the houses , but know that they would end up becoming second homes , which would remove even more properties from the housing market .
by keeping them as letting property , we are at least giving a chance to locals to live in the local area , where they are usually pushed out by the second home market .
jason borthwick , burnham deepdale , norfolk southampton is really suffering from this phenomenon kathy emmott , southampton not only is buy-to-let pushing up prices , it is also creating streets full of rented properties where no-one cares about the gardens , the rubbish , the neighbours etc and all sense of community is lost as almost all the people living there are entirely transient .
i live in a street like that and it is really depressing as i did save all my money to buy my house and all the landlords think about is making cash from the properties .
it 's not just my street - southampton is really suffering from this phenomenon .
something must be done to halt this - raising the tax would be a good start .
kathy emmott , southampton all these people complaining about landlord 's .
i suggest they try letting a property out .
letting law heavily favours the tenant .
letting property is not something to be done on a whim - a lot of responsibilities come with it .
that 's why a landlord is entitled to make some money in the same way as any other business .
jim , scunthorpe if you want to increase supply - do away with capital gains tax for selling .
many landlords ca n't afford to sell since there is n't enough equity in their properties to pay the taxman .
colin gordon , edinburgh so far i have been outbid twice by btl landlords john walters , halifax i am a first time buyer looking to get a foot on the ladder and so far i have been outbid twice by btl landlords .
how am i ever going to buy when blt 'ers are pricing us out of the market going above asking prices for property ?
these houses then stay empty for months .
john walters , halifax once upon a time a btl mortgage was considered as a commercial loan , finance was relatively hard to come by , and the interest rates were considerably higher than for a normal home loan .
now lenders are competing to give money away cheaply for btl mortgages without the traditional income multiples which apply -lrb- especially -rrb- to first-time buyers .
these developments have given the btl investors far too big an advantage and have inflated the house market unnaturally .
richard rogers , cambourne buy-to-let landlords are always wanting to make a profit at the expense of those of us wanting to buy our first home !
i think something should be done soon !
like many , both my husband and i work full time but can not afford a mortgage , let alone raising the money for a deposit , when we are ourselves funding these buy-to-let landlords !
tracey , maidstone i lost a lot of money on buy-to-let and have losses which i can not offset against other income .
these losses are real and are run up on credit cards for which i have to repay out of taxed money .
to disallow interest from tax calculations would be to ignore the economic reality of the venture and would be a huge mistake .
arnie , edinburgh perhaps gordon brown can provide some tax relief to landlords who sell up ?
roger , london i want to get out of the housing market .

john moore , northampton i have nothing against students , but their landlords do n't seem to care if the gardens look scruffy ann gowland , farnham i have lived in a close of 24 terraced houses for over 20 years .
during this time , 12 have come on the market , of which nine have been bought by landlords to let to students , and only three have been bought by families .

i think buy-to-let landlords should not be exempt from tax on mortgage interest .
also i think they should pay council tax .
i hope gordon brown will address the problem .
rents should be controlled , and tenants should be given more security of tenure .
ann gowland , farnham if tax relief on interest payments will be scrapped , will capital gains tax also be scrapped ? !
paul , manchester people should be allowed to get tax relief on tenancy income on one property , but perhaps it should be abolished for any subsequent rental property after the first one .
this should slow the market slightly by pushing out some existing or prospective multiple buy-to-letters .

i agree with the view that people who buy property and then leave it empty should not benefit , but they can only offset the interest against income from the property .
good landlords rent at affordable market rates .
the real issue is that there is no local authorities building social housing and of course thatcher gave you all the right to buy .
how many people bought up the social housing stock , and have reaped a healthy profit .
that is the real issue .
stop the blame culture and address the issue , we must build more houses .
kris hurman , ashford this argument would not have come about if it was not for the laughable inflation targets set by brown leading to ludicrously low interest rates , and secondly the supply side constraints on house building .
if we build more houses and set interest rates against a basket of measures rather than cpi , the price of houses will fall and many highly speculative and amateur btl landlords will be forced to sell uneconomic so-called investments .
steven farrall , ipswich we need a partnership between local councils and buy-to-let money .
the councils would get the finance to build social housing .
the buy-to-let people would benefit from the councils ' expertise and a greater spread of properties .
there would also be more homes for renting and for buying .
finally , we need to halt the forced sale of council houses at knock down prices , which has already done too much harm .
chris grey , guildford their pension is our homelessness .
all property owners exploit a monopoly position - a monopoly in something everyone needs just to be able to have a settled home somewhere and find work .
their capital gains , like those of any owner , are caused by the relative popularity of a location - something their investment itself does nothing to achieve .
their mortgages , like all mortgages , are the core of our money supply and the root of inflation .
this is n't about buy-to-let per se , but about our relationship to land as a society .
land value tax would encourage such people to put their savings into genuinely wealth-producing assets , not zero sum gains that exclude others from life 's essentials .
jock , oxford why should the tenant contribute to their pensions ?
patricia booth , canterbury i think buy-to-let landlords have become very greedy .
as most of us know , landlords can offset much of their expenditure against tax .
so why should the tenant contribute to their pensions ?
there are plenty of other avenues for investment .
also , the greedy landlords make the tenant liable for the council tax .
patricia booth , canterbury the reason for the buy-to-let boom is the ridiculous state pension , the uncertainty of company pensions , the ability of the chancellor to destroy private pensions and the risks as shown by the equitable life debacle .
all these things can be solved by introducing a decent state pension .
john , france the buy-to-let bubble will eventually take down the whole housing market .
in reading all of the comments below it is clear that interest rate rises are already starting to pinch .
more rate rises to come ?
most likely , and when the landlords start to see that they can not even break even there will be a stampede for the exits and prices will drop like a stone .
this is a disaster in the making .
and after that there will no doubt be affordable housing again for the first-time buyers but not before many have lost their shirts .
nicky , southampton the btl industry in the uk is needed , especially in large , high-density urban areas .
getting rid of tax relief is a half-baked idea - it would be insignificant .
it is a highly complex problem to provide enough homes for all and sundry in the south east at the right price .
everybody should have a home in a civilised society but do n't blame btl .
blame gordon brown and co - they run the country and they planned wrong .
joe regan , london maybe if currently insecure pensions were restored and protected again people would n't need to invest in property as an alternative .
my own employers , a blue chip multinational , have followed the market and ended the final salary pension scheme , cutting prospective pensions in half despite making record profits .
buy-to-let is a symptom of this more fundamental disease and taxing such landlords further will only add to the burden of future taxpayers who will have to meet the cost of today 's failed pensions .
deal with the real issue first please and put pensions before shareholder and board greed .
stephen , glasgow interest relief serves to reduce the rents to millions of tenants ... so this is another spun-up non-story .
hugh burnett , london if there is ever a price crash , a lot of tenants will suffer as their rented accommodation is sold from under them nick , horncastle i had to move twice in three years due to buy-to-let landlord greed .
first , making the house intolerable by cramming too many people in , then selling the house from under us to cash in their investment .
if there is ever a price crash , a lot of tenants will suffer as their rented accommodation is sold from under them in the scramble to sell .
we desperately need a stock of rented accommodation divorced from speculation , to serve the same purpose as council housing used to do .
nick , horncastle in the past couple of years interest rates have increased dramatically but rents have been stagnant .
as an average investor i am making a loss on my properties .
there is already a charge on empty property -lrb- council tax -rrb- and i would be mad to voluntarily have a property empty , bringing in no income .
unfortunately , sometimes it is difficult to find tenants when you need them .
the " tax-relief " on buy-to-let mortgages is a complete nonsense .
the mortgage interest -lrb- at much higher rates than an a standard mortgage -rrb- is one of the costs that needs to be offset against the income .
colin allinson , munich i assume that those complaining about the supposed unfair tax advantages for landlords will be happy to pay capital gains tax on any gains they make on their own homes .
after all , why should people who have to live in rented houses subsidise potentially " fat cat " home owners ?
yes , the argument is ridiculous but before envy and claims of unfairness are allowed to destroy a vital source of housing for people on benefits , students , older people without pensions and so on , please can we get our facts straight ?
i am amazed that the nla spokesman did not make this point .
john bird , billericay if tax relief is removed , i , like many others , will be forced to sell up christine wharton , cornwall would a solution for first-time buyers be to give them income tax relief on their first mortgage ?
like many , i went into buy-to-let because i did n't have a pension .
i remortgaged my own home to build up a small portfolio of properties that provide tenants with comfortable homes - though letting law heavily favours them over landlords .
but the latest interest rate rises mean rents barely cover mortgage repayments , let alone insurance and other costs .
if tax relief is removed , i , like many others , will be forced to sell up .
if a mass sell-off leads to a housing crash , i shall be back to square one : no pension !
christine wharton , cornwall it is not just first-time buyers who are being squeezed out by those looking for investments but also those who need to downsize or even move on the same level .
short-term tenants and second home owners do not contribute towards the community either economically or socially .
investment property owners always seem to have the necessary cash to outbid any owner-occupier buyer in the medium to low-priced property categories particularly in the nicer parts of this town .
julia , eastbourne what a load of rubbish is spoken about investors buying properties and taking them from first-time buyers .
the comments i hear most often are first-time buyers ca n't afford the deposits , therefore if investors can and they buy them - at least that is providing homes that those very people can live in - whereas if they had to save up a deposit , they would not be living in them .
rob cargill , london the issue of tax relief is an absolute outrage joy waters , norwich i have children in their 20s whose lives are effectively on hold because of the ludicrous situation in the housing market .
they earn too much for social housing , but not enough to buy a house .
most so-called affordable housing is snapped up by investors and i think the issue of tax relief is an absolute outrage .
what no one ever seems to answer either is the question of security of tenure .
what will happen when all the 20 somethings are having children in a few years time .
my children have both been forced to move simply because the rent has been increased or the property sold .
where is the stability in six month tenancies for families ?
joy waters , norwich offsetting interest against rent is not a " tax break " .
any business making income from owning an asset pays tax on the net income after the costs of running and owning those assets , which includes interest payments incurred as a result of borrowing money to purchase those assets in the first place .
btl is no different .
unlike homeowners , btl landlords will pay capital gains tax on any gain in value when they dispose of the property .
everyone running a business is treated the same -lrb- and fairly so -rrb- , and it is homeowners that get the tax break .
chris baverstock , fareham buy-to-let landlords getting tax breaks is a total disgrace .
it is absolutely clear that first-time buyers are taking out ruinous loans .
the buy-to-let lobby and the mortgage providers have sewn up the uk housing market - it is scandalous .
the so-called " housing market " has become the world 's biggest ever pyramid-selling scam .
it is ruining many , many people 's lives .
houses are already only affordable by average people having to take out loans well over 10 times income .
paul shooter , salisbury affordable housing is quite rightly discussed on numerous occasions on radio and tv - but no one says how much in cash terms they mean by affordable .
anyone willing to come forward with an answer ?
pat bourchier , yateley , hampshire those buy-to-letters of the borrow-to-let variety are clearly doomed duncan , milton keynes buy-to-let investors have out-priced many first-time buyers in all areas of the country .
their business model is built on rising prices , low interest rates , loose lending policies and also a preferential tax system .
with many of these in the process of change those buy-to-letters of the borrow-to-let variety are clearly doomed .
yet banks are still signing off loans and some media outlets are shamefully hyping the market .
i think more responsibility should be shown and loans and information relating to buy-to-let should come with a warning as people are unwittingly risking their retirements , and you only get one of them !
duncan , milton keynes we do n't need any more new houses to be built especially on greenfield sites .
what most people do n't realise is that for every person who wants a home there are five empty houses built before 1960 .
quentin williams , bristol buy-to-let owners who leave properties empty are not receiving any rent .
interest tax relief is only allowable against earnings from the rental income .
therefore , mortgages on empty properties do not attract tax relief .
malcolm johnson , stoke-on-trent the buy-to-let landlord 's mantra seems to be : " gordon stole our pensions , so we have to invest in property . "
so one generation gets their pensions stolen , and now the next generation has had affordable housing stolen from them .
what a triumph for our society .
matt o 'donnell , london the comments we publish are not necessarily the views of the bbc but will reflect the balance of views we have received .
it is helpful if contributors state if they work for any organisation relevant to an issue discussed .
readers should form their own views on whether messages published represent undeclared interests , or views prompted by a common source .
