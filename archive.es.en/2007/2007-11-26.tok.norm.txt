program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 26.11.2007 german official : human rights get too little attention großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nooke was part of an opposition group in the gdr günter nooke , germany 's human rights commissioner , is calling for an expanded effort to fight human rights abuses .
this type of violence is an assault on human dignity , nooke said in an interview with deutsche welle . günter nooke has been the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid since march 2006 .
he is a member of chancellor angel merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and a member of deutsche welle 's broadcasting board . deutsche welle : the human rights situation is very unstable in many parts of the world .
when did you last get the feeling that your agency was able to achieve something ? günter nooke : human rights violations do not get much attention in germany and the western world .
when one travels somewhere and gives the human rights activists there the feeling that they are being heard , that they will be greeted in a german residence with the necessary protection , that they know that they are not alone in their fight - that is something .
whether they are fighting against poverty or promoting democracy , a little verbal acknowledgement can help support some smaller projects on the ground .
that is something i think works well . i also think that the german human rights commissioner should be part of a foreign policy debate here in germany about our strategic interests .
human rights are a far-sighted , practical policy ideal that is very much in the interest of germany and europe .
therefore , i think it would be helpful if we were to learn a little bit more about where we send our money and not just complain about it .
and we should say that it is perhaps in our best long-term interests to send more money because as freedom and democracy spread , our economic interests will be preserved . you just returned home from africa .
did you see anything concrete where you said to yourself , " i really made an impact here ? " i visited a military prison in guinea with a woman from an ngo .
no one knows many of the prisoners there and some just die without ever going to trial .
an officer came out and said that if the woman were to come back next week then she could meet with the boss to discuss her concerns .
perhaps then they can talk about how they can improve the prisoners ' living conditions , medical care or even to help them build a garden .
this is just one example of how a simple visit from a diplomat can cause some movement in a seemingly closed dictatorial system like in guinea . what can be done to improve the human rights situation in congo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence against woman has been prevalent in congo congo is a very sad situation , especially the situation in the east of the country near the rwandan border .
i really think that it was very important that we passed a resolution -lsb- at the united nations -rsb- in new york that the mass raping of women can not be a part of a military , strategic , systematic means of torture . eastern congo is probably the worst example in the world right now where such things are being perpetrated by different political groups .
security personnel , the army and even the police are taking part as well as hutu and tutsi militia and other rebel groups in the jungle .
i do not think that we can even conceive of what is happening in these areas . in february , i met a woman in eastern congo who told me that women are given their own children to eat and that such cannibalism is used not just to violate or to humiliate the women but to devastate them .
these actions absolutely destroy our very understanding of human dignity , of human rights .
it has got so bad that we can not just sit back and watch .
the united nations must use its mandate to do what it can because we simply can not continue to bear what is happening on the ground .
failure to do so would discredit our foreign policy and other international bodies . why do countries that suppress press freedoms , like ethiopia , receive development aid from germany ? we just had a hearing in the bundestag -lsb- germany 's lower house of parliament -rsb- about how much development aid will be tied to human rights .
as the federal human rights commissioner , i will say that each country should be discussed separately and that human right should be a condition to development aid .
but of course it is not easy to attach sanctions when they may only hurt the people and not the government .
therefore there is only one consideration as to how we can better distribute our aid , which is to make sure that our money is truly reaching the people on the ground . perhaps that means a larger number of smaller projects as opposed to bigger projects that are implemented by the central or provincial government .
unfortunately , we recognize that most african countries are not getting less corrupt .
i think that projects with a timetable of three to four years are too short .
in terms of africa , we need to plan our projects in decades and clarify the accountability so that we can credibly determine if the money we are giving out is not going to the wrong hands . let us turn to burma .
this country has moved back into focus because of the recent demonstrations .
now that things have calmed down , are people already forgetting about this country again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world should not forget burma , says nooke i hope that the focus has not shifted away from burma , but that the pressure on the military junta continues .
we here in the western world have our function , but the regional powers such as china and india are even more important in continuing to apply the pressure . burma should not be forgotten but be seen as an example that human rights are not tied to a certain religion or culture but that these ideals are universal and indivisible . people around the world can easily determine if human rights conditions are in the right or in the wrong .
for some to decide that they can simply sidestep one 's right to live and to survive in my judgment is wrong .
that is what happened in burma , and that is why it is such an important place where change needs to take place . how do you view the upcoming elections in russia ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has been supressing freedom of speech in russia russia is an example of how societies can also move backwards when it comes to human rights and the situation has gotten noticeably worse in the past years .
the kremlin has cracked down on the media in order to control the flow of information and discredit the citizens who are pushing for greater freedoms and political rights . the chess player garry kasparov is very famous in russia .
the western world knows him now as a politician , but he has rarely been seen as such in the russian media .
whoever putin , gazprom and the other big interests in russia put forth as their candidate will become president in the coming months .
but first we have to see how the parliamentary elections unfold . an important topic for deutsche welle , especially in central and southeastern europe , is the way countries deal with their communist past and the legacy of the secret police .
the east german stasi -lsb- secret police -rsb- archive is often offered as a model .
how important is the archive in your opinion and what do you see for its future ? i see our way of dealing with the gdr 's secret police archive as a model for the simple reason that is was not destroyed and is more or less now open to the public .
this archive tells the day-to-day story of a society that existed for 40 years .
it not just an archive of the atrocities of the gdr , it is not just an archive of denunciations or a place where we can find out if someone worked with the stasi , it is the daily journal of a culture .
i hope that more access to these files will be allowed and that this will happen independently from any political motives . interview : miodrag soric -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russian president vladimir putin has accused the us of urging international observers not to monitor parliamentary elections to be held on sunday , dec .
2 .
but election monitors say russia 's visa office is to blame . " we have information that , once again , this was done on the recommendation of the us state department , " putin said on monday at a meeting with activists of his united russia party , referring to a pull-out decision earlier this month by an election monitoring group . the office for democratic institutions and human rights -lrb- odihr -rrb- , a warsaw-based branch of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- that had been planning to send observers to russia in the month prior to the elections , refuted putin 's claim . the cancellation had to do with problems obtaining visas , osce director christian strohal said in an interview with reuters news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police response to demonstrations did n't help putin 's reputation in the west " it 's unfortunate that we did n't have any other choice , " strohal said .
" this sort of thing has never happened to us before . " putin also said the pull-out would put a damper on russian-us relations and that any criticism from washington regarding sunday 's vote would further strain ties . " we will take this into account in our inter-state relations , " said putin , suggesting a cool-down in us-russian dealings . eu leader condemns police crackdown a police crackdown on opposition demonstrators over the weekend fuelled criticism that the parliamentary elections are being staged to ensure a hefty majority for united russia . opinion polls suggest that united russia , with putin at the helm , is expected to take the election with a 60 percent majority or more . european commission president jose manuel barroso expressed concern on monday about the severity of the suppression of the weekend demonstration , where truncheon-armed police officers arrested an estimated 200 people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin-supporters rallied in moscow on monday " the right to peaceful free speech and assembly are basic fundamental human rights and i very much regret that the authorities found it necessary to take such heavy-handed action , " said barroso in a statement . putin 's second term ends soon russia 's constitution stipulates a maximum of two terms for heads of state , which means putin is required to leave office next year . some observers have speculated , however , that putin may step down now and run again in the presidential elections planned for march 2 , 2008 , in order to get around the two-term limit , reported reuters .
in any case , the president has indicated that he would maintain political influence after stepping down . putin 's wide popularity at home stems largely from his image as a bearer of stability following the tumultuous post-soviet era under his predecessor , boris yeltsin . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the boost breathes new life into the venture . germany was the only eu member state on friday , nov .
23 , to vote against the bloc 's proposal to contribute an additional 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.56 billion -rrb- to the galileo project , which is intended to serve as a civilian alternative to the united states ' gps navigation system . the eu had originally pledged 1 billion euros , with the rest to come from private industry .
when the private consortium involved in the satnav project pulled out of the deal last spring , galileo 's future became uncertain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu said using unused agriculture funds would be a one-time move though 1.6 billion euros are intended to come out of the eu 's unused agriculture budget , as suggested by the bloc 's budget commissioner dalia grybauskaite , germany had feared that , as the eu 's biggest financier , it would have to carry up to 500 million euros of the commitment . " the result -lsb- of the vote -rsb- is relatively bad , " said a spokesman from the ministry of finance in berlin on sunday .

26 , for a last-ditch effort to find a compromise regarding the future status of the breakaway serbian province of kosovo . the closed-door negotiations in the quiet spa town baden near vienna , hosted by the kosovo troika - russia , the united states and the european union - are a final attempt to clinch a deal ahead of a dec .

the chances of reaching any sort of compromise in the three-day talks remain extremely unlikely .
comparisons with other balkans peace conferences , like dayton , ohio in 1995 or rambouillet , france in 1999 , are hinting at a readiness for compromise that is completely absent from both parties ' positions .
the troika-mediated talks were launched in august when the un security council failed to endorse a model for internationally monitored independence proposed by un special envoy martti athisaari after russian veto threats .
after several inconclusive rounds of talks serbia and kosovo 's ethnic albanians are nowhere near a compromise , despite the troika promise to vigorously pursue a deal .

backed by moscow , serbia suggested solutions similar to autonomy constructs for hong kong or the aland islands in finland .
russia and serbia also called for extending the un deadline , insisting that talks should continue until a compromise is found .
serbia 's prime minister vojislav kostunica , who is expected to lead the belgrade delegation together with president boris tadic , has become increasingly belligerent , accusing the west of planning to set up a " nato state " in the balkans after amputating kosovo from serbia .
kosovo had been the scene of a brutal , indiscriminate crackdown by serbian forces in response to a separatist insurgency in 1998-99 .
nato intervention ended the campaign , widely described in the west as ethnic cleansing , leaving kosovo under un administration .
belgrade , which insists its territorial rights in kosovo are inviolable , has dismissed plans for contractual ties between the two entities .

23 , to vote against the bloc 's proposal to contribute an additional 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.56 billion -rrb- to the galileo project , which is intended to serve as a civilian alternative to the united states ' gps navigation system . the eu had originally pledged 1 billion euros , with the rest to come from private industry .
when the private consortium involved in the satnav project pulled out of the deal last spring , galileo 's future became uncertain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu said using unused agriculture funds would be a one-time move though 1.6 billion euros are intended to come out of the eu 's unused agriculture budget , as suggested by the bloc 's budget commissioner dalia grybauskaite , germany had feared that , as the eu 's biggest financier , it would have to carry up to 500 million euros of the commitment . " the result -lsb- of the vote -rsb- is relatively bad , " said a spokesman from the ministry of finance in berlin on sunday .
" but the nature of majorities is that you have to accept them . " contracts to be granted in variety of sectors germany had advocated that the funds come from cuts to other eu research projects and initially had the support of britain , the netherlands , spain and sweden .
when the eu agreed to draw 600 million euros from other scientific endeavors in the bloc , germany was the only country to maintain resistance to the financing plan .
spain abstained from voting . the total cost of the satellite project is estimated at 3.4 billion euros and is expected to create over 100,000 new jobs in europe . the eu plans to advertise for private bids in at least six different sectors , with no single company receiving a contract in more than two sectors , said european commission spokeswoman michele cercone .
the approach was meant to quell german fears that french companies would win control of the essential elements of the projects . greater accuracy than us counterpart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo should be able to warn drivers of traffic and accidents ahead billed as a way to avoid european dependence on the united states ' gps navigation system , galileo is to provide greater precision and reliability in located objects within one meter -lrb- 3.3 feet -rrb- . the 30 planned galileo satellites will be able to warn car drivers of traffic jams and accurately predict delays in the city bus system .
the system has also been billed as a way to help rescue workers trace missing persons and by law enforcement officers locate escaped prisoners . after a five-year delay due to budget uncertainties , galileo is now slated for completion in 2013 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this type of violence is an assault on human dignity , nooke said in an interview with deutsche welle . günter nooke has been the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid since march 2006 .
he is a member of chancellor angel merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and a member of deutsche welle 's broadcasting board . deutsche welle : the human rights situation is very unstable in many parts of the world .
when did you last get the feeling that your agency was able to achieve something ? günter nooke : human rights violations do not get much attention in germany and the western world .
when one travels somewhere and gives the human rights activists there the feeling that they are being heard , that they will be greeted in a german residence with the necessary protection , that they know that they are not alone in their fight - that is something .
whether they are fighting against poverty or promoting democracy , a little verbal acknowledgement can help support some smaller projects on the ground .
that is something i think works well . i also think that the german human rights commissioner should be part of a foreign policy debate here in germany about our strategic interests .
human rights are a far-sighted , practical policy ideal that is very much in the interest of germany and europe .
therefore , i think it would be helpful if we were to learn a little bit more about where we send our money and not just complain about it .
and we should say that it is perhaps in our best long-term interests to send more money because as freedom and democracy spread , our economic interests will be preserved . you just returned home from africa .
did you see anything concrete where you said to yourself , " i really made an impact here ? " i visited a military prison in guinea with a woman from an ngo .
no one knows many of the prisoners there and some just die without ever going to trial .
an officer came out and said that if the woman were to come back next week then she could meet with the boss to discuss her concerns .
perhaps then they can talk about how they can improve the prisoners ' living conditions , medical care or even to help them build a garden .
this is just one example of how a simple visit from a diplomat can cause some movement in a seemingly closed dictatorial system like in guinea . what can be done to improve the human rights situation in congo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence against woman has been prevalent in congo congo is a very sad situation , especially the situation in the east of the country near the rwandan border .
i really think that it was very important that we passed a resolution -lsb- at the united nations -rsb- in new york that the mass raping of women can not be a part of a military , strategic , systematic means of torture . eastern congo is probably the worst example in the world right now where such things are being perpetrated by different political groups .
security personnel , the army and even the police are taking part as well as hutu and tutsi militia and other rebel groups in the jungle .
i do not think that we can even conceive of what is happening in these areas . in february , i met a woman in eastern congo who told me that women are given their own children to eat and that such cannibalism is used not just to violate or to humiliate the women but to devastate them .
these actions absolutely destroy our very understanding of human dignity , of human rights .
it has got so bad that we can not just sit back and watch .
the united nations must use its mandate to do what it can because we simply can not continue to bear what is happening on the ground .
failure to do so would discredit our foreign policy and other international bodies . why do countries that suppress press freedoms , like ethiopia , receive development aid from germany ? we just had a hearing in the bundestag -lsb- germany 's lower house of parliament -rsb- about how much development aid will be tied to human rights .
as the federal human rights commissioner , i will say that each country should be discussed separately and that human right should be a condition to development aid .
but of course it is not easy to attach sanctions when they may only hurt the people and not the government .
therefore there is only one consideration as to how we can better distribute our aid , which is to make sure that our money is truly reaching the people on the ground . perhaps that means a larger number of smaller projects as opposed to bigger projects that are implemented by the central or provincial government .
unfortunately , we recognize that most african countries are not getting less corrupt .
i think that projects with a timetable of three to four years are too short .
in terms of africa , we need to plan our projects in decades and clarify the accountability so that we can credibly determine if the money we are giving out is not going to the wrong hands . let us turn to burma .
this country has moved back into focus because of the recent demonstrations .
now that things have calmed down , are people already forgetting about this country again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world should not forget burma , says nooke i hope that the focus has not shifted away from burma , but that the pressure on the military junta continues .
we here in the western world have our function , but the regional powers such as china and india are even more important in continuing to apply the pressure . burma should not be forgotten but be seen as an example that human rights are not tied to a certain religion or culture but that these ideals are universal and indivisible . people around the world can easily determine if human rights conditions are in the right or in the wrong .
for some to decide that they can simply sidestep one 's right to live and to survive in my judgment is wrong .
that is what happened in burma , and that is why it is such an important place where change needs to take place . how do you view the upcoming elections in russia ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has been supressing freedom of speech in russia russia is an example of how societies can also move backwards when it comes to human rights and the situation has gotten noticeably worse in the past years .
the kremlin has cracked down on the media in order to control the flow of information and discredit the citizens who are pushing for greater freedoms and political rights . the chess player garry kasparov is very famous in russia .
the western world knows him now as a politician , but he has rarely been seen as such in the russian media .
whoever putin , gazprom and the other big interests in russia put forth as their candidate will become president in the coming months .
but first we have to see how the parliamentary elections unfold . an important topic for deutsche welle , especially in central and southeastern europe , is the way countries deal with their communist past and the legacy of the secret police .
the east german stasi -lsb- secret police -rsb- archive is often offered as a model .
how important is the archive in your opinion and what do you see for its future ? i see our way of dealing with the gdr 's secret police archive as a model for the simple reason that is was not destroyed and is more or less now open to the public .
this archive tells the day-to-day story of a society that existed for 40 years .
it not just an archive of the atrocities of the gdr , it is not just an archive of denunciations or a place where we can find out if someone worked with the stasi , it is the daily journal of a culture .
i hope that more access to these files will be allowed and that this will happen independently from any political motives . interview : miodrag soric -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i really think that it was very important that we passed a resolution -lsb- at the united nations -rsb- in new york that the mass raping of women can not be a part of a military , strategic , systematic means of torture . eastern congo is probably the worst example in the world right now where such things are being perpetrated by different political groups .
security personnel , the army and even the police are taking part as well as hutu and tutsi militia and other rebel groups in the jungle .
i do not think that we can even conceive of what is happening in these areas . in february , i met a woman in eastern congo who told me that women are given their own children to eat and that such cannibalism is used not just to violate or to humiliate the women but to devastate them .
these actions absolutely destroy our very understanding of human dignity , of human rights .
it has got so bad that we can not just sit back and watch .
the united nations must use its mandate to do what it can because we simply can not continue to bear what is happening on the ground .
failure to do so would discredit our foreign policy and other international bodies . why do countries that suppress press freedoms , like ethiopia , receive development aid from germany ? we just had a hearing in the bundestag -lsb- germany 's lower house of parliament -rsb- about how much development aid will be tied to human rights .
as the federal human rights commissioner , i will say that each country should be discussed separately and that human right should be a condition to development aid .
but of course it is not easy to attach sanctions when they may only hurt the people and not the government .
therefore there is only one consideration as to how we can better distribute our aid , which is to make sure that our money is truly reaching the people on the ground . perhaps that means a larger number of smaller projects as opposed to bigger projects that are implemented by the central or provincial government .
unfortunately , we recognize that most african countries are not getting less corrupt .
i think that projects with a timetable of three to four years are too short .
in terms of africa , we need to plan our projects in decades and clarify the accountability so that we can credibly determine if the money we are giving out is not going to the wrong hands . let us turn to burma .
this country has moved back into focus because of the recent demonstrations .
now that things have calmed down , are people already forgetting about this country again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world should not forget burma , says nooke i hope that the focus has not shifted away from burma , but that the pressure on the military junta continues .
we here in the western world have our function , but the regional powers such as china and india are even more important in continuing to apply the pressure . burma should not be forgotten but be seen as an example that human rights are not tied to a certain religion or culture but that these ideals are universal and indivisible . people around the world can easily determine if human rights conditions are in the right or in the wrong .
for some to decide that they can simply sidestep one 's right to live and to survive in my judgment is wrong .
that is what happened in burma , and that is why it is such an important place where change needs to take place . how do you view the upcoming elections in russia ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has been supressing freedom of speech in russia russia is an example of how societies can also move backwards when it comes to human rights and the situation has gotten noticeably worse in the past years .
the kremlin has cracked down on the media in order to control the flow of information and discredit the citizens who are pushing for greater freedoms and political rights . the chess player garry kasparov is very famous in russia .
the western world knows him now as a politician , but he has rarely been seen as such in the russian media .
whoever putin , gazprom and the other big interests in russia put forth as their candidate will become president in the coming months .
but first we have to see how the parliamentary elections unfold . an important topic for deutsche welle , especially in central and southeastern europe , is the way countries deal with their communist past and the legacy of the secret police .
the east german stasi -lsb- secret police -rsb- archive is often offered as a model .
how important is the archive in your opinion and what do you see for its future ? i see our way of dealing with the gdr 's secret police archive as a model for the simple reason that is was not destroyed and is more or less now open to the public .
this archive tells the day-to-day story of a society that existed for 40 years .
it not just an archive of the atrocities of the gdr , it is not just an archive of denunciations or a place where we can find out if someone worked with the stasi , it is the daily journal of a culture .
i hope that more access to these files will be allowed and that this will happen independently from any political motives . interview : miodrag soric -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 26.11.2007 german official : human rights get too little attention großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nooke was part of an opposition group in the gdr günter nooke , germany 's human rights commissioner , is calling for an expanded effort to fight human rights abuses .
this type of violence is an assault on human dignity , nooke said in an interview with deutsche welle . günter nooke has been the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid since march 2006 .
he is a member of chancellor angel merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and a member of deutsche welle 's broadcasting board . deutsche welle : the human rights situation is very unstable in many parts of the world .
when did you last get the feeling that your agency was able to achieve something ? günter nooke : human rights violations do not get much attention in germany and the western world .
when one travels somewhere and gives the human rights activists there the feeling that they are being heard , that they will be greeted in a german residence with the necessary protection , that they know that they are not alone in their fight - that is something .
whether they are fighting against poverty or promoting democracy , a little verbal acknowledgement can help support some smaller projects on the ground .
that is something i think works well . i also think that the german human rights commissioner should be part of a foreign policy debate here in germany about our strategic interests .
human rights are a far-sighted , practical policy ideal that is very much in the interest of germany and europe .
therefore , i think it would be helpful if we were to learn a little bit more about where we send our money and not just complain about it .
and we should say that it is perhaps in our best long-term interests to send more money because as freedom and democracy spread , our economic interests will be preserved . you just returned home from africa .
did you see anything concrete where you said to yourself , " i really made an impact here ? " i visited a military prison in guinea with a woman from an ngo .
no one knows many of the prisoners there and some just die without ever going to trial .
an officer came out and said that if the woman were to come back next week then she could meet with the boss to discuss her concerns .
perhaps then they can talk about how they can improve the prisoners ' living conditions , medical care or even to help them build a garden .
this is just one example of how a simple visit from a diplomat can cause some movement in a seemingly closed dictatorial system like in guinea . what can be done to improve the human rights situation in congo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence against woman has been prevalent in congo congo is a very sad situation , especially the situation in the east of the country near the rwandan border .
i really think that it was very important that we passed a resolution -lsb- at the united nations -rsb- in new york that the mass raping of women can not be a part of a military , strategic , systematic means of torture . eastern congo is probably the worst example in the world right now where such things are being perpetrated by different political groups .
security personnel , the army and even the police are taking part as well as hutu and tutsi militia and other rebel groups in the jungle .
i do not think that we can even conceive of what is happening in these areas . in february , i met a woman in eastern congo who told me that women are given their own children to eat and that such cannibalism is used not just to violate or to humiliate the women but to devastate them .
these actions absolutely destroy our very understanding of human dignity , of human rights .
it has got so bad that we can not just sit back and watch .
the united nations must use its mandate to do what it can because we simply can not continue to bear what is happening on the ground .
failure to do so would discredit our foreign policy and other international bodies . why do countries that suppress press freedoms , like ethiopia , receive development aid from germany ? we just had a hearing in the bundestag -lsb- germany 's lower house of parliament -rsb- about how much development aid will be tied to human rights .
as the federal human rights commissioner , i will say that each country should be discussed separately and that human right should be a condition to development aid .
but of course it is not easy to attach sanctions when they may only hurt the people and not the government .
therefore there is only one consideration as to how we can better distribute our aid , which is to make sure that our money is truly reaching the people on the ground . perhaps that means a larger number of smaller projects as opposed to bigger projects that are implemented by the central or provincial government .
unfortunately , we recognize that most african countries are not getting less corrupt .
i think that projects with a timetable of three to four years are too short .
in terms of africa , we need to plan our projects in decades and clarify the accountability so that we can credibly determine if the money we are giving out is not going to the wrong hands . let us turn to burma .
this country has moved back into focus because of the recent demonstrations .
now that things have calmed down , are people already forgetting about this country again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world should not forget burma , says nooke i hope that the focus has not shifted away from burma , but that the pressure on the military junta continues .
we here in the western world have our function , but the regional powers such as china and india are even more important in continuing to apply the pressure . burma should not be forgotten but be seen as an example that human rights are not tied to a certain religion or culture but that these ideals are universal and indivisible . people around the world can easily determine if human rights conditions are in the right or in the wrong .
for some to decide that they can simply sidestep one 's right to live and to survive in my judgment is wrong .
that is what happened in burma , and that is why it is such an important place where change needs to take place . how do you view the upcoming elections in russia ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has been supressing freedom of speech in russia russia is an example of how societies can also move backwards when it comes to human rights and the situation has gotten noticeably worse in the past years .
the kremlin has cracked down on the media in order to control the flow of information and discredit the citizens who are pushing for greater freedoms and political rights . the chess player garry kasparov is very famous in russia .
the western world knows him now as a politician , but he has rarely been seen as such in the russian media .
whoever putin , gazprom and the other big interests in russia put forth as their candidate will become president in the coming months .
but first we have to see how the parliamentary elections unfold . an important topic for deutsche welle , especially in central and southeastern europe , is the way countries deal with their communist past and the legacy of the secret police .
the east german stasi -lsb- secret police -rsb- archive is often offered as a model .
how important is the archive in your opinion and what do you see for its future ? i see our way of dealing with the gdr 's secret police archive as a model for the simple reason that is was not destroyed and is more or less now open to the public .
this archive tells the day-to-day story of a society that existed for 40 years .
it not just an archive of the atrocities of the gdr , it is not just an archive of denunciations or a place where we can find out if someone worked with the stasi , it is the daily journal of a culture .
i hope that more access to these files will be allowed and that this will happen independently from any political motives . interview : miodrag soric -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but few politicians expect a breakthrough . israeli prime minister ehud olmert had stressed his great interest in the success of tuesday 's conference in the us state of maryland , merkel 's spokesman said after the chancellor and prime minister 's telephone conversation on saturday , nov .
24 . merkel had brought up an action plan put forward by the european union , and olmert had welcomed the eu contribution , the spokesman said . earlier , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he saw the participation of a number of arab countries in the annapolis summit as " an important signal for peace . " syria , saudi arabia to attend meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said israelis and palestinians needed international support " israelis and palestinians face large challenges in the months ahead and need the support of the international community to surmount them , " the german foreign minister said . arab nations were showing their commitment to making a contribution to peace and stability in the region , said steinmeier , who is attending the talks under germany 's presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- . saudi arabia and syria , which do not officially recognize israel , both announced they would also be attending the annapolis summit , which begins on tuesday .
the countries were absent from a failed 2000 summit hosted by then us president bill clinton . historic reason for pessimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several peace accords , including the 1993 oslo agreement , have collapsed norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr store said monday he had no expectations of a peace agreement at the upcoming conference . " there are historical reasons to be pessimistic , " store was quoted as telling norwegian news agency ntb . major differences remain between the israelis and palestinians over core issues , such as the status of jerusalem , which both sides claim as their capital , the borders of a future palestinian state and the fate of palestinian refugees . hamas refuses concessions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush , who has 14 months left in office , has spent little time on the mideast conflict hamas leaders in the gaza strip have already announced they would not accept any concessions made by palestinians during the summit . " the negotiations nowadays are useless and holding the annapolis conference is a waste of time , " hamas leader ismail haniya told reporters on monday .
" our people will not commit themselves to any resolutions harming palestinian national principles . " haniya served as prime minister in a palestinian unity government until he was dismissed by president mahmoud abbas in june , following hamas ' violent takeover of the gaza strip .
hamas was not invited to take part in the peace talks . even after us president george w. bush said he was " personally committed " to ending the decades-long conflict with a two-state solution in the middle east , white house spokeswoman dana perino cautioned against expecting any " immediate results " from the conference . us national security advisor steve hadley also stressed that the conference was not itself a " negotiating forum , " but an " opportunity to move into a negotiating phase between palestinians and israelis .

this type of violence is an assault on human dignity , nooke said in an interview with deutsche welle . günter nooke has been the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid since march 2006 .
he is a member of chancellor angel merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and a member of deutsche welle 's broadcasting board . deutsche welle : the human rights situation is very unstable in many parts of the world .
when did you last get the feeling that your agency was able to achieve something ? günter nooke : human rights violations do not get much attention in germany and the western world .
when one travels somewhere and gives the human rights activists there the feeling that they are being heard , that they will be greeted in a german residence with the necessary protection , that they know that they are not alone in their fight - that is something .
whether they are fighting against poverty or promoting democracy , a little verbal acknowledgement can help support some smaller projects on the ground .
that is something i think works well . i also think that the german human rights commissioner should be part of a foreign policy debate here in germany about our strategic interests .
human rights are a far-sighted , practical policy ideal that is very much in the interest of germany and europe .
therefore , i think it would be helpful if we were to learn a little bit more about where we send our money and not just complain about it .
and we should say that it is perhaps in our best long-term interests to send more money because as freedom and democracy spread , our economic interests will be preserved . you just returned home from africa .
did you see anything concrete where you said to yourself , " i really made an impact here ? " i visited a military prison in guinea with a woman from an ngo .
no one knows many of the prisoners there and some just die without ever going to trial .
an officer came out and said that if the woman were to come back next week then she could meet with the boss to discuss her concerns .
perhaps then they can talk about how they can improve the prisoners ' living conditions , medical care or even to help them build a garden .
this is just one example of how a simple visit from a diplomat can cause some movement in a seemingly closed dictatorial system like in guinea . what can be done to improve the human rights situation in congo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence against woman has been prevalent in congo congo is a very sad situation , especially the situation in the east of the country near the rwandan border .
i really think that it was very important that we passed a resolution -lsb- at the united nations -rsb- in new york that the mass raping of women can not be a part of a military , strategic , systematic means of torture . eastern congo is probably the worst example in the world right now where such things are being perpetrated by different political groups .
security personnel , the army and even the police are taking part as well as hutu and tutsi militia and other rebel groups in the jungle .
i do not think that we can even conceive of what is happening in these areas . in february , i met a woman in eastern congo who told me that women are given their own children to eat and that such cannibalism is used not just to violate or to humiliate the women but to devastate them .
these actions absolutely destroy our very understanding of human dignity , of human rights .
it has got so bad that we can not just sit back and watch .
the united nations must use its mandate to do what it can because we simply can not continue to bear what is happening on the ground .
failure to do so would discredit our foreign policy and other international bodies . why do countries that suppress press freedoms , like ethiopia , receive development aid from germany ? we just had a hearing in the bundestag -lsb- germany 's lower house of parliament -rsb- about how much development aid will be tied to human rights .
as the federal human rights commissioner , i will say that each country should be discussed separately and that human right should be a condition to development aid .
but of course it is not easy to attach sanctions when they may only hurt the people and not the government .
therefore there is only one consideration as to how we can better distribute our aid , which is to make sure that our money is truly reaching the people on the ground . perhaps that means a larger number of smaller projects as opposed to bigger projects that are implemented by the central or provincial government .
unfortunately , we recognize that most african countries are not getting less corrupt .
i think that projects with a timetable of three to four years are too short .
in terms of africa , we need to plan our projects in decades and clarify the accountability so that we can credibly determine if the money we are giving out is not going to the wrong hands . let us turn to burma .
this country has moved back into focus because of the recent demonstrations .
now that things have calmed down , are people already forgetting about this country again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world should not forget burma , says nooke i hope that the focus has not shifted away from burma , but that the pressure on the military junta continues .
we here in the western world have our function , but the regional powers such as china and india are even more important in continuing to apply the pressure . burma should not be forgotten but be seen as an example that human rights are not tied to a certain religion or culture but that these ideals are universal and indivisible . people around the world can easily determine if human rights conditions are in the right or in the wrong .
for some to decide that they can simply sidestep one 's right to live and to survive in my judgment is wrong .
that is what happened in burma , and that is why it is such an important place where change needs to take place . how do you view the upcoming elections in russia ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has been supressing freedom of speech in russia russia is an example of how societies can also move backwards when it comes to human rights and the situation has gotten noticeably worse in the past years .
the kremlin has cracked down on the media in order to control the flow of information and discredit the citizens who are pushing for greater freedoms and political rights . the chess player garry kasparov is very famous in russia .
the western world knows him now as a politician , but he has rarely been seen as such in the russian media .
whoever putin , gazprom and the other big interests in russia put forth as their candidate will become president in the coming months .
but first we have to see how the parliamentary elections unfold . an important topic for deutsche welle , especially in central and southeastern europe , is the way countries deal with their communist past and the legacy of the secret police .
the east german stasi -lsb- secret police -rsb- archive is often offered as a model .
how important is the archive in your opinion and what do you see for its future ? i see our way of dealing with the gdr 's secret police archive as a model for the simple reason that is was not destroyed and is more or less now open to the public .

this type of violence is an assault on human dignity , nooke said in an interview with deutsche welle . günter nooke has been the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid since march 2006 .
he is a member of chancellor angel merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and a member of deutsche welle 's broadcasting board . deutsche welle : the human rights situation is very unstable in many parts of the world .
when did you last get the feeling that your agency was able to achieve something ? günter nooke : human rights violations do not get much attention in germany and the western world .
when one travels somewhere and gives the human rights activists there the feeling that they are being heard , that they will be greeted in a german residence with the necessary protection , that they know that they are not alone in their fight - that is something .
whether they are fighting against poverty or promoting democracy , a little verbal acknowledgement can help support some smaller projects on the ground .
that is something i think works well . i also think that the german human rights commissioner should be part of a foreign policy debate here in germany about our strategic interests .
human rights are a far-sighted , practical policy ideal that is very much in the interest of germany and europe .
therefore , i think it would be helpful if we were to learn a little bit more about where we send our money and not just complain about it .
and we should say that it is perhaps in our best long-term interests to send more money because as freedom and democracy spread , our economic interests will be preserved . you just returned home from africa .
did you see anything concrete where you said to yourself , " i really made an impact here ? " i visited a military prison in guinea with a woman from an ngo .
no one knows many of the prisoners there and some just die without ever going to trial .
an officer came out and said that if the woman were to come back next week then she could meet with the boss to discuss her concerns .
perhaps then they can talk about how they can improve the prisoners ' living conditions , medical care or even to help them build a garden .
this is just one example of how a simple visit from a diplomat can cause some movement in a seemingly closed dictatorial system like in guinea . what can be done to improve the human rights situation in congo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence against woman has been prevalent in congo congo is a very sad situation , especially the situation in the east of the country near the rwandan border .
i really think that it was very important that we passed a resolution -lsb- at the united nations -rsb- in new york that the mass raping of women can not be a part of a military , strategic , systematic means of torture . eastern congo is probably the worst example in the world right now where such things are being perpetrated by different political groups .
security personnel , the army and even the police are taking part as well as hutu and tutsi militia and other rebel groups in the jungle .
i do not think that we can even conceive of what is happening in these areas . in february , i met a woman in eastern congo who told me that women are given their own children to eat and that such cannibalism is used not just to violate or to humiliate the women but to devastate them .
these actions absolutely destroy our very understanding of human dignity , of human rights .
it has got so bad that we can not just sit back and watch .
the united nations must use its mandate to do what it can because we simply can not continue to bear what is happening on the ground .
failure to do so would discredit our foreign policy and other international bodies . why do countries that suppress press freedoms , like ethiopia , receive development aid from germany ? we just had a hearing in the bundestag -lsb- germany 's lower house of parliament -rsb- about how much development aid will be tied to human rights .
as the federal human rights commissioner , i will say that each country should be discussed separately and that human right should be a condition to development aid .
but of course it is not easy to attach sanctions when they may only hurt the people and not the government .
therefore there is only one consideration as to how we can better distribute our aid , which is to make sure that our money is truly reaching the people on the ground . perhaps that means a larger number of smaller projects as opposed to bigger projects that are implemented by the central or provincial government .
unfortunately , we recognize that most african countries are not getting less corrupt .
i think that projects with a timetable of three to four years are too short .
in terms of africa , we need to plan our projects in decades and clarify the accountability so that we can credibly determine if the money we are giving out is not going to the wrong hands . let us turn to burma .
this country has moved back into focus because of the recent demonstrations .
now that things have calmed down , are people already forgetting about this country again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world should not forget burma , says nooke i hope that the focus has not shifted away from burma , but that the pressure on the military junta continues .
we here in the western world have our function , but the regional powers such as china and india are even more important in continuing to apply the pressure . burma should not be forgotten but be seen as an example that human rights are not tied to a certain religion or culture but that these ideals are universal and indivisible . people around the world can easily determine if human rights conditions are in the right or in the wrong .
for some to decide that they can simply sidestep one 's right to live and to survive in my judgment is wrong .
that is what happened in burma , and that is why it is such an important place where change needs to take place . how do you view the upcoming elections in russia ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has been supressing freedom of speech in russia russia is an example of how societies can also move backwards when it comes to human rights and the situation has gotten noticeably worse in the past years .
the kremlin has cracked down on the media in order to control the flow of information and discredit the citizens who are pushing for greater freedoms and political rights . the chess player garry kasparov is very famous in russia .
the western world knows him now as a politician , but he has rarely been seen as such in the russian media .
whoever putin , gazprom and the other big interests in russia put forth as their candidate will become president in the coming months .
but first we have to see how the parliamentary elections unfold . an important topic for deutsche welle , especially in central and southeastern europe , is the way countries deal with their communist past and the legacy of the secret police .
the east german stasi -lsb- secret police -rsb- archive is often offered as a model .
how important is the archive in your opinion and what do you see for its future ? i see our way of dealing with the gdr 's secret police archive as a model for the simple reason that is was not destroyed and is more or less now open to the public .
this archive tells the day-to-day story of a society that existed for 40 years .
it not just an archive of the atrocities of the gdr , it is not just an archive of denunciations or a place where we can find out if someone worked with the stasi , it is the daily journal of a culture .
i hope that more access to these files will be allowed and that this will happen independently from any political motives . interview : miodrag soric -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but few politicians expect a breakthrough . israeli prime minister ehud olmert had stressed his great interest in the success of tuesday 's conference in the us state of maryland , merkel 's spokesman said after the chancellor and prime minister 's telephone conversation on saturday , nov .
24 . merkel had brought up an action plan put forward by the european union , and olmert had welcomed the eu contribution , the spokesman said . earlier , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he saw the participation of a number of arab countries in the annapolis summit as " an important signal for peace . " syria , saudi arabia to attend meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said israelis and palestinians needed international support " israelis and palestinians face large challenges in the months ahead and need the support of the international community to surmount them , " the german foreign minister said . arab nations were showing their commitment to making a contribution to peace and stability in the region , said steinmeier , who is attending the talks under germany 's presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- . saudi arabia and syria , which do not officially recognize israel , both announced they would also be attending the annapolis summit , which begins on tuesday .
the countries were absent from a failed 2000 summit hosted by then us president bill clinton . historic reason for pessimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several peace accords , including the 1993 oslo agreement , have collapsed norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr store said monday he had no expectations of a peace agreement at the upcoming conference . " there are historical reasons to be pessimistic , " store was quoted as telling norwegian news agency ntb . major differences remain between the israelis and palestinians over core issues , such as the status of jerusalem , which both sides claim as their capital , the borders of a future palestinian state and the fate of palestinian refugees . hamas refuses concessions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush , who has 14 months left in office , has spent little time on the mideast conflict hamas leaders in the gaza strip have already announced they would not accept any concessions made by palestinians during the summit . " the negotiations nowadays are useless and holding the annapolis conference is a waste of time , " hamas leader ismail haniya told reporters on monday .
" our people will not commit themselves to any resolutions harming palestinian national principles . " haniya served as prime minister in a palestinian unity government until he was dismissed by president mahmoud abbas in june , following hamas ' violent takeover of the gaza strip .
hamas was not invited to take part in the peace talks . even after us president george w. bush said he was " personally committed " to ending the decades-long conflict with a two-state solution in the middle east , white house spokeswoman dana perino cautioned against expecting any " immediate results " from the conference . us national security advisor steve hadley also stressed that the conference was not itself a " negotiating forum , " but an " opportunity to move into a negotiating phase between palestinians and israelis .

but few politicians expect a breakthrough . israeli prime minister ehud olmert had stressed his great interest in the success of tuesday 's conference in the us state of maryland , merkel 's spokesman said after the chancellor and prime minister 's telephone conversation on saturday , nov .
24 . merkel had brought up an action plan put forward by the european union , and olmert had welcomed the eu contribution , the spokesman said . earlier , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he saw the participation of a number of arab countries in the annapolis summit as " an important signal for peace . " syria , saudi arabia to attend meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said israelis and palestinians needed international support " israelis and palestinians face large challenges in the months ahead and need the support of the international community to surmount them , " the german foreign minister said . arab nations were showing their commitment to making a contribution to peace and stability in the region , said steinmeier , who is attending the talks under germany 's presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- . saudi arabia and syria , which do not officially recognize israel , both announced they would also be attending the annapolis summit , which begins on tuesday .
the countries were absent from a failed 2000 summit hosted by then us president bill clinton . historic reason for pessimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several peace accords , including the 1993 oslo agreement , have collapsed norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr store said monday he had no expectations of a peace agreement at the upcoming conference . " there are historical reasons to be pessimistic , " store was quoted as telling norwegian news agency ntb . major differences remain between the israelis and palestinians over core issues , such as the status of jerusalem , which both sides claim as their capital , the borders of a future palestinian state and the fate of palestinian refugees . hamas refuses concessions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush , who has 14 months left in office , has spent little time on the mideast conflict hamas leaders in the gaza strip have already announced they would not accept any concessions made by palestinians during the summit . " the negotiations nowadays are useless and holding the annapolis conference is a waste of time , " hamas leader ismail haniya told reporters on monday .
" our people will not commit themselves to any resolutions harming palestinian national principles . " haniya served as prime minister in a palestinian unity government until he was dismissed by president mahmoud abbas in june , following hamas ' violent takeover of the gaza strip .
hamas was not invited to take part in the peace talks . even after us president george w. bush said he was " personally committed " to ending the decades-long conflict with a two-state solution in the middle east , white house spokeswoman dana perino cautioned against expecting any " immediate results " from the conference . us national security advisor steve hadley also stressed that the conference was not itself a " negotiating forum , " but an " opportunity to move into a negotiating phase between palestinians and israelis .

this type of violence is an assault on human dignity , nooke said in an interview with deutsche welle . günter nooke has been the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid since march 2006 .
he is a member of chancellor angel merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and a member of deutsche welle 's broadcasting board . deutsche welle : the human rights situation is very unstable in many parts of the world .
when did you last get the feeling that your agency was able to achieve something ? günter nooke : human rights violations do not get much attention in germany and the western world .
when one travels somewhere and gives the human rights activists there the feeling that they are being heard , that they will be greeted in a german residence with the necessary protection , that they know that they are not alone in their fight - that is something .
whether they are fighting against poverty or promoting democracy , a little verbal acknowledgement can help support some smaller projects on the ground .
that is something i think works well . i also think that the german human rights commissioner should be part of a foreign policy debate here in germany about our strategic interests .
human rights are a far-sighted , practical policy ideal that is very much in the interest of germany and europe .
therefore , i think it would be helpful if we were to learn a little bit more about where we send our money and not just complain about it .
and we should say that it is perhaps in our best long-term interests to send more money because as freedom and democracy spread , our economic interests will be preserved . you just returned home from africa .
did you see anything concrete where you said to yourself , " i really made an impact here ? " i visited a military prison in guinea with a woman from an ngo .
no one knows many of the prisoners there and some just die without ever going to trial .
an officer came out and said that if the woman were to come back next week then she could meet with the boss to discuss her concerns .
perhaps then they can talk about how they can improve the prisoners ' living conditions , medical care or even to help them build a garden .
this is just one example of how a simple visit from a diplomat can cause some movement in a seemingly closed dictatorial system like in guinea . what can be done to improve the human rights situation in congo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence against woman has been prevalent in congo congo is a very sad situation , especially the situation in the east of the country near the rwandan border .
i really think that it was very important that we passed a resolution -lsb- at the united nations -rsb- in new york that the mass raping of women can not be a part of a military , strategic , systematic means of torture . eastern congo is probably the worst example in the world right now where such things are being perpetrated by different political groups .
security personnel , the army and even the police are taking part as well as hutu and tutsi militia and other rebel groups in the jungle .
i do not think that we can even conceive of what is happening in these areas . in february , i met a woman in eastern congo who told me that women are given their own children to eat and that such cannibalism is used not just to violate or to humiliate the women but to devastate them .
these actions absolutely destroy our very understanding of human dignity , of human rights .
it has got so bad that we can not just sit back and watch .
the united nations must use its mandate to do what it can because we simply can not continue to bear what is happening on the ground .
failure to do so would discredit our foreign policy and other international bodies . why do countries that suppress press freedoms , like ethiopia , receive development aid from germany ? we just had a hearing in the bundestag -lsb- germany 's lower house of parliament -rsb- about how much development aid will be tied to human rights .
as the federal human rights commissioner , i will say that each country should be discussed separately and that human right should be a condition to development aid .
but of course it is not easy to attach sanctions when they may only hurt the people and not the government .
therefore there is only one consideration as to how we can better distribute our aid , which is to make sure that our money is truly reaching the people on the ground . perhaps that means a larger number of smaller projects as opposed to bigger projects that are implemented by the central or provincial government .
unfortunately , we recognize that most african countries are not getting less corrupt .
i think that projects with a timetable of three to four years are too short .
in terms of africa , we need to plan our projects in decades and clarify the accountability so that we can credibly determine if the money we are giving out is not going to the wrong hands . let us turn to burma .
this country has moved back into focus because of the recent demonstrations .
now that things have calmed down , are people already forgetting about this country again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world should not forget burma , says nooke i hope that the focus has not shifted away from burma , but that the pressure on the military junta continues .
we here in the western world have our function , but the regional powers such as china and india are even more important in continuing to apply the pressure . burma should not be forgotten but be seen as an example that human rights are not tied to a certain religion or culture but that these ideals are universal and indivisible . people around the world can easily determine if human rights conditions are in the right or in the wrong .
for some to decide that they can simply sidestep one 's right to live and to survive in my judgment is wrong .
that is what happened in burma , and that is why it is such an important place where change needs to take place . how do you view the upcoming elections in russia ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has been supressing freedom of speech in russia russia is an example of how societies can also move backwards when it comes to human rights and the situation has gotten noticeably worse in the past years .
the kremlin has cracked down on the media in order to control the flow of information and discredit the citizens who are pushing for greater freedoms and political rights . the chess player garry kasparov is very famous in russia .
the western world knows him now as a politician , but he has rarely been seen as such in the russian media .
whoever putin , gazprom and the other big interests in russia put forth as their candidate will become president in the coming months .
but first we have to see how the parliamentary elections unfold . an important topic for deutsche welle , especially in central and southeastern europe , is the way countries deal with their communist past and the legacy of the secret police .
the east german stasi -lsb- secret police -rsb- archive is often offered as a model .
how important is the archive in your opinion and what do you see for its future ? i see our way of dealing with the gdr 's secret police archive as a model for the simple reason that is was not destroyed and is more or less now open to the public .
this archive tells the day-to-day story of a society that existed for 40 years .
it not just an archive of the atrocities of the gdr , it is not just an archive of denunciations or a place where we can find out if someone worked with the stasi , it is the daily journal of a culture .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 26.11.2007 german official : human rights get too little attention großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nooke was part of an opposition group in the gdr günter nooke , germany 's human rights commissioner , is calling for an expanded effort to fight human rights abuses .
this type of violence is an assault on human dignity , nooke said in an interview with deutsche welle . günter nooke has been the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid since march 2006 .
he is a member of chancellor angel merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and a member of deutsche welle 's broadcasting board . deutsche welle : the human rights situation is very unstable in many parts of the world .
when did you last get the feeling that your agency was able to achieve something ? günter nooke : human rights violations do not get much attention in germany and the western world .
when one travels somewhere and gives the human rights activists there the feeling that they are being heard , that they will be greeted in a german residence with the necessary protection , that they know that they are not alone in their fight - that is something .
whether they are fighting against poverty or promoting democracy , a little verbal acknowledgement can help support some smaller projects on the ground .
that is something i think works well . i also think that the german human rights commissioner should be part of a foreign policy debate here in germany about our strategic interests .
human rights are a far-sighted , practical policy ideal that is very much in the interest of germany and europe .
therefore , i think it would be helpful if we were to learn a little bit more about where we send our money and not just complain about it .
and we should say that it is perhaps in our best long-term interests to send more money because as freedom and democracy spread , our economic interests will be preserved . you just returned home from africa .
did you see anything concrete where you said to yourself , " i really made an impact here ? " i visited a military prison in guinea with a woman from an ngo .
no one knows many of the prisoners there and some just die without ever going to trial .
an officer came out and said that if the woman were to come back next week then she could meet with the boss to discuss her concerns .
perhaps then they can talk about how they can improve the prisoners ' living conditions , medical care or even to help them build a garden .
this is just one example of how a simple visit from a diplomat can cause some movement in a seemingly closed dictatorial system like in guinea . what can be done to improve the human rights situation in congo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence against woman has been prevalent in congo congo is a very sad situation , especially the situation in the east of the country near the rwandan border .
i really think that it was very important that we passed a resolution -lsb- at the united nations -rsb- in new york that the mass raping of women can not be a part of a military , strategic , systematic means of torture . eastern congo is probably the worst example in the world right now where such things are being perpetrated by different political groups .
security personnel , the army and even the police are taking part as well as hutu and tutsi militia and other rebel groups in the jungle .
i do not think that we can even conceive of what is happening in these areas . in february , i met a woman in eastern congo who told me that women are given their own children to eat and that such cannibalism is used not just to violate or to humiliate the women but to devastate them .
these actions absolutely destroy our very understanding of human dignity , of human rights .
it has got so bad that we can not just sit back and watch .
the united nations must use its mandate to do what it can because we simply can not continue to bear what is happening on the ground .
failure to do so would discredit our foreign policy and other international bodies . why do countries that suppress press freedoms , like ethiopia , receive development aid from germany ? we just had a hearing in the bundestag -lsb- germany 's lower house of parliament -rsb- about how much development aid will be tied to human rights .
as the federal human rights commissioner , i will say that each country should be discussed separately and that human right should be a condition to development aid .
but of course it is not easy to attach sanctions when they may only hurt the people and not the government .
therefore there is only one consideration as to how we can better distribute our aid , which is to make sure that our money is truly reaching the people on the ground . perhaps that means a larger number of smaller projects as opposed to bigger projects that are implemented by the central or provincial government .
unfortunately , we recognize that most african countries are not getting less corrupt .
i think that projects with a timetable of three to four years are too short .
in terms of africa , we need to plan our projects in decades and clarify the accountability so that we can credibly determine if the money we are giving out is not going to the wrong hands . let us turn to burma .
this country has moved back into focus because of the recent demonstrations .
now that things have calmed down , are people already forgetting about this country again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world should not forget burma , says nooke i hope that the focus has not shifted away from burma , but that the pressure on the military junta continues .
we here in the western world have our function , but the regional powers such as china and india are even more important in continuing to apply the pressure . burma should not be forgotten but be seen as an example that human rights are not tied to a certain religion or culture but that these ideals are universal and indivisible . people around the world can easily determine if human rights conditions are in the right or in the wrong .
for some to decide that they can simply sidestep one 's right to live and to survive in my judgment is wrong .
that is what happened in burma , and that is why it is such an important place where change needs to take place . how do you view the upcoming elections in russia ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has been supressing freedom of speech in russia russia is an example of how societies can also move backwards when it comes to human rights and the situation has gotten noticeably worse in the past years .
the kremlin has cracked down on the media in order to control the flow of information and discredit the citizens who are pushing for greater freedoms and political rights . the chess player garry kasparov is very famous in russia .
the western world knows him now as a politician , but he has rarely been seen as such in the russian media .
whoever putin , gazprom and the other big interests in russia put forth as their candidate will become president in the coming months .
but first we have to see how the parliamentary elections unfold . an important topic for deutsche welle , especially in central and southeastern europe , is the way countries deal with their communist past and the legacy of the secret police .
the east german stasi -lsb- secret police -rsb- archive is often offered as a model .
how important is the archive in your opinion and what do you see for its future ? i see our way of dealing with the gdr 's secret police archive as a model for the simple reason that is was not destroyed and is more or less now open to the public .
this archive tells the day-to-day story of a society that existed for 40 years .
it not just an archive of the atrocities of the gdr , it is not just an archive of denunciations or a place where we can find out if someone worked with the stasi , it is the daily journal of a culture .
i hope that more access to these files will be allowed and that this will happen independently from any political motives . interview : miodrag soric -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but few politicians expect a breakthrough . israeli prime minister ehud olmert had stressed his great interest in the success of tuesday 's conference in the us state of maryland , merkel 's spokesman said after the chancellor and prime minister 's telephone conversation on saturday , nov .
24 . merkel had brought up an action plan put forward by the european union , and olmert had welcomed the eu contribution , the spokesman said . earlier , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he saw the participation of a number of arab countries in the annapolis summit as " an important signal for peace . " syria , saudi arabia to attend meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said israelis and palestinians needed international support " israelis and palestinians face large challenges in the months ahead and need the support of the international community to surmount them , " the german foreign minister said . arab nations were showing their commitment to making a contribution to peace and stability in the region , said steinmeier , who is attending the talks under germany 's presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- . saudi arabia and syria , which do not officially recognize israel , both announced they would also be attending the annapolis summit , which begins on tuesday .
the countries were absent from a failed 2000 summit hosted by then us president bill clinton . historic reason for pessimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several peace accords , including the 1993 oslo agreement , have collapsed norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr store said monday he had no expectations of a peace agreement at the upcoming conference . " there are historical reasons to be pessimistic , " store was quoted as telling norwegian news agency ntb . major differences remain between the israelis and palestinians over core issues , such as the status of jerusalem , which both sides claim as their capital , the borders of a future palestinian state and the fate of palestinian refugees . hamas refuses concessions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush , who has 14 months left in office , has spent little time on the mideast conflict hamas leaders in the gaza strip have already announced they would not accept any concessions made by palestinians during the summit . " the negotiations nowadays are useless and holding the annapolis conference is a waste of time , " hamas leader ismail haniya told reporters on monday .
" our people will not commit themselves to any resolutions harming palestinian national principles . " haniya served as prime minister in a palestinian unity government until he was dismissed by president mahmoud abbas in june , following hamas ' violent takeover of the gaza strip .
hamas was not invited to take part in the peace talks . even after us president george w. bush said he was " personally committed " to ending the decades-long conflict with a two-state solution in the middle east , white house spokeswoman dana perino cautioned against expecting any " immediate results " from the conference . us national security advisor steve hadley also stressed that the conference was not itself a " negotiating forum , " but an " opportunity to move into a negotiating phase between palestinians and israelis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 26.11.2007 german official : human rights get too little attention großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nooke was part of an opposition group in the gdr günter nooke , germany 's human rights commissioner , is calling for an expanded effort to fight human rights abuses .
this type of violence is an assault on human dignity , nooke said in an interview with deutsche welle . günter nooke has been the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid since march 2006 .
he is a member of chancellor angel merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and a member of deutsche welle 's broadcasting board . deutsche welle : the human rights situation is very unstable in many parts of the world .
when did you last get the feeling that your agency was able to achieve something ? günter nooke : human rights violations do not get much attention in germany and the western world .
when one travels somewhere and gives the human rights activists there the feeling that they are being heard , that they will be greeted in a german residence with the necessary protection , that they know that they are not alone in their fight - that is something .
whether they are fighting against poverty or promoting democracy , a little verbal acknowledgement can help support some smaller projects on the ground .
that is something i think works well . i also think that the german human rights commissioner should be part of a foreign policy debate here in germany about our strategic interests .
human rights are a far-sighted , practical policy ideal that is very much in the interest of germany and europe .
therefore , i think it would be helpful if we were to learn a little bit more about where we send our money and not just complain about it .
and we should say that it is perhaps in our best long-term interests to send more money because as freedom and democracy spread , our economic interests will be preserved . you just returned home from africa .
did you see anything concrete where you said to yourself , " i really made an impact here ? " i visited a military prison in guinea with a woman from an ngo .
no one knows many of the prisoners there and some just die without ever going to trial .
an officer came out and said that if the woman were to come back next week then she could meet with the boss to discuss her concerns .
perhaps then they can talk about how they can improve the prisoners ' living conditions , medical care or even to help them build a garden .
this is just one example of how a simple visit from a diplomat can cause some movement in a seemingly closed dictatorial system like in guinea . what can be done to improve the human rights situation in congo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence against woman has been prevalent in congo congo is a very sad situation , especially the situation in the east of the country near the rwandan border .
i really think that it was very important that we passed a resolution -lsb- at the united nations -rsb- in new york that the mass raping of women can not be a part of a military , strategic , systematic means of torture . eastern congo is probably the worst example in the world right now where such things are being perpetrated by different political groups .
security personnel , the army and even the police are taking part as well as hutu and tutsi militia and other rebel groups in the jungle .
i do not think that we can even conceive of what is happening in these areas . in february , i met a woman in eastern congo who told me that women are given their own children to eat and that such cannibalism is used not just to violate or to humiliate the women but to devastate them .
these actions absolutely destroy our very understanding of human dignity , of human rights .
it has got so bad that we can not just sit back and watch .
the united nations must use its mandate to do what it can because we simply can not continue to bear what is happening on the ground .
failure to do so would discredit our foreign policy and other international bodies . why do countries that suppress press freedoms , like ethiopia , receive development aid from germany ? we just had a hearing in the bundestag -lsb- germany 's lower house of parliament -rsb- about how much development aid will be tied to human rights .
as the federal human rights commissioner , i will say that each country should be discussed separately and that human right should be a condition to development aid .
but of course it is not easy to attach sanctions when they may only hurt the people and not the government .
therefore there is only one consideration as to how we can better distribute our aid , which is to make sure that our money is truly reaching the people on the ground . perhaps that means a larger number of smaller projects as opposed to bigger projects that are implemented by the central or provincial government .
unfortunately , we recognize that most african countries are not getting less corrupt .
i think that projects with a timetable of three to four years are too short .
in terms of africa , we need to plan our projects in decades and clarify the accountability so that we can credibly determine if the money we are giving out is not going to the wrong hands . let us turn to burma .
this country has moved back into focus because of the recent demonstrations .
now that things have calmed down , are people already forgetting about this country again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world should not forget burma , says nooke i hope that the focus has not shifted away from burma , but that the pressure on the military junta continues .
we here in the western world have our function , but the regional powers such as china and india are even more important in continuing to apply the pressure . burma should not be forgotten but be seen as an example that human rights are not tied to a certain religion or culture but that these ideals are universal and indivisible . people around the world can easily determine if human rights conditions are in the right or in the wrong .
for some to decide that they can simply sidestep one 's right to live and to survive in my judgment is wrong .
that is what happened in burma , and that is why it is such an important place where change needs to take place . how do you view the upcoming elections in russia ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has been supressing freedom of speech in russia russia is an example of how societies can also move backwards when it comes to human rights and the situation has gotten noticeably worse in the past years .

russian president vladimir putin has accused the us of urging international observers not to monitor parliamentary elections to be held on sunday , dec .
2 .
but election monitors say russia 's visa office is to blame . " we have information that , once again , this was done on the recommendation of the us state department , " putin said on monday at a meeting with activists of his united russia party , referring to a pull-out decision earlier this month by an election monitoring group . the office for democratic institutions and human rights -lrb- odihr -rrb- , a warsaw-based branch of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- that had been planning to send observers to russia in the month prior to the elections , refuted putin 's claim . the cancellation had to do with problems obtaining visas , osce director christian strohal said in an interview with reuters news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police response to demonstrations did n't help putin 's reputation in the west " it 's unfortunate that we did n't have any other choice , " strohal said .
" this sort of thing has never happened to us before . " putin also said the pull-out would put a damper on russian-us relations and that any criticism from washington regarding sunday 's vote would further strain ties . " we will take this into account in our inter-state relations , " said putin , suggesting a cool-down in us-russian dealings . eu leader condemns police crackdown a police crackdown on opposition demonstrators over the weekend fuelled criticism that the parliamentary elections are being staged to ensure a hefty majority for united russia . opinion polls suggest that united russia , with putin at the helm , is expected to take the election with a 60 percent majority or more . european commission president jose manuel barroso expressed concern on monday about the severity of the suppression of the weekend demonstration , where truncheon-armed police officers arrested an estimated 200 people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin-supporters rallied in moscow on monday " the right to peaceful free speech and assembly are basic fundamental human rights and i very much regret that the authorities found it necessary to take such heavy-handed action , " said barroso in a statement . putin 's second term ends soon russia 's constitution stipulates a maximum of two terms for heads of state , which means putin is required to leave office next year . some observers have speculated , however , that putin may step down now and run again in the presidential elections planned for march 2 , 2008 , in order to get around the two-term limit , reported reuters .
in any case , the president has indicated that he would maintain political influence after stepping down . putin 's wide popularity at home stems largely from his image as a bearer of stability following the tumultuous post-soviet era under his predecessor , boris yeltsin . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this type of violence is an assault on human dignity , nooke said in an interview with deutsche welle . günter nooke has been the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid since march 2006 .
he is a member of chancellor angel merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and a member of deutsche welle 's broadcasting board . deutsche welle : the human rights situation is very unstable in many parts of the world .
when did you last get the feeling that your agency was able to achieve something ? günter nooke : human rights violations do not get much attention in germany and the western world .
when one travels somewhere and gives the human rights activists there the feeling that they are being heard , that they will be greeted in a german residence with the necessary protection , that they know that they are not alone in their fight - that is something .
whether they are fighting against poverty or promoting democracy , a little verbal acknowledgement can help support some smaller projects on the ground .
that is something i think works well . i also think that the german human rights commissioner should be part of a foreign policy debate here in germany about our strategic interests .
human rights are a far-sighted , practical policy ideal that is very much in the interest of germany and europe .
therefore , i think it would be helpful if we were to learn a little bit more about where we send our money and not just complain about it .
and we should say that it is perhaps in our best long-term interests to send more money because as freedom and democracy spread , our economic interests will be preserved . you just returned home from africa .
did you see anything concrete where you said to yourself , " i really made an impact here ? " i visited a military prison in guinea with a woman from an ngo .
no one knows many of the prisoners there and some just die without ever going to trial .
an officer came out and said that if the woman were to come back next week then she could meet with the boss to discuss her concerns .
perhaps then they can talk about how they can improve the prisoners ' living conditions , medical care or even to help them build a garden .
this is just one example of how a simple visit from a diplomat can cause some movement in a seemingly closed dictatorial system like in guinea . what can be done to improve the human rights situation in congo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence against woman has been prevalent in congo congo is a very sad situation , especially the situation in the east of the country near the rwandan border .
i really think that it was very important that we passed a resolution -lsb- at the united nations -rsb- in new york that the mass raping of women can not be a part of a military , strategic , systematic means of torture . eastern congo is probably the worst example in the world right now where such things are being perpetrated by different political groups .
security personnel , the army and even the police are taking part as well as hutu and tutsi militia and other rebel groups in the jungle .
i do not think that we can even conceive of what is happening in these areas . in february , i met a woman in eastern congo who told me that women are given their own children to eat and that such cannibalism is used not just to violate or to humiliate the women but to devastate them .
these actions absolutely destroy our very understanding of human dignity , of human rights .
it has got so bad that we can not just sit back and watch .
the united nations must use its mandate to do what it can because we simply can not continue to bear what is happening on the ground .
failure to do so would discredit our foreign policy and other international bodies . why do countries that suppress press freedoms , like ethiopia , receive development aid from germany ? we just had a hearing in the bundestag -lsb- germany 's lower house of parliament -rsb- about how much development aid will be tied to human rights .
as the federal human rights commissioner , i will say that each country should be discussed separately and that human right should be a condition to development aid .
but of course it is not easy to attach sanctions when they may only hurt the people and not the government .
therefore there is only one consideration as to how we can better distribute our aid , which is to make sure that our money is truly reaching the people on the ground . perhaps that means a larger number of smaller projects as opposed to bigger projects that are implemented by the central or provincial government .
unfortunately , we recognize that most african countries are not getting less corrupt .
i think that projects with a timetable of three to four years are too short .
in terms of africa , we need to plan our projects in decades and clarify the accountability so that we can credibly determine if the money we are giving out is not going to the wrong hands . let us turn to burma .
this country has moved back into focus because of the recent demonstrations .
now that things have calmed down , are people already forgetting about this country again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world should not forget burma , says nooke i hope that the focus has not shifted away from burma , but that the pressure on the military junta continues .
we here in the western world have our function , but the regional powers such as china and india are even more important in continuing to apply the pressure . burma should not be forgotten but be seen as an example that human rights are not tied to a certain religion or culture but that these ideals are universal and indivisible . people around the world can easily determine if human rights conditions are in the right or in the wrong .
for some to decide that they can simply sidestep one 's right to live and to survive in my judgment is wrong .
that is what happened in burma , and that is why it is such an important place where change needs to take place . how do you view the upcoming elections in russia ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has been supressing freedom of speech in russia russia is an example of how societies can also move backwards when it comes to human rights and the situation has gotten noticeably worse in the past years .
the kremlin has cracked down on the media in order to control the flow of information and discredit the citizens who are pushing for greater freedoms and political rights . the chess player garry kasparov is very famous in russia .
the western world knows him now as a politician , but he has rarely been seen as such in the russian media .
whoever putin , gazprom and the other big interests in russia put forth as their candidate will become president in the coming months .
but first we have to see how the parliamentary elections unfold . an important topic for deutsche welle , especially in central and southeastern europe , is the way countries deal with their communist past and the legacy of the secret police .

26 , for a last-ditch effort to find a compromise regarding the future status of the breakaway serbian province of kosovo . the closed-door negotiations in the quiet spa town baden near vienna , hosted by the kosovo troika - russia , the united states and the european union - are a final attempt to clinch a deal ahead of a dec .
10 deadline .
the chances of reaching any sort of compromise in the three-day talks remain extremely unlikely .
comparisons with other balkans peace conferences , like dayton , ohio in 1995 or rambouillet , france in 1999 , are hinting at a readiness for compromise that is completely absent from both parties ' positions .
the troika-mediated talks were launched in august when the un security council failed to endorse a model for internationally monitored independence proposed by un special envoy martti athisaari after russian veto threats .
after several inconclusive rounds of talks serbia and kosovo 's ethnic albanians are nowhere near a compromise , despite the troika promise to vigorously pursue a deal .
the last-ditch effort at hotel schloss weikersdorf comes before the troika reports back to un secretary general ban ki-moon on dec .
10 .
opposing views bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica has accused the west of trying to set up a nato state in kosovo kosovo 's ethnic albanians - who constitute more than 90 percent of the population - will settle for nothing short of independence , while serbia is only willing to go as far as granting far-reaching autonomy to the province .
backed by moscow , serbia suggested solutions similar to autonomy constructs for hong kong or the aland islands in finland .
russia and serbia also called for extending the un deadline , insisting that talks should continue until a compromise is found .
serbia 's prime minister vojislav kostunica , who is expected to lead the belgrade delegation together with president boris tadic , has become increasingly belligerent , accusing the west of planning to set up a " nato state " in the balkans after amputating kosovo from serbia .
kosovo had been the scene of a brutal , indiscriminate crackdown by serbian forces in response to a separatist insurgency in 1998-99 .
nato intervention ended the campaign , widely described in the west as ethnic cleansing , leaving kosovo under un administration .
belgrade , which insists its territorial rights in kosovo are inviolable , has dismissed plans for contractual ties between the two entities .
serbian politicians promised that belgrade would " never " recognize an independent kosovo and threatened an economic and political blockade in case of a unilateral declaration .
unilateral moves ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hashim thaci wants to lead the province to independence kosovo 's ethnic albanian leaders said they planned to unilaterally declare independence after dec .
10 , irrespective of the post-baden situation , but backpedaled after being warned not to take hasty steps .
kosovo 's likely new prime minister , hashim thaci , whose democratic party won the nov .
17 general elections , said he expected independence by the end of the year , but promised to coordinate his steps with brussels and washington .
" for kosovo there 's only one solution - it will become independent , " the ex-rebel commander thaci said , dismissing suggestions of any " intermediate status " for kosovo 's 2 million albanians in a post-baden setting .
with kosovo being backed by washington and belgrade by moscow , consensus within the eu remains elusive .
a majority of the union 's 27 member states favors independence for kosovo , but concerns exist that the province 's example could encourage secessionists elsewhere .
at the end of the previous round of talks in brussels on nov .
20 , the troika said it would explore all possibilities .
but even troika chief wolfgang ischinger admitted agreement was unlikely , barring a last minute about-face by one of the two parties . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but few politicians expect a breakthrough . israeli prime minister ehud olmert had stressed his great interest in the success of tuesday 's conference in the us state of maryland , merkel 's spokesman said after the chancellor and prime minister 's telephone conversation on saturday , nov .
24 . merkel had brought up an action plan put forward by the european union , and olmert had welcomed the eu contribution , the spokesman said . earlier , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he saw the participation of a number of arab countries in the annapolis summit as " an important signal for peace . " syria , saudi arabia to attend meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said israelis and palestinians needed international support " israelis and palestinians face large challenges in the months ahead and need the support of the international community to surmount them , " the german foreign minister said . arab nations were showing their commitment to making a contribution to peace and stability in the region , said steinmeier , who is attending the talks under germany 's presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- . saudi arabia and syria , which do not officially recognize israel , both announced they would also be attending the annapolis summit , which begins on tuesday .
the countries were absent from a failed 2000 summit hosted by then us president bill clinton . historic reason for pessimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several peace accords , including the 1993 oslo agreement , have collapsed norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr store said monday he had no expectations of a peace agreement at the upcoming conference . " there are historical reasons to be pessimistic , " store was quoted as telling norwegian news agency ntb . major differences remain between the israelis and palestinians over core issues , such as the status of jerusalem , which both sides claim as their capital , the borders of a future palestinian state and the fate of palestinian refugees . hamas refuses concessions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush , who has 14 months left in office , has spent little time on the mideast conflict hamas leaders in the gaza strip have already announced they would not accept any concessions made by palestinians during the summit . " the negotiations nowadays are useless and holding the annapolis conference is a waste of time , " hamas leader ismail haniya told reporters on monday .
" our people will not commit themselves to any resolutions harming palestinian national principles . " haniya served as prime minister in a palestinian unity government until he was dismissed by president mahmoud abbas in june , following hamas ' violent takeover of the gaza strip .
hamas was not invited to take part in the peace talks . even after us president george w. bush said he was " personally committed " to ending the decades-long conflict with a two-state solution in the middle east , white house spokeswoman dana perino cautioned against expecting any " immediate results " from the conference . us national security advisor steve hadley also stressed that the conference was not itself a " negotiating forum , " but an " opportunity to move into a negotiating phase between palestinians and israelis .

this type of violence is an assault on human dignity , nooke said in an interview with deutsche welle . günter nooke has been the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid since march 2006 .
he is a member of chancellor angel merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and a member of deutsche welle 's broadcasting board . deutsche welle : the human rights situation is very unstable in many parts of the world .
when did you last get the feeling that your agency was able to achieve something ? günter nooke : human rights violations do not get much attention in germany and the western world .
when one travels somewhere and gives the human rights activists there the feeling that they are being heard , that they will be greeted in a german residence with the necessary protection , that they know that they are not alone in their fight - that is something .
whether they are fighting against poverty or promoting democracy , a little verbal acknowledgement can help support some smaller projects on the ground .
that is something i think works well . i also think that the german human rights commissioner should be part of a foreign policy debate here in germany about our strategic interests .
human rights are a far-sighted , practical policy ideal that is very much in the interest of germany and europe .
therefore , i think it would be helpful if we were to learn a little bit more about where we send our money and not just complain about it .
and we should say that it is perhaps in our best long-term interests to send more money because as freedom and democracy spread , our economic interests will be preserved . you just returned home from africa .
did you see anything concrete where you said to yourself , " i really made an impact here ? " i visited a military prison in guinea with a woman from an ngo .
no one knows many of the prisoners there and some just die without ever going to trial .
an officer came out and said that if the woman were to come back next week then she could meet with the boss to discuss her concerns .
perhaps then they can talk about how they can improve the prisoners ' living conditions , medical care or even to help them build a garden .
this is just one example of how a simple visit from a diplomat can cause some movement in a seemingly closed dictatorial system like in guinea . what can be done to improve the human rights situation in congo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence against woman has been prevalent in congo congo is a very sad situation , especially the situation in the east of the country near the rwandan border .
i really think that it was very important that we passed a resolution -lsb- at the united nations -rsb- in new york that the mass raping of women can not be a part of a military , strategic , systematic means of torture . eastern congo is probably the worst example in the world right now where such things are being perpetrated by different political groups .
security personnel , the army and even the police are taking part as well as hutu and tutsi militia and other rebel groups in the jungle .
i do not think that we can even conceive of what is happening in these areas . in february , i met a woman in eastern congo who told me that women are given their own children to eat and that such cannibalism is used not just to violate or to humiliate the women but to devastate them .
these actions absolutely destroy our very understanding of human dignity , of human rights .
it has got so bad that we can not just sit back and watch .
the united nations must use its mandate to do what it can because we simply can not continue to bear what is happening on the ground .
failure to do so would discredit our foreign policy and other international bodies . why do countries that suppress press freedoms , like ethiopia , receive development aid from germany ? we just had a hearing in the bundestag -lsb- germany 's lower house of parliament -rsb- about how much development aid will be tied to human rights .
as the federal human rights commissioner , i will say that each country should be discussed separately and that human right should be a condition to development aid .
but of course it is not easy to attach sanctions when they may only hurt the people and not the government .
therefore there is only one consideration as to how we can better distribute our aid , which is to make sure that our money is truly reaching the people on the ground . perhaps that means a larger number of smaller projects as opposed to bigger projects that are implemented by the central or provincial government .
unfortunately , we recognize that most african countries are not getting less corrupt .
i think that projects with a timetable of three to four years are too short .
in terms of africa , we need to plan our projects in decades and clarify the accountability so that we can credibly determine if the money we are giving out is not going to the wrong hands . let us turn to burma .
this country has moved back into focus because of the recent demonstrations .
now that things have calmed down , are people already forgetting about this country again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world should not forget burma , says nooke i hope that the focus has not shifted away from burma , but that the pressure on the military junta continues .
we here in the western world have our function , but the regional powers such as china and india are even more important in continuing to apply the pressure . burma should not be forgotten but be seen as an example that human rights are not tied to a certain religion or culture but that these ideals are universal and indivisible . people around the world can easily determine if human rights conditions are in the right or in the wrong .
for some to decide that they can simply sidestep one 's right to live and to survive in my judgment is wrong .
that is what happened in burma , and that is why it is such an important place where change needs to take place . how do you view the upcoming elections in russia ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has been supressing freedom of speech in russia russia is an example of how societies can also move backwards when it comes to human rights and the situation has gotten noticeably worse in the past years .
the kremlin has cracked down on the media in order to control the flow of information and discredit the citizens who are pushing for greater freedoms and political rights . the chess player garry kasparov is very famous in russia .
the western world knows him now as a politician , but he has rarely been seen as such in the russian media .
whoever putin , gazprom and the other big interests in russia put forth as their candidate will become president in the coming months .
but first we have to see how the parliamentary elections unfold . an important topic for deutsche welle , especially in central and southeastern europe , is the way countries deal with their communist past and the legacy of the secret police .
the east german stasi -lsb- secret police -rsb- archive is often offered as a model .
how important is the archive in your opinion and what do you see for its future ? i see our way of dealing with the gdr 's secret police archive as a model for the simple reason that is was not destroyed and is more or less now open to the public .
this archive tells the day-to-day story of a society that existed for 40 years .
it not just an archive of the atrocities of the gdr , it is not just an archive of denunciations or a place where we can find out if someone worked with the stasi , it is the daily journal of a culture .
i hope that more access to these files will be allowed and that this will happen independently from any political motives . interview : miodrag soric -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that is something i think works well . i also think that the german human rights commissioner should be part of a foreign policy debate here in germany about our strategic interests .
human rights are a far-sighted , practical policy ideal that is very much in the interest of germany and europe .
therefore , i think it would be helpful if we were to learn a little bit more about where we send our money and not just complain about it .
and we should say that it is perhaps in our best long-term interests to send more money because as freedom and democracy spread , our economic interests will be preserved . you just returned home from africa .
did you see anything concrete where you said to yourself , " i really made an impact here ? " i visited a military prison in guinea with a woman from an ngo .
no one knows many of the prisoners there and some just die without ever going to trial .
an officer came out and said that if the woman were to come back next week then she could meet with the boss to discuss her concerns .
perhaps then they can talk about how they can improve the prisoners ' living conditions , medical care or even to help them build a garden .
this is just one example of how a simple visit from a diplomat can cause some movement in a seemingly closed dictatorial system like in guinea . what can be done to improve the human rights situation in congo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence against woman has been prevalent in congo congo is a very sad situation , especially the situation in the east of the country near the rwandan border .
i really think that it was very important that we passed a resolution -lsb- at the united nations -rsb- in new york that the mass raping of women can not be a part of a military , strategic , systematic means of torture . eastern congo is probably the worst example in the world right now where such things are being perpetrated by different political groups .
security personnel , the army and even the police are taking part as well as hutu and tutsi militia and other rebel groups in the jungle .
i do not think that we can even conceive of what is happening in these areas . in february , i met a woman in eastern congo who told me that women are given their own children to eat and that such cannibalism is used not just to violate or to humiliate the women but to devastate them .
these actions absolutely destroy our very understanding of human dignity , of human rights .
it has got so bad that we can not just sit back and watch .
the united nations must use its mandate to do what it can because we simply can not continue to bear what is happening on the ground .
failure to do so would discredit our foreign policy and other international bodies . why do countries that suppress press freedoms , like ethiopia , receive development aid from germany ? we just had a hearing in the bundestag -lsb- germany 's lower house of parliament -rsb- about how much development aid will be tied to human rights .
as the federal human rights commissioner , i will say that each country should be discussed separately and that human right should be a condition to development aid .
but of course it is not easy to attach sanctions when they may only hurt the people and not the government .
therefore there is only one consideration as to how we can better distribute our aid , which is to make sure that our money is truly reaching the people on the ground . perhaps that means a larger number of smaller projects as opposed to bigger projects that are implemented by the central or provincial government .
unfortunately , we recognize that most african countries are not getting less corrupt .
i think that projects with a timetable of three to four years are too short .
in terms of africa , we need to plan our projects in decades and clarify the accountability so that we can credibly determine if the money we are giving out is not going to the wrong hands . let us turn to burma .
this country has moved back into focus because of the recent demonstrations .
now that things have calmed down , are people already forgetting about this country again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world should not forget burma , says nooke i hope that the focus has not shifted away from burma , but that the pressure on the military junta continues .
we here in the western world have our function , but the regional powers such as china and india are even more important in continuing to apply the pressure . burma should not be forgotten but be seen as an example that human rights are not tied to a certain religion or culture but that these ideals are universal and indivisible . people around the world can easily determine if human rights conditions are in the right or in the wrong .
for some to decide that they can simply sidestep one 's right to live and to survive in my judgment is wrong .
that is what happened in burma , and that is why it is such an important place where change needs to take place . how do you view the upcoming elections in russia ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has been supressing freedom of speech in russia russia is an example of how societies can also move backwards when it comes to human rights and the situation has gotten noticeably worse in the past years .
the kremlin has cracked down on the media in order to control the flow of information and discredit the citizens who are pushing for greater freedoms and political rights . the chess player garry kasparov is very famous in russia .
the western world knows him now as a politician , but he has rarely been seen as such in the russian media .
whoever putin , gazprom and the other big interests in russia put forth as their candidate will become president in the coming months .
but first we have to see how the parliamentary elections unfold . an important topic for deutsche welle , especially in central and southeastern europe , is the way countries deal with their communist past and the legacy of the secret police .
the east german stasi -lsb- secret police -rsb- archive is often offered as a model .
how important is the archive in your opinion and what do you see for its future ? i see our way of dealing with the gdr 's secret police archive as a model for the simple reason that is was not destroyed and is more or less now open to the public .
this archive tells the day-to-day story of a society that existed for 40 years .
it not just an archive of the atrocities of the gdr , it is not just an archive of denunciations or a place where we can find out if someone worked with the stasi , it is the daily journal of a culture .
i hope that more access to these files will be allowed and that this will happen independently from any political motives . interview : miodrag soric -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this type of violence is an assault on human dignity , nooke said in an interview with deutsche welle . günter nooke has been the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid since march 2006 .
he is a member of chancellor angel merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and a member of deutsche welle 's broadcasting board . deutsche welle : the human rights situation is very unstable in many parts of the world .
when did you last get the feeling that your agency was able to achieve something ? günter nooke : human rights violations do not get much attention in germany and the western world .
when one travels somewhere and gives the human rights activists there the feeling that they are being heard , that they will be greeted in a german residence with the necessary protection , that they know that they are not alone in their fight - that is something .
whether they are fighting against poverty or promoting democracy , a little verbal acknowledgement can help support some smaller projects on the ground .
that is something i think works well . i also think that the german human rights commissioner should be part of a foreign policy debate here in germany about our strategic interests .
human rights are a far-sighted , practical policy ideal that is very much in the interest of germany and europe .
therefore , i think it would be helpful if we were to learn a little bit more about where we send our money and not just complain about it .
and we should say that it is perhaps in our best long-term interests to send more money because as freedom and democracy spread , our economic interests will be preserved . you just returned home from africa .
did you see anything concrete where you said to yourself , " i really made an impact here ? " i visited a military prison in guinea with a woman from an ngo .
no one knows many of the prisoners there and some just die without ever going to trial .
an officer came out and said that if the woman were to come back next week then she could meet with the boss to discuss her concerns .
perhaps then they can talk about how they can improve the prisoners ' living conditions , medical care or even to help them build a garden .
this is just one example of how a simple visit from a diplomat can cause some movement in a seemingly closed dictatorial system like in guinea . what can be done to improve the human rights situation in congo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence against woman has been prevalent in congo congo is a very sad situation , especially the situation in the east of the country near the rwandan border .
i really think that it was very important that we passed a resolution -lsb- at the united nations -rsb- in new york that the mass raping of women can not be a part of a military , strategic , systematic means of torture . eastern congo is probably the worst example in the world right now where such things are being perpetrated by different political groups .
security personnel , the army and even the police are taking part as well as hutu and tutsi militia and other rebel groups in the jungle .
i do not think that we can even conceive of what is happening in these areas . in february , i met a woman in eastern congo who told me that women are given their own children to eat and that such cannibalism is used not just to violate or to humiliate the women but to devastate them .
these actions absolutely destroy our very understanding of human dignity , of human rights .
it has got so bad that we can not just sit back and watch .
the united nations must use its mandate to do what it can because we simply can not continue to bear what is happening on the ground .
failure to do so would discredit our foreign policy and other international bodies . why do countries that suppress press freedoms , like ethiopia , receive development aid from germany ? we just had a hearing in the bundestag -lsb- germany 's lower house of parliament -rsb- about how much development aid will be tied to human rights .
as the federal human rights commissioner , i will say that each country should be discussed separately and that human right should be a condition to development aid .
but of course it is not easy to attach sanctions when they may only hurt the people and not the government .
therefore there is only one consideration as to how we can better distribute our aid , which is to make sure that our money is truly reaching the people on the ground . perhaps that means a larger number of smaller projects as opposed to bigger projects that are implemented by the central or provincial government .
unfortunately , we recognize that most african countries are not getting less corrupt .
i think that projects with a timetable of three to four years are too short .
in terms of africa , we need to plan our projects in decades and clarify the accountability so that we can credibly determine if the money we are giving out is not going to the wrong hands . let us turn to burma .
this country has moved back into focus because of the recent demonstrations .
now that things have calmed down , are people already forgetting about this country again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world should not forget burma , says nooke i hope that the focus has not shifted away from burma , but that the pressure on the military junta continues .
we here in the western world have our function , but the regional powers such as china and india are even more important in continuing to apply the pressure . burma should not be forgotten but be seen as an example that human rights are not tied to a certain religion or culture but that these ideals are universal and indivisible . people around the world can easily determine if human rights conditions are in the right or in the wrong .
for some to decide that they can simply sidestep one 's right to live and to survive in my judgment is wrong .
that is what happened in burma , and that is why it is such an important place where change needs to take place . how do you view the upcoming elections in russia ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has been supressing freedom of speech in russia russia is an example of how societies can also move backwards when it comes to human rights and the situation has gotten noticeably worse in the past years .

this type of violence is an assault on human dignity , nooke said in an interview with deutsche welle . günter nooke has been the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid since march 2006 .
he is a member of chancellor angel merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and a member of deutsche welle 's broadcasting board . deutsche welle : the human rights situation is very unstable in many parts of the world .
when did you last get the feeling that your agency was able to achieve something ? günter nooke : human rights violations do not get much attention in germany and the western world .
when one travels somewhere and gives the human rights activists there the feeling that they are being heard , that they will be greeted in a german residence with the necessary protection , that they know that they are not alone in their fight - that is something .
whether they are fighting against poverty or promoting democracy , a little verbal acknowledgement can help support some smaller projects on the ground .
that is something i think works well . i also think that the german human rights commissioner should be part of a foreign policy debate here in germany about our strategic interests .
human rights are a far-sighted , practical policy ideal that is very much in the interest of germany and europe .
therefore , i think it would be helpful if we were to learn a little bit more about where we send our money and not just complain about it .
and we should say that it is perhaps in our best long-term interests to send more money because as freedom and democracy spread , our economic interests will be preserved . you just returned home from africa .

26 , for a last-ditch effort to find a compromise regarding the future status of the breakaway serbian province of kosovo . the closed-door negotiations in the quiet spa town baden near vienna , hosted by the kosovo troika - russia , the united states and the european union - are a final attempt to clinch a deal ahead of a dec .
10 deadline .
the chances of reaching any sort of compromise in the three-day talks remain extremely unlikely .
comparisons with other balkans peace conferences , like dayton , ohio in 1995 or rambouillet , france in 1999 , are hinting at a readiness for compromise that is completely absent from both parties ' positions .
the troika-mediated talks were launched in august when the un security council failed to endorse a model for internationally monitored independence proposed by un special envoy martti athisaari after russian veto threats .
after several inconclusive rounds of talks serbia and kosovo 's ethnic albanians are nowhere near a compromise , despite the troika promise to vigorously pursue a deal .
the last-ditch effort at hotel schloss weikersdorf comes before the troika reports back to un secretary general ban ki-moon on dec .
10 .
opposing views bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica has accused the west of trying to set up a nato state in kosovo kosovo 's ethnic albanians - who constitute more than 90 percent of the population - will settle for nothing short of independence , while serbia is only willing to go as far as granting far-reaching autonomy to the province .
backed by moscow , serbia suggested solutions similar to autonomy constructs for hong kong or the aland islands in finland .
russia and serbia also called for extending the un deadline , insisting that talks should continue until a compromise is found .
serbia 's prime minister vojislav kostunica , who is expected to lead the belgrade delegation together with president boris tadic , has become increasingly belligerent , accusing the west of planning to set up a " nato state " in the balkans after amputating kosovo from serbia .
kosovo had been the scene of a brutal , indiscriminate crackdown by serbian forces in response to a separatist insurgency in 1998-99 .
nato intervention ended the campaign , widely described in the west as ethnic cleansing , leaving kosovo under un administration .
belgrade , which insists its territorial rights in kosovo are inviolable , has dismissed plans for contractual ties between the two entities .
serbian politicians promised that belgrade would " never " recognize an independent kosovo and threatened an economic and political blockade in case of a unilateral declaration .
unilateral moves ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hashim thaci wants to lead the province to independence kosovo 's ethnic albanian leaders said they planned to unilaterally declare independence after dec .
10 , irrespective of the post-baden situation , but backpedaled after being warned not to take hasty steps .
kosovo 's likely new prime minister , hashim thaci , whose democratic party won the nov .
17 general elections , said he expected independence by the end of the year , but promised to coordinate his steps with brussels and washington .
" for kosovo there 's only one solution - it will become independent , " the ex-rebel commander thaci said , dismissing suggestions of any " intermediate status " for kosovo 's 2 million albanians in a post-baden setting .
with kosovo being backed by washington and belgrade by moscow , consensus within the eu remains elusive .
a majority of the union 's 27 member states favors independence for kosovo , but concerns exist that the province 's example could encourage secessionists elsewhere .
at the end of the previous round of talks in brussels on nov .
20 , the troika said it would explore all possibilities .
but even troika chief wolfgang ischinger admitted agreement was unlikely , barring a last minute about-face by one of the two parties . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the boost breathes new life into the venture . germany was the only eu member state on friday , nov .
23 , to vote against the bloc 's proposal to contribute an additional 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.56 billion -rrb- to the galileo project , which is intended to serve as a civilian alternative to the united states ' gps navigation system . the eu had originally pledged 1 billion euros , with the rest to come from private industry .
when the private consortium involved in the satnav project pulled out of the deal last spring , galileo 's future became uncertain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu said using unused agriculture funds would be a one-time move though 1.6 billion euros are intended to come out of the eu 's unused agriculture budget , as suggested by the bloc 's budget commissioner dalia grybauskaite , germany had feared that , as the eu 's biggest financier , it would have to carry up to 500 million euros of the commitment . " the result -lsb- of the vote -rsb- is relatively bad , " said a spokesman from the ministry of finance in berlin on sunday .
" but the nature of majorities is that you have to accept them . " contracts to be granted in variety of sectors germany had advocated that the funds come from cuts to other eu research projects and initially had the support of britain , the netherlands , spain and sweden .
when the eu agreed to draw 600 million euros from other scientific endeavors in the bloc , germany was the only country to maintain resistance to the financing plan .
spain abstained from voting . the total cost of the satellite project is estimated at 3.4 billion euros and is expected to create over 100,000 new jobs in europe . the eu plans to advertise for private bids in at least six different sectors , with no single company receiving a contract in more than two sectors , said european commission spokeswoman michele cercone .
the approach was meant to quell german fears that french companies would win control of the essential elements of the projects . greater accuracy than us counterpart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo should be able to warn drivers of traffic and accidents ahead billed as a way to avoid european dependence on the united states ' gps navigation system , galileo is to provide greater precision and reliability in located objects within one meter -lrb- 3.3 feet -rrb- . the 30 planned galileo satellites will be able to warn car drivers of traffic jams and accurately predict delays in the city bus system .
the system has also been billed as a way to help rescue workers trace missing persons and by law enforcement officers locate escaped prisoners . after a five-year delay due to budget uncertainties , galileo is now slated for completion in 2013 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de berlin wants bigger share of galileo for german companies berlin has said it wants a larger role for german companies in the galileo satellite navigation system as the eu debates how it will pay for the project , which has been plagued by delays and funding problems .

russian president vladimir putin has accused the us of urging international observers not to monitor parliamentary elections to be held on sunday , dec .

but election monitors say russia 's visa office is to blame . " we have information that , once again , this was done on the recommendation of the us state department , " putin said on monday at a meeting with activists of his united russia party , referring to a pull-out decision earlier this month by an election monitoring group . the office for democratic institutions and human rights -lrb- odihr -rrb- , a warsaw-based branch of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- that had been planning to send observers to russia in the month prior to the elections , refuted putin 's claim . the cancellation had to do with problems obtaining visas , osce director christian strohal said in an interview with reuters news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police response to demonstrations did n't help putin 's reputation in the west " it 's unfortunate that we did n't have any other choice , " strohal said .
" this sort of thing has never happened to us before . " putin also said the pull-out would put a damper on russian-us relations and that any criticism from washington regarding sunday 's vote would further strain ties . " we will take this into account in our inter-state relations , " said putin , suggesting a cool-down in us-russian dealings . eu leader condemns police crackdown a police crackdown on opposition demonstrators over the weekend fuelled criticism that the parliamentary elections are being staged to ensure a hefty majority for united russia . opinion polls suggest that united russia , with putin at the helm , is expected to take the election with a 60 percent majority or more . european commission president jose manuel barroso expressed concern on monday about the severity of the suppression of the weekend demonstration , where truncheon-armed police officers arrested an estimated 200 people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin-supporters rallied in moscow on monday " the right to peaceful free speech and assembly are basic fundamental human rights and i very much regret that the authorities found it necessary to take such heavy-handed action , " said barroso in a statement . putin 's second term ends soon russia 's constitution stipulates a maximum of two terms for heads of state , which means putin is required to leave office next year . some observers have speculated , however , that putin may step down now and run again in the presidential elections planned for march 2 , 2008 , in order to get around the two-term limit , reported reuters .
in any case , the president has indicated that he would maintain political influence after stepping down . putin 's wide popularity at home stems largely from his image as a bearer of stability following the tumultuous post-soviet era under his predecessor , boris yeltsin . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this type of violence is an assault on human dignity , nooke said in an interview with deutsche welle . günter nooke has been the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid since march 2006 .
he is a member of chancellor angel merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and a member of deutsche welle 's broadcasting board . deutsche welle : the human rights situation is very unstable in many parts of the world .
when did you last get the feeling that your agency was able to achieve something ? günter nooke : human rights violations do not get much attention in germany and the western world .
when one travels somewhere and gives the human rights activists there the feeling that they are being heard , that they will be greeted in a german residence with the necessary protection , that they know that they are not alone in their fight - that is something .
whether they are fighting against poverty or promoting democracy , a little verbal acknowledgement can help support some smaller projects on the ground .
that is something i think works well . i also think that the german human rights commissioner should be part of a foreign policy debate here in germany about our strategic interests .
human rights are a far-sighted , practical policy ideal that is very much in the interest of germany and europe .
therefore , i think it would be helpful if we were to learn a little bit more about where we send our money and not just complain about it .
and we should say that it is perhaps in our best long-term interests to send more money because as freedom and democracy spread , our economic interests will be preserved . you just returned home from africa .
did you see anything concrete where you said to yourself , " i really made an impact here ? " i visited a military prison in guinea with a woman from an ngo .
no one knows many of the prisoners there and some just die without ever going to trial .
an officer came out and said that if the woman were to come back next week then she could meet with the boss to discuss her concerns .
perhaps then they can talk about how they can improve the prisoners ' living conditions , medical care or even to help them build a garden .
this is just one example of how a simple visit from a diplomat can cause some movement in a seemingly closed dictatorial system like in guinea . what can be done to improve the human rights situation in congo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence against woman has been prevalent in congo congo is a very sad situation , especially the situation in the east of the country near the rwandan border .
i really think that it was very important that we passed a resolution -lsb- at the united nations -rsb- in new york that the mass raping of women can not be a part of a military , strategic , systematic means of torture . eastern congo is probably the worst example in the world right now where such things are being perpetrated by different political groups .
security personnel , the army and even the police are taking part as well as hutu and tutsi militia and other rebel groups in the jungle .
i do not think that we can even conceive of what is happening in these areas . in february , i met a woman in eastern congo who told me that women are given their own children to eat and that such cannibalism is used not just to violate or to humiliate the women but to devastate them .
these actions absolutely destroy our very understanding of human dignity , of human rights .
it has got so bad that we can not just sit back and watch .
the united nations must use its mandate to do what it can because we simply can not continue to bear what is happening on the ground .
failure to do so would discredit our foreign policy and other international bodies . why do countries that suppress press freedoms , like ethiopia , receive development aid from germany ? we just had a hearing in the bundestag -lsb- germany 's lower house of parliament -rsb- about how much development aid will be tied to human rights .
as the federal human rights commissioner , i will say that each country should be discussed separately and that human right should be a condition to development aid .
but of course it is not easy to attach sanctions when they may only hurt the people and not the government .
therefore there is only one consideration as to how we can better distribute our aid , which is to make sure that our money is truly reaching the people on the ground . perhaps that means a larger number of smaller projects as opposed to bigger projects that are implemented by the central or provincial government .
unfortunately , we recognize that most african countries are not getting less corrupt .
i think that projects with a timetable of three to four years are too short .
in terms of africa , we need to plan our projects in decades and clarify the accountability so that we can credibly determine if the money we are giving out is not going to the wrong hands . let us turn to burma .
this country has moved back into focus because of the recent demonstrations .
now that things have calmed down , are people already forgetting about this country again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world should not forget burma , says nooke i hope that the focus has not shifted away from burma , but that the pressure on the military junta continues .
we here in the western world have our function , but the regional powers such as china and india are even more important in continuing to apply the pressure . burma should not be forgotten but be seen as an example that human rights are not tied to a certain religion or culture but that these ideals are universal and indivisible . people around the world can easily determine if human rights conditions are in the right or in the wrong .
for some to decide that they can simply sidestep one 's right to live and to survive in my judgment is wrong .
that is what happened in burma , and that is why it is such an important place where change needs to take place . how do you view the upcoming elections in russia ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has been supressing freedom of speech in russia russia is an example of how societies can also move backwards when it comes to human rights and the situation has gotten noticeably worse in the past years .
the kremlin has cracked down on the media in order to control the flow of information and discredit the citizens who are pushing for greater freedoms and political rights . the chess player garry kasparov is very famous in russia .
the western world knows him now as a politician , but he has rarely been seen as such in the russian media .
whoever putin , gazprom and the other big interests in russia put forth as their candidate will become president in the coming months .
but first we have to see how the parliamentary elections unfold . an important topic for deutsche welle , especially in central and southeastern europe , is the way countries deal with their communist past and the legacy of the secret police .
the east german stasi -lsb- secret police -rsb- archive is often offered as a model .
how important is the archive in your opinion and what do you see for its future ? i see our way of dealing with the gdr 's secret police archive as a model for the simple reason that is was not destroyed and is more or less now open to the public .
this archive tells the day-to-day story of a society that existed for 40 years .
it not just an archive of the atrocities of the gdr , it is not just an archive of denunciations or a place where we can find out if someone worked with the stasi , it is the daily journal of a culture .

the boost breathes new life into the venture . germany was the only eu member state on friday , nov .
23 , to vote against the bloc 's proposal to contribute an additional 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.56 billion -rrb- to the galileo project , which is intended to serve as a civilian alternative to the united states ' gps navigation system . the eu had originally pledged 1 billion euros , with the rest to come from private industry .
when the private consortium involved in the satnav project pulled out of the deal last spring , galileo 's future became uncertain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu said using unused agriculture funds would be a one-time move though 1.6 billion euros are intended to come out of the eu 's unused agriculture budget , as suggested by the bloc 's budget commissioner dalia grybauskaite , germany had feared that , as the eu 's biggest financier , it would have to carry up to 500 million euros of the commitment . " the result -lsb- of the vote -rsb- is relatively bad , " said a spokesman from the ministry of finance in berlin on sunday .
" but the nature of majorities is that you have to accept them . " contracts to be granted in variety of sectors germany had advocated that the funds come from cuts to other eu research projects and initially had the support of britain , the netherlands , spain and sweden .
when the eu agreed to draw 600 million euros from other scientific endeavors in the bloc , germany was the only country to maintain resistance to the financing plan .
spain abstained from voting . the total cost of the satellite project is estimated at 3.4 billion euros and is expected to create over 100,000 new jobs in europe . the eu plans to advertise for private bids in at least six different sectors , with no single company receiving a contract in more than two sectors , said european commission spokeswoman michele cercone .
the approach was meant to quell german fears that french companies would win control of the essential elements of the projects . greater accuracy than us counterpart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo should be able to warn drivers of traffic and accidents ahead billed as a way to avoid european dependence on the united states ' gps navigation system , galileo is to provide greater precision and reliability in located objects within one meter -lrb- 3.3 feet -rrb- . the 30 planned galileo satellites will be able to warn car drivers of traffic jams and accurately predict delays in the city bus system .
the system has also been billed as a way to help rescue workers trace missing persons and by law enforcement officers locate escaped prisoners . after a five-year delay due to budget uncertainties , galileo is now slated for completion in 2013 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 26.11.2007 german official : human rights get too little attention großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nooke was part of an opposition group in the gdr günter nooke , germany 's human rights commissioner , is calling for an expanded effort to fight human rights abuses .
this type of violence is an assault on human dignity , nooke said in an interview with deutsche welle . günter nooke has been the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid since march 2006 .
he is a member of chancellor angel merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and a member of deutsche welle 's broadcasting board . deutsche welle : the human rights situation is very unstable in many parts of the world .
when did you last get the feeling that your agency was able to achieve something ? günter nooke : human rights violations do not get much attention in germany and the western world .
when one travels somewhere and gives the human rights activists there the feeling that they are being heard , that they will be greeted in a german residence with the necessary protection , that they know that they are not alone in their fight - that is something .
whether they are fighting against poverty or promoting democracy , a little verbal acknowledgement can help support some smaller projects on the ground .
that is something i think works well . i also think that the german human rights commissioner should be part of a foreign policy debate here in germany about our strategic interests .
human rights are a far-sighted , practical policy ideal that is very much in the interest of germany and europe .
therefore , i think it would be helpful if we were to learn a little bit more about where we send our money and not just complain about it .
and we should say that it is perhaps in our best long-term interests to send more money because as freedom and democracy spread , our economic interests will be preserved . you just returned home from africa .
did you see anything concrete where you said to yourself , " i really made an impact here ? " i visited a military prison in guinea with a woman from an ngo .
no one knows many of the prisoners there and some just die without ever going to trial .
an officer came out and said that if the woman were to come back next week then she could meet with the boss to discuss her concerns .
perhaps then they can talk about how they can improve the prisoners ' living conditions , medical care or even to help them build a garden .
this is just one example of how a simple visit from a diplomat can cause some movement in a seemingly closed dictatorial system like in guinea . what can be done to improve the human rights situation in congo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence against woman has been prevalent in congo congo is a very sad situation , especially the situation in the east of the country near the rwandan border .
i really think that it was very important that we passed a resolution -lsb- at the united nations -rsb- in new york that the mass raping of women can not be a part of a military , strategic , systematic means of torture . eastern congo is probably the worst example in the world right now where such things are being perpetrated by different political groups .
security personnel , the army and even the police are taking part as well as hutu and tutsi militia and other rebel groups in the jungle .
i do not think that we can even conceive of what is happening in these areas . in february , i met a woman in eastern congo who told me that women are given their own children to eat and that such cannibalism is used not just to violate or to humiliate the women but to devastate them .
these actions absolutely destroy our very understanding of human dignity , of human rights .
it has got so bad that we can not just sit back and watch .
the united nations must use its mandate to do what it can because we simply can not continue to bear what is happening on the ground .
failure to do so would discredit our foreign policy and other international bodies . why do countries that suppress press freedoms , like ethiopia , receive development aid from germany ? we just had a hearing in the bundestag -lsb- germany 's lower house of parliament -rsb- about how much development aid will be tied to human rights .
as the federal human rights commissioner , i will say that each country should be discussed separately and that human right should be a condition to development aid .
but of course it is not easy to attach sanctions when they may only hurt the people and not the government .
therefore there is only one consideration as to how we can better distribute our aid , which is to make sure that our money is truly reaching the people on the ground . perhaps that means a larger number of smaller projects as opposed to bigger projects that are implemented by the central or provincial government .
unfortunately , we recognize that most african countries are not getting less corrupt .
i think that projects with a timetable of three to four years are too short .
in terms of africa , we need to plan our projects in decades and clarify the accountability so that we can credibly determine if the money we are giving out is not going to the wrong hands . let us turn to burma .
this country has moved back into focus because of the recent demonstrations .
now that things have calmed down , are people already forgetting about this country again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world should not forget burma , says nooke i hope that the focus has not shifted away from burma , but that the pressure on the military junta continues .
we here in the western world have our function , but the regional powers such as china and india are even more important in continuing to apply the pressure . burma should not be forgotten but be seen as an example that human rights are not tied to a certain religion or culture but that these ideals are universal and indivisible . people around the world can easily determine if human rights conditions are in the right or in the wrong .
for some to decide that they can simply sidestep one 's right to live and to survive in my judgment is wrong .
that is what happened in burma , and that is why it is such an important place where change needs to take place . how do you view the upcoming elections in russia ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has been supressing freedom of speech in russia russia is an example of how societies can also move backwards when it comes to human rights and the situation has gotten noticeably worse in the past years .

this type of violence is an assault on human dignity , nooke said in an interview with deutsche welle . günter nooke has been the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid since march 2006 .
he is a member of chancellor angel merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and a member of deutsche welle 's broadcasting board . deutsche welle : the human rights situation is very unstable in many parts of the world .
when did you last get the feeling that your agency was able to achieve something ? günter nooke : human rights violations do not get much attention in germany and the western world .
when one travels somewhere and gives the human rights activists there the feeling that they are being heard , that they will be greeted in a german residence with the necessary protection , that they know that they are not alone in their fight - that is something .
whether they are fighting against poverty or promoting democracy , a little verbal acknowledgement can help support some smaller projects on the ground .
that is something i think works well . i also think that the german human rights commissioner should be part of a foreign policy debate here in germany about our strategic interests .
human rights are a far-sighted , practical policy ideal that is very much in the interest of germany and europe .
therefore , i think it would be helpful if we were to learn a little bit more about where we send our money and not just complain about it .
and we should say that it is perhaps in our best long-term interests to send more money because as freedom and democracy spread , our economic interests will be preserved . you just returned home from africa .
did you see anything concrete where you said to yourself , " i really made an impact here ? " i visited a military prison in guinea with a woman from an ngo .
no one knows many of the prisoners there and some just die without ever going to trial .
an officer came out and said that if the woman were to come back next week then she could meet with the boss to discuss her concerns .
perhaps then they can talk about how they can improve the prisoners ' living conditions , medical care or even to help them build a garden .
this is just one example of how a simple visit from a diplomat can cause some movement in a seemingly closed dictatorial system like in guinea . what can be done to improve the human rights situation in congo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence against woman has been prevalent in congo congo is a very sad situation , especially the situation in the east of the country near the rwandan border .
i really think that it was very important that we passed a resolution -lsb- at the united nations -rsb- in new york that the mass raping of women can not be a part of a military , strategic , systematic means of torture . eastern congo is probably the worst example in the world right now where such things are being perpetrated by different political groups .

as the federal human rights commissioner , i will say that each country should be discussed separately and that human right should be a condition to development aid .
but of course it is not easy to attach sanctions when they may only hurt the people and not the government .
therefore there is only one consideration as to how we can better distribute our aid , which is to make sure that our money is truly reaching the people on the ground . perhaps that means a larger number of smaller projects as opposed to bigger projects that are implemented by the central or provincial government .
unfortunately , we recognize that most african countries are not getting less corrupt .
i think that projects with a timetable of three to four years are too short .
in terms of africa , we need to plan our projects in decades and clarify the accountability so that we can credibly determine if the money we are giving out is not going to the wrong hands . let us turn to burma .
this country has moved back into focus because of the recent demonstrations .
now that things have calmed down , are people already forgetting about this country again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world should not forget burma , says nooke i hope that the focus has not shifted away from burma , but that the pressure on the military junta continues .
we here in the western world have our function , but the regional powers such as china and india are even more important in continuing to apply the pressure . burma should not be forgotten but be seen as an example that human rights are not tied to a certain religion or culture but that these ideals are universal and indivisible . people around the world can easily determine if human rights conditions are in the right or in the wrong .
for some to decide that they can simply sidestep one 's right to live and to survive in my judgment is wrong .
that is what happened in burma , and that is why it is such an important place where change needs to take place . how do you view the upcoming elections in russia ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has been supressing freedom of speech in russia russia is an example of how societies can also move backwards when it comes to human rights and the situation has gotten noticeably worse in the past years .
the kremlin has cracked down on the media in order to control the flow of information and discredit the citizens who are pushing for greater freedoms and political rights . the chess player garry kasparov is very famous in russia .
the western world knows him now as a politician , but he has rarely been seen as such in the russian media .
whoever putin , gazprom and the other big interests in russia put forth as their candidate will become president in the coming months .
but first we have to see how the parliamentary elections unfold . an important topic for deutsche welle , especially in central and southeastern europe , is the way countries deal with their communist past and the legacy of the secret police .
the east german stasi -lsb- secret police -rsb- archive is often offered as a model .
how important is the archive in your opinion and what do you see for its future ? i see our way of dealing with the gdr 's secret police archive as a model for the simple reason that is was not destroyed and is more or less now open to the public .
this archive tells the day-to-day story of a society that existed for 40 years .
it not just an archive of the atrocities of the gdr , it is not just an archive of denunciations or a place where we can find out if someone worked with the stasi , it is the daily journal of a culture .
i hope that more access to these files will be allowed and that this will happen independently from any political motives . interview : miodrag soric -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , for a last-ditch effort to find a compromise regarding the future status of the breakaway serbian province of kosovo . the closed-door negotiations in the quiet spa town baden near vienna , hosted by the kosovo troika - russia , the united states and the european union - are a final attempt to clinch a deal ahead of a dec .
10 deadline .
the chances of reaching any sort of compromise in the three-day talks remain extremely unlikely .
comparisons with other balkans peace conferences , like dayton , ohio in 1995 or rambouillet , france in 1999 , are hinting at a readiness for compromise that is completely absent from both parties ' positions .
the troika-mediated talks were launched in august when the un security council failed to endorse a model for internationally monitored independence proposed by un special envoy martti athisaari after russian veto threats .
after several inconclusive rounds of talks serbia and kosovo 's ethnic albanians are nowhere near a compromise , despite the troika promise to vigorously pursue a deal .

backed by moscow , serbia suggested solutions similar to autonomy constructs for hong kong or the aland islands in finland .
russia and serbia also called for extending the un deadline , insisting that talks should continue until a compromise is found .
serbia 's prime minister vojislav kostunica , who is expected to lead the belgrade delegation together with president boris tadic , has become increasingly belligerent , accusing the west of planning to set up a " nato state " in the balkans after amputating kosovo from serbia .
kosovo had been the scene of a brutal , indiscriminate crackdown by serbian forces in response to a separatist insurgency in 1998-99 .
nato intervention ended the campaign , widely described in the west as ethnic cleansing , leaving kosovo under un administration .
belgrade , which insists its territorial rights in kosovo are inviolable , has dismissed plans for contractual ties between the two entities .
serbian politicians promised that belgrade would " never " recognize an independent kosovo and threatened an economic and political blockade in case of a unilateral declaration .

spain abstained from voting . the total cost of the satellite project is estimated at 3.4 billion euros and is expected to create over 100,000 new jobs in europe . the eu plans to advertise for private bids in at least six different sectors , with no single company receiving a contract in more than two sectors , said european commission spokeswoman michele cercone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 26.11.2007 last round of kosovo talks unlikely to end in compromise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians will settle for nothing short of independence from serbia representatives of belgrade and pristina will meet on monday , nov .
26 , for a last-ditch effort to find a compromise regarding the future status of the breakaway serbian province of kosovo . the closed-door negotiations in the quiet spa town baden near vienna , hosted by the kosovo troika - russia , the united states and the european union - are a final attempt to clinch a deal ahead of a dec .
10 deadline .
the chances of reaching any sort of compromise in the three-day talks remain extremely unlikely .
comparisons with other balkans peace conferences , like dayton , ohio in 1995 or rambouillet , france in 1999 , are hinting at a readiness for compromise that is completely absent from both parties ' positions .
the troika-mediated talks were launched in august when the un security council failed to endorse a model for internationally monitored independence proposed by un special envoy martti athisaari after russian veto threats .
after several inconclusive rounds of talks serbia and kosovo 's ethnic albanians are nowhere near a compromise , despite the troika promise to vigorously pursue a deal .
the last-ditch effort at hotel schloss weikersdorf comes before the troika reports back to un secretary general ban ki-moon on dec .
10 .
opposing views bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica has accused the west of trying to set up a nato state in kosovo kosovo 's ethnic albanians - who constitute more than 90 percent of the population - will settle for nothing short of independence , while serbia is only willing to go as far as granting far-reaching autonomy to the province .
backed by moscow , serbia suggested solutions similar to autonomy constructs for hong kong or the aland islands in finland .
russia and serbia also called for extending the un deadline , insisting that talks should continue until a compromise is found .
serbia 's prime minister vojislav kostunica , who is expected to lead the belgrade delegation together with president boris tadic , has become increasingly belligerent , accusing the west of planning to set up a " nato state " in the balkans after amputating kosovo from serbia .
kosovo had been the scene of a brutal , indiscriminate crackdown by serbian forces in response to a separatist insurgency in 1998-99 .
nato intervention ended the campaign , widely described in the west as ethnic cleansing , leaving kosovo under un administration .
belgrade , which insists its territorial rights in kosovo are inviolable , has dismissed plans for contractual ties between the two entities .
serbian politicians promised that belgrade would " never " recognize an independent kosovo and threatened an economic and political blockade in case of a unilateral declaration .
unilateral moves ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hashim thaci wants to lead the province to independence kosovo 's ethnic albanian leaders said they planned to unilaterally declare independence after dec .
10 , irrespective of the post-baden situation , but backpedaled after being warned not to take hasty steps .
kosovo 's likely new prime minister , hashim thaci , whose democratic party won the nov .
17 general elections , said he expected independence by the end of the year , but promised to coordinate his steps with brussels and washington .

russian president vladimir putin has accused the us of urging international observers not to monitor parliamentary elections to be held on sunday , dec .

but election monitors say russia 's visa office is to blame . " we have information that , once again , this was done on the recommendation of the us state department , " putin said on monday at a meeting with activists of his united russia party , referring to a pull-out decision earlier this month by an election monitoring group . the office for democratic institutions and human rights -lrb- odihr -rrb- , a warsaw-based branch of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- that had been planning to send observers to russia in the month prior to the elections , refuted putin 's claim . the cancellation had to do with problems obtaining visas , osce director christian strohal said in an interview with reuters news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police response to demonstrations did n't help putin 's reputation in the west " it 's unfortunate that we did n't have any other choice , " strohal said .
" this sort of thing has never happened to us before . " putin also said the pull-out would put a damper on russian-us relations and that any criticism from washington regarding sunday 's vote would further strain ties . " we will take this into account in our inter-state relations , " said putin , suggesting a cool-down in us-russian dealings . eu leader condemns police crackdown a police crackdown on opposition demonstrators over the weekend fuelled criticism that the parliamentary elections are being staged to ensure a hefty majority for united russia . opinion polls suggest that united russia , with putin at the helm , is expected to take the election with a 60 percent majority or more . european commission president jose manuel barroso expressed concern on monday about the severity of the suppression of the weekend demonstration , where truncheon-armed police officers arrested an estimated 200 people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin-supporters rallied in moscow on monday " the right to peaceful free speech and assembly are basic fundamental human rights and i very much regret that the authorities found it necessary to take such heavy-handed action , " said barroso in a statement . putin 's second term ends soon russia 's constitution stipulates a maximum of two terms for heads of state , which means putin is required to leave office next year . some observers have speculated , however , that putin may step down now and run again in the presidential elections planned for march 2 , 2008 , in order to get around the two-term limit , reported reuters .
in any case , the president has indicated that he would maintain political influence after stepping down . putin 's wide popularity at home stems largely from his image as a bearer of stability following the tumultuous post-soviet era under his predecessor , boris yeltsin . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 26.11.2007 german official : human rights get too little attention großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nooke was part of an opposition group in the gdr günter nooke , germany 's human rights commissioner , is calling for an expanded effort to fight human rights abuses .
this type of violence is an assault on human dignity , nooke said in an interview with deutsche welle . günter nooke has been the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid since march 2006 .
he is a member of chancellor angel merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and a member of deutsche welle 's broadcasting board . deutsche welle : the human rights situation is very unstable in many parts of the world .
when did you last get the feeling that your agency was able to achieve something ? günter nooke : human rights violations do not get much attention in germany and the western world .
when one travels somewhere and gives the human rights activists there the feeling that they are being heard , that they will be greeted in a german residence with the necessary protection , that they know that they are not alone in their fight - that is something .
whether they are fighting against poverty or promoting democracy , a little verbal acknowledgement can help support some smaller projects on the ground .
that is something i think works well . i also think that the german human rights commissioner should be part of a foreign policy debate here in germany about our strategic interests .
human rights are a far-sighted , practical policy ideal that is very much in the interest of germany and europe .
therefore , i think it would be helpful if we were to learn a little bit more about where we send our money and not just complain about it .
and we should say that it is perhaps in our best long-term interests to send more money because as freedom and democracy spread , our economic interests will be preserved . you just returned home from africa .
did you see anything concrete where you said to yourself , " i really made an impact here ? " i visited a military prison in guinea with a woman from an ngo .
no one knows many of the prisoners there and some just die without ever going to trial .
an officer came out and said that if the woman were to come back next week then she could meet with the boss to discuss her concerns .
perhaps then they can talk about how they can improve the prisoners ' living conditions , medical care or even to help them build a garden .
this is just one example of how a simple visit from a diplomat can cause some movement in a seemingly closed dictatorial system like in guinea . what can be done to improve the human rights situation in congo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence against woman has been prevalent in congo congo is a very sad situation , especially the situation in the east of the country near the rwandan border .
i really think that it was very important that we passed a resolution -lsb- at the united nations -rsb- in new york that the mass raping of women can not be a part of a military , strategic , systematic means of torture . eastern congo is probably the worst example in the world right now where such things are being perpetrated by different political groups .
security personnel , the army and even the police are taking part as well as hutu and tutsi militia and other rebel groups in the jungle .
i do not think that we can even conceive of what is happening in these areas . in february , i met a woman in eastern congo who told me that women are given their own children to eat and that such cannibalism is used not just to violate or to humiliate the women but to devastate them .
these actions absolutely destroy our very understanding of human dignity , of human rights .
it has got so bad that we can not just sit back and watch .
the united nations must use its mandate to do what it can because we simply can not continue to bear what is happening on the ground .
failure to do so would discredit our foreign policy and other international bodies . why do countries that suppress press freedoms , like ethiopia , receive development aid from germany ? we just had a hearing in the bundestag -lsb- germany 's lower house of parliament -rsb- about how much development aid will be tied to human rights .
as the federal human rights commissioner , i will say that each country should be discussed separately and that human right should be a condition to development aid .
but of course it is not easy to attach sanctions when they may only hurt the people and not the government .
therefore there is only one consideration as to how we can better distribute our aid , which is to make sure that our money is truly reaching the people on the ground . perhaps that means a larger number of smaller projects as opposed to bigger projects that are implemented by the central or provincial government .
unfortunately , we recognize that most african countries are not getting less corrupt .
i think that projects with a timetable of three to four years are too short .
in terms of africa , we need to plan our projects in decades and clarify the accountability so that we can credibly determine if the money we are giving out is not going to the wrong hands . let us turn to burma .
this country has moved back into focus because of the recent demonstrations .
now that things have calmed down , are people already forgetting about this country again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world should not forget burma , says nooke i hope that the focus has not shifted away from burma , but that the pressure on the military junta continues .
we here in the western world have our function , but the regional powers such as china and india are even more important in continuing to apply the pressure . burma should not be forgotten but be seen as an example that human rights are not tied to a certain religion or culture but that these ideals are universal and indivisible . people around the world can easily determine if human rights conditions are in the right or in the wrong .
for some to decide that they can simply sidestep one 's right to live and to survive in my judgment is wrong .
that is what happened in burma , and that is why it is such an important place where change needs to take place . how do you view the upcoming elections in russia ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has been supressing freedom of speech in russia russia is an example of how societies can also move backwards when it comes to human rights and the situation has gotten noticeably worse in the past years .
the kremlin has cracked down on the media in order to control the flow of information and discredit the citizens who are pushing for greater freedoms and political rights . the chess player garry kasparov is very famous in russia .
the western world knows him now as a politician , but he has rarely been seen as such in the russian media .
whoever putin , gazprom and the other big interests in russia put forth as their candidate will become president in the coming months .
but first we have to see how the parliamentary elections unfold . an important topic for deutsche welle , especially in central and southeastern europe , is the way countries deal with their communist past and the legacy of the secret police .
the east german stasi -lsb- secret police -rsb- archive is often offered as a model .
how important is the archive in your opinion and what do you see for its future ? i see our way of dealing with the gdr 's secret police archive as a model for the simple reason that is was not destroyed and is more or less now open to the public .
this archive tells the day-to-day story of a society that existed for 40 years .
it not just an archive of the atrocities of the gdr , it is not just an archive of denunciations or a place where we can find out if someone worked with the stasi , it is the daily journal of a culture .
i hope that more access to these files will be allowed and that this will happen independently from any political motives . interview : miodrag soric -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this type of violence is an assault on human dignity , nooke said in an interview with deutsche welle . günter nooke has been the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid since march 2006 .
he is a member of chancellor angel merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and a member of deutsche welle 's broadcasting board . deutsche welle : the human rights situation is very unstable in many parts of the world .
when did you last get the feeling that your agency was able to achieve something ? günter nooke : human rights violations do not get much attention in germany and the western world .
when one travels somewhere and gives the human rights activists there the feeling that they are being heard , that they will be greeted in a german residence with the necessary protection , that they know that they are not alone in their fight - that is something .
whether they are fighting against poverty or promoting democracy , a little verbal acknowledgement can help support some smaller projects on the ground .
that is something i think works well . i also think that the german human rights commissioner should be part of a foreign policy debate here in germany about our strategic interests .
human rights are a far-sighted , practical policy ideal that is very much in the interest of germany and europe .
therefore , i think it would be helpful if we were to learn a little bit more about where we send our money and not just complain about it .
and we should say that it is perhaps in our best long-term interests to send more money because as freedom and democracy spread , our economic interests will be preserved . you just returned home from africa .
did you see anything concrete where you said to yourself , " i really made an impact here ? " i visited a military prison in guinea with a woman from an ngo .
no one knows many of the prisoners there and some just die without ever going to trial .
an officer came out and said that if the woman were to come back next week then she could meet with the boss to discuss her concerns .
perhaps then they can talk about how they can improve the prisoners ' living conditions , medical care or even to help them build a garden .
this is just one example of how a simple visit from a diplomat can cause some movement in a seemingly closed dictatorial system like in guinea . what can be done to improve the human rights situation in congo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence against woman has been prevalent in congo congo is a very sad situation , especially the situation in the east of the country near the rwandan border .
i really think that it was very important that we passed a resolution -lsb- at the united nations -rsb- in new york that the mass raping of women can not be a part of a military , strategic , systematic means of torture . eastern congo is probably the worst example in the world right now where such things are being perpetrated by different political groups .
security personnel , the army and even the police are taking part as well as hutu and tutsi militia and other rebel groups in the jungle .
i do not think that we can even conceive of what is happening in these areas . in february , i met a woman in eastern congo who told me that women are given their own children to eat and that such cannibalism is used not just to violate or to humiliate the women but to devastate them .
these actions absolutely destroy our very understanding of human dignity , of human rights .
it has got so bad that we can not just sit back and watch .
the united nations must use its mandate to do what it can because we simply can not continue to bear what is happening on the ground .
failure to do so would discredit our foreign policy and other international bodies . why do countries that suppress press freedoms , like ethiopia , receive development aid from germany ? we just had a hearing in the bundestag -lsb- germany 's lower house of parliament -rsb- about how much development aid will be tied to human rights .
as the federal human rights commissioner , i will say that each country should be discussed separately and that human right should be a condition to development aid .
but of course it is not easy to attach sanctions when they may only hurt the people and not the government .
therefore there is only one consideration as to how we can better distribute our aid , which is to make sure that our money is truly reaching the people on the ground . perhaps that means a larger number of smaller projects as opposed to bigger projects that are implemented by the central or provincial government .
unfortunately , we recognize that most african countries are not getting less corrupt .
i think that projects with a timetable of three to four years are too short .
in terms of africa , we need to plan our projects in decades and clarify the accountability so that we can credibly determine if the money we are giving out is not going to the wrong hands . let us turn to burma .
this country has moved back into focus because of the recent demonstrations .
now that things have calmed down , are people already forgetting about this country again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world should not forget burma , says nooke i hope that the focus has not shifted away from burma , but that the pressure on the military junta continues .
we here in the western world have our function , but the regional powers such as china and india are even more important in continuing to apply the pressure . burma should not be forgotten but be seen as an example that human rights are not tied to a certain religion or culture but that these ideals are universal and indivisible . people around the world can easily determine if human rights conditions are in the right or in the wrong .
for some to decide that they can simply sidestep one 's right to live and to survive in my judgment is wrong .
that is what happened in burma , and that is why it is such an important place where change needs to take place . how do you view the upcoming elections in russia ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has been supressing freedom of speech in russia russia is an example of how societies can also move backwards when it comes to human rights and the situation has gotten noticeably worse in the past years .
the kremlin has cracked down on the media in order to control the flow of information and discredit the citizens who are pushing for greater freedoms and political rights . the chess player garry kasparov is very famous in russia .
the western world knows him now as a politician , but he has rarely been seen as such in the russian media .
whoever putin , gazprom and the other big interests in russia put forth as their candidate will become president in the coming months .
but first we have to see how the parliamentary elections unfold . an important topic for deutsche welle , especially in central and southeastern europe , is the way countries deal with their communist past and the legacy of the secret police .
the east german stasi -lsb- secret police -rsb- archive is often offered as a model .
how important is the archive in your opinion and what do you see for its future ? i see our way of dealing with the gdr 's secret police archive as a model for the simple reason that is was not destroyed and is more or less now open to the public .
this archive tells the day-to-day story of a society that existed for 40 years .
it not just an archive of the atrocities of the gdr , it is not just an archive of denunciations or a place where we can find out if someone worked with the stasi , it is the daily journal of a culture .
i hope that more access to these files will be allowed and that this will happen independently from any political motives . interview : miodrag soric -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 26.11.2007 german official : human rights get too little attention großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nooke was part of an opposition group in the gdr günter nooke , germany 's human rights commissioner , is calling for an expanded effort to fight human rights abuses .
this type of violence is an assault on human dignity , nooke said in an interview with deutsche welle . günter nooke has been the german government 's commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid since march 2006 .
he is a member of chancellor angel merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and a member of deutsche welle 's broadcasting board . deutsche welle : the human rights situation is very unstable in many parts of the world .
when did you last get the feeling that your agency was able to achieve something ? günter nooke : human rights violations do not get much attention in germany and the western world .
when one travels somewhere and gives the human rights activists there the feeling that they are being heard , that they will be greeted in a german residence with the necessary protection , that they know that they are not alone in their fight - that is something .
whether they are fighting against poverty or promoting democracy , a little verbal acknowledgement can help support some smaller projects on the ground .
that is something i think works well . i also think that the german human rights commissioner should be part of a foreign policy debate here in germany about our strategic interests .
human rights are a far-sighted , practical policy ideal that is very much in the interest of germany and europe .
therefore , i think it would be helpful if we were to learn a little bit more about where we send our money and not just complain about it .
and we should say that it is perhaps in our best long-term interests to send more money because as freedom and democracy spread , our economic interests will be preserved . you just returned home from africa .
did you see anything concrete where you said to yourself , " i really made an impact here ? " i visited a military prison in guinea with a woman from an ngo .
no one knows many of the prisoners there and some just die without ever going to trial .
an officer came out and said that if the woman were to come back next week then she could meet with the boss to discuss her concerns .
perhaps then they can talk about how they can improve the prisoners ' living conditions , medical care or even to help them build a garden .
this is just one example of how a simple visit from a diplomat can cause some movement in a seemingly closed dictatorial system like in guinea . what can be done to improve the human rights situation in congo ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence against woman has been prevalent in congo congo is a very sad situation , especially the situation in the east of the country near the rwandan border .
i really think that it was very important that we passed a resolution -lsb- at the united nations -rsb- in new york that the mass raping of women can not be a part of a military , strategic , systematic means of torture . eastern congo is probably the worst example in the world right now where such things are being perpetrated by different political groups .
security personnel , the army and even the police are taking part as well as hutu and tutsi militia and other rebel groups in the jungle .
i do not think that we can even conceive of what is happening in these areas . in february , i met a woman in eastern congo who told me that women are given their own children to eat and that such cannibalism is used not just to violate or to humiliate the women but to devastate them .
these actions absolutely destroy our very understanding of human dignity , of human rights .
it has got so bad that we can not just sit back and watch .
the united nations must use its mandate to do what it can because we simply can not continue to bear what is happening on the ground .
failure to do so would discredit our foreign policy and other international bodies . why do countries that suppress press freedoms , like ethiopia , receive development aid from germany ? we just had a hearing in the bundestag -lsb- germany 's lower house of parliament -rsb- about how much development aid will be tied to human rights .
as the federal human rights commissioner , i will say that each country should be discussed separately and that human right should be a condition to development aid .
but of course it is not easy to attach sanctions when they may only hurt the people and not the government .
therefore there is only one consideration as to how we can better distribute our aid , which is to make sure that our money is truly reaching the people on the ground . perhaps that means a larger number of smaller projects as opposed to bigger projects that are implemented by the central or provincial government .
unfortunately , we recognize that most african countries are not getting less corrupt .
i think that projects with a timetable of three to four years are too short .
in terms of africa , we need to plan our projects in decades and clarify the accountability so that we can credibly determine if the money we are giving out is not going to the wrong hands . let us turn to burma .
this country has moved back into focus because of the recent demonstrations .
now that things have calmed down , are people already forgetting about this country again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world should not forget burma , says nooke i hope that the focus has not shifted away from burma , but that the pressure on the military junta continues .
we here in the western world have our function , but the regional powers such as china and india are even more important in continuing to apply the pressure . burma should not be forgotten but be seen as an example that human rights are not tied to a certain religion or culture but that these ideals are universal and indivisible . people around the world can easily determine if human rights conditions are in the right or in the wrong .
for some to decide that they can simply sidestep one 's right to live and to survive in my judgment is wrong .
that is what happened in burma , and that is why it is such an important place where change needs to take place . how do you view the upcoming elections in russia ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has been supressing freedom of speech in russia russia is an example of how societies can also move backwards when it comes to human rights and the situation has gotten noticeably worse in the past years .
the kremlin has cracked down on the media in order to control the flow of information and discredit the citizens who are pushing for greater freedoms and political rights . the chess player garry kasparov is very famous in russia .
the western world knows him now as a politician , but he has rarely been seen as such in the russian media .
whoever putin , gazprom and the other big interests in russia put forth as their candidate will become president in the coming months .
but first we have to see how the parliamentary elections unfold . an important topic for deutsche welle , especially in central and southeastern europe , is the way countries deal with their communist past and the legacy of the secret police .
the east german stasi -lsb- secret police -rsb- archive is often offered as a model .
how important is the archive in your opinion and what do you see for its future ? i see our way of dealing with the gdr 's secret police archive as a model for the simple reason that is was not destroyed and is more or less now open to the public .
this archive tells the day-to-day story of a society that existed for 40 years .
it not just an archive of the atrocities of the gdr , it is not just an archive of denunciations or a place where we can find out if someone worked with the stasi , it is the daily journal of a culture .
i hope that more access to these files will be allowed and that this will happen independently from any political motives . interview : miodrag soric -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 26.11.2007 last round of kosovo talks unlikely to end in compromise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo albanians will settle for nothing short of independence from serbia representatives of belgrade and pristina will meet on monday , nov .
26 , for a last-ditch effort to find a compromise regarding the future status of the breakaway serbian province of kosovo . the closed-door negotiations in the quiet spa town baden near vienna , hosted by the kosovo troika - russia , the united states and the european union - are a final attempt to clinch a deal ahead of a dec .
10 deadline .
the chances of reaching any sort of compromise in the three-day talks remain extremely unlikely .
comparisons with other balkans peace conferences , like dayton , ohio in 1995 or rambouillet , france in 1999 , are hinting at a readiness for compromise that is completely absent from both parties ' positions .
the troika-mediated talks were launched in august when the un security council failed to endorse a model for internationally monitored independence proposed by un special envoy martti athisaari after russian veto threats .
after several inconclusive rounds of talks serbia and kosovo 's ethnic albanians are nowhere near a compromise , despite the troika promise to vigorously pursue a deal .
the last-ditch effort at hotel schloss weikersdorf comes before the troika reports back to un secretary general ban ki-moon on dec .
10 .
opposing views bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica has accused the west of trying to set up a nato state in kosovo kosovo 's ethnic albanians - who constitute more than 90 percent of the population - will settle for nothing short of independence , while serbia is only willing to go as far as granting far-reaching autonomy to the province .
backed by moscow , serbia suggested solutions similar to autonomy constructs for hong kong or the aland islands in finland .
russia and serbia also called for extending the un deadline , insisting that talks should continue until a compromise is found .
serbia 's prime minister vojislav kostunica , who is expected to lead the belgrade delegation together with president boris tadic , has become increasingly belligerent , accusing the west of planning to set up a " nato state " in the balkans after amputating kosovo from serbia .
kosovo had been the scene of a brutal , indiscriminate crackdown by serbian forces in response to a separatist insurgency in 1998-99 .
nato intervention ended the campaign , widely described in the west as ethnic cleansing , leaving kosovo under un administration .
belgrade , which insists its territorial rights in kosovo are inviolable , has dismissed plans for contractual ties between the two entities .
serbian politicians promised that belgrade would " never " recognize an independent kosovo and threatened an economic and political blockade in case of a unilateral declaration .
unilateral moves ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hashim thaci wants to lead the province to independence kosovo 's ethnic albanian leaders said they planned to unilaterally declare independence after dec .
10 , irrespective of the post-baden situation , but backpedaled after being warned not to take hasty steps .
kosovo 's likely new prime minister , hashim thaci , whose democratic party won the nov .
17 general elections , said he expected independence by the end of the year , but promised to coordinate his steps with brussels and washington .
" for kosovo there 's only one solution - it will become independent , " the ex-rebel commander thaci said , dismissing suggestions of any " intermediate status " for kosovo 's 2 million albanians in a post-baden setting .
with kosovo being backed by washington and belgrade by moscow , consensus within the eu remains elusive .
a majority of the union 's 27 member states favors independence for kosovo , but concerns exist that the province 's example could encourage secessionists elsewhere .
at the end of the previous round of talks in brussels on nov .
20 , the troika said it would explore all possibilities .
but even troika chief wolfgang ischinger admitted agreement was unlikely , barring a last minute about-face by one of the two parties . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" syria , saudi arabia to attend meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said israelis and palestinians needed international support " israelis and palestinians face large challenges in the months ahead and need the support of the international community to surmount them , " the german foreign minister said . arab nations were showing their commitment to making a contribution to peace and stability in the region , said steinmeier , who is attending the talks under germany 's presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- . saudi arabia and syria , which do not officially recognize israel , both announced they would also be attending the annapolis summit , which begins on tuesday .

" there are historical reasons to be pessimistic , " store was quoted as telling norwegian news agency ntb . major differences remain between the israelis and palestinians over core issues , such as the status of jerusalem , which both sides claim as their capital , the borders of a future palestinian state and the fate of palestinian refugees . hamas refuses concessions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush , who has 14 months left in office , has spent little time on the mideast conflict hamas leaders in the gaza strip have already announced they would not accept any concessions made by palestinians during the summit . " the negotiations nowadays are useless and holding the annapolis conference is a waste of time , " hamas leader ismail haniya told reporters on monday .
" our people will not commit themselves to any resolutions harming palestinian national principles . " haniya served as prime minister in a palestinian unity government until he was dismissed by president mahmoud abbas in june , following hamas ' violent takeover of the gaza strip .
hamas was not invited to take part in the peace talks . even after us president george w. bush said he was " personally committed " to ending the decades-long conflict with a two-state solution in the middle east , white house spokeswoman dana perino cautioned against expecting any " immediate results " from the conference . us national security advisor steve hadley also stressed that the conference was not itself a " negotiating forum , " but an " opportunity to move into a negotiating phase between palestinians and israelis .

" syria , saudi arabia to attend meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said israelis and palestinians needed international support " israelis and palestinians face large challenges in the months ahead and need the support of the international community to surmount them , " the german foreign minister said . arab nations were showing their commitment to making a contribution to peace and stability in the region , said steinmeier , who is attending the talks under germany 's presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- . saudi arabia and syria , which do not officially recognize israel , both announced they would also be attending the annapolis summit , which begins on tuesday .
the countries were absent from a failed 2000 summit hosted by then us president bill clinton . historic reason for pessimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several peace accords , including the 1993 oslo agreement , have collapsed norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr store said monday he had no expectations of a peace agreement at the upcoming conference . " there are historical reasons to be pessimistic , " store was quoted as telling norwegian news agency ntb . major differences remain between the israelis and palestinians over core issues , such as the status of jerusalem , which both sides claim as their capital , the borders of a future palestinian state and the fate of palestinian refugees . hamas refuses concessions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush , who has 14 months left in office , has spent little time on the mideast conflict hamas leaders in the gaza strip have already announced they would not accept any concessions made by palestinians during the summit . " the negotiations nowadays are useless and holding the annapolis conference is a waste of time , " hamas leader ismail haniya told reporters on monday .
" our people will not commit themselves to any resolutions harming palestinian national principles . " haniya served as prime minister in a palestinian unity government until he was dismissed by president mahmoud abbas in june , following hamas ' violent takeover of the gaza strip .
hamas was not invited to take part in the peace talks . even after us president george w. bush said he was " personally committed " to ending the decades-long conflict with a two-state solution in the middle east , white house spokeswoman dana perino cautioned against expecting any " immediate results " from the conference . us national security advisor steve hadley also stressed that the conference was not itself a " negotiating forum , " but an " opportunity to move into a negotiating phase between palestinians and israelis .

consumer watchdog postwatch warned that an amnesty for cards without enough postage will not be repeated this year .
new sizing and pricing rules began in august 2006 , but were not enforced over last year 's festive season .
in the spirit of the holiday , customers should get the same deal this year , said andy frewin , postwatch 's director .
the price of postage " what we are hoping very much is that royal mail will apply the spirit of christmas rather than the letter of their rules and only ask for the surcharges when it is blatantly under-stamped , " he told bbc 's breakfast .
mr frewin said customers who receive a card with insufficient postage will be given a notice to that effect and will then have to go to the post office , queue for service and pay £ 1 plus the missing postage before they can collect their cards .
a spokesman for royal mail told the bbc that while there is no official deal to ignore the surcharges over the coming weeks , they will be applied using " common sense " over the holiday season .
in bringing in the changes last year the royal mail said 80 % of post should cost the same amount to send .
royal mail said the charges reflect the cost of sorting large letters , which has to be done manually instead of by machine .
postwatch has encouraged consumers to familiarise themselves with the revised pricing and sizing in order to avoid the extra fees and inconvenience .
the price of postage letter : 34p -lrb- 1st class -rrb- or 24p -lrb- 2nd class -rrb- .
max size - 240mm long , 165mm wide , 5mm thick ; max weight - 100g large letter : 48p to £ 1.42 -lrb- 1st class -rrb- ; 40p to £ 1.20 -lrb- 2nd -rrb- .

an investigation by unison found large variations in cleaning practices at ambulance trusts in the uk .
some areas do not have dedicated cleaning staff and ambulance crews are left to give the vehicles a " quick mop out " , the health union said .
the government said it expected trusts to follow national guidance on ambulance cleaning .
in many trusts , ambulance crews are responsible for cleaning their own vehicles and this is a waste of their time and training sam oestreicher unison ' we use mr muscle ' send us your experiences unison called for cleanliness standards to be properly applied and monitored across trusts to improve standards .
ambulance crews questioned by the union said targets , time and money were all to blame for different cleaning practices between trusts .
in the worst example , ambulance crews in the north west have no dedicated cleaning staff or cleaning time .
paramedics report that they do not get time to even check the vehicles , which are never deep cleaned .
the only precaution is that if staff know a patient is infected , for example with clostridium difficile , the ambulance will be mopped out .
gold standard at the other end of the scale london ambulance service has introduced on-site cleaners who work throughout the night to routinely deep clean the fleet .
they also restock ambulances with fresh kit , freeing up paramedics for seeing patients .
effectively , crews bring in a dirty vehicle and leave with a cleaned one , unison said .
in the south west , funding problems are causing delays to plans to employ staff to carry out deep cleaning , staff said .
and paramedics in wales agreed not enough was being done although the service is looking at a similar deep clean system to that used in london .
sam oestreicher , unison national officer for ambulance staff said : " the government recently announced extra money for deep cleaning hospitals , but ambulances seem to have been forgotten .
" they are part of the patient care package and no one should have to travel or work in a dirty ambulance .
he added : " in many trusts , ambulance crews are responsible for cleaning their own vehicles and this is a waste of their time and training .
" they should be out there saving lives not mopping out the back of a dirty ambulance . "
he said existing voluntary guidelines should become mandatory standards .
but stressed that extra funding would be needed if or resources would be cut elsewhere .
health minister ben bradshaw said : " we take healthcare associated infections and cleanliness seriously in all healthcare environments .
" the available evidence does not suggest that ambulances are a major source of infection , but tackling healthcare associated infections is an nhs-wide issue .
" the ambulance service association has issued guidance and we expect trusts to follow this .
" trusts should also take cleaning time into account when managing their supply of ambulances to attend emergency calls . "

an investigation by unison found large variations in cleaning practices at ambulance trusts in the uk .
some areas do not have dedicated cleaning staff and ambulance crews are left to give the vehicles a " quick mop out " , the health union said .
the government said it expected trusts to follow national guidance on ambulance cleaning .
in many trusts , ambulance crews are responsible for cleaning their own vehicles and this is a waste of their time and training sam oestreicher unison ' we use mr muscle ' send us your experiences unison called for cleanliness standards to be properly applied and monitored across trusts to improve standards .
ambulance crews questioned by the union said targets , time and money were all to blame for different cleaning practices between trusts .
in the worst example , ambulance crews in the north west have no dedicated cleaning staff or cleaning time .
paramedics report that they do not get time to even check the vehicles , which are never deep cleaned .
the only precaution is that if staff know a patient is infected , for example with clostridium difficile , the ambulance will be mopped out .
gold standard at the other end of the scale london ambulance service has introduced on-site cleaners who work throughout the night to routinely deep clean the fleet .
they also restock ambulances with fresh kit , freeing up paramedics for seeing patients .
effectively , crews bring in a dirty vehicle and leave with a cleaned one , unison said .
in the south west , funding problems are causing delays to plans to employ staff to carry out deep cleaning , staff said .
and paramedics in wales agreed not enough was being done although the service is looking at a similar deep clean system to that used in london .
sam oestreicher , unison national officer for ambulance staff said : " the government recently announced extra money for deep cleaning hospitals , but ambulances seem to have been forgotten .
" they are part of the patient care package and no one should have to travel or work in a dirty ambulance .
he added : " in many trusts , ambulance crews are responsible for cleaning their own vehicles and this is a waste of their time and training .
" they should be out there saving lives not mopping out the back of a dirty ambulance . "
he said existing voluntary guidelines should become mandatory standards .
but stressed that extra funding would be needed if or resources would be cut elsewhere .
health minister ben bradshaw said : " we take healthcare associated infections and cleanliness seriously in all healthcare environments .
" the available evidence does not suggest that ambulances are a major source of infection , but tackling healthcare associated infections is an nhs-wide issue .
" the ambulance service association has issued guidance and we expect trusts to follow this .
" trusts should also take cleaning time into account when managing their supply of ambulances to attend emergency calls . "

paramedics have told radio 5 live that they 're not being provided with proper equipment .
instead they are having to resort to household products like flash and mr muscle to clean their vehicles .
sometimes they even buy the cleaning materials themselves , and claim they 're given insufficient time and training to get the ambulances as clean as they should be .
one of the country 's leading experts in hospital infections , dr mark enright , said the claims were " extremely worrying " .
' laden with mrsa ' one paramedic from the north west of england , who does not want to be named , explained how time pressures make it hard for him to do his job .
" we 're doing a basic wipe over of the ambulance - we 're just wiping the sides , wiping the stretcher , and just doing our best with what we 've got , " he said .
" we could start the cleaning and we start taking stuff off and we get a call and we 've got to put it all back again and off we go . "

" it 's got to be laden with mrsa , because we 're not cleaning them properly , and that goes throughout the service , " he said .
" we use mr muscle to clean with .
i have no idea whether it kills mrsa .
all we 're doing is cleaning the ambulance and making it look cleaner and smell better . "
' an absolute disgrace ' another paramedic from the north west with over 20 years of experience on the job remembers that it used to be different when he started work .
" you used to get time set aside and you 'd strip the whole thing out and gut the whole vehicle .
now that just does not happen , " he said .
where he works , it 's so difficult to get hold of appropriate cleaning products that they sometimes resort to taking alcohol wipes from the casualty ward without permission .
" you try to clean it but with whatever limited resources you can find .
you 're looking at a sort of minging dirty old mop and washing up liquid .
" i do n't deem that appropriate for cleaning an ambulance in any way shape or form . "
his concern is on behalf of the patients he has to transport .
" seeing as we are the first port of call for many people going into casualty , the back of ambulances is an absolute disgrace , " he said .
" i would hate to think if a spot check were done what you 'd find if you did swabs on the back of an ambulance . "
' skanky mops ' another paramedic from the north east of england is also concerned for his patients .
" as a paramedic i would expect that the environment that i treat my patients in would be a place that that 's safe and free from infection .
" however i come regularly onto ambulances and find traces of blood , dirty floors , linen that has n't been changed . "
he agreed that the equipment available to keep his ambulance clean is n't up to much .
" there 's bleach , some wipes that we carry on the ambulance which are supposed to kill some germs but have not been proven to get rid of mrsa or c. difficile or many other bugs , there 's flash spray fluid and then there 's basically some very skanky mops , " he said .
" they are really quite filthy - they 're not replaced more than maybe every 8 to 12 months . "

" as a paramedic i would expect that the environment that i treat my patients in would be a place that that 's safe and free from infection .
" however i come regularly onto ambulances and find traces of blood , dirty floors , linen that has n't been changed . "
he agreed that the equipment available to keep his ambulance clean is n't up to much .
" there 's bleach , some wipes that we carry on the ambulance which are supposed to kill some germs but have not been proven to get rid of mrsa or c. difficile or many other bugs , there 's flash spray fluid and then there 's basically some very skanky mops , " he said .
" they are really quite filthy - they 're not replaced more than maybe every 8 to 12 months . "

rebuilding in pictures long march taking jobs have your say in the first of a series on china 's new relationship with africa , the bbc 's adam blenford looks at how their economic interests coincide .
the next piece looks at the chinese firms rebuilding the ethiopian capital , addis ababa .
in almost every corner of africa there is something that interests china .
the continent is rich in natural resources that promise to keep china 's booming , fuel-hungry economy on the road .
there is copper to mine in zambia , iron ore to extract in gabon and oil to refine in angola .
in other countries less blessed by natural resources , chinese companies have spied trading and investment opportunities .
see a map of china 's investment in africa africa 's need for new and better roads , school buildings , computer networks , telecoms systems and power generation has opened a lucrative window of opportunity for chinese firms .
the new sino-african dynamic can leave the west ill at ease , reviving memories of europe 's colonial domination in africa and drawing complaints that low chinese bids are freezing out western companies .
china never imposes its own will on african countries , nor interferes in the domestic affairs of african countries yang xiao gan chinese embassy , addis ababa have your say china also offers " no-strings " aid , a marked contrast to western donors who impose conditions on aid and tie trade sweeteners to human rights issues .
critics say china 's approach has emboldened unsavoury governments , allowing them to ignore western calls for reform , safe in the knowledge that beijing will take up the slack .
sudan , with its vast oil reserves , is the number one recipient of chinese investment , and sells some two-thirds of its oil to beijing .
as a result , china has been criticised for its links with a government ostracised by many for its role in the ongoing crisis in darfur .
elsewhere , stories of anti-chinese unrest in zambia and the killing of nine chinese oil workers by rebels in ethiopia 's ogaden region have focused beijing 's attention on the price it might have to pay for its african adventure .
beyond the stereotype the chinese insist they are not interested in dominating africa .
instead china says it seeks a " harmonious world " , an evolution of its cold war search for " peaceful co-existence " , and it wants to coax african countries along the path towards development .
instead of top-down aid projects , chinese companies seek profits in africa as they bequeath the continent a new infrastructure - one that will more than likely be used to increase trade with china .
" china consistently respects and supports african countries , " yan xiao gang , china 's economic attache in ethiopia , told the bbc .
" it never imposes its own will on african countries , nor interferes in the domestic affairs of african countries . "
ethiopian officials speak of " owning " their country 's development , but do admit that major contracts usually go to chinese firms because of their ability to keep costs down .
many chinese firms employ large numbers of local workers but wages remain low .
however , there is evidence that workers are learning new skills because of the availability of chinese-funded work .
taking advantage of low labour costs , the chinese are also building factories across africa .
observers say beijing appears ready for the long haul in africa .
" for china to become a major power , it needs to continue its double-digit economic growth of recent years .
for this it needs energy and markets , " prof m venkataraman of the university of addis ababa told the bbc .
those markets are proving receptive , and trade with the continent is famously booming - up to $ 40bn in 2004 , a tenfold increase in under a decade .
yet most african countries now have a growing trade deficit with china , in spite of favourable tax-free trading agreements .
ethiopian exports to china reached $ 132m -lrb- £ 63m -rrb- in 2006 , a figure dwarfed by the value of chinese imports of $ 432m -lrb- £ 206m -rrb- .
" it is not clear what the long-term effect of the chinese projects will be , " said mr venkataraman .
" but the facts are very clear - there are going to be benefits to both sides .
china is going to remain in this continent for a very long time . "
potent symbols the china-africa relationship shot to attention in november 2006 when 48 african heads of government attended a forum in beijing .
china 's capital was festooned with images of exotic africa for the occasion .
speeches were made and deals were struck .
see china 's $ 150m gift to the african union enlarge image tsegab kebebew , a senior official in ethiopia 's foreign ministry , was in beijing for the meeting .
one year on , he remains enthused about the relationship .
" this is a new strategic partnership .
there is no colonial history between africa and china , so they are well received here , " he told the bbc .
" there is no psychological bias against the chinese . "
in fact china has a history of involvement in africa , and undertook major aid projects in the 1960s and 1970s .
among beijing 's gifts was a railroad linking zambia and tanzania , now scheduled to be rebuilt by a chinese company .
china 's gifts to modern-day africa will soon include a gleaming new conference centre at the headquarters of the african union in addis ababa - a symbol of beijing 's commitment to african development , says mr yan of the chinese embassy .
there is symbolism in the shops , too .
with ethiopia only now marking the turn of its millennium , seven years after the rest of the world , the country is in the grip of a 12-month millennium frenzy .
banners adorn public buildings and souvenirs are on sale in many shops .
the government hopes the outbreak of national pride will spur ethiopia to a new age of prosperity .
those browsing a local market for , say , a souvenir plate bearing the legend " ethiopian millennium 2000 " would do well to turn the gift over and look underneath .
embossed on the white plastic is a phrase already familiar to all in the west : " made in china " .

in the first of a series on china 's new relationship with africa , the bbc 's adam blenford looks at how their economic interests coincide .
the next piece looks at the chinese firms rebuilding the ethiopian capital , addis ababa .
in almost every corner of africa there is something that interests china .
the continent is rich in natural resources that promise to keep china 's booming , fuel-hungry economy on the road .
there is copper to mine in zambia , iron ore to extract in gabon and oil to refine in angola .
in other countries less blessed by natural resources , chinese companies have spied trading and investment opportunities .
see a map of china 's investment in africa africa 's need for new and better roads , school buildings , computer networks , telecoms systems and power generation has opened a lucrative window of opportunity for chinese firms .
the new sino-african dynamic can leave the west ill at ease , reviving memories of europe 's colonial domination in africa and drawing complaints that low chinese bids are freezing out western companies . "
china never imposes its own will on african countries , nor interferes in the domestic affairs of african countries " yang xiao gan chinese embassy , addis ababa have your say china also offers " no-strings " aid , a marked contrast to western donors who impose conditions on aid and tie trade sweeteners to human rights issues .
critics say china 's approach has emboldened unsavoury governments , allowing them to ignore western calls for reform , safe in the knowledge that beijing will take up the slack .
sudan , with its vast oil reserves , is the number one recipient of chinese investment , and sells some two-thirds of its oil to beijing .
as a result , china has been criticised for its links with a government ostracised by many for its role in the ongoing crisis in darfur .
elsewhere , stories of anti-chinese unrest in zambia and the killing of nine chinese oil workers by rebels in ethiopia 's ogaden region have focused beijing 's attention on the price it might have to pay for its african adventure .
beyond the stereotype the chinese insist they are not interested in dominating africa .
instead china says it seeks a " harmonious world " , an evolution of its cold war search for " peaceful co-existence " , and it wants to coax african countries along the path towards development .
instead of top-down aid projects , chinese companies seek profits in africa as they bequeath the continent a new infrastructure - one that will more than likely be used to increase trade with china .
" china consistently respects and supports african countries , " yan xiao gang , china 's economic attache in ethiopia , told the bbc .
" it never imposes its own will on african countries , nor interferes in the domestic affairs of african countries . "
ethiopian officials speak of " owning " their country 's development , but do admit that major contracts usually go to chinese firms because of their ability to keep costs down .
many chinese firms employ large numbers of local workers but wages remain low .
however , there is evidence that workers are learning new skills because of the availability of chinese-funded work .
taking advantage of low labour costs , the chinese are also building factories across africa .
observers say beijing appears ready for the long haul in africa .
" for china to become a major power , it needs to continue its double-digit economic growth of recent years .
for this it needs energy and markets , " prof m venkataraman of the university of addis ababa told the bbc .
those markets are proving receptive , and trade with the continent is famously booming - up to $ 40bn in 2004 , a tenfold increase in under a decade .
yet most african countries now have a growing trade deficit with china , in spite of favourable tax-free trading agreements .
ethiopian exports to china reached $ 132m -lrb- £ 63m -rrb- in 2006 , a figure dwarfed by the value of chinese imports of $ 432m -lrb- £ 206m -rrb- .
" it is not clear what the long-term effect of the chinese projects will be , " said mr venkataraman .
" but the facts are very clear - there are going to be benefits to both sides .
china is going to remain in this continent for a very long time . "
potent symbols the china-africa relationship shot to attention in november 2006 when 48 african heads of government attended a forum in beijing .
china 's capital was festooned with images of exotic africa for the occasion .
speeches were made and deals were struck .
tsegab kebebew , a senior official in ethiopia 's foreign ministry , was in beijing for the meeting .
one year on , he remains enthused about the relationship .
" this is a new strategic partnership .
there is no colonial history between africa and china , so they are well received here , " he told the bbc .
" there is no psychological bias against the chinese . "
in fact china has a history of involvement in africa , and undertook major aid projects in the 1960s and 1970s .
among beijing 's gifts was a railroad linking zambia and tanzania , now scheduled to be rebuilt by a chinese company .
china 's gifts to modern-day africa will soon include a gleaming new conference centre at the headquarters of the african union in addis ababa - a symbol of beijing 's commitment to african development , says mr yan of the chinese embassy .
there is symbolism in the shops , too .
with ethiopia only now marking the turn of its millennium , seven years after the rest of the world , the country is in the grip of a 12-month millennium frenzy .
banners adorn public buildings and souvenirs are on sale in many shops .
the government hopes the outbreak of national pride will spur ethiopia to a new age of prosperity .
those browsing a local market for , say , a souvenir plate bearing the legend " ethiopian millennium 2000 " would do well to turn the gift over and look underneath .
embossed on the white plastic is a phrase already familiar to all in the west : " made in china " .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- moneybox -pipe- warning over ' bullying ' lenders bbc news / moneybox graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- monday , 26 november 2007 , 08:43 gmt warning over ' bullying ' lenders by bob howard bbc radio 4 's money box borrowers should n't be bullied into repaying mortgage arrears too quickly , says a senior judge .
judge michael tennant , president of the association of district judges , says lenders often unreasonably demand repayment within a year .
but people going to court can win permission to repay over a much longer period of time .
the council of mortgage lenders says sometimes borrowers overestimate how much and how quickly they can repay .
coercion " very often debtors will reach agreements with the lender which are hopelessly unrealistic " judge tennant once someone is more than two months behind with their payments , the lender can apply for a court hearing .
there , a judge decides how much it 's reasonable for them to pay each month to clear their arrears .
judge tennant told radio 4 's money box programme borrowers should not be coerced by lenders before going to court : " it 's important for debtors to realise that in negotiating with lenders there is no reason for them to feel bullied into agreeing an unrealistic repayment schedule .
" very often debtors will reach agreements with the lender which are hopelessly unrealistic just in order to make the problem go away . "
many lenders want arrears repaid within the year , but the court can order payments to be spread across the remaining lifetime of the mortgage .
this substantially reduces the monthly payments which borrowers facing financial difficulty have to make . "
it 's neither in the lender 's interests nor in the customers for any arrangement to fail . "
michael coogan , council of mortgage lenders judge tennant fears that some customers are borrowing more money to pay off their arrears and this is placing them ever deeper into debt .
peter tutton , a policy adviser for citizens advice agrees that pressure from lenders is pushing people into ill advised re-mortgage deals : " we see people who sort of cycle down remortgage after remortgage .
if lenders are in a position to help people see what they can afford and they do n't do that , it drives people to much worse options . "
blame the council of mortgage lenders , which represents the main mortgage lenders , says generally it does n't think its members are being unreasonable in how they ask for the repayment of arrears .
michael coogan , the cml 's director general , says customers themselves are sometimes to blame : " it 's neither in the lender 's interests nor in the customers for any arrangement to fail , " he said .
" i think the question is whose bullying whom , whether customers are being over optimistic about how much they can afford to try and placate the lender . "
the issue is likely to grow , with cml figures predicting that the number of homes actually repossessed by lenders is set to rise by 50 % next year , from 30,000 to 45,000 .
judge tennant says if customers are also in arrears with loans which are not secured on their property , like most loans for cars or items of furniture , they must pay their mortgages first , or risk losing their home .

judge michael tennant , president of the association of district judges , says lenders often unreasonably demand repayment within a year .
but people going to court can win permission to repay over a much longer period of time .
the council of mortgage lenders says sometimes borrowers overestimate how much and how quickly they can repay .
coercion very often debtors will reach agreements with the lender which are hopelessly unrealistic judge tennant once someone is more than two months behind with their payments , the lender can apply for a court hearing .
there , a judge decides how much it 's reasonable for them to pay each month to clear their arrears .
judge tennant told radio 4 's money box programme borrowers should not be coerced by lenders before going to court : " it 's important for debtors to realise that in negotiating with lenders there is no reason for them to feel bullied into agreeing an unrealistic repayment schedule .
" very often debtors will reach agreements with the lender which are hopelessly unrealistic just in order to make the problem go away . "
many lenders want arrears repaid within the year , but the court can order payments to be spread across the remaining lifetime of the mortgage .
this substantially reduces the monthly payments which borrowers facing financial difficulty have to make .
it 's neither in the lender 's interests nor in the customers for any arrangement to fail .
michael coogan , council of mortgage lenders judge tennant fears that some customers are borrowing more money to pay off their arrears and this is placing them ever deeper into debt .
peter tutton , a policy adviser for citizens advice agrees that pressure from lenders is pushing people into ill advised re-mortgage deals : " we see people who sort of cycle down remortgage after remortgage .
if lenders are in a position to help people see what they can afford and they do n't do that , it drives people to much worse options . "
blame the council of mortgage lenders , which represents the main mortgage lenders , says generally it does n't think its members are being unreasonable in how they ask for the repayment of arrears .
michael coogan , the cml 's director general , says customers themselves are sometimes to blame : " it 's neither in the lender 's interests nor in the customers for any arrangement to fail , " he said .
" i think the question is whose bullying whom , whether customers are being over optimistic about how much they can afford to try and placate the lender . "
the issue is likely to grow , with cml figures predicting that the number of homes actually repossessed by lenders is set to rise by 50 % next year , from 30,000 to 45,000 .
judge tennant says if customers are also in arrears with loans which are not secured on their property , like most loans for cars or items of furniture , they must pay their mortgages first , or risk losing their home .

both the chancellor and the prime minister told mps the banks would repay customers who lost money .
but in a letter the banks have told the chancellor that he should reimburse them for the cost .
so far the treasury has yet to respond to the banks .
the letter is signed by the british bankers ' association , the building societies association and the payment service apacs which is responsible for security of money transfers .
refund it warns the chancellor that they will refund their customers initially but , if there is widespread theft due to the blunder by the revenue , the banks will look to the government for recompense .
speaking on radio 4 's money box programme sandra quinn of apacs said : " under the banking code we protect customers .
and customers need to know that they have one point of contact if they 're concerned and that is their bank or building society .
" but there is a separate issue about long-term liability .
and if there is evidence that the loss of this data does lead to widespread fraud we will want to pick this up with the chancellor and the revenue .
they wo n't be surprised by that . "
sandra quinn also told the programme that apacs and the banks did not hear about the data loss until friday 16 november , more than four weeks after the disc was sent and more than three weeks after a senior revenue official became aware of the loss .
" we 'd have liked to have known earlier because the earlier we knew the sooner we could take steps , " she said .
no guarantee and , despite assurances by the chancellor that all the 7.3 million bank accounts affected would be " flagged " so they could be monitored for " irregular activity " , sandra quinn said that could not be guaranteed .
" obviously this is a massive issue we ca n't guarantee that every account will be flagged .
but there is no evidence that this data is in criminal hands . "
she said every bank and building society had been told which of their accounts was affected and would sample accounts to monitor activity for any signs of fraud .
but she added that individuals should also check their bank statements carefully themselves .

tackling " inefficient " business practices had also helped it improve its performance , it added .
the firm unveiled a 50 % rise in profits to £ 199.7m in the six months to the end of september .
thames water was criticised by the regulator ofwat last year for its poor leakage record .
but the company said that in the last year it had lost an average of 695 million litres per day -lrb- mld -rrb- - about 120 mld less than a year earlier .
thames added it had laid 266km of new water mains since april 2007 , putting it well ahead of its target .
and it said that greater efficiency had cut operating costs by £ 50m , or 9.7 % over the six months .
chief executive david owens said that the firm had " huge strides to address the issues which really matter to our customers and stakeholders " .
" the legacy of high operating costs and inefficient working practices has now been put behind us , " he said .
as well as providing drinking water to 8.5 million customers in london and the south east , the company also manages waste water for about 13.5 million customers .

tackling " inefficient " business practices had also helped it improve its performance , it added .
the firm unveiled a 50 % rise in profits to £ 199.7m in the six months to the end of september .
thames water was criticised by the regulator ofwat last year for its poor leakage record .
but the company said that in the last year it had lost an average of 695 million litres per day -lrb- mld -rrb- - about 120 mld less than a year earlier .
thames added it had laid 266km of new water mains since april 2007 , putting it well ahead of its target .
and it said that greater efficiency had cut operating costs by £ 50m , or 9.7 % over the six months .
chief executive david owens said that the firm had " huge strides to address the issues which really matter to our customers and stakeholders " .
" the legacy of high operating costs and inefficient working practices has now been put behind us , " he said .
as well as providing drinking water to 8.5 million customers in london and the south east , the company also manages waste water for about 13.5 million customers .

some of these have been successful , including those between egypt and israel and israel and jordan , but a settlement has still not been reached in the core conflict , the dispute between the israelis and palestinians .
the bbc news website 's paul reynolds looks at the main peace proposals since 1967 and what happened to them .
scr 242 , 1967 camp david , 1978 madrid conference 1991 israeli-syrian talks oslo agreement , 1993 camp david , 2000 taba , 2001 saudi plan , 2002 road map , 2003 geneva accord , 2003 security council resolution 242 , 1967 this was passed on 22 november 1967 and embodies the principle that has guided most of the subsequent peace plans - the exchange of land for peace .
the resolution called for the " withdrawal of israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict " , and " respect for and acknowledgement of the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of every state in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force " .
the resolution is famous for the imprecision , in english , of its central phase concerning an israeli withdrawal - it says simply " from territories " .
obstacles to peace history of negotiations jerusalem water refugees borders and settlements the israelis said this did not necessarily mean all territories , but arab negotiators argued that it did .
it was written under chapter vi of the un charter , under which security council resolutions are recommendations , not under chapter vii , which means they are orders .
many peace proposals refer to 242 .
resolution 338 is usually linked to it .
this called for a ceasefire in the war of october 1973 and urged the implementation of 242 " in all its parts " .
text of un security council resolution 242 text of un security council resolution 338 return to top camp david accords , 1978 there were several peace plans following the 1967 war , including one by yigal allon , an israeli general who proposed that israel give back to jordan the highlands of the west bank while retaining a defensive line along the jordan valley .
however , nothing happened until after the war in october 1973 , during which egyptian forces crossed the suez canal .
there followed a new mood for peace , at least between israel and egypt , as was shown by a historic visit to jerusalem by the egyptian president anwar sadat in november 1977 .
us president jimmy carter capitalised on the new mood and invited president sadat and the israeli prime minister menachem begin for talks at the presidential retreat at camp david near washington .
the talks lasted for 12 days and resulted in two agreements .
the first was called a framework for peace in the middle east .
it laid down principles for peace , expanding on resolution 242 , set out what it hoped was a way of resolving what it called the " palestinian problem " , agreed that there should be a treaty between egypt and israel and called for other treaties between israel and its neighbours .
the weakness of the first agreement was the section on the palestinians .
the plan aimed to set up a " self-governing authority " in the west bank and gaza , leading to eventual " final status " talks , but the palestinians were not party to the agreement .
the second accord was the framework for the peace treaty between egypt and israel .
this followed in 1979 , after an israeli withdrawal from the sinai .
this was the first recognition of israel as a state by a major arab country .
they probably stand as the most successful negotiations in the whole peace process .
the treaty has lasted , and it substantially strengthened israel 's position .
however the peace between egypt and israel has not been warm .
president sadat was himself later assassinated .
text of camp david agreement return to top the madrid conference , 1991 this conference , co-sponsored by the us and the soviet union , was designed to follow up the egypt-israel treaty by encouraging other arab countries to sign their own agreements with israel .
jordan , lebanon and syria were invited as well as israel and egypt .
the palestinians were also represented , but as part of a joint delegation with jordan and not by yasser arafat or other leading figures in the palestine liberation organisation -lrb- plo -rrb- , to whom the israelis objected .
the conference eventually led to a peace treaty between israel and jordan in 1994 , but this probably would have happened anyway .
the symbolism of arab countries other than egypt openly negotiating with israel was probably the main achievement of the madrid conference .
the palestinian track soon gave way to secret talks that led to the oslo agreement .
return to top israeli-syrian talks after the madrid conference in 1991 , direct talks began between israel and syria .
syria 's main demand was for a full israeli withdrawal from the golan heights , the plateau overlooking the sea of galilee that israel had captured in 1967 .
israel responded that it was prepared to negotiate a withdrawal but the extent and timing of that withdrawal depended on syria agreeing to a peace treaty and to an extended period of normalisation of relations first .
any agreement would also have to be accepted in a referendum in israel .
syria claims that in talks in 1995 , the then israeli prime minister yitzhak rabin agreed to a total pullback .
however , the israelis say this was only a theoretical acceptance and that it depended on the full normalisation of relations , a condition that syria , it claims , did not accept .
an unofficial agreement between israeli and syrian private citizens was reported to have been reached in 2006 but this has not led to talks between the two governments .
israeli talks with lebanon took place after madrid but have stalled , complicated by border disputes and , more recently , last year 's war between israel and hezbollah .
any israeli treaty with lebanon is expected to have to wait until after one with syria , given syria 's influence in lebanon .
return to top oslo agreement , 1993 the oslo negotiations tried to tackle the missing element of all previous talks - a direct agreement between israelis and palestinians , represented by the plo .
its importance was that there was finally mutual recognition between israel and the plo .
the talks took place in secret under norwegian auspices and the agreement was signed on the white house lawn on 13 september 1993 , witnessed by president bill clinton .
white house handshake on this day the plo leader yasser arafat and the israeli prime minister yitzhak rabin shook hands .
the agreement was that israeli troops would withdraw in stages from the west bank and gaza , that a " palestinian interim self-governing authority " would be set up for a five-year transitional period , leading to a permanent settlement based on resolutions 242 and 338 .
the agreement spoke of putting " an end to decades of confrontation and conflict " and of each side recognising " their mutual legitimate and political rights " .
therefore , though not stated explicitly in the text , the implication was that a state of palestine would one day be set up alongside israel .
there was an exchange of letters in which yasser arafat stated : " the plo recognises the right of the state of israel to exist in peace and security . "
yitzhak rabin said : " the government of israel has decided to recognise the plo as the representative of the palestinian people . "
hamas and other palestinian rejectionist groups did not accept oslo and launched suicide bomb attacks on israelis .
there was opposition within israel from settler-led groups .
oslo was only partially implemented .
text : oslo declaration of principles return to top camp david , 2000 various attempts were made -lrb- including at taba in 1995 , the wye river in 1998 and sharm el-sheikh in 1999 -rrb- to speed up the withdrawal and self-government provisions of oslo .
then in 2000 , president bill clinton sought to address the final status issues - including borders , jerusalem and refugees - that oslo had left on one side for later negotiation .
the talks took place in july between israeli prime minister ehud barak and plo chairman yasser arafat .
there was no agreement .
however , the negotiations were more detailed than ever before .
the basic problem was that the maximum israel offered was less than the minimum the palestinians could accept .
israel offered the gaza strip , a large part of the west bank , plus extra land from the negev desert , while keeping major settlement blocks and most of east jerusalem .
it proposed islamic guardianship of key sites in the old city of jerusalem and contributions to a fund for palestinian refugees .
the palestinians wanted to start with a reversion to the lines of 1967 , offered the israelis rights over the jewish quarter of the old city and wanted recognition of the " right of return " of palestinian refugees .
the failure at camp david was followed by a renewal of the palestinian uprising or intifada .
text of joint statement on camp david peace talks , july 25 , 2000 return to top taba , 2001 although he was about to leave office , bill clinton refused to give up and he presented a " bridging proposal " which set up further talks in washington and cairo and then taba in egypt .
these talks were not at the top level , but differences were narrowed without being overcome .
there was more flexibility on territory and it was reported by eu observers that israeli negotiators accepted the concept of east jerusalem being the capital of a palestinian state .
a statement afterwards said that " it proved impossible to reach understandings on all issues " .
the israeli prime minister ehud barak , fighting an election campaign , said that " nothing is agreed upon until everything is agreed upon " and said that he could not commit a subsequent government to what he called the " ideas " coming out of the talks .
with the election of ariel sharon in february 2001 , time ran out .
text of eu paper on taba talks return to top saudi peace plan , 2002 after the failure of bilateral talks and the resumption of conflict , the saudi peace plan presented at an arab summit in beirut in march 2002 went back to a multilateral approach and in particular signalled a desire by the arab world as a whole to put an end to this dispute .
under the plan , israel would withdraw to the lines of june 1967 , a palestinian state would be set up in the west bank and gaza and there would be a " just solution " of the refugee issue .
in return , arab countries would recognise israel .
the plan was re-endorsed by another arab summit in riyadh in 2007 .
its strength is the support given by arab countries to a two-state solution .
its weakness is that the parties have to negotiate the same issues on which they have failed so far .
text of saudi initiative / beirut declaration return to top road map , 2003 the road map is a plan drawn up by the " quartet " - the united states , russia , the european union and the united nations .
it does not lay down the details of a final settlement , but suggests how a settlement might be approached .
it followed efforts made by us senator george mitchell to get the peace process back on track in 2001 .
the plan was preceded by an important statement in june 2002 by president george w bush who became the first us president to call for a palestinian state .
the road map tries to lay down conditions for its achievement .
it proposed a phased timetable , putting the establishment of security before a final settlement .
it is designed to create confidence , leading to final status talks .
phase 1 : both sides would issue statements supporting the two-state solution , the palestinians would end violence , act against " all those engaged in terror " , draw up a constitution , hold elections and the israelis would stop settlement activities and act with military restraint phase two : would see the creation , at an international conference , of a palestinian state with " provisional borders " phase 3 : final agreement talks .
the road map has not been implemented .
its timetable called for the final agreement to be reached in 2005 .
it has been overtaken by events .
road map text return to top geneva accord , 2003 while official efforts foundered , an informal agreement was announced in december 2003 by israeli and palestinian figures - yossi beilin , one of the architects of oslo , on the israeli side , and former palestinian information minister yasser abed rabbo on the other .
it reverses the concept of the road map , in which the growth of security and confidence precede a political agreement and puts the agreement first , which is then designed to produce security and peace .
its main compromise is that the palestinians effectively give up their " right of return " in exchange for almost the whole of the west bank , though there could be a token return by a few .
israel would give up some major settlements such as ariel , but keep others closer to the border , with swaps of land in israel for any taken in the west bank .
palestinians would have the right to have their capital in east jerusalem , though with israeli sovereignty over the western wall in the old city .
the geneva agreement has no official status .
another unofficial agreeemnt was one drawn up by a former head of the israeli shin bet internal security service ami ayalon and a former plo representative in jerusalem sari nusseibeh .
this envisaged a return to the 1967 lines , an open city of jerusalem and an end to the palestinian claim to a right of return to former homes .

under carter , the us oversaw the first arab-israeli peace treaty some of these have been successful , including those between egypt and israel and israel and jordan , but a settlement has still not been reached in the core conflict , the dispute between the israelis and palestinians .
the bbc news website 's paul reynolds looks at the main peace proposals since 1967 and what happened to them .
scr 242 , 1967 camp david , 1978 madrid conference 1991 israeli-syrian talks oslo agreement , 1993 camp david , 2000 taba , 2001 saudi plan , 2002 road map , 2003 geneva accord , 2003 security council resolution 242 , 1967 this was passed on 22 november 1967 and embodies the principle that has guided most of the subsequent peace plans - the exchange of land for peace .
the resolution called for the " withdrawal of israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict " , and " respect for and acknowledgement of the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of every state in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force " .
the resolution is famous for the imprecision , in english , of its central phase concerning an israeli withdrawal - it says simply " from territories " .
obstacles to peace history of negotiations jerusalem water refugees borders and settlements the israelis said this did not necessarily mean all territories , but arab negotiators argued that it did .
it was written under chapter vi of the un charter , under which security council resolutions are recommendations , not under chapter vii , which means they are orders .
many peace proposals refer to 242 .
resolution 338 is usually linked to it .
this called for a ceasefire in the war of october 1973 and urged the implementation of 242 " in all its parts " .
text of un security council resolution 242 text of un security council resolution 338 return to top camp david accords , 1978 there were several peace plans following the 1967 war , including one by yigal allon , an israeli general who proposed that israel give back to jordan the highlands of the west bank while retaining a defensive line along the jordan valley .
however , nothing happened until after the war in october 1973 , during which egyptian forces crossed the suez canal .
there followed a new mood for peace , at least between israel and egypt , as was shown by a historic visit to jerusalem by the egyptian president anwar sadat in november 1977 .
us president jimmy carter capitalised on the new mood and invited president sadat and the israeli prime minister menachem begin for talks at the presidential retreat at camp david near washington .
the talks lasted for 12 days and resulted in two agreements .
the first was called a framework for peace in the middle east .
it laid down principles for peace , expanding on resolution 242 , set out what it hoped was a way of resolving what it called the " palestinian problem " , agreed that there should be a treaty between egypt and israel and called for other treaties between israel and its neighbours .
the weakness of the first agreement was the section on the palestinians .
the plan aimed to set up a " self-governing authority " in the west bank and gaza , leading to eventual " final status " talks , but the palestinians were not party to the agreement .
the second accord was the framework for the peace treaty between egypt and israel .
this followed in 1979 , after an israeli withdrawal from the sinai .
this was the first recognition of israel as a state by a major arab country .
they probably stand as the most successful negotiations in the whole peace process .
the treaty has lasted , and it substantially strengthened israel 's position .
however the peace between egypt and israel has not been warm .
president sadat was himself later assassinated .
text of camp david agreement return to top the madrid conference , 1991 the madrid conference built on israel 's treaty with egypt this conference , co-sponsored by the us and the soviet union , was designed to follow up the egypt-israel treaty by encouraging other arab countries to sign their own agreements with israel .
jordan , lebanon and syria were invited as well as israel and egypt .
the palestinians were also represented , but as part of a joint delegation with jordan and not by yasser arafat or other leading figures in the palestine liberation organisation -lrb- plo -rrb- , to whom the israelis objected .
the conference eventually led to a peace treaty between israel and jordan in 1994 , but this probably would have happened anyway .
the symbolism of arab countries other than egypt openly negotiating with israel was probably the main achievement of the madrid conference .
the palestinian track soon gave way to secret talks that led to the oslo agreement .
return to top israeli-syrian talks after the madrid conference in 1991 , direct talks began between israel and syria .
syria 's main demand was for a full israeli withdrawal from the golan heights , the plateau overlooking the sea of galilee that israel had captured in 1967 .
israel responded that it was prepared to negotiate a withdrawal but the extent and timing of that withdrawal depended on syria agreeing to a peace treaty and to an extended period of normalisation of relations first .
any agreement would also have to be accepted in a referendum in israel .
syria claims that in talks in 1995 , the then israeli prime minister yitzhak rabin agreed to a total pullback .
however , the israelis say this was only a theoretical acceptance and that it depended on the full normalisation of relations , a condition that syria , it claims , did not accept .
an unofficial agreement between israeli and syrian private citizens was reported to have been reached in 2006 but this has not led to talks between the two governments .
israeli talks with lebanon took place after madrid but have stalled , complicated by border disputes and , more recently , last year 's war between israel and hezbollah .
any israeli treaty with lebanon is expected to have to wait until after one with syria , given syria 's influence in lebanon .
return to top oslo agreement , 1993 the oslo negotiations tried to tackle the missing element of all previous talks - a direct agreement between israelis and palestinians , represented by the plo .
its importance was that there was finally mutual recognition between israel and the plo .
the talks took place in secret under norwegian auspices and the agreement was signed on the white house lawn on 13 september 1993 , witnessed by president bill clinton .
white house handshake on this day the plo leader yasser arafat and the israeli prime minister yitzhak rabin shook hands .
the agreement was that israeli troops would withdraw in stages from the west bank and gaza , that a " palestinian interim self-governing authority " would be set up for a five-year transitional period , leading to a permanent settlement based on resolutions 242 and 338 .
the agreement spoke of putting " an end to decades of confrontation and conflict " and of each side recognising " their mutual legitimate and political rights " .
therefore , though not stated explicitly in the text , the implication was that a state of palestine would one day be set up alongside israel .
there was an exchange of letters in which yasser arafat stated : " the plo recognises the right of the state of israel to exist in peace and security . "
yitzhak rabin said : " the government of israel has decided to recognise the plo as the representative of the palestinian people . "
hamas and other palestinian rejectionist groups did not accept oslo and launched suicide bomb attacks on israelis .
there was opposition within israel from settler-led groups .
oslo was only partially implemented .
text : oslo declaration of principles return to top camp david , 2000 various attempts were made -lrb- including at taba in 1995 , the wye river in 1998 and sharm el-sheikh in 1999 -rrb- to speed up the withdrawal and self-government provisions of oslo .
then in 2000 , president bill clinton sought to address the final status issues - including borders , jerusalem and refugees - that oslo had left on one side for later negotiation .
the talks took place in july between israeli prime minister ehud barak and plo chairman yasser arafat .
at camp david in 2000 , barak and arafat failed to agree there was no agreement .
however , the negotiations were more detailed than ever before .
the basic problem was that the maximum israel offered was less than the minimum the palestinians could accept .
israel offered the gaza strip , a large part of the west bank , plus extra land from the negev desert , while keeping major settlement blocks and most of east jerusalem .
it proposed islamic guardianship of key sites in the old city of jerusalem and contributions to a fund for palestinian refugees .
the palestinians wanted to start with a reversion to the lines of 1967 , offered the israelis rights over the jewish quarter of the old city and wanted recognition of the " right of return " of palestinian refugees .
the failure at camp david was followed by a renewal of the palestinian uprising or intifada .
text of joint statement on camp david peace talks , july 25 , 2000 return to top taba , 2001 although he was about to leave office , bill clinton refused to give up and he presented a " bridging proposal " which set up further talks in washington and cairo and then taba in egypt .
these talks were not at the top level , but differences were narrowed without being overcome .
there was more flexibility on territory and it was reported by eu observers that israeli negotiators accepted the concept of east jerusalem being the capital of a palestinian state .
a statement afterwards said that " it proved impossible to reach understandings on all issues " .
the israeli prime minister ehud barak , fighting an election campaign , said that " nothing is agreed upon until everything is agreed upon " and said that he could not commit a subsequent government to what he called the " ideas " coming out of the talks .
with the election of ariel sharon in february 2001 , time ran out .
text of eu paper on taba talks return to top saudi peace plan , 2002 after the failure of bilateral talks and the resumption of conflict , the saudi peace plan presented at an arab summit in beirut in march 2002 went back to a multilateral approach and in particular signalled a desire by the arab world as a whole to put an end to this dispute .
under the plan , israel would withdraw to the lines of june 1967 , a palestinian state would be set up in the west bank and gaza and there would be a " just solution " of the refugee issue .
in return , arab countries would recognise israel .
the plan was re-endorsed by another arab summit in riyadh in 2007 .
its strength is the support given by arab countries to a two-state solution .
its weakness is that the parties have to negotiate the same issues on which they have failed so far .
text of saudi initiative / beirut declaration return to top road map , 2003 the road map is a plan drawn up by the " quartet " - the united states , russia , the european union and the united nations .
it does not lay down the details of a final settlement , but suggests how a settlement might be approached .
it followed efforts made by us senator george mitchell to get the peace process back on track in 2001 .
the plan was preceded by an important statement in june 2002 by president george w bush who became the first us president to call for a palestinian state .
the road map tries to lay down conditions for its achievement .
it proposed a phased timetable , putting the establishment of security before a final settlement .
it is designed to create confidence , leading to final status talks .
phase 1 : both sides would issue statements supporting the two-state solution , the palestinians would end violence , act against " all those engaged in terror " , draw up a constitution , hold elections and the israelis would stop settlement activities and act with military restraint phase two : would see the creation , at an international conference , of a palestinian state with " provisional borders " phase 3 : final agreement talks .
the road map has not been implemented .
its timetable called for the final agreement to be reached in 2005 .
it has been overtaken by events .
road map text return to top geneva accord , 2003 while official efforts foundered , an informal agreement was announced in december 2003 by israeli and palestinian figures - yossi beilin , one of the architects of oslo , on the israeli side , and former palestinian information minister yasser abed rabbo on the other .
it reverses the concept of the road map , in which the growth of security and confidence precede a political agreement and puts the agreement first , which is then designed to produce security and peace .
its main compromise is that the palestinians effectively give up their " right of return " in exchange for almost the whole of the west bank , though there could be a token return by a few .
israel would give up some major settlements such as ariel , but keep others closer to the border , with swaps of land in israel for any taken in the west bank .
palestinians would have the right to have their capital in east jerusalem , though with israeli sovereignty over the western wall in the old city .
the geneva agreement has no official status .
another unofficial agreeemnt was one drawn up by a former head of the israeli shin bet internal security service ami ayalon and a former plo representative in jerusalem sari nusseibeh .
this envisaged a return to the 1967 lines , an open city of jerusalem and an end to the palestinian claim to a right of return to former homes .
