no widespread mistreatment of recruits was found . the german parliament 's military commissioner reinhold robbe released his annual report tuesday about the shortcomings of the german armed forces .
at the top of the list , robbe said the bundeswehr is underfinanced . the lack of money causes problems for soldiers in several ways , the report said .
robbe decried the decaying condition of many of the military barracks .
some are filled with mold and ready to collapse , with disgusting bathrooms . he also pointed out that soldiers are worried about their personal financial situations and remain at the bottom of their income groups . foreign missions causing financial strain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some military barracks are in bad condition the military 's financial strain needs to be taken into account before the government agrees to new deployments , robbe said .
there are some fears that germany 's army of 245,000 is overstretched , although only a relatively small percentage are engaged in foreign peacekeeping missions .
there are currently 9,000 soldiers on foreign missions in places like afghanistan , lebanon and the balkans . " in every single case it needs to be tested whether the bundeswehr is overburdened or overextended , " he said . robbe , a social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentarian , is the designated defense commissioner for the german parliament .
his role is to provide the government with an annual report about problems with the military .
he also warns politicians about any problems in the military and to be an outside point of contact for soldiers . mistreatment not widespread bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recruits not mishandled , report says the german army has dealt with several high-profile scandals recently .

the civil trial is expected to last several weeks . the staff are charged with mistreating recruits during allegedly unapproved exercises meant to toughen them up in the case of a hostage situation .
there was a national outcry after german media reported on the alleged abuse . robbe said he was convinced the coesfeld methods were not typical of the german army , and his report said such treatment did not occur at other military bases .

even more important is the all-pervasiveness of the lie in political discourse , he says , especially in the 21st century .
that is why the foundation is making an appeal for a worldwide reading tuesday to raise awareness of lying in politics and strengthen the fight against it .
the event this year , called the " second anniversary of the political lie , " will honor murdered russian journalist anna politkovskaya by reading a selection of her works .
around 50 institutions in 10 countries are set to participate .
" with this event , we want to bring more awareness to the issue and strengthen the fight against it , " said schreiber .
last year , the foundation marked the third anniversary of the beginning of the war in iraq with a worldwide reading .
on march 20 , 2006 , eliot weinberger 's 2005 text collage , " what i heard about iraq , " was read in 47 venues around the world , marking the first " day of the political lie . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya was one of the few russian journalists who reported from chechnya and in the wake of the murder of politkovskaya last october , schreiber said it was obvious that her works should be selected for this year 's event .
" in her reports , anna politkovskaya described the truth of the catastrophe of the war in chechnya , a war that has gone on far from the public eye , " he said .
" she was trying to bring the truth to light and was killed for it . "
long-time critic this year , texts from her book called " a small corner of hell : dispatches from chechnya " will be read on the radio , at public venues , public and private gatherings and schools around the world .
specifically , the readings will be from two chapters in the 2003 book : " machkety : a concentration camp with a commercial streak " and " special operation zyazikov . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya was a sharp critic of putin the chapters portray a landscape of torture and murder , condemn the cynicism of bureaucrats , depict the misery and desperation of a civilian population that is torn between the army and rebels and offer a nightmarish picture of the climate of state-fueled fear and repression in russia .
politkovskaya , a long-time critic of russian president vladimir putin , worked for a number of russian newspapers , including the small opposition paper novaya gazeta , and often wrote about how the war in chechnya was far from over , disputing the official line .
instead , she focused on human rights violations and on the civil population caught in the middle of two warring parties .
she had faced threats and intimidation .
yet she refused to have a bodyguard in the same way she refused to go into exile .
in 2004 , she was the victim of a poisoning attempt .
in october , an unknown gunman shot her dead in the stairwell of her moscow apartment block .

" aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which he co-edited with robert a. hinde , dissects human aggression and war . dw-radio : why has embedding journalists become a popular way to report on war ? jo groebel : the term " embedded journalist " made the headlines during the iraq war when the united states entered the country .
lots of journalists were more or less siding with the soldiers entering the country .
the idea there was , rather than having reporting with this certain distance to what 's actually going on , that journalists would have a first-hand image and first-hand impression of what 's going on .
criticism has , of course , been addressing the fact that someone so close to a certain war party may lose his or her neutrality and objectivity . in your opinion , is it possible for an embedded journalist to be critical or does he have to satisfy the government upon which he relies for his information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if news from reporters traveling with soldiers can remain objective well , i think it 's probably more psychological than immediately some kind of oppression .
certainly , there is a danger if i 'm siding with certain soldiers and there are attacks , there may be what in a completely different context one called the stockholm syndrome .
even if you are critical of those who are there , the pure fact that there is a certain closeness and common threat coming from the other side may interfere with objectivity .
and there 's another side to it that one would probably only pick those journalists who are sympathetic with those they are accompanying . do you think it is possible for a journalist , whether he 's imbedded or not , to do objective reporting in a war situation ? in war itself , it 's nearly impossible to come up with a final truth .
i suppose this is far beyond a question of whether there 's embedded journalism or not .
one could even claim that journalism and fact reporting itself is something which is a very tricky thing to relate immediately to any kind of proof . there have been some reports that pictures broadcast from the last two persian gulf wars were faked .
how badly manipulated are reports by embedded journalists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military also maintains a supply of reporter-soldiers i would say this is a more fundamental challenge than particularly with embedded journalists .
war automatically means also war about public opinion .
all armies do have battalions of people who are only dealing with the interpretation or manipulation of facts .
embedded journalism clearly has the aim to create sympathy among those who are accompanying the army and the soldiers .
i suppose it 's kind of more of a variation of what already always has been the somewhat tricky approach to truth and objective journalism in a war situation . another us war that got huge media coverage was the vietnam war in the 1970s .
can the media output of the vietnam war be compared in any way to the current war in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas masks are part of the equipment of a war correspondent i suppose what 's definitely pretty similar is that you see a shift in change in public opinion , most certainly within the united states .
with or without imbedded journalism , you ca n't really control all of those images coming from the war .
so with the increasing number of images of victims nearly daily and -lrb- images of -rrb- all the dead soldiers , particularly american soldiers and also iraqis , it becomes increasingly obvious that this is probably a war which can not be won .
this is certainly a similarity with vietnam .
starting out , loyalty with government .

" aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which he co-edited with robert a. hinde , dissects human aggression and war . dw-radio : why has embedding journalists become a popular way to report on war ? jo groebel : the term " embedded journalist " made the headlines during the iraq war when the united states entered the country .
lots of journalists were more or less siding with the soldiers entering the country .
the idea there was , rather than having reporting with this certain distance to what 's actually going on , that journalists would have a first-hand image and first-hand impression of what 's going on .
criticism has , of course , been addressing the fact that someone so close to a certain war party may lose his or her neutrality and objectivity . in your opinion , is it possible for an embedded journalist to be critical or does he have to satisfy the government upon which he relies for his information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if news from reporters traveling with soldiers can remain objective well , i think it 's probably more psychological than immediately some kind of oppression .
certainly , there is a danger if i 'm siding with certain soldiers and there are attacks , there may be what in a completely different context one called the stockholm syndrome .
even if you are critical of those who are there , the pure fact that there is a certain closeness and common threat coming from the other side may interfere with objectivity .
and there 's another side to it that one would probably only pick those journalists who are sympathetic with those they are accompanying . do you think it is possible for a journalist , whether he 's imbedded or not , to do objective reporting in a war situation ? in war itself , it 's nearly impossible to come up with a final truth .
i suppose this is far beyond a question of whether there 's embedded journalism or not .
one could even claim that journalism and fact reporting itself is something which is a very tricky thing to relate immediately to any kind of proof . there have been some reports that pictures broadcast from the last two persian gulf wars were faked .
how badly manipulated are reports by embedded journalists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military also maintains a supply of reporter-soldiers i would say this is a more fundamental challenge than particularly with embedded journalists .
war automatically means also war about public opinion .
all armies do have battalions of people who are only dealing with the interpretation or manipulation of facts .
embedded journalism clearly has the aim to create sympathy among those who are accompanying the army and the soldiers .
i suppose it 's kind of more of a variation of what already always has been the somewhat tricky approach to truth and objective journalism in a war situation . another us war that got huge media coverage was the vietnam war in the 1970s .
can the media output of the vietnam war be compared in any way to the current war in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas masks are part of the equipment of a war correspondent i suppose what 's definitely pretty similar is that you see a shift in change in public opinion , most certainly within the united states .
with or without imbedded journalism , you ca n't really control all of those images coming from the war .
so with the increasing number of images of victims nearly daily and -lrb- images of -rrb- all the dead soldiers , particularly american soldiers and also iraqis , it becomes increasingly obvious that this is probably a war which can not be won .

" poland is the only country apart from belarus where this issue has never been settled , " said jehuda evron , chairman of the us-based holocaust restitution committee . he called on polish lawmakers to act so elderly victims of expropriation " at the end of their lives should have a feeling that justice has been done . " jewish and non-jewish groups have joined forces to step up the pressure as poland 's parliament makes its 17th attempt to come up with legislation to settle the issue . a draft bill currently before parliament , which would pay 15 percent compensation to former owners and their heirs , has drawn criticism from the groups . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has had to face claims since it joined the eu in 2004 " we demand that a law is passed quickly to allow former property owners to recover their real estate , where possible , and where it is not , that they are compensated , " said miroslaw szypowski , head of the national association of former property owners . " the government has n't consulted us , " he added , referring to the 250,000-member polish property-owners ' association .
" it 's as if we do n't exist . " doing their utmost last month , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski told a delegation of jewish campaigners that his government would do its utmost to ensure parliament passed a compensation law by the end of the year . the value of seized property for which compensation is being sought is estimated at 16 billion euros to 18 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.3 billion to $ 23.9 billion -rrb- , according to the property owners ' association . jewish property was seized by nazi germany after the invasion of poland in 1939 . after world war ii , poland 's new soviet-inspired communist government nationalized property from non-jewish poles and from the few jews who had survived the holocaust . german claims attacked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is trying to improve ties between the two on monday , kaczynski also slammed the german government for failing to halt property claims by germans expelled at the end of world war ii from newly polish territory . " i must underline that in order to have genuinely normal relations between poland and germany ... this issue must be settled , " kaczynski told reporters , in the wake of a visit to poland by german chancellor angela merkel . kaczynski bemoaned the fact that merkel 's position during her visit " proved that there has been no progress on this issue . " merkel 's trip was aimed at patching up relations between warsaw and berlin , which have seen the historic wound of the nazi occupation of poland reopened since poland 's conservative twins - the premier and his brother president lech kaczynski - came to power . no government support in a speech at warsaw university on friday , merkel said berlin did not and would not support the prussian trust , a small german association which filed 22 claims late last year at the european court of human rights seeking the restitution of property that lies in present-day poland . warsaw , however , has repeatedly called on the german government to do more , notably by acting to prevent property lawsuits being brought by individuals . kaczynski , who has launched a series of stinging verbal attacks on berlin about the issue , said poland was pressing germany " to decide finally to make a clear declaration that these claims have no basis in german and international law . " the claims stem from the redrawing of borders agreed by the soviet union , britain and the united states at the 1945 potsdam conference which saw large parts of eastern germany awarded to poland , which in turn lost a swathe of its own eastern territory to the soviets . millions of germans living in what is now northern and western poland were expelled , leaving behind property and land . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor merkel heads to poland as tensions remain high german chancellor angela merkel put improving bilateral ties high on her agenda before leaving for talks in warsaw .

who will win and lose these clashes comes down to team schedules , injuries and nerves . schalke got a boast from a long-time rival and detractor on tuesday , when bayern munich president franz beckenbauer told the tabloid bild newspaper he thinks the men in blue will take their first german title in 49 years . but the kaiser has a history of mistaken predictions , and schalke 's path to a possible trophy is rockier than it may appear at first glance .
in fact , the league leaders ' chances at the title are probably no better than those of their nearest rivals , second-placed werder bremen . home advantage versus historical baggage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have diego while schalke 's lincoln is serving a suspension schalke currently top the table by three points , but their lead is actually smaller than that .
thanks to werder 's better goal difference , a single schalke loss combined with a bremen victory would flip the two teams in the standings . that loss could come as soon as march 31 , after the bundesliga concludes its current one-week break .
schalke play bayern in munich on that date - whereas bremen no longer face the reigning champions . and then there 's the weight of history .
schalke are under enormous pressure to become german champions for the first time in nearly half-a-century .
the perennial bridesmaids in blue have shown jitters of late , and last weekend 's win over stuttgart was more luck than performance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen striker miroslav klose has been laid low in 2007 werder only play at home three times in final eight matches .
but bremen have performed equally well away as in weser stadium this season , and none of their remaining opponents are currently in the top five . bremen 's biggest worry is striker miroslav klose , who 's been ailing for most of 2007 .
if werder are to make up their deficit with schalke , they 'll need their top goal-getter to get on form . the crucial third spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without gomez , stuttgart will need a team effort stuttgart and bayern still have an outside shot at the title , should both of the favourites implode , but more likely they 'll be battling for third place and a chance to qualify for the champions league . stuttgart 's main problem is the absence of their main offensive weapon , striker mario gomez , who 's out for around five weeks with injuries .
as last week 's loss to schalke showed , it 's impossible to win games without scoring any goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern really need to beat southern german rivals stuttgart but bayern have the far tougher schedule .
they play three of their last eight games against current top-five teams , compared to stuttgart 's one , and have the additional burden of champions league matches in early april against ac milan . the crucial date here is april 21 , when the two teams lock horns in stuttgart .
if the hosts get a result , bayern could well fail to qualify for the champions league for the first time since 1995 . the elevator down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund went into free fall in february mönchengladbach , bielefeld and bochum currently occupy the drop zone and are most likely to be relegated .
but plenty teams are teetering on the edge of the precipice , including bundesliga giants hamburg and dortmund , and popular underdogs mainz . the signs are most positive for hamburg .
they play 5 of their final matches at home and only 2 against top-five clubs .
if playmaker rafael van der vaart stays fit , hamburg should stay up . dortmund have it considerably harder .
they have only 3 home games and an equal number against top opposition .
moreover they 're on a downward curve , having not won since mid-february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiny mainz still have a lot of work against bigger opponents meanwhile , mainz 's miracle comeback could falter due to a back-loaded schedule featuring clashes with leverkusen , schalke , stuttgart and , on the last day of the season , bayern .
dead last at the winter break , mainz could come up heartbreakingly short as the 2006-7 campaign comes to what 's sure to be an exciting conclusion . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen still in the hunt behind schalke as bayern , stuttgart fall a 2-0 home win for werder bremen over mainz sunday reduced schalke 04 's lead at the top of the bundesliga to three points .
schalke beat third-placed stuttgart saturday while fourth-placed bayern munich lost in frankfurt .
-lrb- 19.03.2007 -rrb- managerial musical chairs no surprise for dortmund fans many soccer fans will be incredulous that borussia dortmund are on their third coach of the season .
but supporters of the rhine valley giants will be less surprised .
the club has a reputation for short coaching tenures .
-lrb- 14.03.2007 -rrb- nice guys need not finish last nearly everyone wrote off mainz who had just 11 points at the end of 2006 and were stuck at the bottom of the table .
but in the season 's second leg , they reeled off an unprecedented streak to escape the relegation zone .

who will win and lose these clashes comes down to team schedules , injuries and nerves . schalke got a boast from a long-time rival and detractor on tuesday , when bayern munich president franz beckenbauer told the tabloid bild newspaper he thinks the men in blue will take their first german title in 49 years . but the kaiser has a history of mistaken predictions , and schalke 's path to a possible trophy is rockier than it may appear at first glance .
in fact , the league leaders ' chances at the title are probably no better than those of their nearest rivals , second-placed werder bremen . home advantage versus historical baggage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have diego while schalke 's lincoln is serving a suspension schalke currently top the table by three points , but their lead is actually smaller than that .
thanks to werder 's better goal difference , a single schalke loss combined with a bremen victory would flip the two teams in the standings . that loss could come as soon as march 31 , after the bundesliga concludes its current one-week break .
schalke play bayern in munich on that date - whereas bremen no longer face the reigning champions . and then there 's the weight of history .
schalke are under enormous pressure to become german champions for the first time in nearly half-a-century .
the perennial bridesmaids in blue have shown jitters of late , and last weekend 's win over stuttgart was more luck than performance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen striker miroslav klose has been laid low in 2007 werder only play at home three times in final eight matches .
but bremen have performed equally well away as in weser stadium this season , and none of their remaining opponents are currently in the top five . bremen 's biggest worry is striker miroslav klose , who 's been ailing for most of 2007 .
if werder are to make up their deficit with schalke , they 'll need their top goal-getter to get on form . the crucial third spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without gomez , stuttgart will need a team effort stuttgart and bayern still have an outside shot at the title , should both of the favourites implode , but more likely they 'll be battling for third place and a chance to qualify for the champions league . stuttgart 's main problem is the absence of their main offensive weapon , striker mario gomez , who 's out for around five weeks with injuries .

there are currently 9,000 soldiers on foreign missions in places like afghanistan , lebanon and the balkans .

even as the company struggles to remain profitable , most other european union countries are reluctant to liberalize their mail markets . deutsche post stocks fell 6 percent tuesday after the company announced its 2007 earnings will fall short of predictions . europe 's largest mail service provider has tried to diversify and take a more international approach in recent years . at the same time , many other eu countries have dragged their feet on liberalizing their own mail monopolies .
deutsche post said it 's worried this attitude will put them at a disadvantage . domestic postal services in eu countries are scheduled to be completely opened to competition by 2009 .
the bloc also wants to open the market for letters under 50 grams -lrb- 1.8 ounces -rrb- to private carriers and thereby get rid of state postal monopolies . deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel has used profits from the traditional mail service to transform the company into a major player in the global transport and logistics market . still , delivering letters remains a vital part of the deutsche post .
even with the company 's big push in recent years into international logistics , freight and express mail , normal mail delivery remains responsible for 25 percent of the company 's gross income , and more than 60 percent of its profit . post wants liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel wants european postal markets opened to competition zumwinkel ha said he is not against liberalization in the postal sector .
in fact , he 's betting on his company moving into liberalized postal markets of other eu countries .
but he also said he worries about competition being distorted by unequal liberalization . a date needs to be fixed for other countries to open their markets to competition , zumwinkel said , adding that it does n't bother him if germany is one of the first to do so , but " the date must be fixed . " " we 're saying : liberalization is good .
liberalization should be .
but it must take place in lockstep in europe , " zumwinkel added . zumwinkel said deutsche post would insist on reciprocity .
if germany opens its market , all european countries should do the same .
germany , the united kingdom and scandinavian countries have said they will allow foreign competition in their postal markets .
france , poland , greece , italy , spain are among the european countries reluctant to give up their postal monopolies . this reluctance goes against the idea at the basis of forming the european union , zumwinkel said .
it was supposed to mean getting rid of tariffs and forming common markets . " you ca n't say , ' i 'm going to do this to you , but you ca n't do this to me , " ' he said .

this is already happening to an extent in germany , with some private companies paying wages as low as four euros per hour to deliver parcels .
deutsche post also takes advantage of cheap labor .
since 2000 , the company has shed 34,000 part and full time positions , turning to subcontractors in some cases . the german government has said despite other countries ' reluctance to end their own letter-delivery monopolies , it will go forward with its plan to open its system to competition in 2008 . karl zawadzky -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks open postal markets by 2009 the european commission laid out plans to complete the opening of the european union 's postal-services market to competition by 2009 despite fierce opposition from some countries .

if germany opens its market , all european countries should do the same .
germany , the united kingdom and scandinavian countries have said they will allow foreign competition in their postal markets .
france , poland , greece , italy , spain are among the european countries reluctant to give up their postal monopolies . this reluctance goes against the idea at the basis of forming the european union , zumwinkel said .
it was supposed to mean getting rid of tariffs and forming common markets . " you ca n't say , ' i 'm going to do this to you , but you ca n't do this to me , " ' he said .
" that 's not how it works . " deutsche post employs 80,000 people in europe to deliver letters .
a 20-percent loss could endanger 32,000 jobs .
many postal employees are public servants , which makes it extremyl difficult for the post to lay them off or cut their pay . delivering mail big business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monopolists want to make sure all people get their mail it 's not only the german postal service that is labor-intensive .
in the european union , 1.6 million people work as postal carriers .
it is a $ 90 billion market . countries are concerned about issues like universal coverage as public postal carriers are required to deliver mail at acceptable prices to remote regions five days a week , even if it is n't profitable to do so . countries also worry that opening the market will lead to the tendency to find low-paid workers to deliver mail .
this is already happening to an extent in germany , with some private companies paying wages as low as four euros per hour to deliver parcels .
deutsche post also takes advantage of cheap labor .
since 2000 , the company has shed 34,000 part and full time positions , turning to subcontractors in some cases . the german government has said despite other countries ' reluctance to end their own letter-delivery monopolies , it will go forward with its plan to open its system to competition in 2008 . karl zawadzky -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks open postal markets by 2009 the european commission laid out plans to complete the opening of the european union 's postal-services market to competition by 2009 despite fierce opposition from some countries .

belgian foreign minister karel de gucht may also hold talks with him . " there is no eu decision that would ban such visits , nor any decision laying out the eu 's policy on such contacts , " explained the european commission 's spokeswoman for external affairs , emma udwin . the united states also made contact with the independent finance minister , according to palestinian sources , while non-eu country norway has gone further and recognized the government outright . germany mideast quartet 's demands met bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with abbas in berlin in february german chancellor angela merkel told palestinian president mahmoud abbas in a telephone conversation on tuesday that she was pleased the new fatah-hamas unity government had contributed to some internal stability ion the region , according to government spokesman ulrich wilhelm . " at the same time , she urged again that the new government fulfill the criteria of the so-called middle east quartet , in particular the renunciation of violence and the recognition of israel , " wilhelm said . hamas swept to power a year ago .
the elections that brought it to office were endorsed but the result was shunned by the eu and the united states , as the group ranks on their terror blacklists . it led to the end of direct aid to the hamas government , including a israeli boycott of hundreds of millions of dollars of tax and customs duties owed to the palestinian authority , and drove it into bankruptcy . no official ties , but doors still open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fatah-hamas unity coalition officially took over on saturday on monday , the united states and european union agreed to withhold recognition of the unity government grouping western-backed moderates and islamic radicals , but they did leave the door open to future official ties . the two along with the united nations and russia , who all make up the middle east diplomatic quartet , insist that the cabinet 's program must recognize israel , renounce violence and respect past peace agreements . " i have to say that this government does not comply fully with the principles , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said monday .
" it 's much more important what they do than what they say at this point in time . " palestinian officials have repeatedly called for an end to the international aid boycott , as the gaza strip spiraled into economic chaos and violence . eu wants proof from palestinians but officials said on tuesday that the eu was in no hurry , without proof that the new government is as good as its word . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana said the new government 's actions will speak louder than its words " we need to see real action from the government , and that wo n't happen from one day to the next , " one official in brussels said , on condition of anonymity . the union is by far the biggest aid provider to the palestinians .
it donated some 700 million euros -lrb- $ 900 million -rrb- last year , without any of the money reaching hamas . even with hamas being by-passed , the amount was around 200 million euros more than it usually provides annually . finding fair aid model most of the funds went through a temporary mechanism set up to provide fuel for hospitals and generators and pay temporary allowances to those most in need , and officials expect that to evolve . " the question of how to normalize financial assistance is something that will be addressed very gradually , " the eu official said .
" the temporary mechanism will evolve . " " we 'll keep using the mechanism for a while , " said solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach .
" it allows us to give aid .
we 're not going to close the door but we 're not going to open it right up either . " officials agreed that the eu 's position on dealing with the government - at least non-hamas members in it - is likely be made more formal at a meeting of the bloc 's foreign ministers in bremen , northern germany late next week . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , us play down differences on missile defense us efforts to set up a missile defense system are legitimate , though russia 's opposition to basing the system in eastern europe must be addressed , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 20.03.2007 schalke and bremen battle for the title großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's way too early for leaders schalke to start celebrating a tight race at the top and a fierce struggle at the bottom promise lots of excitement for the final quarter to the season .
who will win and lose these clashes comes down to team schedules , injuries and nerves . schalke got a boast from a long-time rival and detractor on tuesday , when bayern munich president franz beckenbauer told the tabloid bild newspaper he thinks the men in blue will take their first german title in 49 years . but the kaiser has a history of mistaken predictions , and schalke 's path to a possible trophy is rockier than it may appear at first glance .
in fact , the league leaders ' chances at the title are probably no better than those of their nearest rivals , second-placed werder bremen . home advantage versus historical baggage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have diego while schalke 's lincoln is serving a suspension schalke currently top the table by three points , but their lead is actually smaller than that .
thanks to werder 's better goal difference , a single schalke loss combined with a bremen victory would flip the two teams in the standings . that loss could come as soon as march 31 , after the bundesliga concludes its current one-week break .
schalke play bayern in munich on that date - whereas bremen no longer face the reigning champions . and then there 's the weight of history .
schalke are under enormous pressure to become german champions for the first time in nearly half-a-century .
the perennial bridesmaids in blue have shown jitters of late , and last weekend 's win over stuttgart was more luck than performance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen striker miroslav klose has been laid low in 2007 werder only play at home three times in final eight matches .
but bremen have performed equally well away as in weser stadium this season , and none of their remaining opponents are currently in the top five . bremen 's biggest worry is striker miroslav klose , who 's been ailing for most of 2007 .
if werder are to make up their deficit with schalke , they 'll need their top goal-getter to get on form . the crucial third spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without gomez , stuttgart will need a team effort stuttgart and bayern still have an outside shot at the title , should both of the favourites implode , but more likely they 'll be battling for third place and a chance to qualify for the champions league . stuttgart 's main problem is the absence of their main offensive weapon , striker mario gomez , who 's out for around five weeks with injuries .
as last week 's loss to schalke showed , it 's impossible to win games without scoring any goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern really need to beat southern german rivals stuttgart but bayern have the far tougher schedule .
they play three of their last eight games against current top-five teams , compared to stuttgart 's one , and have the additional burden of champions league matches in early april against ac milan . the crucial date here is april 21 , when the two teams lock horns in stuttgart .
if the hosts get a result , bayern could well fail to qualify for the champions league for the first time since 1995 . the elevator down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund went into free fall in february mönchengladbach , bielefeld and bochum currently occupy the drop zone and are most likely to be relegated .
but plenty teams are teetering on the edge of the precipice , including bundesliga giants hamburg and dortmund , and popular underdogs mainz . the signs are most positive for hamburg .
they play 5 of their final matches at home and only 2 against top-five clubs .
if playmaker rafael van der vaart stays fit , hamburg should stay up . dortmund have it considerably harder .
they have only 3 home games and an equal number against top opposition .
moreover they 're on a downward curve , having not won since mid-february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiny mainz still have a lot of work against bigger opponents meanwhile , mainz 's miracle comeback could falter due to a back-loaded schedule featuring clashes with leverkusen , schalke , stuttgart and , on the last day of the season , bayern .
dead last at the winter break , mainz could come up heartbreakingly short as the 2006-7 campaign comes to what 's sure to be an exciting conclusion . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen still in the hunt behind schalke as bayern , stuttgart fall a 2-0 home win for werder bremen over mainz sunday reduced schalke 04 's lead at the top of the bundesliga to three points .

no widespread mistreatment of recruits was found . the german parliament 's military commissioner reinhold robbe released his annual report tuesday about the shortcomings of the german armed forces .
at the top of the list , robbe said the bundeswehr is underfinanced . the lack of money causes problems for soldiers in several ways , the report said .
robbe decried the decaying condition of many of the military barracks .
some are filled with mold and ready to collapse , with disgusting bathrooms . he also pointed out that soldiers are worried about their personal financial situations and remain at the bottom of their income groups . foreign missions causing financial strain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some military barracks are in bad condition the military 's financial strain needs to be taken into account before the government agrees to new deployments , robbe said .
there are some fears that germany 's army of 245,000 is overstretched , although only a relatively small percentage are engaged in foreign peacekeeping missions .
there are currently 9,000 soldiers on foreign missions in places like afghanistan , lebanon and the balkans . " in every single case it needs to be tested whether the bundeswehr is overburdened or overextended , " he said . robbe , a social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentarian , is the designated defense commissioner for the german parliament .
his role is to provide the government with an annual report about problems with the military .
he also warns politicians about any problems in the military and to be an outside point of contact for soldiers . mistreatment not widespread bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recruits not mishandled , report says the german army has dealt with several high-profile scandals recently .
seven german soldiers face court martial for photographs which depict them posing and playing with human skulls while stationed in afghanistan . on monday , a separate trial of 18 training staff began , charging the staff of mistreating as many as 163 armed forces personnel in 2004 at a base in coesfeld near the northern german city of münster .
the civil trial is expected to last several weeks . the staff are charged with mistreating recruits during allegedly unapproved exercises meant to toughen them up in the case of a hostage situation .
there was a national outcry after german media reported on the alleged abuse . robbe said he was convinced the coesfeld methods were not typical of the german army , and his report said such treatment did not occur at other military bases .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 20.03.2007 reporting has changed public 's opinion of iraq war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists want to get a close-up view of the war on the fourth anniversary of the us-led invasion of iraq , on tuesday , media analyst jo groebel said it remains difficult for journalists to report objectively while traveling with troops during war . jo groebel , director of the german digital institute , has written and edited numerous books about new media and the internet .
" aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which he co-edited with robert a. hinde , dissects human aggression and war . dw-radio : why has embedding journalists become a popular way to report on war ? jo groebel : the term " embedded journalist " made the headlines during the iraq war when the united states entered the country .
lots of journalists were more or less siding with the soldiers entering the country .
the idea there was , rather than having reporting with this certain distance to what 's actually going on , that journalists would have a first-hand image and first-hand impression of what 's going on .
criticism has , of course , been addressing the fact that someone so close to a certain war party may lose his or her neutrality and objectivity . in your opinion , is it possible for an embedded journalist to be critical or does he have to satisfy the government upon which he relies for his information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if news from reporters traveling with soldiers can remain objective well , i think it 's probably more psychological than immediately some kind of oppression .
certainly , there is a danger if i 'm siding with certain soldiers and there are attacks , there may be what in a completely different context one called the stockholm syndrome .
even if you are critical of those who are there , the pure fact that there is a certain closeness and common threat coming from the other side may interfere with objectivity .
and there 's another side to it that one would probably only pick those journalists who are sympathetic with those they are accompanying . do you think it is possible for a journalist , whether he 's imbedded or not , to do objective reporting in a war situation ? in war itself , it 's nearly impossible to come up with a final truth .
i suppose this is far beyond a question of whether there 's embedded journalism or not .
one could even claim that journalism and fact reporting itself is something which is a very tricky thing to relate immediately to any kind of proof . there have been some reports that pictures broadcast from the last two persian gulf wars were faked .
how badly manipulated are reports by embedded journalists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military also maintains a supply of reporter-soldiers i would say this is a more fundamental challenge than particularly with embedded journalists .
war automatically means also war about public opinion .
all armies do have battalions of people who are only dealing with the interpretation or manipulation of facts .
embedded journalism clearly has the aim to create sympathy among those who are accompanying the army and the soldiers .
i suppose it 's kind of more of a variation of what already always has been the somewhat tricky approach to truth and objective journalism in a war situation . another us war that got huge media coverage was the vietnam war in the 1970s .
can the media output of the vietnam war be compared in any way to the current war in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas masks are part of the equipment of a war correspondent i suppose what 's definitely pretty similar is that you see a shift in change in public opinion , most certainly within the united states .
with or without imbedded journalism , you ca n't really control all of those images coming from the war .
so with the increasing number of images of victims nearly daily and -lrb- images of -rrb- all the dead soldiers , particularly american soldiers and also iraqis , it becomes increasingly obvious that this is probably a war which can not be won .
this is certainly a similarity with vietnam .
starting out , loyalty with government .
then , a real shift due to images , again , with or without embedded journalism , regarding the real face of the war .
and i suppose public opinion now has certainly changed due to media reporting . kerstin winter interviewed jo groebel -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us soldier found guilty of desertion at trial in germany as an american is convicted of desertion for his attempts to leave the army , organizations in germany that counsel soldiers on how they can avoid being sent to war said they 've been flooded with inquires .
-lrb- 06.03.2007 -rrb- britain , denmark to pull out troops from iraq britain , along with denmark , confirmed it would begin a major troop withdrawal from iraq in coming months and lithuania too has indicated it may follow suit .

the line-up also includes four women , the highest share in any french presidential election . under rules designed to weed out frivolous candidacies , would-be contenders had until friday to submit 500 endorsements from france 's mayors and other elected officials to the constitutional council , the body that supervises the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : segolene royal will be the candidate for the socialists more than 40 contenders - many of them single-issue campaigners with no political support base - had initially thrown their hat in the ring .

even more important is the all-pervasiveness of the lie in political discourse , he says , especially in the 21st century .
that is why the foundation is making an appeal for a worldwide reading tuesday to raise awareness of lying in politics and strengthen the fight against it .
the event this year , called the " second anniversary of the political lie , " will honor murdered russian journalist anna politkovskaya by reading a selection of her works .
around 50 institutions in 10 countries are set to participate .
" with this event , we want to bring more awareness to the issue and strengthen the fight against it , " said schreiber .
last year , the foundation marked the third anniversary of the beginning of the war in iraq with a worldwide reading .
on march 20 , 2006 , eliot weinberger 's 2005 text collage , " what i heard about iraq , " was read in 47 venues around the world , marking the first " day of the political lie . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya was one of the few russian journalists who reported from chechnya and in the wake of the murder of politkovskaya last october , schreiber said it was obvious that her works should be selected for this year 's event .
" in her reports , anna politkovskaya described the truth of the catastrophe of the war in chechnya , a war that has gone on far from the public eye , " he said .
" she was trying to bring the truth to light and was killed for it . "
long-time critic this year , texts from her book called " a small corner of hell : dispatches from chechnya " will be read on the radio , at public venues , public and private gatherings and schools around the world .
specifically , the readings will be from two chapters in the 2003 book : " machkety : a concentration camp with a commercial streak " and " special operation zyazikov . "

" poland is the only country apart from belarus where this issue has never been settled , " said jehuda evron , chairman of the us-based holocaust restitution committee . he called on polish lawmakers to act so elderly victims of expropriation " at the end of their lives should have a feeling that justice has been done . " jewish and non-jewish groups have joined forces to step up the pressure as poland 's parliament makes its 17th attempt to come up with legislation to settle the issue . a draft bill currently before parliament , which would pay 15 percent compensation to former owners and their heirs , has drawn criticism from the groups . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has had to face claims since it joined the eu in 2004 " we demand that a law is passed quickly to allow former property owners to recover their real estate , where possible , and where it is not , that they are compensated , " said miroslaw szypowski , head of the national association of former property owners . " the government has n't consulted us , " he added , referring to the 250,000-member polish property-owners ' association .
" it 's as if we do n't exist . " doing their utmost last month , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski told a delegation of jewish campaigners that his government would do its utmost to ensure parliament passed a compensation law by the end of the year . the value of seized property for which compensation is being sought is estimated at 16 billion euros to 18 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.3 billion to $ 23.9 billion -rrb- , according to the property owners ' association . jewish property was seized by nazi germany after the invasion of poland in 1939 . after world war ii , poland 's new soviet-inspired communist government nationalized property from non-jewish poles and from the few jews who had survived the holocaust . german claims attacked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is trying to improve ties between the two on monday , kaczynski also slammed the german government for failing to halt property claims by germans expelled at the end of world war ii from newly polish territory . " i must underline that in order to have genuinely normal relations between poland and germany ... this issue must be settled , " kaczynski told reporters , in the wake of a visit to poland by german chancellor angela merkel . kaczynski bemoaned the fact that merkel 's position during her visit " proved that there has been no progress on this issue . " merkel 's trip was aimed at patching up relations between warsaw and berlin , which have seen the historic wound of the nazi occupation of poland reopened since poland 's conservative twins - the premier and his brother president lech kaczynski - came to power . no government support in a speech at warsaw university on friday , merkel said berlin did not and would not support the prussian trust , a small german association which filed 22 claims late last year at the european court of human rights seeking the restitution of property that lies in present-day poland . warsaw , however , has repeatedly called on the german government to do more , notably by acting to prevent property lawsuits being brought by individuals . kaczynski , who has launched a series of stinging verbal attacks on berlin about the issue , said poland was pressing germany " to decide finally to make a clear declaration that these claims have no basis in german and international law . " the claims stem from the redrawing of borders agreed by the soviet union , britain and the united states at the 1945 potsdam conference which saw large parts of eastern germany awarded to poland , which in turn lost a swathe of its own eastern territory to the soviets . millions of germans living in what is now northern and western poland were expelled , leaving behind property and land . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor merkel heads to poland as tensions remain high german chancellor angela merkel put improving bilateral ties high on her agenda before leaving for talks in warsaw .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.03.2007 reporting has changed public 's opinion of iraq war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists want to get a close-up view of the war on the fourth anniversary of the us-led invasion of iraq , on tuesday , media analyst jo groebel said it remains difficult for journalists to report objectively while traveling with troops during war . jo groebel , director of the german digital institute , has written and edited numerous books about new media and the internet .
" aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which he co-edited with robert a. hinde , dissects human aggression and war . dw-radio : why has embedding journalists become a popular way to report on war ? jo groebel : the term " embedded journalist " made the headlines during the iraq war when the united states entered the country .
lots of journalists were more or less siding with the soldiers entering the country .
the idea there was , rather than having reporting with this certain distance to what 's actually going on , that journalists would have a first-hand image and first-hand impression of what 's going on .
criticism has , of course , been addressing the fact that someone so close to a certain war party may lose his or her neutrality and objectivity . in your opinion , is it possible for an embedded journalist to be critical or does he have to satisfy the government upon which he relies for his information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if news from reporters traveling with soldiers can remain objective well , i think it 's probably more psychological than immediately some kind of oppression .
certainly , there is a danger if i 'm siding with certain soldiers and there are attacks , there may be what in a completely different context one called the stockholm syndrome .
even if you are critical of those who are there , the pure fact that there is a certain closeness and common threat coming from the other side may interfere with objectivity .
and there 's another side to it that one would probably only pick those journalists who are sympathetic with those they are accompanying . do you think it is possible for a journalist , whether he 's imbedded or not , to do objective reporting in a war situation ? in war itself , it 's nearly impossible to come up with a final truth .
i suppose this is far beyond a question of whether there 's embedded journalism or not .
one could even claim that journalism and fact reporting itself is something which is a very tricky thing to relate immediately to any kind of proof . there have been some reports that pictures broadcast from the last two persian gulf wars were faked .
how badly manipulated are reports by embedded journalists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military also maintains a supply of reporter-soldiers i would say this is a more fundamental challenge than particularly with embedded journalists .
war automatically means also war about public opinion .
all armies do have battalions of people who are only dealing with the interpretation or manipulation of facts .
embedded journalism clearly has the aim to create sympathy among those who are accompanying the army and the soldiers .
i suppose it 's kind of more of a variation of what already always has been the somewhat tricky approach to truth and objective journalism in a war situation . another us war that got huge media coverage was the vietnam war in the 1970s .
can the media output of the vietnam war be compared in any way to the current war in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas masks are part of the equipment of a war correspondent i suppose what 's definitely pretty similar is that you see a shift in change in public opinion , most certainly within the united states .
with or without imbedded journalism , you ca n't really control all of those images coming from the war .
so with the increasing number of images of victims nearly daily and -lrb- images of -rrb- all the dead soldiers , particularly american soldiers and also iraqis , it becomes increasingly obvious that this is probably a war which can not be won .
this is certainly a similarity with vietnam .
starting out , loyalty with government .
then , a real shift due to images , again , with or without embedded journalism , regarding the real face of the war .
and i suppose public opinion now has certainly changed due to media reporting . kerstin winter interviewed jo groebel -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us soldier found guilty of desertion at trial in germany as an american is convicted of desertion for his attempts to leave the army , organizations in germany that counsel soldiers on how they can avoid being sent to war said they 've been flooded with inquires .
-lrb- 06.03.2007 -rrb- britain , denmark to pull out troops from iraq britain , along with denmark , confirmed it would begin a major troop withdrawal from iraq in coming months and lithuania too has indicated it may follow suit .
washington however denies its coalition is crumbling .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 20.03.2007 schalke and bremen battle for the title großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's way too early for leaders schalke to start celebrating a tight race at the top and a fierce struggle at the bottom promise lots of excitement for the final quarter to the season .
who will win and lose these clashes comes down to team schedules , injuries and nerves . schalke got a boast from a long-time rival and detractor on tuesday , when bayern munich president franz beckenbauer told the tabloid bild newspaper he thinks the men in blue will take their first german title in 49 years . but the kaiser has a history of mistaken predictions , and schalke 's path to a possible trophy is rockier than it may appear at first glance .
in fact , the league leaders ' chances at the title are probably no better than those of their nearest rivals , second-placed werder bremen . home advantage versus historical baggage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have diego while schalke 's lincoln is serving a suspension schalke currently top the table by three points , but their lead is actually smaller than that .
thanks to werder 's better goal difference , a single schalke loss combined with a bremen victory would flip the two teams in the standings . that loss could come as soon as march 31 , after the bundesliga concludes its current one-week break .
schalke play bayern in munich on that date - whereas bremen no longer face the reigning champions . and then there 's the weight of history .
schalke are under enormous pressure to become german champions for the first time in nearly half-a-century .
the perennial bridesmaids in blue have shown jitters of late , and last weekend 's win over stuttgart was more luck than performance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen striker miroslav klose has been laid low in 2007 werder only play at home three times in final eight matches .
but bremen have performed equally well away as in weser stadium this season , and none of their remaining opponents are currently in the top five . bremen 's biggest worry is striker miroslav klose , who 's been ailing for most of 2007 .
if werder are to make up their deficit with schalke , they 'll need their top goal-getter to get on form . the crucial third spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without gomez , stuttgart will need a team effort stuttgart and bayern still have an outside shot at the title , should both of the favourites implode , but more likely they 'll be battling for third place and a chance to qualify for the champions league . stuttgart 's main problem is the absence of their main offensive weapon , striker mario gomez , who 's out for around five weeks with injuries .
as last week 's loss to schalke showed , it 's impossible to win games without scoring any goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern really need to beat southern german rivals stuttgart but bayern have the far tougher schedule .
they play three of their last eight games against current top-five teams , compared to stuttgart 's one , and have the additional burden of champions league matches in early april against ac milan . the crucial date here is april 21 , when the two teams lock horns in stuttgart .
if the hosts get a result , bayern could well fail to qualify for the champions league for the first time since 1995 . the elevator down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund went into free fall in february mönchengladbach , bielefeld and bochum currently occupy the drop zone and are most likely to be relegated .
but plenty teams are teetering on the edge of the precipice , including bundesliga giants hamburg and dortmund , and popular underdogs mainz . the signs are most positive for hamburg .
they play 5 of their final matches at home and only 2 against top-five clubs .
if playmaker rafael van der vaart stays fit , hamburg should stay up . dortmund have it considerably harder .
they have only 3 home games and an equal number against top opposition .
moreover they 're on a downward curve , having not won since mid-february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiny mainz still have a lot of work against bigger opponents meanwhile , mainz 's miracle comeback could falter due to a back-loaded schedule featuring clashes with leverkusen , schalke , stuttgart and , on the last day of the season , bayern .
dead last at the winter break , mainz could come up heartbreakingly short as the 2006-7 campaign comes to what 's sure to be an exciting conclusion . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen still in the hunt behind schalke as bayern , stuttgart fall a 2-0 home win for werder bremen over mainz sunday reduced schalke 04 's lead at the top of the bundesliga to three points .
schalke beat third-placed stuttgart saturday while fourth-placed bayern munich lost in frankfurt .
-lrb- 19.03.2007 -rrb- managerial musical chairs no surprise for dortmund fans many soccer fans will be incredulous that borussia dortmund are on their third coach of the season .
but supporters of the rhine valley giants will be less surprised .
the club has a reputation for short coaching tenures .
-lrb- 14.03.2007 -rrb- nice guys need not finish last nearly everyone wrote off mainz who had just 11 points at the end of 2006 and were stuck at the bottom of the table .
but in the season 's second leg , they reeled off an unprecedented streak to escape the relegation zone .

even more important is the all-pervasiveness of the lie in political discourse , he says , especially in the 21st century .
that is why the foundation is making an appeal for a worldwide reading tuesday to raise awareness of lying in politics and strengthen the fight against it .
the event this year , called the " second anniversary of the political lie , " will honor murdered russian journalist anna politkovskaya by reading a selection of her works .
around 50 institutions in 10 countries are set to participate .
" with this event , we want to bring more awareness to the issue and strengthen the fight against it , " said schreiber .
last year , the foundation marked the third anniversary of the beginning of the war in iraq with a worldwide reading .
on march 20 , 2006 , eliot weinberger 's 2005 text collage , " what i heard about iraq , " was read in 47 venues around the world , marking the first " day of the political lie . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya was one of the few russian journalists who reported from chechnya and in the wake of the murder of politkovskaya last october , schreiber said it was obvious that her works should be selected for this year 's event .
" in her reports , anna politkovskaya described the truth of the catastrophe of the war in chechnya , a war that has gone on far from the public eye , " he said .
" she was trying to bring the truth to light and was killed for it . "
long-time critic this year , texts from her book called " a small corner of hell : dispatches from chechnya " will be read on the radio , at public venues , public and private gatherings and schools around the world .
specifically , the readings will be from two chapters in the 2003 book : " machkety : a concentration camp with a commercial streak " and " special operation zyazikov . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya was a sharp critic of putin the chapters portray a landscape of torture and murder , condemn the cynicism of bureaucrats , depict the misery and desperation of a civilian population that is torn between the army and rebels and offer a nightmarish picture of the climate of state-fueled fear and repression in russia .
politkovskaya , a long-time critic of russian president vladimir putin , worked for a number of russian newspapers , including the small opposition paper novaya gazeta , and often wrote about how the war in chechnya was far from over , disputing the official line .
instead , she focused on human rights violations and on the civil population caught in the middle of two warring parties .
she had faced threats and intimidation .
yet she refused to have a bodyguard in the same way she refused to go into exile .
in 2004 , she was the victim of a poisoning attempt .
in october , an unknown gunman shot her dead in the stairwell of her moscow apartment block .

even more important is the all-pervasiveness of the lie in political discourse , he says , especially in the 21st century .
that is why the foundation is making an appeal for a worldwide reading tuesday to raise awareness of lying in politics and strengthen the fight against it .
the event this year , called the " second anniversary of the political lie , " will honor murdered russian journalist anna politkovskaya by reading a selection of her works .
around 50 institutions in 10 countries are set to participate .
" with this event , we want to bring more awareness to the issue and strengthen the fight against it , " said schreiber .
last year , the foundation marked the third anniversary of the beginning of the war in iraq with a worldwide reading .
on march 20 , 2006 , eliot weinberger 's 2005 text collage , " what i heard about iraq , " was read in 47 venues around the world , marking the first " day of the political lie . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya was one of the few russian journalists who reported from chechnya and in the wake of the murder of politkovskaya last october , schreiber said it was obvious that her works should be selected for this year 's event .
" in her reports , anna politkovskaya described the truth of the catastrophe of the war in chechnya , a war that has gone on far from the public eye , " he said .
" she was trying to bring the truth to light and was killed for it . "
long-time critic this year , texts from her book called " a small corner of hell : dispatches from chechnya " will be read on the radio , at public venues , public and private gatherings and schools around the world .
specifically , the readings will be from two chapters in the 2003 book : " machkety : a concentration camp with a commercial streak " and " special operation zyazikov . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya was a sharp critic of putin the chapters portray a landscape of torture and murder , condemn the cynicism of bureaucrats , depict the misery and desperation of a civilian population that is torn between the army and rebels and offer a nightmarish picture of the climate of state-fueled fear and repression in russia .
politkovskaya , a long-time critic of russian president vladimir putin , worked for a number of russian newspapers , including the small opposition paper novaya gazeta , and often wrote about how the war in chechnya was far from over , disputing the official line .
instead , she focused on human rights violations and on the civil population caught in the middle of two warring parties .
she had faced threats and intimidation .
yet she refused to have a bodyguard in the same way she refused to go into exile .
in 2004 , she was the victim of a poisoning attempt .
in october , an unknown gunman shot her dead in the stairwell of her moscow apartment block .

even as the company struggles to remain profitable , most other european union countries are reluctant to liberalize their mail markets . deutsche post stocks fell 6 percent tuesday after the company announced its 2007 earnings will fall short of predictions . europe 's largest mail service provider has tried to diversify and take a more international approach in recent years . at the same time , many other eu countries have dragged their feet on liberalizing their own mail monopolies .
deutsche post said it 's worried this attitude will put them at a disadvantage . domestic postal services in eu countries are scheduled to be completely opened to competition by 2009 .
the bloc also wants to open the market for letters under 50 grams -lrb- 1.8 ounces -rrb- to private carriers and thereby get rid of state postal monopolies . deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel has used profits from the traditional mail service to transform the company into a major player in the global transport and logistics market . still , delivering letters remains a vital part of the deutsche post .
even with the company 's big push in recent years into international logistics , freight and express mail , normal mail delivery remains responsible for 25 percent of the company 's gross income , and more than 60 percent of its profit . post wants liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel wants european postal markets opened to competition zumwinkel ha said he is not against liberalization in the postal sector .
in fact , he 's betting on his company moving into liberalized postal markets of other eu countries .
but he also said he worries about competition being distorted by unequal liberalization . a date needs to be fixed for other countries to open their markets to competition , zumwinkel said , adding that it does n't bother him if germany is one of the first to do so , but " the date must be fixed . " " we 're saying : liberalization is good .
liberalization should be .
but it must take place in lockstep in europe , " zumwinkel added . zumwinkel said deutsche post would insist on reciprocity .
if germany opens its market , all european countries should do the same .
germany , the united kingdom and scandinavian countries have said they will allow foreign competition in their postal markets .
france , poland , greece , italy , spain are among the european countries reluctant to give up their postal monopolies . this reluctance goes against the idea at the basis of forming the european union , zumwinkel said .
it was supposed to mean getting rid of tariffs and forming common markets . " you ca n't say , ' i 'm going to do this to you , but you ca n't do this to me , " ' he said .
" that 's not how it works . " deutsche post employs 80,000 people in europe to deliver letters .
a 20-percent loss could endanger 32,000 jobs .
many postal employees are public servants , which makes it extremyl difficult for the post to lay them off or cut their pay . delivering mail big business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monopolists want to make sure all people get their mail it 's not only the german postal service that is labor-intensive .
in the european union , 1.6 million people work as postal carriers .
it is a $ 90 billion market . countries are concerned about issues like universal coverage as public postal carriers are required to deliver mail at acceptable prices to remote regions five days a week , even if it is n't profitable to do so . countries also worry that opening the market will lead to the tendency to find low-paid workers to deliver mail .
this is already happening to an extent in germany , with some private companies paying wages as low as four euros per hour to deliver parcels .
deutsche post also takes advantage of cheap labor .
since 2000 , the company has shed 34,000 part and full time positions , turning to subcontractors in some cases . the german government has said despite other countries ' reluctance to end their own letter-delivery monopolies , it will go forward with its plan to open its system to competition in 2008 . karl zawadzky -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks open postal markets by 2009 the european commission laid out plans to complete the opening of the european union 's postal-services market to competition by 2009 despite fierce opposition from some countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.03.2007 reporting has changed public 's opinion of iraq war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists want to get a close-up view of the war on the fourth anniversary of the us-led invasion of iraq , on tuesday , media analyst jo groebel said it remains difficult for journalists to report objectively while traveling with troops during war . jo groebel , director of the german digital institute , has written and edited numerous books about new media and the internet .
" aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which he co-edited with robert a. hinde , dissects human aggression and war . dw-radio : why has embedding journalists become a popular way to report on war ? jo groebel : the term " embedded journalist " made the headlines during the iraq war when the united states entered the country .
lots of journalists were more or less siding with the soldiers entering the country .
the idea there was , rather than having reporting with this certain distance to what 's actually going on , that journalists would have a first-hand image and first-hand impression of what 's going on .
criticism has , of course , been addressing the fact that someone so close to a certain war party may lose his or her neutrality and objectivity . in your opinion , is it possible for an embedded journalist to be critical or does he have to satisfy the government upon which he relies for his information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if news from reporters traveling with soldiers can remain objective well , i think it 's probably more psychological than immediately some kind of oppression .
certainly , there is a danger if i 'm siding with certain soldiers and there are attacks , there may be what in a completely different context one called the stockholm syndrome .
even if you are critical of those who are there , the pure fact that there is a certain closeness and common threat coming from the other side may interfere with objectivity .
and there 's another side to it that one would probably only pick those journalists who are sympathetic with those they are accompanying . do you think it is possible for a journalist , whether he 's imbedded or not , to do objective reporting in a war situation ? in war itself , it 's nearly impossible to come up with a final truth .
i suppose this is far beyond a question of whether there 's embedded journalism or not .
one could even claim that journalism and fact reporting itself is something which is a very tricky thing to relate immediately to any kind of proof . there have been some reports that pictures broadcast from the last two persian gulf wars were faked .
how badly manipulated are reports by embedded journalists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military also maintains a supply of reporter-soldiers i would say this is a more fundamental challenge than particularly with embedded journalists .
war automatically means also war about public opinion .
all armies do have battalions of people who are only dealing with the interpretation or manipulation of facts .
embedded journalism clearly has the aim to create sympathy among those who are accompanying the army and the soldiers .
i suppose it 's kind of more of a variation of what already always has been the somewhat tricky approach to truth and objective journalism in a war situation . another us war that got huge media coverage was the vietnam war in the 1970s .
can the media output of the vietnam war be compared in any way to the current war in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas masks are part of the equipment of a war correspondent i suppose what 's definitely pretty similar is that you see a shift in change in public opinion , most certainly within the united states .
with or without imbedded journalism , you ca n't really control all of those images coming from the war .
so with the increasing number of images of victims nearly daily and -lrb- images of -rrb- all the dead soldiers , particularly american soldiers and also iraqis , it becomes increasingly obvious that this is probably a war which can not be won .
this is certainly a similarity with vietnam .
starting out , loyalty with government .
then , a real shift due to images , again , with or without embedded journalism , regarding the real face of the war .
and i suppose public opinion now has certainly changed due to media reporting . kerstin winter interviewed jo groebel -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us soldier found guilty of desertion at trial in germany as an american is convicted of desertion for his attempts to leave the army , organizations in germany that counsel soldiers on how they can avoid being sent to war said they 've been flooded with inquires .
-lrb- 06.03.2007 -rrb- britain , denmark to pull out troops from iraq britain , along with denmark , confirmed it would begin a major troop withdrawal from iraq in coming months and lithuania too has indicated it may follow suit .
washington however denies its coalition is crumbling .
-lrb- 21.02.2007 -rrb- propaganda wars fight for headlines in the middle east jo groebel , the director of the german digital institute , spoke with dw-world.de about the media coverage of the middle east and why violence dominates news reports while peace is seldom mentioned .

" aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which he co-edited with robert a. hinde , dissects human aggression and war . dw-radio : why has embedding journalists become a popular way to report on war ? jo groebel : the term " embedded journalist " made the headlines during the iraq war when the united states entered the country .
lots of journalists were more or less siding with the soldiers entering the country .
the idea there was , rather than having reporting with this certain distance to what 's actually going on , that journalists would have a first-hand image and first-hand impression of what 's going on .
criticism has , of course , been addressing the fact that someone so close to a certain war party may lose his or her neutrality and objectivity . in your opinion , is it possible for an embedded journalist to be critical or does he have to satisfy the government upon which he relies for his information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if news from reporters traveling with soldiers can remain objective well , i think it 's probably more psychological than immediately some kind of oppression .
certainly , there is a danger if i 'm siding with certain soldiers and there are attacks , there may be what in a completely different context one called the stockholm syndrome .
even if you are critical of those who are there , the pure fact that there is a certain closeness and common threat coming from the other side may interfere with objectivity .
and there 's another side to it that one would probably only pick those journalists who are sympathetic with those they are accompanying . do you think it is possible for a journalist , whether he 's imbedded or not , to do objective reporting in a war situation ? in war itself , it 's nearly impossible to come up with a final truth .
i suppose this is far beyond a question of whether there 's embedded journalism or not .
one could even claim that journalism and fact reporting itself is something which is a very tricky thing to relate immediately to any kind of proof . there have been some reports that pictures broadcast from the last two persian gulf wars were faked .
how badly manipulated are reports by embedded journalists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military also maintains a supply of reporter-soldiers i would say this is a more fundamental challenge than particularly with embedded journalists .
war automatically means also war about public opinion .
all armies do have battalions of people who are only dealing with the interpretation or manipulation of facts .
embedded journalism clearly has the aim to create sympathy among those who are accompanying the army and the soldiers .
i suppose it 's kind of more of a variation of what already always has been the somewhat tricky approach to truth and objective journalism in a war situation . another us war that got huge media coverage was the vietnam war in the 1970s .
can the media output of the vietnam war be compared in any way to the current war in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas masks are part of the equipment of a war correspondent i suppose what 's definitely pretty similar is that you see a shift in change in public opinion , most certainly within the united states .
with or without imbedded journalism , you ca n't really control all of those images coming from the war .
so with the increasing number of images of victims nearly daily and -lrb- images of -rrb- all the dead soldiers , particularly american soldiers and also iraqis , it becomes increasingly obvious that this is probably a war which can not be won .
this is certainly a similarity with vietnam .
starting out , loyalty with government .
then , a real shift due to images , again , with or without embedded journalism , regarding the real face of the war .
and i suppose public opinion now has certainly changed due to media reporting . kerstin winter interviewed jo groebel -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us soldier found guilty of desertion at trial in germany as an american is convicted of desertion for his attempts to leave the army , organizations in germany that counsel soldiers on how they can avoid being sent to war said they 've been flooded with inquires .

the bloc also wants to open the market for letters under 50 grams -lrb- 1.8 ounces -rrb- to private carriers and thereby get rid of state postal monopolies . deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel has used profits from the traditional mail service to transform the company into a major player in the global transport and logistics market . still , delivering letters remains a vital part of the deutsche post .

the civil trial is expected to last several weeks . the staff are charged with mistreating recruits during allegedly unapproved exercises meant to toughen them up in the case of a hostage situation .
there was a national outcry after german media reported on the alleged abuse . robbe said he was convinced the coesfeld methods were not typical of the german army , and his report said such treatment did not occur at other military bases .

no widespread mistreatment of recruits was found . the german parliament 's military commissioner reinhold robbe released his annual report tuesday about the shortcomings of the german armed forces .
at the top of the list , robbe said the bundeswehr is underfinanced . the lack of money causes problems for soldiers in several ways , the report said .
robbe decried the decaying condition of many of the military barracks .
some are filled with mold and ready to collapse , with disgusting bathrooms . he also pointed out that soldiers are worried about their personal financial situations and remain at the bottom of their income groups . foreign missions causing financial strain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some military barracks are in bad condition the military 's financial strain needs to be taken into account before the government agrees to new deployments , robbe said .
there are some fears that germany 's army of 245,000 is overstretched , although only a relatively small percentage are engaged in foreign peacekeeping missions .
there are currently 9,000 soldiers on foreign missions in places like afghanistan , lebanon and the balkans . " in every single case it needs to be tested whether the bundeswehr is overburdened or overextended , " he said . robbe , a social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentarian , is the designated defense commissioner for the german parliament .
his role is to provide the government with an annual report about problems with the military .
he also warns politicians about any problems in the military and to be an outside point of contact for soldiers . mistreatment not widespread bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recruits not mishandled , report says the german army has dealt with several high-profile scandals recently .
seven german soldiers face court martial for photographs which depict them posing and playing with human skulls while stationed in afghanistan . on monday , a separate trial of 18 training staff began , charging the staff of mistreating as many as 163 armed forces personnel in 2004 at a base in coesfeld near the northern german city of münster .
the civil trial is expected to last several weeks . the staff are charged with mistreating recruits during allegedly unapproved exercises meant to toughen them up in the case of a hostage situation .
there was a national outcry after german media reported on the alleged abuse . robbe said he was convinced the coesfeld methods were not typical of the german army , and his report said such treatment did not occur at other military bases .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.03.2007 germany 's deutsche post wants europe to open markets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mail competition is likely to heat up in europe deutsche post 's monopoly on letter delivery will end next year .
even as the company struggles to remain profitable , most other european union countries are reluctant to liberalize their mail markets . deutsche post stocks fell 6 percent tuesday after the company announced its 2007 earnings will fall short of predictions . europe 's largest mail service provider has tried to diversify and take a more international approach in recent years . at the same time , many other eu countries have dragged their feet on liberalizing their own mail monopolies .
deutsche post said it 's worried this attitude will put them at a disadvantage . domestic postal services in eu countries are scheduled to be completely opened to competition by 2009 .
the bloc also wants to open the market for letters under 50 grams -lrb- 1.8 ounces -rrb- to private carriers and thereby get rid of state postal monopolies . deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel has used profits from the traditional mail service to transform the company into a major player in the global transport and logistics market . still , delivering letters remains a vital part of the deutsche post .
even with the company 's big push in recent years into international logistics , freight and express mail , normal mail delivery remains responsible for 25 percent of the company 's gross income , and more than 60 percent of its profit . post wants liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel wants european postal markets opened to competition zumwinkel ha said he is not against liberalization in the postal sector .
in fact , he 's betting on his company moving into liberalized postal markets of other eu countries .
but he also said he worries about competition being distorted by unequal liberalization . a date needs to be fixed for other countries to open their markets to competition , zumwinkel said , adding that it does n't bother him if germany is one of the first to do so , but " the date must be fixed . " " we 're saying : liberalization is good .
liberalization should be .
but it must take place in lockstep in europe , " zumwinkel added . zumwinkel said deutsche post would insist on reciprocity .
if germany opens its market , all european countries should do the same .
germany , the united kingdom and scandinavian countries have said they will allow foreign competition in their postal markets .
france , poland , greece , italy , spain are among the european countries reluctant to give up their postal monopolies . this reluctance goes against the idea at the basis of forming the european union , zumwinkel said .
it was supposed to mean getting rid of tariffs and forming common markets . " you ca n't say , ' i 'm going to do this to you , but you ca n't do this to me , " ' he said .
" that 's not how it works . " deutsche post employs 80,000 people in europe to deliver letters .
a 20-percent loss could endanger 32,000 jobs .
many postal employees are public servants , which makes it extremyl difficult for the post to lay them off or cut their pay . delivering mail big business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monopolists want to make sure all people get their mail it 's not only the german postal service that is labor-intensive .
in the european union , 1.6 million people work as postal carriers .
it is a $ 90 billion market . countries are concerned about issues like universal coverage as public postal carriers are required to deliver mail at acceptable prices to remote regions five days a week , even if it is n't profitable to do so . countries also worry that opening the market will lead to the tendency to find low-paid workers to deliver mail .
this is already happening to an extent in germany , with some private companies paying wages as low as four euros per hour to deliver parcels .
deutsche post also takes advantage of cheap labor .
since 2000 , the company has shed 34,000 part and full time positions , turning to subcontractors in some cases . the german government has said despite other countries ' reluctance to end their own letter-delivery monopolies , it will go forward with its plan to open its system to competition in 2008 . karl zawadzky -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks open postal markets by 2009 the european commission laid out plans to complete the opening of the european union 's postal-services market to competition by 2009 despite fierce opposition from some countries .

" poland is the only country apart from belarus where this issue has never been settled , " said jehuda evron , chairman of the us-based holocaust restitution committee . he called on polish lawmakers to act so elderly victims of expropriation " at the end of their lives should have a feeling that justice has been done . " jewish and non-jewish groups have joined forces to step up the pressure as poland 's parliament makes its 17th attempt to come up with legislation to settle the issue . a draft bill currently before parliament , which would pay 15 percent compensation to former owners and their heirs , has drawn criticism from the groups . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has had to face claims since it joined the eu in 2004 " we demand that a law is passed quickly to allow former property owners to recover their real estate , where possible , and where it is not , that they are compensated , " said miroslaw szypowski , head of the national association of former property owners . " the government has n't consulted us , " he added , referring to the 250,000-member polish property-owners ' association .
" it 's as if we do n't exist . " doing their utmost last month , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski told a delegation of jewish campaigners that his government would do its utmost to ensure parliament passed a compensation law by the end of the year . the value of seized property for which compensation is being sought is estimated at 16 billion euros to 18 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.3 billion to $ 23.9 billion -rrb- , according to the property owners ' association . jewish property was seized by nazi germany after the invasion of poland in 1939 . after world war ii , poland 's new soviet-inspired communist government nationalized property from non-jewish poles and from the few jews who had survived the holocaust . german claims attacked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is trying to improve ties between the two on monday , kaczynski also slammed the german government for failing to halt property claims by germans expelled at the end of world war ii from newly polish territory . " i must underline that in order to have genuinely normal relations between poland and germany ... this issue must be settled , " kaczynski told reporters , in the wake of a visit to poland by german chancellor angela merkel . kaczynski bemoaned the fact that merkel 's position during her visit " proved that there has been no progress on this issue . " merkel 's trip was aimed at patching up relations between warsaw and berlin , which have seen the historic wound of the nazi occupation of poland reopened since poland 's conservative twins - the premier and his brother president lech kaczynski - came to power . no government support in a speech at warsaw university on friday , merkel said berlin did not and would not support the prussian trust , a small german association which filed 22 claims late last year at the european court of human rights seeking the restitution of property that lies in present-day poland . warsaw , however , has repeatedly called on the german government to do more , notably by acting to prevent property lawsuits being brought by individuals . kaczynski , who has launched a series of stinging verbal attacks on berlin about the issue , said poland was pressing germany " to decide finally to make a clear declaration that these claims have no basis in german and international law . " the claims stem from the redrawing of borders agreed by the soviet union , britain and the united states at the 1945 potsdam conference which saw large parts of eastern germany awarded to poland , which in turn lost a swathe of its own eastern territory to the soviets . millions of germans living in what is now northern and western poland were expelled , leaving behind property and land . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor merkel heads to poland as tensions remain high german chancellor angela merkel put improving bilateral ties high on her agenda before leaving for talks in warsaw .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.03.2007 germany 's deutsche post wants europe to open markets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mail competition is likely to heat up in europe deutsche post 's monopoly on letter delivery will end next year .
even as the company struggles to remain profitable , most other european union countries are reluctant to liberalize their mail markets . deutsche post stocks fell 6 percent tuesday after the company announced its 2007 earnings will fall short of predictions . europe 's largest mail service provider has tried to diversify and take a more international approach in recent years . at the same time , many other eu countries have dragged their feet on liberalizing their own mail monopolies .
deutsche post said it 's worried this attitude will put them at a disadvantage . domestic postal services in eu countries are scheduled to be completely opened to competition by 2009 .
the bloc also wants to open the market for letters under 50 grams -lrb- 1.8 ounces -rrb- to private carriers and thereby get rid of state postal monopolies . deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel has used profits from the traditional mail service to transform the company into a major player in the global transport and logistics market . still , delivering letters remains a vital part of the deutsche post .
even with the company 's big push in recent years into international logistics , freight and express mail , normal mail delivery remains responsible for 25 percent of the company 's gross income , and more than 60 percent of its profit . post wants liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel wants european postal markets opened to competition zumwinkel ha said he is not against liberalization in the postal sector .
in fact , he 's betting on his company moving into liberalized postal markets of other eu countries .
but he also said he worries about competition being distorted by unequal liberalization . a date needs to be fixed for other countries to open their markets to competition , zumwinkel said , adding that it does n't bother him if germany is one of the first to do so , but " the date must be fixed . " " we 're saying : liberalization is good .
liberalization should be .
but it must take place in lockstep in europe , " zumwinkel added . zumwinkel said deutsche post would insist on reciprocity .
if germany opens its market , all european countries should do the same .
germany , the united kingdom and scandinavian countries have said they will allow foreign competition in their postal markets .
france , poland , greece , italy , spain are among the european countries reluctant to give up their postal monopolies . this reluctance goes against the idea at the basis of forming the european union , zumwinkel said .
it was supposed to mean getting rid of tariffs and forming common markets . " you ca n't say , ' i 'm going to do this to you , but you ca n't do this to me , " ' he said .
" that 's not how it works . " deutsche post employs 80,000 people in europe to deliver letters .
a 20-percent loss could endanger 32,000 jobs .
many postal employees are public servants , which makes it extremyl difficult for the post to lay them off or cut their pay . delivering mail big business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monopolists want to make sure all people get their mail it 's not only the german postal service that is labor-intensive .
in the european union , 1.6 million people work as postal carriers .
it is a $ 90 billion market . countries are concerned about issues like universal coverage as public postal carriers are required to deliver mail at acceptable prices to remote regions five days a week , even if it is n't profitable to do so . countries also worry that opening the market will lead to the tendency to find low-paid workers to deliver mail .
this is already happening to an extent in germany , with some private companies paying wages as low as four euros per hour to deliver parcels .
deutsche post also takes advantage of cheap labor .
since 2000 , the company has shed 34,000 part and full time positions , turning to subcontractors in some cases . the german government has said despite other countries ' reluctance to end their own letter-delivery monopolies , it will go forward with its plan to open its system to competition in 2008 . karl zawadzky -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks open postal markets by 2009 the european commission laid out plans to complete the opening of the european union 's postal-services market to competition by 2009 despite fierce opposition from some countries .
-lrb- 19.10.2006 -rrb- deutsche post bags british health services contract germany 's deutsche post has won a 2.3 billion-euro -lrb- $ 2.96 billion -rrb- contract , its largest ever , from britain 's national health service -lrb- nhs -rrb- , a spokeswoman for the company said .
-lrb- 05.09.2006 -rrb- deutsche post to buy uk 's exel deutsche post , the semi-privatized german postal service , has offered to buy british firm exel for 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- .
the deal would create the world 's biggest logistics company .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.03.2007 reporting has changed public 's opinion of iraq war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists want to get a close-up view of the war on the fourth anniversary of the us-led invasion of iraq , on tuesday , media analyst jo groebel said it remains difficult for journalists to report objectively while traveling with troops during war . jo groebel , director of the german digital institute , has written and edited numerous books about new media and the internet .
" aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which he co-edited with robert a. hinde , dissects human aggression and war . dw-radio : why has embedding journalists become a popular way to report on war ? jo groebel : the term " embedded journalist " made the headlines during the iraq war when the united states entered the country .
lots of journalists were more or less siding with the soldiers entering the country .
the idea there was , rather than having reporting with this certain distance to what 's actually going on , that journalists would have a first-hand image and first-hand impression of what 's going on .
criticism has , of course , been addressing the fact that someone so close to a certain war party may lose his or her neutrality and objectivity . in your opinion , is it possible for an embedded journalist to be critical or does he have to satisfy the government upon which he relies for his information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if news from reporters traveling with soldiers can remain objective well , i think it 's probably more psychological than immediately some kind of oppression .
certainly , there is a danger if i 'm siding with certain soldiers and there are attacks , there may be what in a completely different context one called the stockholm syndrome .
even if you are critical of those who are there , the pure fact that there is a certain closeness and common threat coming from the other side may interfere with objectivity .
and there 's another side to it that one would probably only pick those journalists who are sympathetic with those they are accompanying . do you think it is possible for a journalist , whether he 's imbedded or not , to do objective reporting in a war situation ? in war itself , it 's nearly impossible to come up with a final truth .
i suppose this is far beyond a question of whether there 's embedded journalism or not .
one could even claim that journalism and fact reporting itself is something which is a very tricky thing to relate immediately to any kind of proof . there have been some reports that pictures broadcast from the last two persian gulf wars were faked .
how badly manipulated are reports by embedded journalists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military also maintains a supply of reporter-soldiers i would say this is a more fundamental challenge than particularly with embedded journalists .
war automatically means also war about public opinion .
all armies do have battalions of people who are only dealing with the interpretation or manipulation of facts .
embedded journalism clearly has the aim to create sympathy among those who are accompanying the army and the soldiers .
i suppose it 's kind of more of a variation of what already always has been the somewhat tricky approach to truth and objective journalism in a war situation . another us war that got huge media coverage was the vietnam war in the 1970s .
can the media output of the vietnam war be compared in any way to the current war in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas masks are part of the equipment of a war correspondent i suppose what 's definitely pretty similar is that you see a shift in change in public opinion , most certainly within the united states .
with or without imbedded journalism , you ca n't really control all of those images coming from the war .
so with the increasing number of images of victims nearly daily and -lrb- images of -rrb- all the dead soldiers , particularly american soldiers and also iraqis , it becomes increasingly obvious that this is probably a war which can not be won .
this is certainly a similarity with vietnam .
starting out , loyalty with government .
then , a real shift due to images , again , with or without embedded journalism , regarding the real face of the war .
and i suppose public opinion now has certainly changed due to media reporting . kerstin winter interviewed jo groebel -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us soldier found guilty of desertion at trial in germany as an american is convicted of desertion for his attempts to leave the army , organizations in germany that counsel soldiers on how they can avoid being sent to war said they 've been flooded with inquires .
-lrb- 06.03.2007 -rrb- britain , denmark to pull out troops from iraq britain , along with denmark , confirmed it would begin a major troop withdrawal from iraq in coming months and lithuania too has indicated it may follow suit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.03.2007 germany 's deutsche post wants europe to open markets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mail competition is likely to heat up in europe deutsche post 's monopoly on letter delivery will end next year .
even as the company struggles to remain profitable , most other european union countries are reluctant to liberalize their mail markets . deutsche post stocks fell 6 percent tuesday after the company announced its 2007 earnings will fall short of predictions . europe 's largest mail service provider has tried to diversify and take a more international approach in recent years . at the same time , many other eu countries have dragged their feet on liberalizing their own mail monopolies .
deutsche post said it 's worried this attitude will put them at a disadvantage . domestic postal services in eu countries are scheduled to be completely opened to competition by 2009 .
the bloc also wants to open the market for letters under 50 grams -lrb- 1.8 ounces -rrb- to private carriers and thereby get rid of state postal monopolies . deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel has used profits from the traditional mail service to transform the company into a major player in the global transport and logistics market . still , delivering letters remains a vital part of the deutsche post .
even with the company 's big push in recent years into international logistics , freight and express mail , normal mail delivery remains responsible for 25 percent of the company 's gross income , and more than 60 percent of its profit . post wants liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel wants european postal markets opened to competition zumwinkel ha said he is not against liberalization in the postal sector .
in fact , he 's betting on his company moving into liberalized postal markets of other eu countries .
but he also said he worries about competition being distorted by unequal liberalization . a date needs to be fixed for other countries to open their markets to competition , zumwinkel said , adding that it does n't bother him if germany is one of the first to do so , but " the date must be fixed . " " we 're saying : liberalization is good .
liberalization should be .
but it must take place in lockstep in europe , " zumwinkel added . zumwinkel said deutsche post would insist on reciprocity .
if germany opens its market , all european countries should do the same .
germany , the united kingdom and scandinavian countries have said they will allow foreign competition in their postal markets .
france , poland , greece , italy , spain are among the european countries reluctant to give up their postal monopolies . this reluctance goes against the idea at the basis of forming the european union , zumwinkel said .
it was supposed to mean getting rid of tariffs and forming common markets . " you ca n't say , ' i 'm going to do this to you , but you ca n't do this to me , " ' he said .
" that 's not how it works . " deutsche post employs 80,000 people in europe to deliver letters .
a 20-percent loss could endanger 32,000 jobs .
many postal employees are public servants , which makes it extremyl difficult for the post to lay them off or cut their pay . delivering mail big business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monopolists want to make sure all people get their mail it 's not only the german postal service that is labor-intensive .
in the european union , 1.6 million people work as postal carriers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.03.2007 germany 's deutsche post wants europe to open markets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mail competition is likely to heat up in europe deutsche post 's monopoly on letter delivery will end next year .
even as the company struggles to remain profitable , most other european union countries are reluctant to liberalize their mail markets . deutsche post stocks fell 6 percent tuesday after the company announced its 2007 earnings will fall short of predictions . europe 's largest mail service provider has tried to diversify and take a more international approach in recent years . at the same time , many other eu countries have dragged their feet on liberalizing their own mail monopolies .
deutsche post said it 's worried this attitude will put them at a disadvantage . domestic postal services in eu countries are scheduled to be completely opened to competition by 2009 .
the bloc also wants to open the market for letters under 50 grams -lrb- 1.8 ounces -rrb- to private carriers and thereby get rid of state postal monopolies . deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel has used profits from the traditional mail service to transform the company into a major player in the global transport and logistics market . still , delivering letters remains a vital part of the deutsche post .
even with the company 's big push in recent years into international logistics , freight and express mail , normal mail delivery remains responsible for 25 percent of the company 's gross income , and more than 60 percent of its profit . post wants liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel wants european postal markets opened to competition zumwinkel ha said he is not against liberalization in the postal sector .
in fact , he 's betting on his company moving into liberalized postal markets of other eu countries .
but he also said he worries about competition being distorted by unequal liberalization . a date needs to be fixed for other countries to open their markets to competition , zumwinkel said , adding that it does n't bother him if germany is one of the first to do so , but " the date must be fixed . " " we 're saying : liberalization is good .
liberalization should be .
but it must take place in lockstep in europe , " zumwinkel added . zumwinkel said deutsche post would insist on reciprocity .
if germany opens its market , all european countries should do the same .
germany , the united kingdom and scandinavian countries have said they will allow foreign competition in their postal markets .
france , poland , greece , italy , spain are among the european countries reluctant to give up their postal monopolies . this reluctance goes against the idea at the basis of forming the european union , zumwinkel said .
it was supposed to mean getting rid of tariffs and forming common markets . " you ca n't say , ' i 'm going to do this to you , but you ca n't do this to me , " ' he said .
" that 's not how it works . " deutsche post employs 80,000 people in europe to deliver letters .
a 20-percent loss could endanger 32,000 jobs .
many postal employees are public servants , which makes it extremyl difficult for the post to lay them off or cut their pay . delivering mail big business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monopolists want to make sure all people get their mail it 's not only the german postal service that is labor-intensive .
in the european union , 1.6 million people work as postal carriers .
it is a $ 90 billion market . countries are concerned about issues like universal coverage as public postal carriers are required to deliver mail at acceptable prices to remote regions five days a week , even if it is n't profitable to do so . countries also worry that opening the market will lead to the tendency to find low-paid workers to deliver mail .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 20.03.2007 schalke and bremen battle for the title großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's way too early for leaders schalke to start celebrating a tight race at the top and a fierce struggle at the bottom promise lots of excitement for the final quarter to the season .
who will win and lose these clashes comes down to team schedules , injuries and nerves . schalke got a boast from a long-time rival and detractor on tuesday , when bayern munich president franz beckenbauer told the tabloid bild newspaper he thinks the men in blue will take their first german title in 49 years . but the kaiser has a history of mistaken predictions , and schalke 's path to a possible trophy is rockier than it may appear at first glance .
in fact , the league leaders ' chances at the title are probably no better than those of their nearest rivals , second-placed werder bremen . home advantage versus historical baggage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have diego while schalke 's lincoln is serving a suspension schalke currently top the table by three points , but their lead is actually smaller than that .
thanks to werder 's better goal difference , a single schalke loss combined with a bremen victory would flip the two teams in the standings . that loss could come as soon as march 31 , after the bundesliga concludes its current one-week break .
schalke play bayern in munich on that date - whereas bremen no longer face the reigning champions . and then there 's the weight of history .
schalke are under enormous pressure to become german champions for the first time in nearly half-a-century .
the perennial bridesmaids in blue have shown jitters of late , and last weekend 's win over stuttgart was more luck than performance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen striker miroslav klose has been laid low in 2007 werder only play at home three times in final eight matches .
but bremen have performed equally well away as in weser stadium this season , and none of their remaining opponents are currently in the top five . bremen 's biggest worry is striker miroslav klose , who 's been ailing for most of 2007 .
if werder are to make up their deficit with schalke , they 'll need their top goal-getter to get on form . the crucial third spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without gomez , stuttgart will need a team effort stuttgart and bayern still have an outside shot at the title , should both of the favourites implode , but more likely they 'll be battling for third place and a chance to qualify for the champions league . stuttgart 's main problem is the absence of their main offensive weapon , striker mario gomez , who 's out for around five weeks with injuries .
as last week 's loss to schalke showed , it 's impossible to win games without scoring any goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern really need to beat southern german rivals stuttgart but bayern have the far tougher schedule .
they play three of their last eight games against current top-five teams , compared to stuttgart 's one , and have the additional burden of champions league matches in early april against ac milan . the crucial date here is april 21 , when the two teams lock horns in stuttgart .
if the hosts get a result , bayern could well fail to qualify for the champions league for the first time since 1995 . the elevator down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund went into free fall in february mönchengladbach , bielefeld and bochum currently occupy the drop zone and are most likely to be relegated .
but plenty teams are teetering on the edge of the precipice , including bundesliga giants hamburg and dortmund , and popular underdogs mainz . the signs are most positive for hamburg .
they play 5 of their final matches at home and only 2 against top-five clubs .
if playmaker rafael van der vaart stays fit , hamburg should stay up . dortmund have it considerably harder .
they have only 3 home games and an equal number against top opposition .
moreover they 're on a downward curve , having not won since mid-february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiny mainz still have a lot of work against bigger opponents meanwhile , mainz 's miracle comeback could falter due to a back-loaded schedule featuring clashes with leverkusen , schalke , stuttgart and , on the last day of the season , bayern .
dead last at the winter break , mainz could come up heartbreakingly short as the 2006-7 campaign comes to what 's sure to be an exciting conclusion . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen still in the hunt behind schalke as bayern , stuttgart fall a 2-0 home win for werder bremen over mainz sunday reduced schalke 04 's lead at the top of the bundesliga to three points .
schalke beat third-placed stuttgart saturday while fourth-placed bayern munich lost in frankfurt .
-lrb- 19.03.2007 -rrb- managerial musical chairs no surprise for dortmund fans many soccer fans will be incredulous that borussia dortmund are on their third coach of the season .
but supporters of the rhine valley giants will be less surprised .

even as the company struggles to remain profitable , most other european union countries are reluctant to liberalize their mail markets . deutsche post stocks fell 6 percent tuesday after the company announced its 2007 earnings will fall short of predictions . europe 's largest mail service provider has tried to diversify and take a more international approach in recent years . at the same time , many other eu countries have dragged their feet on liberalizing their own mail monopolies .
deutsche post said it 's worried this attitude will put them at a disadvantage . domestic postal services in eu countries are scheduled to be completely opened to competition by 2009 .
the bloc also wants to open the market for letters under 50 grams -lrb- 1.8 ounces -rrb- to private carriers and thereby get rid of state postal monopolies . deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel has used profits from the traditional mail service to transform the company into a major player in the global transport and logistics market . still , delivering letters remains a vital part of the deutsche post .
even with the company 's big push in recent years into international logistics , freight and express mail , normal mail delivery remains responsible for 25 percent of the company 's gross income , and more than 60 percent of its profit . post wants liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel wants european postal markets opened to competition zumwinkel ha said he is not against liberalization in the postal sector .
in fact , he 's betting on his company moving into liberalized postal markets of other eu countries .
but he also said he worries about competition being distorted by unequal liberalization . a date needs to be fixed for other countries to open their markets to competition , zumwinkel said , adding that it does n't bother him if germany is one of the first to do so , but " the date must be fixed . " " we 're saying : liberalization is good .
liberalization should be .
but it must take place in lockstep in europe , " zumwinkel added . zumwinkel said deutsche post would insist on reciprocity .
if germany opens its market , all european countries should do the same .
germany , the united kingdom and scandinavian countries have said they will allow foreign competition in their postal markets .
france , poland , greece , italy , spain are among the european countries reluctant to give up their postal monopolies . this reluctance goes against the idea at the basis of forming the european union , zumwinkel said .
it was supposed to mean getting rid of tariffs and forming common markets . " you ca n't say , ' i 'm going to do this to you , but you ca n't do this to me , " ' he said .
" that 's not how it works . " deutsche post employs 80,000 people in europe to deliver letters .
a 20-percent loss could endanger 32,000 jobs .
many postal employees are public servants , which makes it extremyl difficult for the post to lay them off or cut their pay . delivering mail big business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monopolists want to make sure all people get their mail it 's not only the german postal service that is labor-intensive .
in the european union , 1.6 million people work as postal carriers .
it is a $ 90 billion market . countries are concerned about issues like universal coverage as public postal carriers are required to deliver mail at acceptable prices to remote regions five days a week , even if it is n't profitable to do so . countries also worry that opening the market will lead to the tendency to find low-paid workers to deliver mail .
this is already happening to an extent in germany , with some private companies paying wages as low as four euros per hour to deliver parcels .
deutsche post also takes advantage of cheap labor .
since 2000 , the company has shed 34,000 part and full time positions , turning to subcontractors in some cases . the german government has said despite other countries ' reluctance to end their own letter-delivery monopolies , it will go forward with its plan to open its system to competition in 2008 . karl zawadzky -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks open postal markets by 2009 the european commission laid out plans to complete the opening of the european union 's postal-services market to competition by 2009 despite fierce opposition from some countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 20.03.2007 schalke and bremen battle for the title großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's way too early for leaders schalke to start celebrating a tight race at the top and a fierce struggle at the bottom promise lots of excitement for the final quarter to the season .
who will win and lose these clashes comes down to team schedules , injuries and nerves . schalke got a boast from a long-time rival and detractor on tuesday , when bayern munich president franz beckenbauer told the tabloid bild newspaper he thinks the men in blue will take their first german title in 49 years . but the kaiser has a history of mistaken predictions , and schalke 's path to a possible trophy is rockier than it may appear at first glance .
in fact , the league leaders ' chances at the title are probably no better than those of their nearest rivals , second-placed werder bremen . home advantage versus historical baggage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have diego while schalke 's lincoln is serving a suspension schalke currently top the table by three points , but their lead is actually smaller than that .
thanks to werder 's better goal difference , a single schalke loss combined with a bremen victory would flip the two teams in the standings . that loss could come as soon as march 31 , after the bundesliga concludes its current one-week break .
schalke play bayern in munich on that date - whereas bremen no longer face the reigning champions . and then there 's the weight of history .
schalke are under enormous pressure to become german champions for the first time in nearly half-a-century .
the perennial bridesmaids in blue have shown jitters of late , and last weekend 's win over stuttgart was more luck than performance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen striker miroslav klose has been laid low in 2007 werder only play at home three times in final eight matches .
but bremen have performed equally well away as in weser stadium this season , and none of their remaining opponents are currently in the top five . bremen 's biggest worry is striker miroslav klose , who 's been ailing for most of 2007 .
if werder are to make up their deficit with schalke , they 'll need their top goal-getter to get on form . the crucial third spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without gomez , stuttgart will need a team effort stuttgart and bayern still have an outside shot at the title , should both of the favourites implode , but more likely they 'll be battling for third place and a chance to qualify for the champions league . stuttgart 's main problem is the absence of their main offensive weapon , striker mario gomez , who 's out for around five weeks with injuries .
as last week 's loss to schalke showed , it 's impossible to win games without scoring any goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern really need to beat southern german rivals stuttgart but bayern have the far tougher schedule .
they play three of their last eight games against current top-five teams , compared to stuttgart 's one , and have the additional burden of champions league matches in early april against ac milan . the crucial date here is april 21 , when the two teams lock horns in stuttgart .
if the hosts get a result , bayern could well fail to qualify for the champions league for the first time since 1995 . the elevator down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund went into free fall in february mönchengladbach , bielefeld and bochum currently occupy the drop zone and are most likely to be relegated .
but plenty teams are teetering on the edge of the precipice , including bundesliga giants hamburg and dortmund , and popular underdogs mainz . the signs are most positive for hamburg .
they play 5 of their final matches at home and only 2 against top-five clubs .
if playmaker rafael van der vaart stays fit , hamburg should stay up . dortmund have it considerably harder .
they have only 3 home games and an equal number against top opposition .
moreover they 're on a downward curve , having not won since mid-february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiny mainz still have a lot of work against bigger opponents meanwhile , mainz 's miracle comeback could falter due to a back-loaded schedule featuring clashes with leverkusen , schalke , stuttgart and , on the last day of the season , bayern .
dead last at the winter break , mainz could come up heartbreakingly short as the 2006-7 campaign comes to what 's sure to be an exciting conclusion . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen still in the hunt behind schalke as bayern , stuttgart fall a 2-0 home win for werder bremen over mainz sunday reduced schalke 04 's lead at the top of the bundesliga to three points .
schalke beat third-placed stuttgart saturday while fourth-placed bayern munich lost in frankfurt .
-lrb- 19.03.2007 -rrb- managerial musical chairs no surprise for dortmund fans many soccer fans will be incredulous that borussia dortmund are on their third coach of the season .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 20.03.2007 reporting has changed public 's opinion of iraq war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists want to get a close-up view of the war on the fourth anniversary of the us-led invasion of iraq , on tuesday , media analyst jo groebel said it remains difficult for journalists to report objectively while traveling with troops during war . jo groebel , director of the german digital institute , has written and edited numerous books about new media and the internet .
" aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which he co-edited with robert a. hinde , dissects human aggression and war . dw-radio : why has embedding journalists become a popular way to report on war ? jo groebel : the term " embedded journalist " made the headlines during the iraq war when the united states entered the country .
lots of journalists were more or less siding with the soldiers entering the country .
the idea there was , rather than having reporting with this certain distance to what 's actually going on , that journalists would have a first-hand image and first-hand impression of what 's going on .
criticism has , of course , been addressing the fact that someone so close to a certain war party may lose his or her neutrality and objectivity . in your opinion , is it possible for an embedded journalist to be critical or does he have to satisfy the government upon which he relies for his information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if news from reporters traveling with soldiers can remain objective well , i think it 's probably more psychological than immediately some kind of oppression .
certainly , there is a danger if i 'm siding with certain soldiers and there are attacks , there may be what in a completely different context one called the stockholm syndrome .
even if you are critical of those who are there , the pure fact that there is a certain closeness and common threat coming from the other side may interfere with objectivity .
and there 's another side to it that one would probably only pick those journalists who are sympathetic with those they are accompanying . do you think it is possible for a journalist , whether he 's imbedded or not , to do objective reporting in a war situation ? in war itself , it 's nearly impossible to come up with a final truth .
i suppose this is far beyond a question of whether there 's embedded journalism or not .
one could even claim that journalism and fact reporting itself is something which is a very tricky thing to relate immediately to any kind of proof . there have been some reports that pictures broadcast from the last two persian gulf wars were faked .
how badly manipulated are reports by embedded journalists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military also maintains a supply of reporter-soldiers i would say this is a more fundamental challenge than particularly with embedded journalists .
war automatically means also war about public opinion .
all armies do have battalions of people who are only dealing with the interpretation or manipulation of facts .
embedded journalism clearly has the aim to create sympathy among those who are accompanying the army and the soldiers .
i suppose it 's kind of more of a variation of what already always has been the somewhat tricky approach to truth and objective journalism in a war situation . another us war that got huge media coverage was the vietnam war in the 1970s .
can the media output of the vietnam war be compared in any way to the current war in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas masks are part of the equipment of a war correspondent i suppose what 's definitely pretty similar is that you see a shift in change in public opinion , most certainly within the united states .
with or without imbedded journalism , you ca n't really control all of those images coming from the war .
so with the increasing number of images of victims nearly daily and -lrb- images of -rrb- all the dead soldiers , particularly american soldiers and also iraqis , it becomes increasingly obvious that this is probably a war which can not be won .
this is certainly a similarity with vietnam .
starting out , loyalty with government .
then , a real shift due to images , again , with or without embedded journalism , regarding the real face of the war .
and i suppose public opinion now has certainly changed due to media reporting . kerstin winter interviewed jo groebel -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us soldier found guilty of desertion at trial in germany as an american is convicted of desertion for his attempts to leave the army , organizations in germany that counsel soldiers on how they can avoid being sent to war said they 've been flooded with inquires .
-lrb- 06.03.2007 -rrb- britain , denmark to pull out troops from iraq britain , along with denmark , confirmed it would begin a major troop withdrawal from iraq in coming months and lithuania too has indicated it may follow suit .
washington however denies its coalition is crumbling .
-lrb- 21.02.2007 -rrb- propaganda wars fight for headlines in the middle east jo groebel , the director of the german digital institute , spoke with dw-world.de about the media coverage of the middle east and why violence dominates news reports while peace is seldom mentioned .

no widespread mistreatment of recruits was found . the german parliament 's military commissioner reinhold robbe released his annual report tuesday about the shortcomings of the german armed forces .
at the top of the list , robbe said the bundeswehr is underfinanced . the lack of money causes problems for soldiers in several ways , the report said .
robbe decried the decaying condition of many of the military barracks .
some are filled with mold and ready to collapse , with disgusting bathrooms . he also pointed out that soldiers are worried about their personal financial situations and remain at the bottom of their income groups . foreign missions causing financial strain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some military barracks are in bad condition the military 's financial strain needs to be taken into account before the government agrees to new deployments , robbe said .
there are some fears that germany 's army of 245,000 is overstretched , although only a relatively small percentage are engaged in foreign peacekeeping missions .
there are currently 9,000 soldiers on foreign missions in places like afghanistan , lebanon and the balkans . " in every single case it needs to be tested whether the bundeswehr is overburdened or overextended , " he said . robbe , a social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentarian , is the designated defense commissioner for the german parliament .
his role is to provide the government with an annual report about problems with the military .
he also warns politicians about any problems in the military and to be an outside point of contact for soldiers . mistreatment not widespread bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recruits not mishandled , report says the german army has dealt with several high-profile scandals recently .
seven german soldiers face court martial for photographs which depict them posing and playing with human skulls while stationed in afghanistan . on monday , a separate trial of 18 training staff began , charging the staff of mistreating as many as 163 armed forces personnel in 2004 at a base in coesfeld near the northern german city of münster .
the civil trial is expected to last several weeks . the staff are charged with mistreating recruits during allegedly unapproved exercises meant to toughen them up in the case of a hostage situation .
there was a national outcry after german media reported on the alleged abuse . robbe said he was convinced the coesfeld methods were not typical of the german army , and his report said such treatment did not occur at other military bases . " in view of the information i 've been given since , i can say that the armed forces have definitely learned from this incident , " he said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundeswehr officials in court over brutal hazing of recruits eighteen training officials from the german military are in court charged with the abuse of recruits .

schalke are under enormous pressure to become german champions for the first time in nearly half-a-century .
the perennial bridesmaids in blue have shown jitters of late , and last weekend 's win over stuttgart was more luck than performance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen striker miroslav klose has been laid low in 2007 werder only play at home three times in final eight matches .
but bremen have performed equally well away as in weser stadium this season , and none of their remaining opponents are currently in the top five . bremen 's biggest worry is striker miroslav klose , who 's been ailing for most of 2007 .
if werder are to make up their deficit with schalke , they 'll need their top goal-getter to get on form . the crucial third spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without gomez , stuttgart will need a team effort stuttgart and bayern still have an outside shot at the title , should both of the favourites implode , but more likely they 'll be battling for third place and a chance to qualify for the champions league . stuttgart 's main problem is the absence of their main offensive weapon , striker mario gomez , who 's out for around five weeks with injuries .
as last week 's loss to schalke showed , it 's impossible to win games without scoring any goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern really need to beat southern german rivals stuttgart but bayern have the far tougher schedule .
they play three of their last eight games against current top-five teams , compared to stuttgart 's one , and have the additional burden of champions league matches in early april against ac milan . the crucial date here is april 21 , when the two teams lock horns in stuttgart .
if the hosts get a result , bayern could well fail to qualify for the champions league for the first time since 1995 . the elevator down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund went into free fall in february mönchengladbach , bielefeld and bochum currently occupy the drop zone and are most likely to be relegated .
but plenty teams are teetering on the edge of the precipice , including bundesliga giants hamburg and dortmund , and popular underdogs mainz . the signs are most positive for hamburg .
they play 5 of their final matches at home and only 2 against top-five clubs .
if playmaker rafael van der vaart stays fit , hamburg should stay up . dortmund have it considerably harder .
they have only 3 home games and an equal number against top opposition .
moreover they 're on a downward curve , having not won since mid-february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiny mainz still have a lot of work against bigger opponents meanwhile , mainz 's miracle comeback could falter due to a back-loaded schedule featuring clashes with leverkusen , schalke , stuttgart and , on the last day of the season , bayern .
dead last at the winter break , mainz could come up heartbreakingly short as the 2006-7 campaign comes to what 's sure to be an exciting conclusion . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen still in the hunt behind schalke as bayern , stuttgart fall a 2-0 home win for werder bremen over mainz sunday reduced schalke 04 's lead at the top of the bundesliga to three points .
schalke beat third-placed stuttgart saturday while fourth-placed bayern munich lost in frankfurt .
-lrb- 19.03.2007 -rrb- managerial musical chairs no surprise for dortmund fans many soccer fans will be incredulous that borussia dortmund are on their third coach of the season .
but supporters of the rhine valley giants will be less surprised .
the club has a reputation for short coaching tenures .
-lrb- 14.03.2007 -rrb- nice guys need not finish last nearly everyone wrote off mainz who had just 11 points at the end of 2006 and were stuck at the bottom of the table .
but in the season 's second leg , they reeled off an unprecedented streak to escape the relegation zone .

no widespread mistreatment of recruits was found . the german parliament 's military commissioner reinhold robbe released his annual report tuesday about the shortcomings of the german armed forces .
at the top of the list , robbe said the bundeswehr is underfinanced . the lack of money causes problems for soldiers in several ways , the report said .
robbe decried the decaying condition of many of the military barracks .
some are filled with mold and ready to collapse , with disgusting bathrooms . he also pointed out that soldiers are worried about their personal financial situations and remain at the bottom of their income groups . foreign missions causing financial strain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some military barracks are in bad condition the military 's financial strain needs to be taken into account before the government agrees to new deployments , robbe said .
there are some fears that germany 's army of 245,000 is overstretched , although only a relatively small percentage are engaged in foreign peacekeeping missions .
there are currently 9,000 soldiers on foreign missions in places like afghanistan , lebanon and the balkans . " in every single case it needs to be tested whether the bundeswehr is overburdened or overextended , " he said . robbe , a social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentarian , is the designated defense commissioner for the german parliament .
his role is to provide the government with an annual report about problems with the military .
he also warns politicians about any problems in the military and to be an outside point of contact for soldiers . mistreatment not widespread bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recruits not mishandled , report says the german army has dealt with several high-profile scandals recently .

the civil trial is expected to last several weeks . the staff are charged with mistreating recruits during allegedly unapproved exercises meant to toughen them up in the case of a hostage situation .
there was a national outcry after german media reported on the alleged abuse . robbe said he was convinced the coesfeld methods were not typical of the german army , and his report said such treatment did not occur at other military bases .

" aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which he co-edited with robert a. hinde , dissects human aggression and war . dw-radio : why has embedding journalists become a popular way to report on war ? jo groebel : the term " embedded journalist " made the headlines during the iraq war when the united states entered the country .
lots of journalists were more or less siding with the soldiers entering the country .
the idea there was , rather than having reporting with this certain distance to what 's actually going on , that journalists would have a first-hand image and first-hand impression of what 's going on .
criticism has , of course , been addressing the fact that someone so close to a certain war party may lose his or her neutrality and objectivity . in your opinion , is it possible for an embedded journalist to be critical or does he have to satisfy the government upon which he relies for his information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if news from reporters traveling with soldiers can remain objective well , i think it 's probably more psychological than immediately some kind of oppression .
certainly , there is a danger if i 'm siding with certain soldiers and there are attacks , there may be what in a completely different context one called the stockholm syndrome .
even if you are critical of those who are there , the pure fact that there is a certain closeness and common threat coming from the other side may interfere with objectivity .
and there 's another side to it that one would probably only pick those journalists who are sympathetic with those they are accompanying . do you think it is possible for a journalist , whether he 's imbedded or not , to do objective reporting in a war situation ? in war itself , it 's nearly impossible to come up with a final truth .
i suppose this is far beyond a question of whether there 's embedded journalism or not .
one could even claim that journalism and fact reporting itself is something which is a very tricky thing to relate immediately to any kind of proof . there have been some reports that pictures broadcast from the last two persian gulf wars were faked .
how badly manipulated are reports by embedded journalists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military also maintains a supply of reporter-soldiers i would say this is a more fundamental challenge than particularly with embedded journalists .
war automatically means also war about public opinion .
all armies do have battalions of people who are only dealing with the interpretation or manipulation of facts .
embedded journalism clearly has the aim to create sympathy among those who are accompanying the army and the soldiers .
i suppose it 's kind of more of a variation of what already always has been the somewhat tricky approach to truth and objective journalism in a war situation . another us war that got huge media coverage was the vietnam war in the 1970s .
can the media output of the vietnam war be compared in any way to the current war in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas masks are part of the equipment of a war correspondent i suppose what 's definitely pretty similar is that you see a shift in change in public opinion , most certainly within the united states .
with or without imbedded journalism , you ca n't really control all of those images coming from the war .
so with the increasing number of images of victims nearly daily and -lrb- images of -rrb- all the dead soldiers , particularly american soldiers and also iraqis , it becomes increasingly obvious that this is probably a war which can not be won .
this is certainly a similarity with vietnam .
starting out , loyalty with government .

" poland is the only country apart from belarus where this issue has never been settled , " said jehuda evron , chairman of the us-based holocaust restitution committee . he called on polish lawmakers to act so elderly victims of expropriation " at the end of their lives should have a feeling that justice has been done . " jewish and non-jewish groups have joined forces to step up the pressure as poland 's parliament makes its 17th attempt to come up with legislation to settle the issue . a draft bill currently before parliament , which would pay 15 percent compensation to former owners and their heirs , has drawn criticism from the groups . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has had to face claims since it joined the eu in 2004 " we demand that a law is passed quickly to allow former property owners to recover their real estate , where possible , and where it is not , that they are compensated , " said miroslaw szypowski , head of the national association of former property owners . " the government has n't consulted us , " he added , referring to the 250,000-member polish property-owners ' association .
" it 's as if we do n't exist . " doing their utmost last month , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski told a delegation of jewish campaigners that his government would do its utmost to ensure parliament passed a compensation law by the end of the year . the value of seized property for which compensation is being sought is estimated at 16 billion euros to 18 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.3 billion to $ 23.9 billion -rrb- , according to the property owners ' association . jewish property was seized by nazi germany after the invasion of poland in 1939 . after world war ii , poland 's new soviet-inspired communist government nationalized property from non-jewish poles and from the few jews who had survived the holocaust . german claims attacked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is trying to improve ties between the two on monday , kaczynski also slammed the german government for failing to halt property claims by germans expelled at the end of world war ii from newly polish territory . " i must underline that in order to have genuinely normal relations between poland and germany ... this issue must be settled , " kaczynski told reporters , in the wake of a visit to poland by german chancellor angela merkel . kaczynski bemoaned the fact that merkel 's position during her visit " proved that there has been no progress on this issue . " merkel 's trip was aimed at patching up relations between warsaw and berlin , which have seen the historic wound of the nazi occupation of poland reopened since poland 's conservative twins - the premier and his brother president lech kaczynski - came to power . no government support in a speech at warsaw university on friday , merkel said berlin did not and would not support the prussian trust , a small german association which filed 22 claims late last year at the european court of human rights seeking the restitution of property that lies in present-day poland . warsaw , however , has repeatedly called on the german government to do more , notably by acting to prevent property lawsuits being brought by individuals . kaczynski , who has launched a series of stinging verbal attacks on berlin about the issue , said poland was pressing germany " to decide finally to make a clear declaration that these claims have no basis in german and international law . " the claims stem from the redrawing of borders agreed by the soviet union , britain and the united states at the 1945 potsdam conference which saw large parts of eastern germany awarded to poland , which in turn lost a swathe of its own eastern territory to the soviets . millions of germans living in what is now northern and western poland were expelled , leaving behind property and land . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor merkel heads to poland as tensions remain high german chancellor angela merkel put improving bilateral ties high on her agenda before leaving for talks in warsaw .
now she must wonder why she bothered .
german-polish relations have taken another turn for the worst .

" poland is the only country apart from belarus where this issue has never been settled , " said jehuda evron , chairman of the us-based holocaust restitution committee . he called on polish lawmakers to act so elderly victims of expropriation " at the end of their lives should have a feeling that justice has been done . " jewish and non-jewish groups have joined forces to step up the pressure as poland 's parliament makes its 17th attempt to come up with legislation to settle the issue . a draft bill currently before parliament , which would pay 15 percent compensation to former owners and their heirs , has drawn criticism from the groups . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has had to face claims since it joined the eu in 2004 " we demand that a law is passed quickly to allow former property owners to recover their real estate , where possible , and where it is not , that they are compensated , " said miroslaw szypowski , head of the national association of former property owners .

" merkel 's trip was aimed at patching up relations between warsaw and berlin , which have seen the historic wound of the nazi occupation of poland reopened since poland 's conservative twins - the premier and his brother president lech kaczynski - came to power . no government support in a speech at warsaw university on friday , merkel said berlin did not and would not support the prussian trust , a small german association which filed 22 claims late last year at the european court of human rights seeking the restitution of property that lies in present-day poland . warsaw , however , has repeatedly called on the german government to do more , notably by acting to prevent property lawsuits being brought by individuals . kaczynski , who has launched a series of stinging verbal attacks on berlin about the issue , said poland was pressing germany " to decide finally to make a clear declaration that these claims have no basis in german and international law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.03.2007 germany 's deutsche post wants europe to open markets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mail competition is likely to heat up in europe deutsche post 's monopoly on letter delivery will end next year .
even as the company struggles to remain profitable , most other european union countries are reluctant to liberalize their mail markets . deutsche post stocks fell 6 percent tuesday after the company announced its 2007 earnings will fall short of predictions . europe 's largest mail service provider has tried to diversify and take a more international approach in recent years . at the same time , many other eu countries have dragged their feet on liberalizing their own mail monopolies .
deutsche post said it 's worried this attitude will put them at a disadvantage . domestic postal services in eu countries are scheduled to be completely opened to competition by 2009 .
the bloc also wants to open the market for letters under 50 grams -lrb- 1.8 ounces -rrb- to private carriers and thereby get rid of state postal monopolies . deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel has used profits from the traditional mail service to transform the company into a major player in the global transport and logistics market . still , delivering letters remains a vital part of the deutsche post .
even with the company 's big push in recent years into international logistics , freight and express mail , normal mail delivery remains responsible for 25 percent of the company 's gross income , and more than 60 percent of its profit . post wants liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel wants european postal markets opened to competition zumwinkel ha said he is not against liberalization in the postal sector .
in fact , he 's betting on his company moving into liberalized postal markets of other eu countries .
but he also said he worries about competition being distorted by unequal liberalization . a date needs to be fixed for other countries to open their markets to competition , zumwinkel said , adding that it does n't bother him if germany is one of the first to do so , but " the date must be fixed . " " we 're saying : liberalization is good .
liberalization should be .
but it must take place in lockstep in europe , " zumwinkel added . zumwinkel said deutsche post would insist on reciprocity .
if germany opens its market , all european countries should do the same .
germany , the united kingdom and scandinavian countries have said they will allow foreign competition in their postal markets .
france , poland , greece , italy , spain are among the european countries reluctant to give up their postal monopolies . this reluctance goes against the idea at the basis of forming the european union , zumwinkel said .
it was supposed to mean getting rid of tariffs and forming common markets . " you ca n't say , ' i 'm going to do this to you , but you ca n't do this to me , " ' he said .
" that 's not how it works . " deutsche post employs 80,000 people in europe to deliver letters .
a 20-percent loss could endanger 32,000 jobs .
many postal employees are public servants , which makes it extremyl difficult for the post to lay them off or cut their pay . delivering mail big business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monopolists want to make sure all people get their mail it 's not only the german postal service that is labor-intensive .

lots of journalists were more or less siding with the soldiers entering the country .
the idea there was , rather than having reporting with this certain distance to what 's actually going on , that journalists would have a first-hand image and first-hand impression of what 's going on .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.03.2007 germany 's deutsche post wants europe to open markets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mail competition is likely to heat up in europe deutsche post 's monopoly on letter delivery will end next year .
even as the company struggles to remain profitable , most other european union countries are reluctant to liberalize their mail markets . deutsche post stocks fell 6 percent tuesday after the company announced its 2007 earnings will fall short of predictions . europe 's largest mail service provider has tried to diversify and take a more international approach in recent years . at the same time , many other eu countries have dragged their feet on liberalizing their own mail monopolies .
deutsche post said it 's worried this attitude will put them at a disadvantage . domestic postal services in eu countries are scheduled to be completely opened to competition by 2009 .
the bloc also wants to open the market for letters under 50 grams -lrb- 1.8 ounces -rrb- to private carriers and thereby get rid of state postal monopolies . deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel has used profits from the traditional mail service to transform the company into a major player in the global transport and logistics market . still , delivering letters remains a vital part of the deutsche post .
even with the company 's big push in recent years into international logistics , freight and express mail , normal mail delivery remains responsible for 25 percent of the company 's gross income , and more than 60 percent of its profit . post wants liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel wants european postal markets opened to competition zumwinkel ha said he is not against liberalization in the postal sector .
in fact , he 's betting on his company moving into liberalized postal markets of other eu countries .
but he also said he worries about competition being distorted by unequal liberalization . a date needs to be fixed for other countries to open their markets to competition , zumwinkel said , adding that it does n't bother him if germany is one of the first to do so , but " the date must be fixed . " " we 're saying : liberalization is good .
liberalization should be .
but it must take place in lockstep in europe , " zumwinkel added . zumwinkel said deutsche post would insist on reciprocity .
if germany opens its market , all european countries should do the same .
germany , the united kingdom and scandinavian countries have said they will allow foreign competition in their postal markets .
france , poland , greece , italy , spain are among the european countries reluctant to give up their postal monopolies . this reluctance goes against the idea at the basis of forming the european union , zumwinkel said .
it was supposed to mean getting rid of tariffs and forming common markets . " you ca n't say , ' i 'm going to do this to you , but you ca n't do this to me , " ' he said .
" that 's not how it works . " deutsche post employs 80,000 people in europe to deliver letters .
a 20-percent loss could endanger 32,000 jobs .
many postal employees are public servants , which makes it extremyl difficult for the post to lay them off or cut their pay . delivering mail big business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monopolists want to make sure all people get their mail it 's not only the german postal service that is labor-intensive .
in the european union , 1.6 million people work as postal carriers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 20.03.2007 schalke and bremen battle for the title großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's way too early for leaders schalke to start celebrating a tight race at the top and a fierce struggle at the bottom promise lots of excitement for the final quarter to the season .
who will win and lose these clashes comes down to team schedules , injuries and nerves . schalke got a boast from a long-time rival and detractor on tuesday , when bayern munich president franz beckenbauer told the tabloid bild newspaper he thinks the men in blue will take their first german title in 49 years . but the kaiser has a history of mistaken predictions , and schalke 's path to a possible trophy is rockier than it may appear at first glance .
in fact , the league leaders ' chances at the title are probably no better than those of their nearest rivals , second-placed werder bremen . home advantage versus historical baggage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have diego while schalke 's lincoln is serving a suspension schalke currently top the table by three points , but their lead is actually smaller than that .
thanks to werder 's better goal difference , a single schalke loss combined with a bremen victory would flip the two teams in the standings . that loss could come as soon as march 31 , after the bundesliga concludes its current one-week break .
schalke play bayern in munich on that date - whereas bremen no longer face the reigning champions . and then there 's the weight of history .
schalke are under enormous pressure to become german champions for the first time in nearly half-a-century .
the perennial bridesmaids in blue have shown jitters of late , and last weekend 's win over stuttgart was more luck than performance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen striker miroslav klose has been laid low in 2007 werder only play at home three times in final eight matches .
but bremen have performed equally well away as in weser stadium this season , and none of their remaining opponents are currently in the top five . bremen 's biggest worry is striker miroslav klose , who 's been ailing for most of 2007 .
if werder are to make up their deficit with schalke , they 'll need their top goal-getter to get on form . the crucial third spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without gomez , stuttgart will need a team effort stuttgart and bayern still have an outside shot at the title , should both of the favourites implode , but more likely they 'll be battling for third place and a chance to qualify for the champions league . stuttgart 's main problem is the absence of their main offensive weapon , striker mario gomez , who 's out for around five weeks with injuries .
as last week 's loss to schalke showed , it 's impossible to win games without scoring any goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern really need to beat southern german rivals stuttgart but bayern have the far tougher schedule .
they play three of their last eight games against current top-five teams , compared to stuttgart 's one , and have the additional burden of champions league matches in early april against ac milan . the crucial date here is april 21 , when the two teams lock horns in stuttgart .
if the hosts get a result , bayern could well fail to qualify for the champions league for the first time since 1995 . the elevator down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund went into free fall in february mönchengladbach , bielefeld and bochum currently occupy the drop zone and are most likely to be relegated .
but plenty teams are teetering on the edge of the precipice , including bundesliga giants hamburg and dortmund , and popular underdogs mainz . the signs are most positive for hamburg .
they play 5 of their final matches at home and only 2 against top-five clubs .
if playmaker rafael van der vaart stays fit , hamburg should stay up . dortmund have it considerably harder .
they have only 3 home games and an equal number against top opposition .
moreover they 're on a downward curve , having not won since mid-february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiny mainz still have a lot of work against bigger opponents meanwhile , mainz 's miracle comeback could falter due to a back-loaded schedule featuring clashes with leverkusen , schalke , stuttgart and , on the last day of the season , bayern .
dead last at the winter break , mainz could come up heartbreakingly short as the 2006-7 campaign comes to what 's sure to be an exciting conclusion . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen still in the hunt behind schalke as bayern , stuttgart fall a 2-0 home win for werder bremen over mainz sunday reduced schalke 04 's lead at the top of the bundesliga to three points .
schalke beat third-placed stuttgart saturday while fourth-placed bayern munich lost in frankfurt .
-lrb- 19.03.2007 -rrb- managerial musical chairs no surprise for dortmund fans many soccer fans will be incredulous that borussia dortmund are on their third coach of the season .
but supporters of the rhine valley giants will be less surprised .
the club has a reputation for short coaching tenures .
-lrb- 14.03.2007 -rrb- nice guys need not finish last nearly everyone wrote off mainz who had just 11 points at the end of 2006 and were stuck at the bottom of the table .
but in the season 's second leg , they reeled off an unprecedented streak to escape the relegation zone .

no widespread mistreatment of recruits was found . the german parliament 's military commissioner reinhold robbe released his annual report tuesday about the shortcomings of the german armed forces .
at the top of the list , robbe said the bundeswehr is underfinanced . the lack of money causes problems for soldiers in several ways , the report said .
robbe decried the decaying condition of many of the military barracks .
some are filled with mold and ready to collapse , with disgusting bathrooms . he also pointed out that soldiers are worried about their personal financial situations and remain at the bottom of their income groups . foreign missions causing financial strain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some military barracks are in bad condition the military 's financial strain needs to be taken into account before the government agrees to new deployments , robbe said .
there are some fears that germany 's army of 245,000 is overstretched , although only a relatively small percentage are engaged in foreign peacekeeping missions .
there are currently 9,000 soldiers on foreign missions in places like afghanistan , lebanon and the balkans . " in every single case it needs to be tested whether the bundeswehr is overburdened or overextended , " he said . robbe , a social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentarian , is the designated defense commissioner for the german parliament .
his role is to provide the government with an annual report about problems with the military .
he also warns politicians about any problems in the military and to be an outside point of contact for soldiers . mistreatment not widespread bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recruits not mishandled , report says the german army has dealt with several high-profile scandals recently .

the civil trial is expected to last several weeks . the staff are charged with mistreating recruits during allegedly unapproved exercises meant to toughen them up in the case of a hostage situation .
there was a national outcry after german media reported on the alleged abuse . robbe said he was convinced the coesfeld methods were not typical of the german army , and his report said such treatment did not occur at other military bases .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.03.2007 germany 's deutsche post wants europe to open markets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mail competition is likely to heat up in europe deutsche post 's monopoly on letter delivery will end next year .
even as the company struggles to remain profitable , most other european union countries are reluctant to liberalize their mail markets . deutsche post stocks fell 6 percent tuesday after the company announced its 2007 earnings will fall short of predictions . europe 's largest mail service provider has tried to diversify and take a more international approach in recent years . at the same time , many other eu countries have dragged their feet on liberalizing their own mail monopolies .
deutsche post said it 's worried this attitude will put them at a disadvantage . domestic postal services in eu countries are scheduled to be completely opened to competition by 2009 .
the bloc also wants to open the market for letters under 50 grams -lrb- 1.8 ounces -rrb- to private carriers and thereby get rid of state postal monopolies . deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel has used profits from the traditional mail service to transform the company into a major player in the global transport and logistics market . still , delivering letters remains a vital part of the deutsche post .
even with the company 's big push in recent years into international logistics , freight and express mail , normal mail delivery remains responsible for 25 percent of the company 's gross income , and more than 60 percent of its profit . post wants liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel wants european postal markets opened to competition zumwinkel ha said he is not against liberalization in the postal sector .
in fact , he 's betting on his company moving into liberalized postal markets of other eu countries .
but he also said he worries about competition being distorted by unequal liberalization . a date needs to be fixed for other countries to open their markets to competition , zumwinkel said , adding that it does n't bother him if germany is one of the first to do so , but " the date must be fixed . " " we 're saying : liberalization is good .
liberalization should be .
but it must take place in lockstep in europe , " zumwinkel added . zumwinkel said deutsche post would insist on reciprocity .
if germany opens its market , all european countries should do the same .
germany , the united kingdom and scandinavian countries have said they will allow foreign competition in their postal markets .
france , poland , greece , italy , spain are among the european countries reluctant to give up their postal monopolies . this reluctance goes against the idea at the basis of forming the european union , zumwinkel said .
it was supposed to mean getting rid of tariffs and forming common markets . " you ca n't say , ' i 'm going to do this to you , but you ca n't do this to me , " ' he said .
" that 's not how it works . " deutsche post employs 80,000 people in europe to deliver letters .
a 20-percent loss could endanger 32,000 jobs .
many postal employees are public servants , which makes it extremyl difficult for the post to lay them off or cut their pay . delivering mail big business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monopolists want to make sure all people get their mail it 's not only the german postal service that is labor-intensive .
in the european union , 1.6 million people work as postal carriers .
it is a $ 90 billion market . countries are concerned about issues like universal coverage as public postal carriers are required to deliver mail at acceptable prices to remote regions five days a week , even if it is n't profitable to do so . countries also worry that opening the market will lead to the tendency to find low-paid workers to deliver mail .
this is already happening to an extent in germany , with some private companies paying wages as low as four euros per hour to deliver parcels .
deutsche post also takes advantage of cheap labor .
since 2000 , the company has shed 34,000 part and full time positions , turning to subcontractors in some cases . the german government has said despite other countries ' reluctance to end their own letter-delivery monopolies , it will go forward with its plan to open its system to competition in 2008 . karl zawadzky -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks open postal markets by 2009 the european commission laid out plans to complete the opening of the european union 's postal-services market to competition by 2009 despite fierce opposition from some countries .

who will win and lose these clashes comes down to team schedules , injuries and nerves . schalke got a boast from a long-time rival and detractor on tuesday , when bayern munich president franz beckenbauer told the tabloid bild newspaper he thinks the men in blue will take their first german title in 49 years . but the kaiser has a history of mistaken predictions , and schalke 's path to a possible trophy is rockier than it may appear at first glance .

thanks to werder 's better goal difference , a single schalke loss combined with a bremen victory would flip the two teams in the standings . that loss could come as soon as march 31 , after the bundesliga concludes its current one-week break .
schalke play bayern in munich on that date - whereas bremen no longer face the reigning champions . and then there 's the weight of history .
schalke are under enormous pressure to become german champions for the first time in nearly half-a-century .
the perennial bridesmaids in blue have shown jitters of late , and last weekend 's win over stuttgart was more luck than performance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen striker miroslav klose has been laid low in 2007 werder only play at home three times in final eight matches .
but bremen have performed equally well away as in weser stadium this season , and none of their remaining opponents are currently in the top five . bremen 's biggest worry is striker miroslav klose , who 's been ailing for most of 2007 .

as last week 's loss to schalke showed , it 's impossible to win games without scoring any goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern really need to beat southern german rivals stuttgart but bayern have the far tougher schedule .
they play three of their last eight games against current top-five teams , compared to stuttgart 's one , and have the additional burden of champions league matches in early april against ac milan . the crucial date here is april 21 , when the two teams lock horns in stuttgart .

they play 5 of their final matches at home and only 2 against top-five clubs .
if playmaker rafael van der vaart stays fit , hamburg should stay up . dortmund have it considerably harder .
they have only 3 home games and an equal number against top opposition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 20.03.2007 schalke and bremen battle for the title großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's way too early for leaders schalke to start celebrating a tight race at the top and a fierce struggle at the bottom promise lots of excitement for the final quarter to the season .
who will win and lose these clashes comes down to team schedules , injuries and nerves . schalke got a boast from a long-time rival and detractor on tuesday , when bayern munich president franz beckenbauer told the tabloid bild newspaper he thinks the men in blue will take their first german title in 49 years . but the kaiser has a history of mistaken predictions , and schalke 's path to a possible trophy is rockier than it may appear at first glance .
in fact , the league leaders ' chances at the title are probably no better than those of their nearest rivals , second-placed werder bremen . home advantage versus historical baggage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have diego while schalke 's lincoln is serving a suspension schalke currently top the table by three points , but their lead is actually smaller than that .
thanks to werder 's better goal difference , a single schalke loss combined with a bremen victory would flip the two teams in the standings . that loss could come as soon as march 31 , after the bundesliga concludes its current one-week break .
schalke play bayern in munich on that date - whereas bremen no longer face the reigning champions . and then there 's the weight of history .
schalke are under enormous pressure to become german champions for the first time in nearly half-a-century .
the perennial bridesmaids in blue have shown jitters of late , and last weekend 's win over stuttgart was more luck than performance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen striker miroslav klose has been laid low in 2007 werder only play at home three times in final eight matches .
but bremen have performed equally well away as in weser stadium this season , and none of their remaining opponents are currently in the top five . bremen 's biggest worry is striker miroslav klose , who 's been ailing for most of 2007 .
if werder are to make up their deficit with schalke , they 'll need their top goal-getter to get on form . the crucial third spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without gomez , stuttgart will need a team effort stuttgart and bayern still have an outside shot at the title , should both of the favourites implode , but more likely they 'll be battling for third place and a chance to qualify for the champions league . stuttgart 's main problem is the absence of their main offensive weapon , striker mario gomez , who 's out for around five weeks with injuries .
as last week 's loss to schalke showed , it 's impossible to win games without scoring any goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern really need to beat southern german rivals stuttgart but bayern have the far tougher schedule .
they play three of their last eight games against current top-five teams , compared to stuttgart 's one , and have the additional burden of champions league matches in early april against ac milan . the crucial date here is april 21 , when the two teams lock horns in stuttgart .
if the hosts get a result , bayern could well fail to qualify for the champions league for the first time since 1995 . the elevator down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund went into free fall in february mönchengladbach , bielefeld and bochum currently occupy the drop zone and are most likely to be relegated .
but plenty teams are teetering on the edge of the precipice , including bundesliga giants hamburg and dortmund , and popular underdogs mainz . the signs are most positive for hamburg .
they play 5 of their final matches at home and only 2 against top-five clubs .
if playmaker rafael van der vaart stays fit , hamburg should stay up . dortmund have it considerably harder .
they have only 3 home games and an equal number against top opposition .
moreover they 're on a downward curve , having not won since mid-february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiny mainz still have a lot of work against bigger opponents meanwhile , mainz 's miracle comeback could falter due to a back-loaded schedule featuring clashes with leverkusen , schalke , stuttgart and , on the last day of the season , bayern .
dead last at the winter break , mainz could come up heartbreakingly short as the 2006-7 campaign comes to what 's sure to be an exciting conclusion . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen still in the hunt behind schalke as bayern , stuttgart fall a 2-0 home win for werder bremen over mainz sunday reduced schalke 04 's lead at the top of the bundesliga to three points .
schalke beat third-placed stuttgart saturday while fourth-placed bayern munich lost in frankfurt .

but supporters of the rhine valley giants will be less surprised .

even more important is the all-pervasiveness of the lie in political discourse , he says , especially in the 21st century .
that is why the foundation is making an appeal for a worldwide reading tuesday to raise awareness of lying in politics and strengthen the fight against it .
the event this year , called the " second anniversary of the political lie , " will honor murdered russian journalist anna politkovskaya by reading a selection of her works .
around 50 institutions in 10 countries are set to participate .
" with this event , we want to bring more awareness to the issue and strengthen the fight against it , " said schreiber .
last year , the foundation marked the third anniversary of the beginning of the war in iraq with a worldwide reading .
on march 20 , 2006 , eliot weinberger 's 2005 text collage , " what i heard about iraq , " was read in 47 venues around the world , marking the first " day of the political lie . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya was one of the few russian journalists who reported from chechnya and in the wake of the murder of politkovskaya last october , schreiber said it was obvious that her works should be selected for this year 's event .
" in her reports , anna politkovskaya described the truth of the catastrophe of the war in chechnya , a war that has gone on far from the public eye , " he said .
" she was trying to bring the truth to light and was killed for it . "
long-time critic this year , texts from her book called " a small corner of hell : dispatches from chechnya " will be read on the radio , at public venues , public and private gatherings and schools around the world .
specifically , the readings will be from two chapters in the 2003 book : " machkety : a concentration camp with a commercial streak " and " special operation zyazikov . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya was a sharp critic of putin the chapters portray a landscape of torture and murder , condemn the cynicism of bureaucrats , depict the misery and desperation of a civilian population that is torn between the army and rebels and offer a nightmarish picture of the climate of state-fueled fear and repression in russia .
politkovskaya , a long-time critic of russian president vladimir putin , worked for a number of russian newspapers , including the small opposition paper novaya gazeta , and often wrote about how the war in chechnya was far from over , disputing the official line .
instead , she focused on human rights violations and on the civil population caught in the middle of two warring parties .
she had faced threats and intimidation .
yet she refused to have a bodyguard in the same way she refused to go into exile .
in 2004 , she was the victim of a poisoning attempt .
in october , an unknown gunman shot her dead in the stairwell of her moscow apartment block .

" poland is the only country apart from belarus where this issue has never been settled , " said jehuda evron , chairman of the us-based holocaust restitution committee . he called on polish lawmakers to act so elderly victims of expropriation " at the end of their lives should have a feeling that justice has been done . " jewish and non-jewish groups have joined forces to step up the pressure as poland 's parliament makes its 17th attempt to come up with legislation to settle the issue . a draft bill currently before parliament , which would pay 15 percent compensation to former owners and their heirs , has drawn criticism from the groups . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has had to face claims since it joined the eu in 2004 " we demand that a law is passed quickly to allow former property owners to recover their real estate , where possible , and where it is not , that they are compensated , " said miroslaw szypowski , head of the national association of former property owners . " the government has n't consulted us , " he added , referring to the 250,000-member polish property-owners ' association .
" it 's as if we do n't exist .

even more important is the all-pervasiveness of the lie in political discourse , he says , especially in the 21st century .
that is why the foundation is making an appeal for a worldwide reading tuesday to raise awareness of lying in politics and strengthen the fight against it .
the event this year , called the " second anniversary of the political lie , " will honor murdered russian journalist anna politkovskaya by reading a selection of her works .
around 50 institutions in 10 countries are set to participate .
" with this event , we want to bring more awareness to the issue and strengthen the fight against it , " said schreiber .
last year , the foundation marked the third anniversary of the beginning of the war in iraq with a worldwide reading .
on march 20 , 2006 , eliot weinberger 's 2005 text collage , " what i heard about iraq , " was read in 47 venues around the world , marking the first " day of the political lie . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya was one of the few russian journalists who reported from chechnya and in the wake of the murder of politkovskaya last october , schreiber said it was obvious that her works should be selected for this year 's event .
" in her reports , anna politkovskaya described the truth of the catastrophe of the war in chechnya , a war that has gone on far from the public eye , " he said .
" she was trying to bring the truth to light and was killed for it . "
long-time critic this year , texts from her book called " a small corner of hell : dispatches from chechnya " will be read on the radio , at public venues , public and private gatherings and schools around the world .
specifically , the readings will be from two chapters in the 2003 book : " machkety : a concentration camp with a commercial streak " and " special operation zyazikov . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya was a sharp critic of putin the chapters portray a landscape of torture and murder , condemn the cynicism of bureaucrats , depict the misery and desperation of a civilian population that is torn between the army and rebels and offer a nightmarish picture of the climate of state-fueled fear and repression in russia .
politkovskaya , a long-time critic of russian president vladimir putin , worked for a number of russian newspapers , including the small opposition paper novaya gazeta , and often wrote about how the war in chechnya was far from over , disputing the official line .
instead , she focused on human rights violations and on the civil population caught in the middle of two warring parties .
she had faced threats and intimidation .
yet she refused to have a bodyguard in the same way she refused to go into exile .
in 2004 , she was the victim of a poisoning attempt .
in october , an unknown gunman shot her dead in the stairwell of her moscow apartment block .
material she had collected for her last article subsequently disappeared . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's foreign minister urges russia to solve murders german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has called for russian authorities to solve the recent killings of russian journalist anna politkovskaya and former kgb agent alexander litvinenko as quickly as possible .

deutsche post said it 's worried this attitude will put them at a disadvantage . domestic postal services in eu countries are scheduled to be completely opened to competition by 2009 .
the bloc also wants to open the market for letters under 50 grams -lrb- 1.8 ounces -rrb- to private carriers and thereby get rid of state postal monopolies . deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel has used profits from the traditional mail service to transform the company into a major player in the global transport and logistics market . still , delivering letters remains a vital part of the deutsche post .

" " we 're saying : liberalization is good .
liberalization should be .

germany , the united kingdom and scandinavian countries have said they will allow foreign competition in their postal markets .

" aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which he co-edited with robert a. hinde , dissects human aggression and war . dw-radio : why has embedding journalists become a popular way to report on war ? jo groebel : the term " embedded journalist " made the headlines during the iraq war when the united states entered the country .
lots of journalists were more or less siding with the soldiers entering the country .
the idea there was , rather than having reporting with this certain distance to what 's actually going on , that journalists would have a first-hand image and first-hand impression of what 's going on .
criticism has , of course , been addressing the fact that someone so close to a certain war party may lose his or her neutrality and objectivity . in your opinion , is it possible for an embedded journalist to be critical or does he have to satisfy the government upon which he relies for his information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if news from reporters traveling with soldiers can remain objective well , i think it 's probably more psychological than immediately some kind of oppression .
certainly , there is a danger if i 'm siding with certain soldiers and there are attacks , there may be what in a completely different context one called the stockholm syndrome .
even if you are critical of those who are there , the pure fact that there is a certain closeness and common threat coming from the other side may interfere with objectivity .
and there 's another side to it that one would probably only pick those journalists who are sympathetic with those they are accompanying . do you think it is possible for a journalist , whether he 's imbedded or not , to do objective reporting in a war situation ? in war itself , it 's nearly impossible to come up with a final truth .
i suppose this is far beyond a question of whether there 's embedded journalism or not .
one could even claim that journalism and fact reporting itself is something which is a very tricky thing to relate immediately to any kind of proof . there have been some reports that pictures broadcast from the last two persian gulf wars were faked .
how badly manipulated are reports by embedded journalists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military also maintains a supply of reporter-soldiers i would say this is a more fundamental challenge than particularly with embedded journalists .
war automatically means also war about public opinion .
all armies do have battalions of people who are only dealing with the interpretation or manipulation of facts .
embedded journalism clearly has the aim to create sympathy among those who are accompanying the army and the soldiers .
i suppose it 's kind of more of a variation of what already always has been the somewhat tricky approach to truth and objective journalism in a war situation . another us war that got huge media coverage was the vietnam war in the 1970s .
can the media output of the vietnam war be compared in any way to the current war in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas masks are part of the equipment of a war correspondent i suppose what 's definitely pretty similar is that you see a shift in change in public opinion , most certainly within the united states .
with or without imbedded journalism , you ca n't really control all of those images coming from the war .
so with the increasing number of images of victims nearly daily and -lrb- images of -rrb- all the dead soldiers , particularly american soldiers and also iraqis , it becomes increasingly obvious that this is probably a war which can not be won .
this is certainly a similarity with vietnam .

" aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which he co-edited with robert a. hinde , dissects human aggression and war . dw-radio : why has embedding journalists become a popular way to report on war ? jo groebel : the term " embedded journalist " made the headlines during the iraq war when the united states entered the country .
lots of journalists were more or less siding with the soldiers entering the country .
the idea there was , rather than having reporting with this certain distance to what 's actually going on , that journalists would have a first-hand image and first-hand impression of what 's going on .
criticism has , of course , been addressing the fact that someone so close to a certain war party may lose his or her neutrality and objectivity . in your opinion , is it possible for an embedded journalist to be critical or does he have to satisfy the government upon which he relies for his information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if news from reporters traveling with soldiers can remain objective well , i think it 's probably more psychological than immediately some kind of oppression .
certainly , there is a danger if i 'm siding with certain soldiers and there are attacks , there may be what in a completely different context one called the stockholm syndrome .
even if you are critical of those who are there , the pure fact that there is a certain closeness and common threat coming from the other side may interfere with objectivity .
and there 's another side to it that one would probably only pick those journalists who are sympathetic with those they are accompanying . do you think it is possible for a journalist , whether he 's imbedded or not , to do objective reporting in a war situation ? in war itself , it 's nearly impossible to come up with a final truth .
i suppose this is far beyond a question of whether there 's embedded journalism or not .
one could even claim that journalism and fact reporting itself is something which is a very tricky thing to relate immediately to any kind of proof . there have been some reports that pictures broadcast from the last two persian gulf wars were faked .
how badly manipulated are reports by embedded journalists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military also maintains a supply of reporter-soldiers i would say this is a more fundamental challenge than particularly with embedded journalists .
war automatically means also war about public opinion .
all armies do have battalions of people who are only dealing with the interpretation or manipulation of facts .
embedded journalism clearly has the aim to create sympathy among those who are accompanying the army and the soldiers .
i suppose it 's kind of more of a variation of what already always has been the somewhat tricky approach to truth and objective journalism in a war situation . another us war that got huge media coverage was the vietnam war in the 1970s .
can the media output of the vietnam war be compared in any way to the current war in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas masks are part of the equipment of a war correspondent i suppose what 's definitely pretty similar is that you see a shift in change in public opinion , most certainly within the united states .
with or without imbedded journalism , you ca n't really control all of those images coming from the war .
so with the increasing number of images of victims nearly daily and -lrb- images of -rrb- all the dead soldiers , particularly american soldiers and also iraqis , it becomes increasingly obvious that this is probably a war which can not be won .
this is certainly a similarity with vietnam .
starting out , loyalty with government .
then , a real shift due to images , again , with or without embedded journalism , regarding the real face of the war .
and i suppose public opinion now has certainly changed due to media reporting . kerstin winter interviewed jo groebel -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us soldier found guilty of desertion at trial in germany as an american is convicted of desertion for his attempts to leave the army , organizations in germany that counsel soldiers on how they can avoid being sent to war said they 've been flooded with inquires .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.03.2007 twelve candidates to run for french presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal and sarkozy are the frontrunners , but not alone on the ballot over 40 potential candidates to fight next month 's french presidential elections have been whittled down to 12 , the country 's constitutional council announced , but there are no shocks in the shortlist . twelve candidates including the far-right firebrand jean-marie le pen are to run in next month 's french presidential election after gathering the 500 endorsements needed to qualify , the council said monday . the 12 include right-wing favorite nicolas sarkozy , socialist segolene royal and centrist francois bayrou , as well as anti-globalization crusader jose bove . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is currently the polls ' favorite to win the presidential elections on the left , the other candidates are postman olivier besancenot of the revolutionary communist league , workers ' struggle candidate arlette laguiller , communist party marie-george buffet , small-town mayor gerard schivardi and the green party candidate dominique voynet . on the right , the fourth challenger is the nationalist philippe de villiers of the movement for france , while frederic nihous of the hunting , fishing , nature and traditions party is standing on a single-issue ticket . candidate numbers down the overall number is lower than in 2002 , when 16 candidates contested the first round , seen as one of the reasons for le pen 's shock presence in the second round run-off .
the line-up also includes four women , the highest share in any french presidential election . under rules designed to weed out frivolous candidacies , would-be contenders had until friday to submit 500 endorsements from france 's mayors and other elected officials to the constitutional council , the body that supervises the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : segolene royal will be the candidate for the socialists more than 40 contenders - many of them single-issue campaigners with no political support base - had initially thrown their hat in the ring .

" poland is the only country apart from belarus where this issue has never been settled , " said jehuda evron , chairman of the us-based holocaust restitution committee . he called on polish lawmakers to act so elderly victims of expropriation " at the end of their lives should have a feeling that justice has been done . " jewish and non-jewish groups have joined forces to step up the pressure as poland 's parliament makes its 17th attempt to come up with legislation to settle the issue . a draft bill currently before parliament , which would pay 15 percent compensation to former owners and their heirs , has drawn criticism from the groups . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has had to face claims since it joined the eu in 2004 " we demand that a law is passed quickly to allow former property owners to recover their real estate , where possible , and where it is not , that they are compensated , " said miroslaw szypowski , head of the national association of former property owners . " the government has n't consulted us , " he added , referring to the 250,000-member polish property-owners ' association .
" it 's as if we do n't exist . " doing their utmost last month , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski told a delegation of jewish campaigners that his government would do its utmost to ensure parliament passed a compensation law by the end of the year . the value of seized property for which compensation is being sought is estimated at 16 billion euros to 18 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.3 billion to $ 23.9 billion -rrb- , according to the property owners ' association . jewish property was seized by nazi germany after the invasion of poland in 1939 . after world war ii , poland 's new soviet-inspired communist government nationalized property from non-jewish poles and from the few jews who had survived the holocaust . german claims attacked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is trying to improve ties between the two on monday , kaczynski also slammed the german government for failing to halt property claims by germans expelled at the end of world war ii from newly polish territory . " i must underline that in order to have genuinely normal relations between poland and germany ... this issue must be settled , " kaczynski told reporters , in the wake of a visit to poland by german chancellor angela merkel . kaczynski bemoaned the fact that merkel 's position during her visit " proved that there has been no progress on this issue . " merkel 's trip was aimed at patching up relations between warsaw and berlin , which have seen the historic wound of the nazi occupation of poland reopened since poland 's conservative twins - the premier and his brother president lech kaczynski - came to power . no government support in a speech at warsaw university on friday , merkel said berlin did not and would not support the prussian trust , a small german association which filed 22 claims late last year at the european court of human rights seeking the restitution of property that lies in present-day poland . warsaw , however , has repeatedly called on the german government to do more , notably by acting to prevent property lawsuits being brought by individuals . kaczynski , who has launched a series of stinging verbal attacks on berlin about the issue , said poland was pressing germany " to decide finally to make a clear declaration that these claims have no basis in german and international law . " the claims stem from the redrawing of borders agreed by the soviet union , britain and the united states at the 1945 potsdam conference which saw large parts of eastern germany awarded to poland , which in turn lost a swathe of its own eastern territory to the soviets . millions of germans living in what is now northern and western poland were expelled , leaving behind property and land . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor merkel heads to poland as tensions remain high german chancellor angela merkel put improving bilateral ties high on her agenda before leaving for talks in warsaw .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.03.2007 reporting has changed public 's opinion of iraq war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists want to get a close-up view of the war on the fourth anniversary of the us-led invasion of iraq , on tuesday , media analyst jo groebel said it remains difficult for journalists to report objectively while traveling with troops during war . jo groebel , director of the german digital institute , has written and edited numerous books about new media and the internet .
" aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which he co-edited with robert a. hinde , dissects human aggression and war . dw-radio : why has embedding journalists become a popular way to report on war ? jo groebel : the term " embedded journalist " made the headlines during the iraq war when the united states entered the country .
lots of journalists were more or less siding with the soldiers entering the country .
the idea there was , rather than having reporting with this certain distance to what 's actually going on , that journalists would have a first-hand image and first-hand impression of what 's going on .
criticism has , of course , been addressing the fact that someone so close to a certain war party may lose his or her neutrality and objectivity . in your opinion , is it possible for an embedded journalist to be critical or does he have to satisfy the government upon which he relies for his information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if news from reporters traveling with soldiers can remain objective well , i think it 's probably more psychological than immediately some kind of oppression .
certainly , there is a danger if i 'm siding with certain soldiers and there are attacks , there may be what in a completely different context one called the stockholm syndrome .
even if you are critical of those who are there , the pure fact that there is a certain closeness and common threat coming from the other side may interfere with objectivity .
and there 's another side to it that one would probably only pick those journalists who are sympathetic with those they are accompanying . do you think it is possible for a journalist , whether he 's imbedded or not , to do objective reporting in a war situation ? in war itself , it 's nearly impossible to come up with a final truth .
i suppose this is far beyond a question of whether there 's embedded journalism or not .
one could even claim that journalism and fact reporting itself is something which is a very tricky thing to relate immediately to any kind of proof . there have been some reports that pictures broadcast from the last two persian gulf wars were faked .
how badly manipulated are reports by embedded journalists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military also maintains a supply of reporter-soldiers i would say this is a more fundamental challenge than particularly with embedded journalists .
war automatically means also war about public opinion .
all armies do have battalions of people who are only dealing with the interpretation or manipulation of facts .
embedded journalism clearly has the aim to create sympathy among those who are accompanying the army and the soldiers .
i suppose it 's kind of more of a variation of what already always has been the somewhat tricky approach to truth and objective journalism in a war situation . another us war that got huge media coverage was the vietnam war in the 1970s .
can the media output of the vietnam war be compared in any way to the current war in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas masks are part of the equipment of a war correspondent i suppose what 's definitely pretty similar is that you see a shift in change in public opinion , most certainly within the united states .
with or without imbedded journalism , you ca n't really control all of those images coming from the war .
so with the increasing number of images of victims nearly daily and -lrb- images of -rrb- all the dead soldiers , particularly american soldiers and also iraqis , it becomes increasingly obvious that this is probably a war which can not be won .
this is certainly a similarity with vietnam .
starting out , loyalty with government .
then , a real shift due to images , again , with or without embedded journalism , regarding the real face of the war .
and i suppose public opinion now has certainly changed due to media reporting . kerstin winter interviewed jo groebel -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us soldier found guilty of desertion at trial in germany as an american is convicted of desertion for his attempts to leave the army , organizations in germany that counsel soldiers on how they can avoid being sent to war said they 've been flooded with inquires .
-lrb- 06.03.2007 -rrb- britain , denmark to pull out troops from iraq britain , along with denmark , confirmed it would begin a major troop withdrawal from iraq in coming months and lithuania too has indicated it may follow suit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.03.2007 reporting has changed public 's opinion of iraq war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists want to get a close-up view of the war on the fourth anniversary of the us-led invasion of iraq , on tuesday , media analyst jo groebel said it remains difficult for journalists to report objectively while traveling with troops during war . jo groebel , director of the german digital institute , has written and edited numerous books about new media and the internet .
" aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which he co-edited with robert a. hinde , dissects human aggression and war . dw-radio : why has embedding journalists become a popular way to report on war ? jo groebel : the term " embedded journalist " made the headlines during the iraq war when the united states entered the country .
lots of journalists were more or less siding with the soldiers entering the country .
the idea there was , rather than having reporting with this certain distance to what 's actually going on , that journalists would have a first-hand image and first-hand impression of what 's going on .
criticism has , of course , been addressing the fact that someone so close to a certain war party may lose his or her neutrality and objectivity . in your opinion , is it possible for an embedded journalist to be critical or does he have to satisfy the government upon which he relies for his information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if news from reporters traveling with soldiers can remain objective well , i think it 's probably more psychological than immediately some kind of oppression .
certainly , there is a danger if i 'm siding with certain soldiers and there are attacks , there may be what in a completely different context one called the stockholm syndrome .
even if you are critical of those who are there , the pure fact that there is a certain closeness and common threat coming from the other side may interfere with objectivity .
and there 's another side to it that one would probably only pick those journalists who are sympathetic with those they are accompanying . do you think it is possible for a journalist , whether he 's imbedded or not , to do objective reporting in a war situation ? in war itself , it 's nearly impossible to come up with a final truth .
i suppose this is far beyond a question of whether there 's embedded journalism or not .
one could even claim that journalism and fact reporting itself is something which is a very tricky thing to relate immediately to any kind of proof . there have been some reports that pictures broadcast from the last two persian gulf wars were faked .
how badly manipulated are reports by embedded journalists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military also maintains a supply of reporter-soldiers i would say this is a more fundamental challenge than particularly with embedded journalists .
war automatically means also war about public opinion .
all armies do have battalions of people who are only dealing with the interpretation or manipulation of facts .
embedded journalism clearly has the aim to create sympathy among those who are accompanying the army and the soldiers .
i suppose it 's kind of more of a variation of what already always has been the somewhat tricky approach to truth and objective journalism in a war situation . another us war that got huge media coverage was the vietnam war in the 1970s .
can the media output of the vietnam war be compared in any way to the current war in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas masks are part of the equipment of a war correspondent i suppose what 's definitely pretty similar is that you see a shift in change in public opinion , most certainly within the united states .
with or without imbedded journalism , you ca n't really control all of those images coming from the war .
so with the increasing number of images of victims nearly daily and -lrb- images of -rrb- all the dead soldiers , particularly american soldiers and also iraqis , it becomes increasingly obvious that this is probably a war which can not be won .
this is certainly a similarity with vietnam .
starting out , loyalty with government .
then , a real shift due to images , again , with or without embedded journalism , regarding the real face of the war .
and i suppose public opinion now has certainly changed due to media reporting . kerstin winter interviewed jo groebel -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us soldier found guilty of desertion at trial in germany as an american is convicted of desertion for his attempts to leave the army , organizations in germany that counsel soldiers on how they can avoid being sent to war said they 've been flooded with inquires .
-lrb- 06.03.2007 -rrb- britain , denmark to pull out troops from iraq britain , along with denmark , confirmed it would begin a major troop withdrawal from iraq in coming months and lithuania too has indicated it may follow suit .
washington however denies its coalition is crumbling .

belgian foreign minister karel de gucht may also hold talks with him . " there is no eu decision that would ban such visits , nor any decision laying out the eu 's policy on such contacts , " explained the european commission 's spokeswoman for external affairs , emma udwin . the united states also made contact with the independent finance minister , according to palestinian sources , while non-eu country norway has gone further and recognized the government outright . germany mideast quartet 's demands met bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with abbas in berlin in february german chancellor angela merkel told palestinian president mahmoud abbas in a telephone conversation on tuesday that she was pleased the new fatah-hamas unity government had contributed to some internal stability ion the region , according to government spokesman ulrich wilhelm . " at the same time , she urged again that the new government fulfill the criteria of the so-called middle east quartet , in particular the renunciation of violence and the recognition of israel , " wilhelm said . hamas swept to power a year ago .
the elections that brought it to office were endorsed but the result was shunned by the eu and the united states , as the group ranks on their terror blacklists . it led to the end of direct aid to the hamas government , including a israeli boycott of hundreds of millions of dollars of tax and customs duties owed to the palestinian authority , and drove it into bankruptcy . no official ties , but doors still open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fatah-hamas unity coalition officially took over on saturday on monday , the united states and european union agreed to withhold recognition of the unity government grouping western-backed moderates and islamic radicals , but they did leave the door open to future official ties . the two along with the united nations and russia , who all make up the middle east diplomatic quartet , insist that the cabinet 's program must recognize israel , renounce violence and respect past peace agreements . " i have to say that this government does not comply fully with the principles , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said monday .
" it 's much more important what they do than what they say at this point in time . " palestinian officials have repeatedly called for an end to the international aid boycott , as the gaza strip spiraled into economic chaos and violence . eu wants proof from palestinians but officials said on tuesday that the eu was in no hurry , without proof that the new government is as good as its word . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana said the new government 's actions will speak louder than its words " we need to see real action from the government , and that wo n't happen from one day to the next , " one official in brussels said , on condition of anonymity . the union is by far the biggest aid provider to the palestinians .
it donated some 700 million euros -lrb- $ 900 million -rrb- last year , without any of the money reaching hamas . even with hamas being by-passed , the amount was around 200 million euros more than it usually provides annually . finding fair aid model most of the funds went through a temporary mechanism set up to provide fuel for hospitals and generators and pay temporary allowances to those most in need , and officials expect that to evolve . " the question of how to normalize financial assistance is something that will be addressed very gradually , " the eu official said .
" the temporary mechanism will evolve . " " we 'll keep using the mechanism for a while , " said solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach .
" it allows us to give aid .
we 're not going to close the door but we 're not going to open it right up either . " officials agreed that the eu 's position on dealing with the government - at least non-hamas members in it - is likely be made more formal at a meeting of the bloc 's foreign ministers in bremen , northern germany late next week . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , us play down differences on missile defense us efforts to set up a missile defense system are legitimate , though russia 's opposition to basing the system in eastern europe must be addressed , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said monday .

no widespread mistreatment of recruits was found . the german parliament 's military commissioner reinhold robbe released his annual report tuesday about the shortcomings of the german armed forces .
at the top of the list , robbe said the bundeswehr is underfinanced . the lack of money causes problems for soldiers in several ways , the report said .
robbe decried the decaying condition of many of the military barracks .
some are filled with mold and ready to collapse , with disgusting bathrooms . he also pointed out that soldiers are worried about their personal financial situations and remain at the bottom of their income groups . foreign missions causing financial strain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some military barracks are in bad condition the military 's financial strain needs to be taken into account before the government agrees to new deployments , robbe said .
there are some fears that germany 's army of 245,000 is overstretched , although only a relatively small percentage are engaged in foreign peacekeeping missions .
there are currently 9,000 soldiers on foreign missions in places like afghanistan , lebanon and the balkans . " in every single case it needs to be tested whether the bundeswehr is overburdened or overextended , " he said . robbe , a social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentarian , is the designated defense commissioner for the german parliament .
his role is to provide the government with an annual report about problems with the military .

the civil trial is expected to last several weeks . the staff are charged with mistreating recruits during allegedly unapproved exercises meant to toughen them up in the case of a hostage situation .
there was a national outcry after german media reported on the alleged abuse . robbe said he was convinced the coesfeld methods were not typical of the german army , and his report said such treatment did not occur at other military bases .

" it 's always been the ace in the hole of germany 's second public broadcaster zdf , and now that germany 's beloved saturday night show " wetten , dass … ? " has been bought by the abc network , it looks set to repeat its success state-side . launched in 1981 , the massively popular " wetten , dass … ?

even as the company struggles to remain profitable , most other european union countries are reluctant to liberalize their mail markets . deutsche post stocks fell 6 percent tuesday after the company announced its 2007 earnings will fall short of predictions . europe 's largest mail service provider has tried to diversify and take a more international approach in recent years . at the same time , many other eu countries have dragged their feet on liberalizing their own mail monopolies .
deutsche post said it 's worried this attitude will put them at a disadvantage . domestic postal services in eu countries are scheduled to be completely opened to competition by 2009 .
the bloc also wants to open the market for letters under 50 grams -lrb- 1.8 ounces -rrb- to private carriers and thereby get rid of state postal monopolies . deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel has used profits from the traditional mail service to transform the company into a major player in the global transport and logistics market . still , delivering letters remains a vital part of the deutsche post .
even with the company 's big push in recent years into international logistics , freight and express mail , normal mail delivery remains responsible for 25 percent of the company 's gross income , and more than 60 percent of its profit . post wants liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel wants european postal markets opened to competition zumwinkel ha said he is not against liberalization in the postal sector .
in fact , he 's betting on his company moving into liberalized postal markets of other eu countries .
but he also said he worries about competition being distorted by unequal liberalization . a date needs to be fixed for other countries to open their markets to competition , zumwinkel said , adding that it does n't bother him if germany is one of the first to do so , but " the date must be fixed . " " we 're saying : liberalization is good .
liberalization should be .
but it must take place in lockstep in europe , " zumwinkel added . zumwinkel said deutsche post would insist on reciprocity .
if germany opens its market , all european countries should do the same .
germany , the united kingdom and scandinavian countries have said they will allow foreign competition in their postal markets .
france , poland , greece , italy , spain are among the european countries reluctant to give up their postal monopolies . this reluctance goes against the idea at the basis of forming the european union , zumwinkel said .
it was supposed to mean getting rid of tariffs and forming common markets . " you ca n't say , ' i 'm going to do this to you , but you ca n't do this to me , " ' he said .
" that 's not how it works . " deutsche post employs 80,000 people in europe to deliver letters .
a 20-percent loss could endanger 32,000 jobs .
many postal employees are public servants , which makes it extremyl difficult for the post to lay them off or cut their pay . delivering mail big business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monopolists want to make sure all people get their mail it 's not only the german postal service that is labor-intensive .
in the european union , 1.6 million people work as postal carriers .
it is a $ 90 billion market . countries are concerned about issues like universal coverage as public postal carriers are required to deliver mail at acceptable prices to remote regions five days a week , even if it is n't profitable to do so . countries also worry that opening the market will lead to the tendency to find low-paid workers to deliver mail .
this is already happening to an extent in germany , with some private companies paying wages as low as four euros per hour to deliver parcels .
deutsche post also takes advantage of cheap labor .
since 2000 , the company has shed 34,000 part and full time positions , turning to subcontractors in some cases . the german government has said despite other countries ' reluctance to end their own letter-delivery monopolies , it will go forward with its plan to open its system to competition in 2008 . karl zawadzky -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks open postal markets by 2009 the european commission laid out plans to complete the opening of the european union 's postal-services market to competition by 2009 despite fierce opposition from some countries .

even more important is the all-pervasiveness of the lie in political discourse , he says , especially in the 21st century .
that is why the foundation is making an appeal for a worldwide reading tuesday to raise awareness of lying in politics and strengthen the fight against it .
the event this year , called the " second anniversary of the political lie , " will honor murdered russian journalist anna politkovskaya by reading a selection of her works .
around 50 institutions in 10 countries are set to participate .
" with this event , we want to bring more awareness to the issue and strengthen the fight against it , " said schreiber .
last year , the foundation marked the third anniversary of the beginning of the war in iraq with a worldwide reading .
on march 20 , 2006 , eliot weinberger 's 2005 text collage , " what i heard about iraq , " was read in 47 venues around the world , marking the first " day of the political lie . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya was one of the few russian journalists who reported from chechnya and in the wake of the murder of politkovskaya last october , schreiber said it was obvious that her works should be selected for this year 's event .
" in her reports , anna politkovskaya described the truth of the catastrophe of the war in chechnya , a war that has gone on far from the public eye , " he said .
" she was trying to bring the truth to light and was killed for it . "
long-time critic this year , texts from her book called " a small corner of hell : dispatches from chechnya " will be read on the radio , at public venues , public and private gatherings and schools around the world .
specifically , the readings will be from two chapters in the 2003 book : " machkety : a concentration camp with a commercial streak " and " special operation zyazikov . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya was a sharp critic of putin the chapters portray a landscape of torture and murder , condemn the cynicism of bureaucrats , depict the misery and desperation of a civilian population that is torn between the army and rebels and offer a nightmarish picture of the climate of state-fueled fear and repression in russia .
politkovskaya , a long-time critic of russian president vladimir putin , worked for a number of russian newspapers , including the small opposition paper novaya gazeta , and often wrote about how the war in chechnya was far from over , disputing the official line .
instead , she focused on human rights violations and on the civil population caught in the middle of two warring parties .
she had faced threats and intimidation .
yet she refused to have a bodyguard in the same way she refused to go into exile .
in 2004 , she was the victim of a poisoning attempt .

even more important is the all-pervasiveness of the lie in political discourse , he says , especially in the 21st century .
that is why the foundation is making an appeal for a worldwide reading tuesday to raise awareness of lying in politics and strengthen the fight against it .
the event this year , called the " second anniversary of the political lie , " will honor murdered russian journalist anna politkovskaya by reading a selection of her works .
around 50 institutions in 10 countries are set to participate .
" with this event , we want to bring more awareness to the issue and strengthen the fight against it , " said schreiber .
last year , the foundation marked the third anniversary of the beginning of the war in iraq with a worldwide reading .
on march 20 , 2006 , eliot weinberger 's 2005 text collage , " what i heard about iraq , " was read in 47 venues around the world , marking the first " day of the political lie . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya was one of the few russian journalists who reported from chechnya and in the wake of the murder of politkovskaya last october , schreiber said it was obvious that her works should be selected for this year 's event .
" in her reports , anna politkovskaya described the truth of the catastrophe of the war in chechnya , a war that has gone on far from the public eye , " he said .
" she was trying to bring the truth to light and was killed for it . "
long-time critic this year , texts from her book called " a small corner of hell : dispatches from chechnya " will be read on the radio , at public venues , public and private gatherings and schools around the world .
specifically , the readings will be from two chapters in the 2003 book : " machkety : a concentration camp with a commercial streak " and " special operation zyazikov . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya was a sharp critic of putin the chapters portray a landscape of torture and murder , condemn the cynicism of bureaucrats , depict the misery and desperation of a civilian population that is torn between the army and rebels and offer a nightmarish picture of the climate of state-fueled fear and repression in russia .
politkovskaya , a long-time critic of russian president vladimir putin , worked for a number of russian newspapers , including the small opposition paper novaya gazeta , and often wrote about how the war in chechnya was far from over , disputing the official line .
instead , she focused on human rights violations and on the civil population caught in the middle of two warring parties .
she had faced threats and intimidation .
yet she refused to have a bodyguard in the same way she refused to go into exile .
in 2004 , she was the victim of a poisoning attempt .
in october , an unknown gunman shot her dead in the stairwell of her moscow apartment block .

the line-up also includes four women , the highest share in any french presidential election . under rules designed to weed out frivolous candidacies , would-be contenders had until friday to submit 500 endorsements from france 's mayors and other elected officials to the constitutional council , the body that supervises the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : segolene royal will be the candidate for the socialists more than 40 contenders - many of them single-issue campaigners with no political support base - had initially thrown their hat in the ring .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 20.03.2007 schalke and bremen battle for the title großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's way too early for leaders schalke to start celebrating a tight race at the top and a fierce struggle at the bottom promise lots of excitement for the final quarter to the season .
who will win and lose these clashes comes down to team schedules , injuries and nerves . schalke got a boast from a long-time rival and detractor on tuesday , when bayern munich president franz beckenbauer told the tabloid bild newspaper he thinks the men in blue will take their first german title in 49 years . but the kaiser has a history of mistaken predictions , and schalke 's path to a possible trophy is rockier than it may appear at first glance .
in fact , the league leaders ' chances at the title are probably no better than those of their nearest rivals , second-placed werder bremen . home advantage versus historical baggage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have diego while schalke 's lincoln is serving a suspension schalke currently top the table by three points , but their lead is actually smaller than that .
thanks to werder 's better goal difference , a single schalke loss combined with a bremen victory would flip the two teams in the standings . that loss could come as soon as march 31 , after the bundesliga concludes its current one-week break .
schalke play bayern in munich on that date - whereas bremen no longer face the reigning champions . and then there 's the weight of history .
schalke are under enormous pressure to become german champions for the first time in nearly half-a-century .
the perennial bridesmaids in blue have shown jitters of late , and last weekend 's win over stuttgart was more luck than performance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen striker miroslav klose has been laid low in 2007 werder only play at home three times in final eight matches .
but bremen have performed equally well away as in weser stadium this season , and none of their remaining opponents are currently in the top five . bremen 's biggest worry is striker miroslav klose , who 's been ailing for most of 2007 .
if werder are to make up their deficit with schalke , they 'll need their top goal-getter to get on form . the crucial third spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without gomez , stuttgart will need a team effort stuttgart and bayern still have an outside shot at the title , should both of the favourites implode , but more likely they 'll be battling for third place and a chance to qualify for the champions league . stuttgart 's main problem is the absence of their main offensive weapon , striker mario gomez , who 's out for around five weeks with injuries .
as last week 's loss to schalke showed , it 's impossible to win games without scoring any goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern really need to beat southern german rivals stuttgart but bayern have the far tougher schedule .
they play three of their last eight games against current top-five teams , compared to stuttgart 's one , and have the additional burden of champions league matches in early april against ac milan . the crucial date here is april 21 , when the two teams lock horns in stuttgart .
if the hosts get a result , bayern could well fail to qualify for the champions league for the first time since 1995 . the elevator down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund went into free fall in february mönchengladbach , bielefeld and bochum currently occupy the drop zone and are most likely to be relegated .
but plenty teams are teetering on the edge of the precipice , including bundesliga giants hamburg and dortmund , and popular underdogs mainz . the signs are most positive for hamburg .
they play 5 of their final matches at home and only 2 against top-five clubs .
if playmaker rafael van der vaart stays fit , hamburg should stay up . dortmund have it considerably harder .
they have only 3 home games and an equal number against top opposition .
moreover they 're on a downward curve , having not won since mid-february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiny mainz still have a lot of work against bigger opponents meanwhile , mainz 's miracle comeback could falter due to a back-loaded schedule featuring clashes with leverkusen , schalke , stuttgart and , on the last day of the season , bayern .

no widespread mistreatment of recruits was found . the german parliament 's military commissioner reinhold robbe released his annual report tuesday about the shortcomings of the german armed forces .
at the top of the list , robbe said the bundeswehr is underfinanced . the lack of money causes problems for soldiers in several ways , the report said .
robbe decried the decaying condition of many of the military barracks .
some are filled with mold and ready to collapse , with disgusting bathrooms . he also pointed out that soldiers are worried about their personal financial situations and remain at the bottom of their income groups . foreign missions causing financial strain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some military barracks are in bad condition the military 's financial strain needs to be taken into account before the government agrees to new deployments , robbe said .
there are some fears that germany 's army of 245,000 is overstretched , although only a relatively small percentage are engaged in foreign peacekeeping missions .
there are currently 9,000 soldiers on foreign missions in places like afghanistan , lebanon and the balkans . " in every single case it needs to be tested whether the bundeswehr is overburdened or overextended , " he said . robbe , a social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentarian , is the designated defense commissioner for the german parliament .
his role is to provide the government with an annual report about problems with the military .
he also warns politicians about any problems in the military and to be an outside point of contact for soldiers . mistreatment not widespread bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recruits not mishandled , report says the german army has dealt with several high-profile scandals recently .

the civil trial is expected to last several weeks . the staff are charged with mistreating recruits during allegedly unapproved exercises meant to toughen them up in the case of a hostage situation .
there was a national outcry after german media reported on the alleged abuse . robbe said he was convinced the coesfeld methods were not typical of the german army , and his report said such treatment did not occur at other military bases .

" poland is the only country apart from belarus where this issue has never been settled , " said jehuda evron , chairman of the us-based holocaust restitution committee . he called on polish lawmakers to act so elderly victims of expropriation " at the end of their lives should have a feeling that justice has been done . " jewish and non-jewish groups have joined forces to step up the pressure as poland 's parliament makes its 17th attempt to come up with legislation to settle the issue . a draft bill currently before parliament , which would pay 15 percent compensation to former owners and their heirs , has drawn criticism from the groups . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has had to face claims since it joined the eu in 2004 " we demand that a law is passed quickly to allow former property owners to recover their real estate , where possible , and where it is not , that they are compensated , " said miroslaw szypowski , head of the national association of former property owners . " the government has n't consulted us , " he added , referring to the 250,000-member polish property-owners ' association .
" it 's as if we do n't exist . " doing their utmost last month , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski told a delegation of jewish campaigners that his government would do its utmost to ensure parliament passed a compensation law by the end of the year . the value of seized property for which compensation is being sought is estimated at 16 billion euros to 18 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.3 billion to $ 23.9 billion -rrb- , according to the property owners ' association . jewish property was seized by nazi germany after the invasion of poland in 1939 . after world war ii , poland 's new soviet-inspired communist government nationalized property from non-jewish poles and from the few jews who had survived the holocaust . german claims attacked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is trying to improve ties between the two on monday , kaczynski also slammed the german government for failing to halt property claims by germans expelled at the end of world war ii from newly polish territory . " i must underline that in order to have genuinely normal relations between poland and germany ... this issue must be settled , " kaczynski told reporters , in the wake of a visit to poland by german chancellor angela merkel . kaczynski bemoaned the fact that merkel 's position during her visit " proved that there has been no progress on this issue . " merkel 's trip was aimed at patching up relations between warsaw and berlin , which have seen the historic wound of the nazi occupation of poland reopened since poland 's conservative twins - the premier and his brother president lech kaczynski - came to power . no government support in a speech at warsaw university on friday , merkel said berlin did not and would not support the prussian trust , a small german association which filed 22 claims late last year at the european court of human rights seeking the restitution of property that lies in present-day poland . warsaw , however , has repeatedly called on the german government to do more , notably by acting to prevent property lawsuits being brought by individuals . kaczynski , who has launched a series of stinging verbal attacks on berlin about the issue , said poland was pressing germany " to decide finally to make a clear declaration that these claims have no basis in german and international law . " the claims stem from the redrawing of borders agreed by the soviet union , britain and the united states at the 1945 potsdam conference which saw large parts of eastern germany awarded to poland , which in turn lost a swathe of its own eastern territory to the soviets . millions of germans living in what is now northern and western poland were expelled , leaving behind property and land . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor merkel heads to poland as tensions remain high german chancellor angela merkel put improving bilateral ties high on her agenda before leaving for talks in warsaw .

" it 's always been the ace in the hole of germany 's second public broadcaster zdf , and now that germany 's beloved saturday night show " wetten , dass … ? " has been bought by the abc network , it looks set to repeat its success state-side . launched in 1981 , the massively popular " wetten , dass … ? " could soon become appointment viewing to us audiences as " wanna bet ? " . tv executives on both sides of the atlantic are confident they 'll strike lucky - and the gamble certainly looks like a pretty safe bet . as the most successful show not just in germany but in europe , " wetten , dass ... ? " comprises a mix of celebrity interviews , music and bizarre stunts , dishing up wholesome saturday night viewing that usually over-runs its scheduled 2 hours by at least 45 minutes - and no one even minds . over the years , the show has become a national treasure , turning host thomas gottschalk into a household name , not to mention a multi-millionaire ; consistently ranking no. 1 in the audience stakes with up to 16 million viewers ; and achieving an average market share of 46 percent in a cutthroat saturday evening slot . the concept bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was shocked by michael jackson 's appearance on the show half game show and half talk show , its basic gimmick is getting ordinary people to perform outlandish tasks varying from a chinese martial artist pushing a car with a spear resting on his throat to a nine-year-old boy from vienna computing the shortest bus and railcar routes throughout the city from memory . as entertaining as that can be , the show 's chief attractions are the stars invited to bet for charity on the outcome of the performances and to offer a wager to be carried out if they lose . from then chancellor gerhard schröder driving home an audience member as a forfeit to an ashen-faced michael jackson appearing too weak to hold his own mike , for the last 25 years the show has been providing germany with most of its memorable tv moments , fuelling many a monday-morning water-cooler discussion . successful export bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " wetten , dass ... ?

" the licensing contract with the us has opened the doors to this hit show in the english-language territories , " said alexander coridass , president and ceo of zdf enterprises . so us producers are playing for high stakes , choosing to air their new 60-minute show in a prime time slot once a week - unlike germany , where it broadcasts live just six to seven times a year . but if the show proves as successful in the us as it is in germany , everyone will be a winner .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.03.2007 germany 's deutsche post wants europe to open markets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mail competition is likely to heat up in europe deutsche post 's monopoly on letter delivery will end next year .
even as the company struggles to remain profitable , most other european union countries are reluctant to liberalize their mail markets . deutsche post stocks fell 6 percent tuesday after the company announced its 2007 earnings will fall short of predictions . europe 's largest mail service provider has tried to diversify and take a more international approach in recent years . at the same time , many other eu countries have dragged their feet on liberalizing their own mail monopolies .
deutsche post said it 's worried this attitude will put them at a disadvantage . domestic postal services in eu countries are scheduled to be completely opened to competition by 2009 .
the bloc also wants to open the market for letters under 50 grams -lrb- 1.8 ounces -rrb- to private carriers and thereby get rid of state postal monopolies . deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel has used profits from the traditional mail service to transform the company into a major player in the global transport and logistics market . still , delivering letters remains a vital part of the deutsche post .
even with the company 's big push in recent years into international logistics , freight and express mail , normal mail delivery remains responsible for 25 percent of the company 's gross income , and more than 60 percent of its profit . post wants liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel wants european postal markets opened to competition zumwinkel ha said he is not against liberalization in the postal sector .
in fact , he 's betting on his company moving into liberalized postal markets of other eu countries .
but he also said he worries about competition being distorted by unequal liberalization . a date needs to be fixed for other countries to open their markets to competition , zumwinkel said , adding that it does n't bother him if germany is one of the first to do so , but " the date must be fixed . " " we 're saying : liberalization is good .
liberalization should be .
but it must take place in lockstep in europe , " zumwinkel added . zumwinkel said deutsche post would insist on reciprocity .
if germany opens its market , all european countries should do the same .
germany , the united kingdom and scandinavian countries have said they will allow foreign competition in their postal markets .
france , poland , greece , italy , spain are among the european countries reluctant to give up their postal monopolies . this reluctance goes against the idea at the basis of forming the european union , zumwinkel said .
it was supposed to mean getting rid of tariffs and forming common markets . " you ca n't say , ' i 'm going to do this to you , but you ca n't do this to me , " ' he said .
" that 's not how it works . " deutsche post employs 80,000 people in europe to deliver letters .
a 20-percent loss could endanger 32,000 jobs .
many postal employees are public servants , which makes it extremyl difficult for the post to lay them off or cut their pay . delivering mail big business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monopolists want to make sure all people get their mail it 's not only the german postal service that is labor-intensive .
in the european union , 1.6 million people work as postal carriers .
it is a $ 90 billion market . countries are concerned about issues like universal coverage as public postal carriers are required to deliver mail at acceptable prices to remote regions five days a week , even if it is n't profitable to do so . countries also worry that opening the market will lead to the tendency to find low-paid workers to deliver mail .
this is already happening to an extent in germany , with some private companies paying wages as low as four euros per hour to deliver parcels .
deutsche post also takes advantage of cheap labor .
since 2000 , the company has shed 34,000 part and full time positions , turning to subcontractors in some cases . the german government has said despite other countries ' reluctance to end their own letter-delivery monopolies , it will go forward with its plan to open its system to competition in 2008 . karl zawadzky -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks open postal markets by 2009 the european commission laid out plans to complete the opening of the european union 's postal-services market to competition by 2009 despite fierce opposition from some countries .

even more important is the all-pervasiveness of the lie in political discourse , he says , especially in the 21st century .
that is why the foundation is making an appeal for a worldwide reading tuesday to raise awareness of lying in politics and strengthen the fight against it .
the event this year , called the " second anniversary of the political lie , " will honor murdered russian journalist anna politkovskaya by reading a selection of her works .
around 50 institutions in 10 countries are set to participate .
" with this event , we want to bring more awareness to the issue and strengthen the fight against it , " said schreiber .
last year , the foundation marked the third anniversary of the beginning of the war in iraq with a worldwide reading .
on march 20 , 2006 , eliot weinberger 's 2005 text collage , " what i heard about iraq , " was read in 47 venues around the world , marking the first " day of the political lie . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya was one of the few russian journalists who reported from chechnya and in the wake of the murder of politkovskaya last october , schreiber said it was obvious that her works should be selected for this year 's event .
" in her reports , anna politkovskaya described the truth of the catastrophe of the war in chechnya , a war that has gone on far from the public eye , " he said .
" she was trying to bring the truth to light and was killed for it . "
long-time critic this year , texts from her book called " a small corner of hell : dispatches from chechnya " will be read on the radio , at public venues , public and private gatherings and schools around the world .
specifically , the readings will be from two chapters in the 2003 book : " machkety : a concentration camp with a commercial streak " and " special operation zyazikov . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya was a sharp critic of putin the chapters portray a landscape of torture and murder , condemn the cynicism of bureaucrats , depict the misery and desperation of a civilian population that is torn between the army and rebels and offer a nightmarish picture of the climate of state-fueled fear and repression in russia .
politkovskaya , a long-time critic of russian president vladimir putin , worked for a number of russian newspapers , including the small opposition paper novaya gazeta , and often wrote about how the war in chechnya was far from over , disputing the official line .
instead , she focused on human rights violations and on the civil population caught in the middle of two warring parties .
she had faced threats and intimidation .
yet she refused to have a bodyguard in the same way she refused to go into exile .
in 2004 , she was the victim of a poisoning attempt .

" aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which he co-edited with robert a. hinde , dissects human aggression and war . dw-radio : why has embedding journalists become a popular way to report on war ? jo groebel : the term " embedded journalist " made the headlines during the iraq war when the united states entered the country .
lots of journalists were more or less siding with the soldiers entering the country .
the idea there was , rather than having reporting with this certain distance to what 's actually going on , that journalists would have a first-hand image and first-hand impression of what 's going on .
criticism has , of course , been addressing the fact that someone so close to a certain war party may lose his or her neutrality and objectivity . in your opinion , is it possible for an embedded journalist to be critical or does he have to satisfy the government upon which he relies for his information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if news from reporters traveling with soldiers can remain objective well , i think it 's probably more psychological than immediately some kind of oppression .
certainly , there is a danger if i 'm siding with certain soldiers and there are attacks , there may be what in a completely different context one called the stockholm syndrome .
even if you are critical of those who are there , the pure fact that there is a certain closeness and common threat coming from the other side may interfere with objectivity .
and there 's another side to it that one would probably only pick those journalists who are sympathetic with those they are accompanying . do you think it is possible for a journalist , whether he 's imbedded or not , to do objective reporting in a war situation ? in war itself , it 's nearly impossible to come up with a final truth .
i suppose this is far beyond a question of whether there 's embedded journalism or not .
one could even claim that journalism and fact reporting itself is something which is a very tricky thing to relate immediately to any kind of proof . there have been some reports that pictures broadcast from the last two persian gulf wars were faked .
how badly manipulated are reports by embedded journalists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military also maintains a supply of reporter-soldiers i would say this is a more fundamental challenge than particularly with embedded journalists .
war automatically means also war about public opinion .
all armies do have battalions of people who are only dealing with the interpretation or manipulation of facts .
embedded journalism clearly has the aim to create sympathy among those who are accompanying the army and the soldiers .
i suppose it 's kind of more of a variation of what already always has been the somewhat tricky approach to truth and objective journalism in a war situation . another us war that got huge media coverage was the vietnam war in the 1970s .
can the media output of the vietnam war be compared in any way to the current war in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas masks are part of the equipment of a war correspondent i suppose what 's definitely pretty similar is that you see a shift in change in public opinion , most certainly within the united states .
with or without imbedded journalism , you ca n't really control all of those images coming from the war .
so with the increasing number of images of victims nearly daily and -lrb- images of -rrb- all the dead soldiers , particularly american soldiers and also iraqis , it becomes increasingly obvious that this is probably a war which can not be won .
this is certainly a similarity with vietnam .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 20.03.2007 schalke and bremen battle for the title großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's way too early for leaders schalke to start celebrating a tight race at the top and a fierce struggle at the bottom promise lots of excitement for the final quarter to the season .
who will win and lose these clashes comes down to team schedules , injuries and nerves . schalke got a boast from a long-time rival and detractor on tuesday , when bayern munich president franz beckenbauer told the tabloid bild newspaper he thinks the men in blue will take their first german title in 49 years . but the kaiser has a history of mistaken predictions , and schalke 's path to a possible trophy is rockier than it may appear at first glance .
in fact , the league leaders ' chances at the title are probably no better than those of their nearest rivals , second-placed werder bremen . home advantage versus historical baggage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have diego while schalke 's lincoln is serving a suspension schalke currently top the table by three points , but their lead is actually smaller than that .
thanks to werder 's better goal difference , a single schalke loss combined with a bremen victory would flip the two teams in the standings . that loss could come as soon as march 31 , after the bundesliga concludes its current one-week break .
schalke play bayern in munich on that date - whereas bremen no longer face the reigning champions . and then there 's the weight of history .
schalke are under enormous pressure to become german champions for the first time in nearly half-a-century .
the perennial bridesmaids in blue have shown jitters of late , and last weekend 's win over stuttgart was more luck than performance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen striker miroslav klose has been laid low in 2007 werder only play at home three times in final eight matches .
but bremen have performed equally well away as in weser stadium this season , and none of their remaining opponents are currently in the top five . bremen 's biggest worry is striker miroslav klose , who 's been ailing for most of 2007 .
if werder are to make up their deficit with schalke , they 'll need their top goal-getter to get on form . the crucial third spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without gomez , stuttgart will need a team effort stuttgart and bayern still have an outside shot at the title , should both of the favourites implode , but more likely they 'll be battling for third place and a chance to qualify for the champions league . stuttgart 's main problem is the absence of their main offensive weapon , striker mario gomez , who 's out for around five weeks with injuries .
as last week 's loss to schalke showed , it 's impossible to win games without scoring any goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern really need to beat southern german rivals stuttgart but bayern have the far tougher schedule .
they play three of their last eight games against current top-five teams , compared to stuttgart 's one , and have the additional burden of champions league matches in early april against ac milan . the crucial date here is april 21 , when the two teams lock horns in stuttgart .
if the hosts get a result , bayern could well fail to qualify for the champions league for the first time since 1995 . the elevator down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund went into free fall in february mönchengladbach , bielefeld and bochum currently occupy the drop zone and are most likely to be relegated .
but plenty teams are teetering on the edge of the precipice , including bundesliga giants hamburg and dortmund , and popular underdogs mainz . the signs are most positive for hamburg .
they play 5 of their final matches at home and only 2 against top-five clubs .
if playmaker rafael van der vaart stays fit , hamburg should stay up . dortmund have it considerably harder .
they have only 3 home games and an equal number against top opposition .
moreover they 're on a downward curve , having not won since mid-february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiny mainz still have a lot of work against bigger opponents meanwhile , mainz 's miracle comeback could falter due to a back-loaded schedule featuring clashes with leverkusen , schalke , stuttgart and , on the last day of the season , bayern .
dead last at the winter break , mainz could come up heartbreakingly short as the 2006-7 campaign comes to what 's sure to be an exciting conclusion . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen still in the hunt behind schalke as bayern , stuttgart fall a 2-0 home win for werder bremen over mainz sunday reduced schalke 04 's lead at the top of the bundesliga to three points .
schalke beat third-placed stuttgart saturday while fourth-placed bayern munich lost in frankfurt .
-lrb- 19.03.2007 -rrb- managerial musical chairs no surprise for dortmund fans many soccer fans will be incredulous that borussia dortmund are on their third coach of the season .
but supporters of the rhine valley giants will be less surprised .
the club has a reputation for short coaching tenures .
-lrb- 14.03.2007 -rrb- nice guys need not finish last nearly everyone wrote off mainz who had just 11 points at the end of 2006 and were stuck at the bottom of the table .
but in the season 's second leg , they reeled off an unprecedented streak to escape the relegation zone .

" poland is the only country apart from belarus where this issue has never been settled , " said jehuda evron , chairman of the us-based holocaust restitution committee . he called on polish lawmakers to act so elderly victims of expropriation " at the end of their lives should have a feeling that justice has been done . " jewish and non-jewish groups have joined forces to step up the pressure as poland 's parliament makes its 17th attempt to come up with legislation to settle the issue . a draft bill currently before parliament , which would pay 15 percent compensation to former owners and their heirs , has drawn criticism from the groups . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has had to face claims since it joined the eu in 2004 " we demand that a law is passed quickly to allow former property owners to recover their real estate , where possible , and where it is not , that they are compensated , " said miroslaw szypowski , head of the national association of former property owners . " the government has n't consulted us , " he added , referring to the 250,000-member polish property-owners ' association .
" it 's as if we do n't exist . " doing their utmost last month , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski told a delegation of jewish campaigners that his government would do its utmost to ensure parliament passed a compensation law by the end of the year . the value of seized property for which compensation is being sought is estimated at 16 billion euros to 18 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.3 billion to $ 23.9 billion -rrb- , according to the property owners ' association . jewish property was seized by nazi germany after the invasion of poland in 1939 . after world war ii , poland 's new soviet-inspired communist government nationalized property from non-jewish poles and from the few jews who had survived the holocaust . german claims attacked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is trying to improve ties between the two on monday , kaczynski also slammed the german government for failing to halt property claims by germans expelled at the end of world war ii from newly polish territory . " i must underline that in order to have genuinely normal relations between poland and germany ... this issue must be settled , " kaczynski told reporters , in the wake of a visit to poland by german chancellor angela merkel . kaczynski bemoaned the fact that merkel 's position during her visit " proved that there has been no progress on this issue .

even more important is the all-pervasiveness of the lie in political discourse , he says , especially in the 21st century .
that is why the foundation is making an appeal for a worldwide reading tuesday to raise awareness of lying in politics and strengthen the fight against it .
the event this year , called the " second anniversary of the political lie , " will honor murdered russian journalist anna politkovskaya by reading a selection of her works .
around 50 institutions in 10 countries are set to participate .
" with this event , we want to bring more awareness to the issue and strengthen the fight against it , " said schreiber .
last year , the foundation marked the third anniversary of the beginning of the war in iraq with a worldwide reading .
on march 20 , 2006 , eliot weinberger 's 2005 text collage , " what i heard about iraq , " was read in 47 venues around the world , marking the first " day of the political lie . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya was one of the few russian journalists who reported from chechnya and in the wake of the murder of politkovskaya last october , schreiber said it was obvious that her works should be selected for this year 's event .
" in her reports , anna politkovskaya described the truth of the catastrophe of the war in chechnya , a war that has gone on far from the public eye , " he said .
" she was trying to bring the truth to light and was killed for it . "
long-time critic this year , texts from her book called " a small corner of hell : dispatches from chechnya " will be read on the radio , at public venues , public and private gatherings and schools around the world .
specifically , the readings will be from two chapters in the 2003 book : " machkety : a concentration camp with a commercial streak " and " special operation zyazikov . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya was a sharp critic of putin the chapters portray a landscape of torture and murder , condemn the cynicism of bureaucrats , depict the misery and desperation of a civilian population that is torn between the army and rebels and offer a nightmarish picture of the climate of state-fueled fear and repression in russia .
politkovskaya , a long-time critic of russian president vladimir putin , worked for a number of russian newspapers , including the small opposition paper novaya gazeta , and often wrote about how the war in chechnya was far from over , disputing the official line .
instead , she focused on human rights violations and on the civil population caught in the middle of two warring parties .
she had faced threats and intimidation .
yet she refused to have a bodyguard in the same way she refused to go into exile .
in 2004 , she was the victim of a poisoning attempt .
in october , an unknown gunman shot her dead in the stairwell of her moscow apartment block .

belgian foreign minister karel de gucht may also hold talks with him . " there is no eu decision that would ban such visits , nor any decision laying out the eu 's policy on such contacts , " explained the european commission 's spokeswoman for external affairs , emma udwin . the united states also made contact with the independent finance minister , according to palestinian sources , while non-eu country norway has gone further and recognized the government outright . germany mideast quartet 's demands met bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with abbas in berlin in february german chancellor angela merkel told palestinian president mahmoud abbas in a telephone conversation on tuesday that she was pleased the new fatah-hamas unity government had contributed to some internal stability ion the region , according to government spokesman ulrich wilhelm . " at the same time , she urged again that the new government fulfill the criteria of the so-called middle east quartet , in particular the renunciation of violence and the recognition of israel , " wilhelm said . hamas swept to power a year ago .
the elections that brought it to office were endorsed but the result was shunned by the eu and the united states , as the group ranks on their terror blacklists . it led to the end of direct aid to the hamas government , including a israeli boycott of hundreds of millions of dollars of tax and customs duties owed to the palestinian authority , and drove it into bankruptcy . no official ties , but doors still open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fatah-hamas unity coalition officially took over on saturday on monday , the united states and european union agreed to withhold recognition of the unity government grouping western-backed moderates and islamic radicals , but they did leave the door open to future official ties . the two along with the united nations and russia , who all make up the middle east diplomatic quartet , insist that the cabinet 's program must recognize israel , renounce violence and respect past peace agreements . " i have to say that this government does not comply fully with the principles , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said monday .
" it 's much more important what they do than what they say at this point in time . " palestinian officials have repeatedly called for an end to the international aid boycott , as the gaza strip spiraled into economic chaos and violence . eu wants proof from palestinians but officials said on tuesday that the eu was in no hurry , without proof that the new government is as good as its word . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana said the new government 's actions will speak louder than its words " we need to see real action from the government , and that wo n't happen from one day to the next , " one official in brussels said , on condition of anonymity . the union is by far the biggest aid provider to the palestinians .
it donated some 700 million euros -lrb- $ 900 million -rrb- last year , without any of the money reaching hamas . even with hamas being by-passed , the amount was around 200 million euros more than it usually provides annually . finding fair aid model most of the funds went through a temporary mechanism set up to provide fuel for hospitals and generators and pay temporary allowances to those most in need , and officials expect that to evolve . " the question of how to normalize financial assistance is something that will be addressed very gradually , " the eu official said .
" the temporary mechanism will evolve . " " we 'll keep using the mechanism for a while , " said solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach .
" it allows us to give aid .
we 're not going to close the door but we 're not going to open it right up either . " officials agreed that the eu 's position on dealing with the government - at least non-hamas members in it - is likely be made more formal at a meeting of the bloc 's foreign ministers in bremen , northern germany late next week . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , us play down differences on missile defense us efforts to set up a missile defense system are legitimate , though russia 's opposition to basing the system in eastern europe must be addressed , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said monday .

even more important is the all-pervasiveness of the lie in political discourse , he says , especially in the 21st century .
that is why the foundation is making an appeal for a worldwide reading tuesday to raise awareness of lying in politics and strengthen the fight against it .
the event this year , called the " second anniversary of the political lie , " will honor murdered russian journalist anna politkovskaya by reading a selection of her works .
around 50 institutions in 10 countries are set to participate .
" with this event , we want to bring more awareness to the issue and strengthen the fight against it , " said schreiber .
last year , the foundation marked the third anniversary of the beginning of the war in iraq with a worldwide reading .
on march 20 , 2006 , eliot weinberger 's 2005 text collage , " what i heard about iraq , " was read in 47 venues around the world , marking the first " day of the political lie . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya was one of the few russian journalists who reported from chechnya and in the wake of the murder of politkovskaya last october , schreiber said it was obvious that her works should be selected for this year 's event .
" in her reports , anna politkovskaya described the truth of the catastrophe of the war in chechnya , a war that has gone on far from the public eye , " he said .
" she was trying to bring the truth to light and was killed for it . "
long-time critic this year , texts from her book called " a small corner of hell : dispatches from chechnya " will be read on the radio , at public venues , public and private gatherings and schools around the world .
specifically , the readings will be from two chapters in the 2003 book : " machkety : a concentration camp with a commercial streak " and " special operation zyazikov . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya was a sharp critic of putin the chapters portray a landscape of torture and murder , condemn the cynicism of bureaucrats , depict the misery and desperation of a civilian population that is torn between the army and rebels and offer a nightmarish picture of the climate of state-fueled fear and repression in russia .
politkovskaya , a long-time critic of russian president vladimir putin , worked for a number of russian newspapers , including the small opposition paper novaya gazeta , and often wrote about how the war in chechnya was far from over , disputing the official line .
instead , she focused on human rights violations and on the civil population caught in the middle of two warring parties .
she had faced threats and intimidation .
yet she refused to have a bodyguard in the same way she refused to go into exile .
in 2004 , she was the victim of a poisoning attempt .
in october , an unknown gunman shot her dead in the stairwell of her moscow apartment block .

some are filled with mold and ready to collapse , with disgusting bathrooms . he also pointed out that soldiers are worried about their personal financial situations and remain at the bottom of their income groups . foreign missions causing financial strain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some military barracks are in bad condition the military 's financial strain needs to be taken into account before the government agrees to new deployments , robbe said .
there are some fears that germany 's army of 245,000 is overstretched , although only a relatively small percentage are engaged in foreign peacekeeping missions .
there are currently 9,000 soldiers on foreign missions in places like afghanistan , lebanon and the balkans . " in every single case it needs to be tested whether the bundeswehr is overburdened or overextended , " he said . robbe , a social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentarian , is the designated defense commissioner for the german parliament .
his role is to provide the government with an annual report about problems with the military .
he also warns politicians about any problems in the military and to be an outside point of contact for soldiers . mistreatment not widespread bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recruits not mishandled , report says the german army has dealt with several high-profile scandals recently .
seven german soldiers face court martial for photographs which depict them posing and playing with human skulls while stationed in afghanistan . on monday , a separate trial of 18 training staff began , charging the staff of mistreating as many as 163 armed forces personnel in 2004 at a base in coesfeld near the northern german city of münster .
the civil trial is expected to last several weeks . the staff are charged with mistreating recruits during allegedly unapproved exercises meant to toughen them up in the case of a hostage situation .
there was a national outcry after german media reported on the alleged abuse . robbe said he was convinced the coesfeld methods were not typical of the german army , and his report said such treatment did not occur at other military bases . " in view of the information i 've been given since , i can say that the armed forces have definitely learned from this incident , " he said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundeswehr officials in court over brutal hazing of recruits eighteen training officials from the german military are in court charged with the abuse of recruits .

" aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which he co-edited with robert a. hinde , dissects human aggression and war . dw-radio : why has embedding journalists become a popular way to report on war ? jo groebel : the term " embedded journalist " made the headlines during the iraq war when the united states entered the country .
lots of journalists were more or less siding with the soldiers entering the country .
the idea there was , rather than having reporting with this certain distance to what 's actually going on , that journalists would have a first-hand image and first-hand impression of what 's going on .
criticism has , of course , been addressing the fact that someone so close to a certain war party may lose his or her neutrality and objectivity . in your opinion , is it possible for an embedded journalist to be critical or does he have to satisfy the government upon which he relies for his information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if news from reporters traveling with soldiers can remain objective well , i think it 's probably more psychological than immediately some kind of oppression .
certainly , there is a danger if i 'm siding with certain soldiers and there are attacks , there may be what in a completely different context one called the stockholm syndrome .
even if you are critical of those who are there , the pure fact that there is a certain closeness and common threat coming from the other side may interfere with objectivity .
and there 's another side to it that one would probably only pick those journalists who are sympathetic with those they are accompanying . do you think it is possible for a journalist , whether he 's imbedded or not , to do objective reporting in a war situation ? in war itself , it 's nearly impossible to come up with a final truth .
i suppose this is far beyond a question of whether there 's embedded journalism or not .
one could even claim that journalism and fact reporting itself is something which is a very tricky thing to relate immediately to any kind of proof . there have been some reports that pictures broadcast from the last two persian gulf wars were faked .
how badly manipulated are reports by embedded journalists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military also maintains a supply of reporter-soldiers i would say this is a more fundamental challenge than particularly with embedded journalists .
war automatically means also war about public opinion .
all armies do have battalions of people who are only dealing with the interpretation or manipulation of facts .
embedded journalism clearly has the aim to create sympathy among those who are accompanying the army and the soldiers .
i suppose it 's kind of more of a variation of what already always has been the somewhat tricky approach to truth and objective journalism in a war situation . another us war that got huge media coverage was the vietnam war in the 1970s .
can the media output of the vietnam war be compared in any way to the current war in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas masks are part of the equipment of a war correspondent i suppose what 's definitely pretty similar is that you see a shift in change in public opinion , most certainly within the united states .
with or without imbedded journalism , you ca n't really control all of those images coming from the war .
so with the increasing number of images of victims nearly daily and -lrb- images of -rrb- all the dead soldiers , particularly american soldiers and also iraqis , it becomes increasingly obvious that this is probably a war which can not be won .
this is certainly a similarity with vietnam .
starting out , loyalty with government .
then , a real shift due to images , again , with or without embedded journalism , regarding the real face of the war .
and i suppose public opinion now has certainly changed due to media reporting . kerstin winter interviewed jo groebel -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us soldier found guilty of desertion at trial in germany as an american is convicted of desertion for his attempts to leave the army , organizations in germany that counsel soldiers on how they can avoid being sent to war said they 've been flooded with inquires .

" aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which he co-edited with robert a. hinde , dissects human aggression and war . dw-radio : why has embedding journalists become a popular way to report on war ? jo groebel : the term " embedded journalist " made the headlines during the iraq war when the united states entered the country .
lots of journalists were more or less siding with the soldiers entering the country .
the idea there was , rather than having reporting with this certain distance to what 's actually going on , that journalists would have a first-hand image and first-hand impression of what 's going on .
criticism has , of course , been addressing the fact that someone so close to a certain war party may lose his or her neutrality and objectivity . in your opinion , is it possible for an embedded journalist to be critical or does he have to satisfy the government upon which he relies for his information ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if news from reporters traveling with soldiers can remain objective well , i think it 's probably more psychological than immediately some kind of oppression .
certainly , there is a danger if i 'm siding with certain soldiers and there are attacks , there may be what in a completely different context one called the stockholm syndrome .
even if you are critical of those who are there , the pure fact that there is a certain closeness and common threat coming from the other side may interfere with objectivity .
and there 's another side to it that one would probably only pick those journalists who are sympathetic with those they are accompanying . do you think it is possible for a journalist , whether he 's imbedded or not , to do objective reporting in a war situation ? in war itself , it 's nearly impossible to come up with a final truth .
i suppose this is far beyond a question of whether there 's embedded journalism or not .
one could even claim that journalism and fact reporting itself is something which is a very tricky thing to relate immediately to any kind of proof . there have been some reports that pictures broadcast from the last two persian gulf wars were faked .
how badly manipulated are reports by embedded journalists ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military also maintains a supply of reporter-soldiers i would say this is a more fundamental challenge than particularly with embedded journalists .
war automatically means also war about public opinion .
all armies do have battalions of people who are only dealing with the interpretation or manipulation of facts .
embedded journalism clearly has the aim to create sympathy among those who are accompanying the army and the soldiers .
i suppose it 's kind of more of a variation of what already always has been the somewhat tricky approach to truth and objective journalism in a war situation . another us war that got huge media coverage was the vietnam war in the 1970s .
can the media output of the vietnam war be compared in any way to the current war in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas masks are part of the equipment of a war correspondent i suppose what 's definitely pretty similar is that you see a shift in change in public opinion , most certainly within the united states .
with or without imbedded journalism , you ca n't really control all of those images coming from the war .
so with the increasing number of images of victims nearly daily and -lrb- images of -rrb- all the dead soldiers , particularly american soldiers and also iraqis , it becomes increasingly obvious that this is probably a war which can not be won .
this is certainly a similarity with vietnam .
starting out , loyalty with government .

even as the company struggles to remain profitable , most other european union countries are reluctant to liberalize their mail markets . deutsche post stocks fell 6 percent tuesday after the company announced its 2007 earnings will fall short of predictions . europe 's largest mail service provider has tried to diversify and take a more international approach in recent years . at the same time , many other eu countries have dragged their feet on liberalizing their own mail monopolies .
deutsche post said it 's worried this attitude will put them at a disadvantage . domestic postal services in eu countries are scheduled to be completely opened to competition by 2009 .
the bloc also wants to open the market for letters under 50 grams -lrb- 1.8 ounces -rrb- to private carriers and thereby get rid of state postal monopolies . deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel has used profits from the traditional mail service to transform the company into a major player in the global transport and logistics market . still , delivering letters remains a vital part of the deutsche post .
even with the company 's big push in recent years into international logistics , freight and express mail , normal mail delivery remains responsible for 25 percent of the company 's gross income , and more than 60 percent of its profit . post wants liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel wants european postal markets opened to competition zumwinkel ha said he is not against liberalization in the postal sector .
in fact , he 's betting on his company moving into liberalized postal markets of other eu countries .
but he also said he worries about competition being distorted by unequal liberalization . a date needs to be fixed for other countries to open their markets to competition , zumwinkel said , adding that it does n't bother him if germany is one of the first to do so , but " the date must be fixed . " " we 're saying : liberalization is good .
liberalization should be .
but it must take place in lockstep in europe , " zumwinkel added . zumwinkel said deutsche post would insist on reciprocity .
if germany opens its market , all european countries should do the same .
germany , the united kingdom and scandinavian countries have said they will allow foreign competition in their postal markets .
france , poland , greece , italy , spain are among the european countries reluctant to give up their postal monopolies . this reluctance goes against the idea at the basis of forming the european union , zumwinkel said .
it was supposed to mean getting rid of tariffs and forming common markets . " you ca n't say , ' i 'm going to do this to you , but you ca n't do this to me , " ' he said .
" that 's not how it works . " deutsche post employs 80,000 people in europe to deliver letters .
a 20-percent loss could endanger 32,000 jobs .
many postal employees are public servants , which makes it extremyl difficult for the post to lay them off or cut their pay . delivering mail big business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monopolists want to make sure all people get their mail it 's not only the german postal service that is labor-intensive .
in the european union , 1.6 million people work as postal carriers .
it is a $ 90 billion market . countries are concerned about issues like universal coverage as public postal carriers are required to deliver mail at acceptable prices to remote regions five days a week , even if it is n't profitable to do so . countries also worry that opening the market will lead to the tendency to find low-paid workers to deliver mail .
this is already happening to an extent in germany , with some private companies paying wages as low as four euros per hour to deliver parcels .
deutsche post also takes advantage of cheap labor .
since 2000 , the company has shed 34,000 part and full time positions , turning to subcontractors in some cases . the german government has said despite other countries ' reluctance to end their own letter-delivery monopolies , it will go forward with its plan to open its system to competition in 2008 . karl zawadzky -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks open postal markets by 2009 the european commission laid out plans to complete the opening of the european union 's postal-services market to competition by 2009 despite fierce opposition from some countries .

even as the company struggles to remain profitable , most other european union countries are reluctant to liberalize their mail markets . deutsche post stocks fell 6 percent tuesday after the company announced its 2007 earnings will fall short of predictions . europe 's largest mail service provider has tried to diversify and take a more international approach in recent years . at the same time , many other eu countries have dragged their feet on liberalizing their own mail monopolies .
deutsche post said it 's worried this attitude will put them at a disadvantage . domestic postal services in eu countries are scheduled to be completely opened to competition by 2009 .
the bloc also wants to open the market for letters under 50 grams -lrb- 1.8 ounces -rrb- to private carriers and thereby get rid of state postal monopolies . deutsche post ceo klaus zumwinkel has used profits from the traditional mail service to transform the company into a major player in the global transport and logistics market . still , delivering letters remains a vital part of the deutsche post .

" " we 're saying : liberalization is good .
liberalization should be .

if germany opens its market , all european countries should do the same .
germany , the united kingdom and scandinavian countries have said they will allow foreign competition in their postal markets .
france , poland , greece , italy , spain are among the european countries reluctant to give up their postal monopolies . this reluctance goes against the idea at the basis of forming the european union , zumwinkel said .

' ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abc is betting the german talk-game show will catch on in the united states a us network has acquired the format rights to germany 's most popular long-running tv show , " wetten , dass ... ? " it 's always been the ace in the hole of germany 's second public broadcaster zdf , and now that germany 's beloved saturday night show " wetten , dass … ? " has been bought by the abc network , it looks set to repeat its success state-side . launched in 1981 , the massively popular " wetten , dass … ? " could soon become appointment viewing to us audiences as " wanna bet ? " . tv executives on both sides of the atlantic are confident they 'll strike lucky - and the gamble certainly looks like a pretty safe bet . as the most successful show not just in germany but in europe , " wetten , dass ... ? " comprises a mix of celebrity interviews , music and bizarre stunts , dishing up wholesome saturday night viewing that usually over-runs its scheduled 2 hours by at least 45 minutes - and no one even minds . over the years , the show has become a national treasure , turning host thomas gottschalk into a household name , not to mention a multi-millionaire ; consistently ranking no. 1 in the audience stakes with up to 16 million viewers ; and achieving an average market share of 46 percent in a cutthroat saturday evening slot . the concept bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was shocked by michael jackson 's appearance on the show half game show and half talk show , its basic gimmick is getting ordinary people to perform outlandish tasks varying from a chinese martial artist pushing a car with a spear resting on his throat to a nine-year-old boy from vienna computing the shortest bus and railcar routes throughout the city from memory . as entertaining as that can be , the show 's chief attractions are the stars invited to bet for charity on the outcome of the performances and to offer a wager to be carried out if they lose . from then chancellor gerhard schröder driving home an audience member as a forfeit to an ashen-faced michael jackson appearing too weak to hold his own mike , for the last 25 years the show has been providing germany with most of its memorable tv moments , fuelling many a monday-morning water-cooler discussion . successful export bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " wetten , dass ... ? " has made gottschalk a wealthy man the pilot version for the us is already in production , now that abc has signed up as presenters two popular british television personalities , anthony mcpartlin and declan donnelly .
otherwise known as ant and dec , the hosts are veterans of smash uk shows including " pop idol , " " i 'm a celebrity , get me out of here ! , " and " ant & dec 's saturday night takeaway . " the " wetten , dass … ? " concept has long been sold in the netherlands , turkey , poland , russia and china , and this latest coup is all set to consolidate its status as one of tv 's all-time winners . " the licensing contract with the us has opened the doors to this hit show in the english-language territories , " said alexander coridass , president and ceo of zdf enterprises . so us producers are playing for high stakes , choosing to air their new 60-minute show in a prime time slot once a week - unlike germany , where it broadcasts live just six to seven times a year . but if the show proves as successful in the us as it is in germany , everyone will be a winner .

" poland is the only country apart from belarus where this issue has never been settled , " said jehuda evron , chairman of the us-based holocaust restitution committee . he called on polish lawmakers to act so elderly victims of expropriation " at the end of their lives should have a feeling that justice has been done . " jewish and non-jewish groups have joined forces to step up the pressure as poland 's parliament makes its 17th attempt to come up with legislation to settle the issue . a draft bill currently before parliament , which would pay 15 percent compensation to former owners and their heirs , has drawn criticism from the groups . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has had to face claims since it joined the eu in 2004 " we demand that a law is passed quickly to allow former property owners to recover their real estate , where possible , and where it is not , that they are compensated , " said miroslaw szypowski , head of the national association of former property owners . " the government has n't consulted us , " he added , referring to the 250,000-member polish property-owners ' association .
" it 's as if we do n't exist . " doing their utmost last month , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski told a delegation of jewish campaigners that his government would do its utmost to ensure parliament passed a compensation law by the end of the year . the value of seized property for which compensation is being sought is estimated at 16 billion euros to 18 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.3 billion to $ 23.9 billion -rrb- , according to the property owners ' association . jewish property was seized by nazi germany after the invasion of poland in 1939 . after world war ii , poland 's new soviet-inspired communist government nationalized property from non-jewish poles and from the few jews who had survived the holocaust . german claims attacked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is trying to improve ties between the two on monday , kaczynski also slammed the german government for failing to halt property claims by germans expelled at the end of world war ii from newly polish territory .

" poland is the only country apart from belarus where this issue has never been settled , " said jehuda evron , chairman of the us-based holocaust restitution committee . he called on polish lawmakers to act so elderly victims of expropriation " at the end of their lives should have a feeling that justice has been done . " jewish and non-jewish groups have joined forces to step up the pressure as poland 's parliament makes its 17th attempt to come up with legislation to settle the issue . a draft bill currently before parliament , which would pay 15 percent compensation to former owners and their heirs , has drawn criticism from the groups . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has had to face claims since it joined the eu in 2004 " we demand that a law is passed quickly to allow former property owners to recover their real estate , where possible , and where it is not , that they are compensated , " said miroslaw szypowski , head of the national association of former property owners . " the government has n't consulted us , " he added , referring to the 250,000-member polish property-owners ' association .
" it 's as if we do n't exist . " doing their utmost last month , polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski told a delegation of jewish campaigners that his government would do its utmost to ensure parliament passed a compensation law by the end of the year . the value of seized property for which compensation is being sought is estimated at 16 billion euros to 18 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.3 billion to $ 23.9 billion -rrb- , according to the property owners ' association . jewish property was seized by nazi germany after the invasion of poland in 1939 . after world war ii , poland 's new soviet-inspired communist government nationalized property from non-jewish poles and from the few jews who had survived the holocaust . german claims attacked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is trying to improve ties between the two on monday , kaczynski also slammed the german government for failing to halt property claims by germans expelled at the end of world war ii from newly polish territory . " i must underline that in order to have genuinely normal relations between poland and germany ... this issue must be settled , " kaczynski told reporters , in the wake of a visit to poland by german chancellor angela merkel . kaczynski bemoaned the fact that merkel 's position during her visit " proved that there has been no progress on this issue . " merkel 's trip was aimed at patching up relations between warsaw and berlin , which have seen the historic wound of the nazi occupation of poland reopened since poland 's conservative twins - the premier and his brother president lech kaczynski - came to power . no government support in a speech at warsaw university on friday , merkel said berlin did not and would not support the prussian trust , a small german association which filed 22 claims late last year at the european court of human rights seeking the restitution of property that lies in present-day poland . warsaw , however , has repeatedly called on the german government to do more , notably by acting to prevent property lawsuits being brought by individuals . kaczynski , who has launched a series of stinging verbal attacks on berlin about the issue , said poland was pressing germany " to decide finally to make a clear declaration that these claims have no basis in german and international law . " the claims stem from the redrawing of borders agreed by the soviet union , britain and the united states at the 1945 potsdam conference which saw large parts of eastern germany awarded to poland , which in turn lost a swathe of its own eastern territory to the soviets . millions of germans living in what is now northern and western poland were expelled , leaving behind property and land . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor merkel heads to poland as tensions remain high german chancellor angela merkel put improving bilateral ties high on her agenda before leaving for talks in warsaw .

who will win and lose these clashes comes down to team schedules , injuries and nerves . schalke got a boast from a long-time rival and detractor on tuesday , when bayern munich president franz beckenbauer told the tabloid bild newspaper he thinks the men in blue will take their first german title in 49 years . but the kaiser has a history of mistaken predictions , and schalke 's path to a possible trophy is rockier than it may appear at first glance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 20.03.2007 schalke and bremen battle for the title großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's way too early for leaders schalke to start celebrating a tight race at the top and a fierce struggle at the bottom promise lots of excitement for the final quarter to the season .
who will win and lose these clashes comes down to team schedules , injuries and nerves . schalke got a boast from a long-time rival and detractor on tuesday , when bayern munich president franz beckenbauer told the tabloid bild newspaper he thinks the men in blue will take their first german title in 49 years . but the kaiser has a history of mistaken predictions , and schalke 's path to a possible trophy is rockier than it may appear at first glance .
in fact , the league leaders ' chances at the title are probably no better than those of their nearest rivals , second-placed werder bremen . home advantage versus historical baggage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen have diego while schalke 's lincoln is serving a suspension schalke currently top the table by three points , but their lead is actually smaller than that .
thanks to werder 's better goal difference , a single schalke loss combined with a bremen victory would flip the two teams in the standings . that loss could come as soon as march 31 , after the bundesliga concludes its current one-week break .
schalke play bayern in munich on that date - whereas bremen no longer face the reigning champions . and then there 's the weight of history .
schalke are under enormous pressure to become german champions for the first time in nearly half-a-century .
the perennial bridesmaids in blue have shown jitters of late , and last weekend 's win over stuttgart was more luck than performance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen striker miroslav klose has been laid low in 2007 werder only play at home three times in final eight matches .
but bremen have performed equally well away as in weser stadium this season , and none of their remaining opponents are currently in the top five . bremen 's biggest worry is striker miroslav klose , who 's been ailing for most of 2007 .
if werder are to make up their deficit with schalke , they 'll need their top goal-getter to get on form . the crucial third spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without gomez , stuttgart will need a team effort stuttgart and bayern still have an outside shot at the title , should both of the favourites implode , but more likely they 'll be battling for third place and a chance to qualify for the champions league . stuttgart 's main problem is the absence of their main offensive weapon , striker mario gomez , who 's out for around five weeks with injuries .
as last week 's loss to schalke showed , it 's impossible to win games without scoring any goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern really need to beat southern german rivals stuttgart but bayern have the far tougher schedule .
they play three of their last eight games against current top-five teams , compared to stuttgart 's one , and have the additional burden of champions league matches in early april against ac milan . the crucial date here is april 21 , when the two teams lock horns in stuttgart .
if the hosts get a result , bayern could well fail to qualify for the champions league for the first time since 1995 . the elevator down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund went into free fall in february mönchengladbach , bielefeld and bochum currently occupy the drop zone and are most likely to be relegated .
but plenty teams are teetering on the edge of the precipice , including bundesliga giants hamburg and dortmund , and popular underdogs mainz . the signs are most positive for hamburg .
they play 5 of their final matches at home and only 2 against top-five clubs .
if playmaker rafael van der vaart stays fit , hamburg should stay up . dortmund have it considerably harder .
they have only 3 home games and an equal number against top opposition .
moreover they 're on a downward curve , having not won since mid-february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiny mainz still have a lot of work against bigger opponents meanwhile , mainz 's miracle comeback could falter due to a back-loaded schedule featuring clashes with leverkusen , schalke , stuttgart and , on the last day of the season , bayern .
dead last at the winter break , mainz could come up heartbreakingly short as the 2006-7 campaign comes to what 's sure to be an exciting conclusion . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen still in the hunt behind schalke as bayern , stuttgart fall a 2-0 home win for werder bremen over mainz sunday reduced schalke 04 's lead at the top of the bundesliga to three points .
schalke beat third-placed stuttgart saturday while fourth-placed bayern munich lost in frankfurt .
-lrb- 19.03.2007 -rrb- managerial musical chairs no surprise for dortmund fans many soccer fans will be incredulous that borussia dortmund are on their third coach of the season .
but supporters of the rhine valley giants will be less surprised .
the club has a reputation for short coaching tenures .
-lrb- 14.03.2007 -rrb- nice guys need not finish last nearly everyone wrote off mainz who had just 11 points at the end of 2006 and were stuck at the bottom of the table .
but in the season 's second leg , they reeled off an unprecedented streak to escape the relegation zone .

the pills are said to offer a " legal high " , but the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency -lrb- mhra -rrb- has warned they can cause health problems .
it has seized thousands of pills in the past year and plans to prosecute importers , sellers and manufacturers .
many shops have withdrawn the pills from sale , but some claim bzp helps keep people away from hard drugs . "
it 's a dangerous medicinal product in its own right - people should not take it " danny lee-frost mhra bzp stands for benzyl piperazine - the main active ingredient is piperazine , which is more commonly used as an anti-worming medicine , in animals and humans .
but it also acts as a stimulant - giving similar effects to amphetamines , or speed .
that means health risks too - such as vomiting , dizziness and allergic reactions .
danny lee-frost , from the mhra , investigates the sale of unlicensed medicines .
he said : " our main concern is that people are being led to believe these are safe .
" they walk into a shop and see a sign that says ' legal alternative ' .
" but it 's not legal and it 's not an alternative - it 's a dangerous medicinal product in its own right .
people should not take it . "
felt ill sue harrison agrees .
at her shop in a busy market in manchester , she rues the day when a business contact gave her what she thought was an energy tablet . "
i need to highlight this to other people never to do this " sue harrison " within five minutes i began to feel extremely ill , " she said .
" i was just getting worse and worse and they decided to put me on a hospital ward - i really thought at that time that i was going to die .
" i know it sounds very dramatic but something like this had never happened to me before in my life .
" it takes me all my time to have a paracetamol tablet - never mind something that would harm me . "
sue harrison spent two days in hospital and it was another fortnight before she returned to work .
she is 44 and had never wanted to experiment with drugs .
" i 'm just very disappointed in myself - it 's something i will never ever do again .
" i relive it psychologically through flashbacks - but i need to highlight this to other people never to do this . "
summer festivals regulators want to make sure that clubbers and people going to the summer music festivals are aware of the risks of any substance they may be offered .
some shops that had been selling bzp have now voluntarily withdrawn the pills , after being told about the medicine agency 's investigations .
but there are claims that bzp had a useful function in keeping people away from hard drugs .
one shopkeeper , who did n't want to be identified , had sold bzp and tried it himself , with no bad effects .
" it is a big effect - it 's a lot of energy .
you feel it actually coming through your body , like a hot rush .
" on comparison to illegal ecstasy it 's the same price .
it 's not as strong as the street drugs , but it 's a way of getting people off them . "

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- london icon or ' bashed-up relic ' ?

by trevor timpson bbc news more than 50 years since they appeared on london 's streets , the routemasters are still running - but not everyone is delighted .
the veteran vehicle with its curvy design and its open platform has been called " the last bus to be a proper bus " .
many londoners remember fondly how they used to hop on and off them and pull the string to ring the bell .
but a disability rights commission spokesman says it is " a bashed-up old relic from a bygone age " and the fact that it is still running on two central london heritage routes is " a disappointment " .
a programme of repurchase and refurbishment - begun after the election of mayor ken livingstone in 2000 - stopped in 2003-4 , and the last full-scale route - the 159 - withdrew its routemasters in december 2005 .
what remained was the heritage routes - though only in the hours from 0930 to 1800 and only on the central part of two routes , the 9 -lrb- albert hall to aldwych -rrb- and 15 -lrb- tower of london to trafalgar square -rrb- .
so if you want to get a bus along piccadilly or knightsbridge , what comes along may well be a routemaster - painted in its original livery inside and out .
still rolling along in the age of the bendy-bus and the oystercard .
enthusiasts transport for london calls the 50-year-old model " a design icon synonymous with london " and invites passengers to " take a trip on a london landmark " by using the heritage routes .
meanwhile , enthusiasts spend thousands of pounds to own one and drive them across britain to attend rallies . "
although we 're improving the bus network by introducing new , more accessible buses , routemasters will not be disappearing completely " transport for london still waiting for the bus they hail them as the climax of a series of buses designed in london , for london .
supporters point to their lightness , their new environmentally-friendly engines and their fuel economy compared with later , heavier double-deckers .
but wheelchair users can not get on them - and some people dislike them a lot .
transport consultant andrew braddock says routemasters are " quirky - as is almost anything built to a design effectively laid out in 1912 and around for nearly three times its expected life " .
" we 've stated to transport for london that we 're not happy about the heritage routes , " says disability rights commission spokesman patrick edwards .
he stresses that in 2017 it will be illegal to have public transport that is inaccessible and " tfl are opening themselves to legal action " .
tfl points out that the heritage route buses are in addition to the normal schedules on the 9 and 15 , and disabled people can access low floor , wheelchair-accessible buses on both routes .
mr edwards is not impressed with the argument that many disabled , elderly and frail people may have preferred routemasters because they had conductors .
that is suggesting that disabled people can only get around london " with the goodwill and behest of a helping hand " , he believes .
andrew braddock , formerly head of access and mobility at transport for london , accepts that " the total number of wheelchair users is inevitably small ... but the number of trips being made by this previously ignored group is growing all the time " .
transport for london says it encourages disabled people to use public transport and its bus fleet is wheelchair accessible - if you do n't count the 16 routemasters on the heritage routes - but , says mr braddock , " disabled people need to gain confidence that all the links in the chain will work when they make any journey . "
what of the future ?
andrew morgan , chairman of the routemaster association , regrets the abrupt way in which routemaster services in london were terminated .
" the original idea in 2001 was absolutely right in my opinion , " he said .
mayor ken livingstone had promised to retain the routemaster and increase the number of bus conductors .
ultimate " that would have given him breathing space to design a suitable replacement , not buy the next available thing out of the factory .
now we have things off the shelf and german bendy-buses , and the travel experience has not improved .
it 's gone backwards , " says mr morgan .

the last bus ?
key facts routemasters first entered service in 1956 in total , 2,876 were built some 1,300 still exist london transport said they would be phased out by 1978 they were last used on a regular route in 2005 the bus in summer holiday was not a routemaster it was an rt - the previous model a worthy successor would have the same merit of lightness , built in aluminium with no chassis , and would have a conductor - as well as having a low floor for accessibility .
would it have an open platform for jumping on and off ?
" where appropriate , " says andrew morgan .
doors could be included and closed on some sections of the route , but left open elsewhere .
for the routemasters , apart from rallies and private functions , only the heritage routes now remain .
tfl says it is pleased with the level of interest in the heritage routes and no changes or extensions to them are being considered at present .
andrew morgan thinks they are " moderately successful " .

andrew braddock feels the buses ' limited role on the heritage routes makes sense , but adds : " whether american and japanese tourists really perceive a routemaster to be something different from the other 6,000 or so red double-deckers i frankly doubt . "
your memories of travelling on a routemaster : have no idea what a ' bendy-bus 'looks like as i have been in the usa for over 30 years , but i have wonderful memories of travelling on the old double-deckers to school and to my auntie 's house and all over london .
have a memory of being rather drunk coming home from a party and the conductor laying me out on the long seats so i could have a rest !
my uncle george was a conductor some 50 years ago .
we delighted in seeing him as the bus came closer .. he used the old tickets which he punched .
my sister and i used to jump from bus to bus in the west end on the way to work each day - quicker than being trampled on the tube !
the sight of st. paul 's always made me shudder in the early morning sunlight from the upper deck .
carole ricker , bluffton , usa the routemasters were great , i use to catch the 137 from oxford st to clapham common .
i always liked the wheel arch bench seats next to the platform , sometimes you would get a character conductor to keep you amused on your journey or if he did n't object you could stand on the platform and watch the london streets pass by .
hopping off before your stop to beat the traffic always made you smile .
the new bendy buses are so soulless , usually stuck in traffic just yards from a stop but with no escape possible .
travelling in london now is so boring and slower to boot !
tarquin cole , london , uk there are few things that so clearly symbolize london in the second half of the 1900s as the routemaster , and i fully support their being kept on the heritage routes for many years to come .
and if there is a legal issue with regard to wheelchair access , then simply take them off-route and make them a straight tourist attraction .
but do please keep them on the road - they have been a part of the making of london !
bruce , geneva , switzerland what a load of nonsense !
the very fact that the heritage buses are additional buses on routes already catered for by accessible buses should kill the issue .
i suppose we should also close the whispering gallery in st. paul 's to all visitors over accessibility .
after all , that would be ' fair ' .
as for it becoming illegal , what a joke .
london has new , accessible buses coming out of its ears !
what 's wrong with just a handful of the old ones .
in any case , i do n't think i 'd bother to use the heritage routes specially , but i like to see the buses around , and if there 's no one on them that simply wo n't happen .
the majority of people like them .
is this a democracy ?
jonathan h , kiev , ukraine i think the new buses across london are a disgrace .
if you sit downstairs near the back , it is so cramped. the windows barley let in hardly any air and during the summer months its so hot and stuffy. many people who can not find a seat downstairs often stand as the number of seats are limited compared to the route masters .
i 'm really dissapointed with ken for allowing the replacement of the route master to take its place .
fatima , the length of bendy buses make them a major hazard to anyone riding a bike or trying to cross the road .
what 's more , tfl seem to be finding that people simply do n't bother paying to ride these buses .
clearly , no more of these buses should be ordered .
will , london the non-disabled have rights too .
modern buses are a nightmare for the able-bodied , and particularly the elderly or temporarily infirm .
the lower decks of double deckers have virtually no seats , and no room to " move down the bus " , and getting to and from the upper deck is a white knuckle ride of jerking about and swaying -lrb- ok , some of that is bad driving -rrb- .
bendy buses are not much better , some of the seats are almost inaccessible to anybody who is n't 100 % fit .
i 'm not saying the routemaster was perfect , but it was a damned sight better than any of the replacements - long may they continue to grace our str ! eets !
paul , london i hope that the tfl continues to run these old buses on the special routes they should offer regular modern buses as well but the tourist love this kind of thing .
i know we do and enjoy riding on steam trains on our visits to the uk > barebear2 @ bellsouth.net , winter springs , florida usa it is right that these busses should remain on the heritage routes .
lrt should be allowed to dictate the design of a worthy successor that is suitable for london , not the boring , impractical , heavy and fuel-hungry and time-wasting current models .
we should be allowed to hop on and off where appropriate !
tom hopes , london , england its a few buses mostly operating as a novelty tourist attraction .
99.9 % of london buses are wheelchair accessible .
why spoil the fun for a few tourists ?
david s , london i doubt if patrick edwards of the disability right commission uses buses very often .
i do and i 've never seen a wheelchair user on the new buses in central london .
what i have seen is people frustrated at having to wait until the bus inches towards a bus stop before they can alight , instead of being able to get off in heavy traffic or at trafic lights .
how many people have had the doors closed in their faces and then watched as the bus only moves a few feet before waiting in a queue of traffic and not been able to jump on .
mike , london i love the routemasters !
not only are they a classic design but they are perfect in london because if the bus gets stuck in traffic , you can get off and walk rather than wait til the next stop .
having to wait til the next stop in traffic made me 20 minutes late this morning as the driver refused to open the doors - and i wanted to get off at the next stop which was about 100m down the road !
allie keith , united kingdom i lived in london in the bad old days of the routemaster , and loved them .
it was great to be able to run after them and hop on the back rather than having to wait for them to stop at a bus stop , and hop off again when close to your destination .
conductors served far more of a function than simply collecting tickets ¿ they helped people on and off , they acted as tourist information , and when i talk to people who have traveled to london on holiday some of their fondest memories are of the buses and how helpful the conductors were .
however , i would fully agree that they are unsuitable for the 21st century in terms of disabled access .
i used to work for an independent living scheme , being the ¿ arms and legs ¿ for a gentleman in a wheelchair , and got an idea of just how poorly served the wheelchair user is in london .

by trevor timpson bbc news more than 50 years since they appeared on london 's streets , the routemasters are still running - but not everyone is delighted .
routemasters are still rolling on in the age of the oystercard the veteran vehicle with its curvy design and its open platform has been called " the last bus to be a proper bus " .
many londoners remember fondly how they used to hop on and off them and pull the string to ring the bell .
but a disability rights commission spokesman says it is " a bashed-up old relic from a bygone age " and the fact that it is still running on two central london heritage routes is " a disappointment " .
a programme of repurchase and refurbishment - begun after the election of mayor ken livingstone in 2000 - stopped in 2003-4 , and the last full-scale route - the 159 - withdrew its routemasters in december 2005 .
what remained was the heritage routes - though only in the hours from 0930 to 1800 and only on the central part of two routes , the 9 -lrb- albert hall to aldwych -rrb- and 15 -lrb- tower of london to trafalgar square -rrb- .
so if you want to get a bus along piccadilly or knightsbridge , what comes along may well be a routemaster - painted in its original livery inside and out .
still rolling along in the age of the bendy-bus and the oystercard .
enthusiasts transport for london calls the 50-year-old model " a design icon synonymous with london " and invites passengers to " take a trip on a london landmark " by using the heritage routes .
meanwhile , enthusiasts spend thousands of pounds to own one and drive them across britain to attend rallies .
although we 're improving the bus network by introducing new , more accessible buses , routemasters will not be disappearing completely transport for london still waiting for the bus they hail them as the climax of a series of buses designed in london , for london .
supporters point to their lightness , their new environmentally-friendly engines and their fuel economy compared with later , heavier double-deckers .
but wheelchair users can not get on them - and some people dislike them a lot .
transport consultant andrew braddock says routemasters are " quirky - as is almost anything built to a design effectively laid out in 1912 and around for nearly three times its expected life " .
" we 've stated to transport for london that we 're not happy about the heritage routes , " says disability rights commission spokesman patrick edwards .
he stresses that in 2017 it will be illegal to have public transport that is inaccessible and " tfl are opening themselves to legal action " .
routemaster platforms are fun for some , impossible for others tfl points out that the heritage route buses are in addition to the normal schedules on the 9 and 15 , and disabled people can access low floor , wheelchair-accessible buses on both routes .
mr edwards is not impressed with the argument that many disabled , elderly and frail people may have preferred routemasters because they had conductors .
that is suggesting that disabled people can only get around london " with the goodwill and behest of a helping hand " , he believes .
andrew braddock , formerly head of access and mobility at transport for london , accepts that " the total number of wheelchair users is inevitably small ... but the number of trips being made by this previously ignored group is growing all the time " .
transport for london says it encourages disabled people to use public transport and its bus fleet is wheelchair accessible - if you do n't count the 16 routemasters on the heritage routes - but , says mr braddock , " disabled people need to gain confidence that all the links in the chain will work when they make any journey . "
what of the future ?
andrew morgan , chairman of the routemaster association , regrets the abrupt way in which routemaster services in london were terminated .
" the original idea in 2001 was absolutely right in my opinion , " he said .
mayor ken livingstone had promised to retain the routemaster and increase the number of bus conductors .
ultimate " that would have given him breathing space to design a suitable replacement , not buy the next available thing out of the factory .
now we have things off the shelf and german bendy-buses , and the travel experience has not improved .
it 's gone backwards , " says mr morgan .

by trevor timpson bbc news more than 50 years since they appeared on london 's streets , the routemasters are still running - but not everyone is delighted .
routemasters are still rolling on in the age of the oystercard the veteran vehicle with its curvy design and its open platform has been called " the last bus to be a proper bus " .
many londoners remember fondly how they used to hop on and off them and pull the string to ring the bell .
but a disability rights commission spokesman says it is " a bashed-up old relic from a bygone age " and the fact that it is still running on two central london heritage routes is " a disappointment " .
a programme of repurchase and refurbishment - begun after the election of mayor ken livingstone in 2000 - stopped in 2003-4 , and the last full-scale route - the 159 - withdrew its routemasters in december 2005 .
what remained was the heritage routes - though only in the hours from 0930 to 1800 and only on the central part of two routes , the 9 -lrb- albert hall to aldwych -rrb- and 15 -lrb- tower of london to trafalgar square -rrb- .
so if you want to get a bus along piccadilly or knightsbridge , what comes along may well be a routemaster - painted in its original livery inside and out .
still rolling along in the age of the bendy-bus and the oystercard .
enthusiasts transport for london calls the 50-year-old model " a design icon synonymous with london " and invites passengers to " take a trip on a london landmark " by using the heritage routes .
meanwhile , enthusiasts spend thousands of pounds to own one and drive them across britain to attend rallies .
although we 're improving the bus network by introducing new , more accessible buses , routemasters will not be disappearing completely transport for london still waiting for the bus they hail them as the climax of a series of buses designed in london , for london .
supporters point to their lightness , their new environmentally-friendly engines and their fuel economy compared with later , heavier double-deckers .
but wheelchair users can not get on them - and some people dislike them a lot .
transport consultant andrew braddock says routemasters are " quirky - as is almost anything built to a design effectively laid out in 1912 and around for nearly three times its expected life " .
" we 've stated to transport for london that we 're not happy about the heritage routes , " says disability rights commission spokesman patrick edwards .
he stresses that in 2017 it will be illegal to have public transport that is inaccessible and " tfl are opening themselves to legal action " .
routemaster platforms are fun for some , impossible for others tfl points out that the heritage route buses are in addition to the normal schedules on the 9 and 15 , and disabled people can access low floor , wheelchair-accessible buses on both routes .
mr edwards is not impressed with the argument that many disabled , elderly and frail people may have preferred routemasters because they had conductors .
that is suggesting that disabled people can only get around london " with the goodwill and behest of a helping hand " , he believes .
andrew braddock , formerly head of access and mobility at transport for london , accepts that " the total number of wheelchair users is inevitably small ... but the number of trips being made by this previously ignored group is growing all the time " .
transport for london says it encourages disabled people to use public transport and its bus fleet is wheelchair accessible - if you do n't count the 16 routemasters on the heritage routes - but , says mr braddock , " disabled people need to gain confidence that all the links in the chain will work when they make any journey . "
what of the future ?
andrew morgan , chairman of the routemaster association , regrets the abrupt way in which routemaster services in london were terminated .
" the original idea in 2001 was absolutely right in my opinion , " he said .
mayor ken livingstone had promised to retain the routemaster and increase the number of bus conductors .
ultimate " that would have given him breathing space to design a suitable replacement , not buy the next available thing out of the factory .
now we have things off the shelf and german bendy-buses , and the travel experience has not improved .
it 's gone backwards , " says mr morgan .
he claims the routemaster was " the ultimate design .. so well built , so well engineered that it kept going for more 50 years , and at the beginning of the 21st century it was re-engineered again up to modern standards . "
the last bus ?
key facts routemasters first entered service in 1956 in total , 2,876 were built some 1,300 still exist london transport said they would be phased out by 1978 they were last used on a regular route in 2005 the bus in summer holiday was not a routemaster it was an rt - the previous model a worthy successor would have the same merit of lightness , built in aluminium with no chassis , and would have a conductor - as well as having a low floor for accessibility .
would it have an open platform for jumping on and off ?
" where appropriate , " says andrew morgan .
doors could be included and closed on some sections of the route , but left open elsewhere .
for the routemasters , apart from rallies and private functions , only the heritage routes now remain .
tfl says it is pleased with the level of interest in the heritage routes and no changes or extensions to them are being considered at present .
andrew morgan thinks they are " moderately successful " .
he believes disability campaigners ' attitude to them may be " sour grapes , because they did n't quite win the battle " .
andrew braddock feels the buses ' limited role on the heritage routes makes sense , but adds : " whether american and japanese tourists really perceive a routemaster to be something different from the other 6,000 or so red double-deckers i frankly doubt . "
your memories of travelling on a routemaster : have no idea what a ' bendy-bus 'looks like as i have been in the usa for over 30 years , but i have wonderful memories of travelling on the old double-deckers to school and to my auntie 's house and all over london .
have a memory of being rather drunk coming home from a party and the conductor laying me out on the long seats so i could have a rest !
my uncle george was a conductor some 50 years ago .
we delighted in seeing him as the bus came closer .. he used the old tickets which he punched .
my sister and i used to jump from bus to bus in the west end on the way to work each day - quicker than being trampled on the tube !
the sight of st. paul 's always made me shudder in the early morning sunlight from the upper deck .
carole ricker , bluffton , usa the routemasters were great , i use to catch the 137 from oxford st to clapham common .
i always liked the wheel arch bench seats next to the platform , sometimes you would get a character conductor to keep you amused on your journey or if he did n't object you could stand on the platform and watch the london streets pass by .
hopping off before your stop to beat the traffic always made you smile .
the new bendy buses are so soulless , usually stuck in traffic just yards from a stop but with no escape possible .
travelling in london now is so boring and slower to boot !
tarquin cole , london , uk there are few things that so clearly symbolize london in the second half of the 1900s as the routemaster , and i fully support their being kept on the heritage routes for many years to come .
and if there is a legal issue with regard to wheelchair access , then simply take them off-route and make them a straight tourist attraction .
but do please keep them on the road - they have been a part of the making of london !
bruce , geneva , switzerland what a load of nonsense !
the very fact that the heritage buses are additional buses on routes already catered for by accessible buses should kill the issue .
i suppose we should also close the whispering gallery in st. paul 's to all visitors over accessibility .
after all , that would be ' fair ' .
as for it becoming illegal , what a joke .
london has new , accessible buses coming out of its ears !
what 's wrong with just a handful of the old ones .
in any case , i do n't think i 'd bother to use the heritage routes specially , but i like to see the buses around , and if there 's no one on them that simply wo n't happen .
the majority of people like them .
is this a democracy ?

by trevor timpson bbc news more than 50 years since they appeared on london 's streets , the routemasters are still running - but not everyone is delighted .
routemasters are still rolling on in the age of the oystercard the veteran vehicle with its curvy design and its open platform has been called " the last bus to be a proper bus " .
many londoners remember fondly how they used to hop on and off them and pull the string to ring the bell .
but a disability rights commission spokesman says it is " a bashed-up old relic from a bygone age " and the fact that it is still running on two central london heritage routes is " a disappointment " .
a programme of repurchase and refurbishment - begun after the election of mayor ken livingstone in 2000 - stopped in 2003-4 , and the last full-scale route - the 159 - withdrew its routemasters in december 2005 .
what remained was the heritage routes - though only in the hours from 0930 to 1800 and only on the central part of two routes , the 9 -lrb- albert hall to aldwych -rrb- and 15 -lrb- tower of london to trafalgar square -rrb- .
so if you want to get a bus along piccadilly or knightsbridge , what comes along may well be a routemaster - painted in its original livery inside and out .
still rolling along in the age of the bendy-bus and the oystercard .
enthusiasts transport for london calls the 50-year-old model " a design icon synonymous with london " and invites passengers to " take a trip on a london landmark " by using the heritage routes .
meanwhile , enthusiasts spend thousands of pounds to own one and drive them across britain to attend rallies .
although we 're improving the bus network by introducing new , more accessible buses , routemasters will not be disappearing completely transport for london still waiting for the bus they hail them as the climax of a series of buses designed in london , for london .
supporters point to their lightness , their new environmentally-friendly engines and their fuel economy compared with later , heavier double-deckers .
but wheelchair users can not get on them - and some people dislike them a lot .
transport consultant andrew braddock says routemasters are " quirky - as is almost anything built to a design effectively laid out in 1912 and around for nearly three times its expected life " .
" we 've stated to transport for london that we 're not happy about the heritage routes , " says disability rights commission spokesman patrick edwards .
he stresses that in 2017 it will be illegal to have public transport that is inaccessible and " tfl are opening themselves to legal action " .
routemaster platforms are fun for some , impossible for others tfl points out that the heritage route buses are in addition to the normal schedules on the 9 and 15 , and disabled people can access low floor , wheelchair-accessible buses on both routes .
mr edwards is not impressed with the argument that many disabled , elderly and frail people may have preferred routemasters because they had conductors .
that is suggesting that disabled people can only get around london " with the goodwill and behest of a helping hand " , he believes .
andrew braddock , formerly head of access and mobility at transport for london , accepts that " the total number of wheelchair users is inevitably small ... but the number of trips being made by this previously ignored group is growing all the time " .
transport for london says it encourages disabled people to use public transport and its bus fleet is wheelchair accessible - if you do n't count the 16 routemasters on the heritage routes - but , says mr braddock , " disabled people need to gain confidence that all the links in the chain will work when they make any journey . "
what of the future ?
andrew morgan , chairman of the routemaster association , regrets the abrupt way in which routemaster services in london were terminated .
" the original idea in 2001 was absolutely right in my opinion , " he said .
mayor ken livingstone had promised to retain the routemaster and increase the number of bus conductors .
ultimate " that would have given him breathing space to design a suitable replacement , not buy the next available thing out of the factory .
now we have things off the shelf and german bendy-buses , and the travel experience has not improved .
it 's gone backwards , " says mr morgan .
he claims the routemaster was " the ultimate design .. so well built , so well engineered that it kept going for more 50 years , and at the beginning of the 21st century it was re-engineered again up to modern standards . "
the last bus ?
key facts routemasters first entered service in 1956 in total , 2,876 were built some 1,300 still exist london transport said they would be phased out by 1978 they were last used on a regular route in 2005 the bus in summer holiday was not a routemaster it was an rt - the previous model a worthy successor would have the same merit of lightness , built in aluminium with no chassis , and would have a conductor - as well as having a low floor for accessibility .
would it have an open platform for jumping on and off ?
" where appropriate , " says andrew morgan .
doors could be included and closed on some sections of the route , but left open elsewhere .
for the routemasters , apart from rallies and private functions , only the heritage routes now remain .
tfl says it is pleased with the level of interest in the heritage routes and no changes or extensions to them are being considered at present .
andrew morgan thinks they are " moderately successful " .
he believes disability campaigners ' attitude to them may be " sour grapes , because they did n't quite win the battle " .
andrew braddock feels the buses ' limited role on the heritage routes makes sense , but adds : " whether american and japanese tourists really perceive a routemaster to be something different from the other 6,000 or so red double-deckers i frankly doubt . "
your memories of travelling on a routemaster : have no idea what a ' bendy-bus 'looks like as i have been in the usa for over 30 years , but i have wonderful memories of travelling on the old double-deckers to school and to my auntie 's house and all over london .
have a memory of being rather drunk coming home from a party and the conductor laying me out on the long seats so i could have a rest !
my uncle george was a conductor some 50 years ago .
we delighted in seeing him as the bus came closer .. he used the old tickets which he punched .
my sister and i used to jump from bus to bus in the west end on the way to work each day - quicker than being trampled on the tube !
the sight of st. paul 's always made me shudder in the early morning sunlight from the upper deck .
carole ricker , bluffton , usa the routemasters were great , i use to catch the 137 from oxford st to clapham common .
i always liked the wheel arch bench seats next to the platform , sometimes you would get a character conductor to keep you amused on your journey or if he did n't object you could stand on the platform and watch the london streets pass by .
hopping off before your stop to beat the traffic always made you smile .
the new bendy buses are so soulless , usually stuck in traffic just yards from a stop but with no escape possible .
travelling in london now is so boring and slower to boot !
tarquin cole , london , uk there are few things that so clearly symbolize london in the second half of the 1900s as the routemaster , and i fully support their being kept on the heritage routes for many years to come .
and if there is a legal issue with regard to wheelchair access , then simply take them off-route and make them a straight tourist attraction .
but do please keep them on the road - they have been a part of the making of london !
bruce , geneva , switzerland what a load of nonsense !
the very fact that the heritage buses are additional buses on routes already catered for by accessible buses should kill the issue .
i suppose we should also close the whispering gallery in st. paul 's to all visitors over accessibility .
after all , that would be ' fair ' .
as for it becoming illegal , what a joke .
london has new , accessible buses coming out of its ears !
what 's wrong with just a handful of the old ones .
in any case , i do n't think i 'd bother to use the heritage routes specially , but i like to see the buses around , and if there 's no one on them that simply wo n't happen .
the majority of people like them .
is this a democracy ?
jonathan h , kiev , ukraine i think the new buses across london are a disgrace .
if you sit downstairs near the back , it is so cramped. the windows barley let in hardly any air and during the summer months its so hot and stuffy. many people who can not find a seat downstairs often stand as the number of seats are limited compared to the route masters .
i 'm really dissapointed with ken for allowing the replacement of the route master to take its place .
fatima , the length of bendy buses make them a major hazard to anyone riding a bike or trying to cross the road .
what 's more , tfl seem to be finding that people simply do n't bother paying to ride these buses .
clearly , no more of these buses should be ordered .
will , london the non-disabled have rights too .
modern buses are a nightmare for the able-bodied , and particularly the elderly or temporarily infirm .
the lower decks of double deckers have virtually no seats , and no room to " move down the bus " , and getting to and from the upper deck is a white knuckle ride of jerking about and swaying -lrb- ok , some of that is bad driving -rrb- .
bendy buses are not much better , some of the seats are almost inaccessible to anybody who is n't 100 % fit .
i 'm not saying the routemaster was perfect , but it was a damned sight better than any of the replacements - long may they continue to grace our str ! eets !
paul , london i hope that the tfl continues to run these old buses on the special routes they should offer regular modern buses as well but the tourist love this kind of thing .
i know we do and enjoy riding on steam trains on our visits to the uk > barebear2 @ bellsouth.net , winter springs , florida usa it is right that these busses should remain on the heritage routes .
lrt should be allowed to dictate the design of a worthy successor that is suitable for london , not the boring , impractical , heavy and fuel-hungry and time-wasting current models .
we should be allowed to hop on and off where appropriate !
tom hopes , london , england its a few buses mostly operating as a novelty tourist attraction .
99.9 % of london buses are wheelchair accessible .
why spoil the fun for a few tourists ?
david s , london i doubt if patrick edwards of the disability right commission uses buses very often .
i do and i 've never seen a wheelchair user on the new buses in central london .
what i have seen is people frustrated at having to wait until the bus inches towards a bus stop before they can alight , instead of being able to get off in heavy traffic or at trafic lights .
how many people have had the doors closed in their faces and then watched as the bus only moves a few feet before waiting in a queue of traffic and not been able to jump on .
mike , london i love the routemasters !
not only are they a classic design but they are perfect in london because if the bus gets stuck in traffic , you can get off and walk rather than wait til the next stop .

by trevor timpson bbc news more than 50 years since they appeared on london 's streets , the routemasters are still running - but not everyone is delighted .
routemasters are still rolling on in the age of the oystercard the veteran vehicle with its curvy design and its open platform has been called " the last bus to be a proper bus " .
many londoners remember fondly how they used to hop on and off them and pull the string to ring the bell .
but a disability rights commission spokesman says it is " a bashed-up old relic from a bygone age " and the fact that it is still running on two central london heritage routes is " a disappointment " .
a programme of repurchase and refurbishment - begun after the election of mayor ken livingstone in 2000 - stopped in 2003-4 , and the last full-scale route - the 159 - withdrew its routemasters in december 2005 .
what remained was the heritage routes - though only in the hours from 0930 to 1800 and only on the central part of two routes , the 9 -lrb- albert hall to aldwych -rrb- and 15 -lrb- tower of london to trafalgar square -rrb- .
so if you want to get a bus along piccadilly or knightsbridge , what comes along may well be a routemaster - painted in its original livery inside and out .
still rolling along in the age of the bendy-bus and the oystercard .
enthusiasts transport for london calls the 50-year-old model " a design icon synonymous with london " and invites passengers to " take a trip on a london landmark " by using the heritage routes .
meanwhile , enthusiasts spend thousands of pounds to own one and drive them across britain to attend rallies .
although we 're improving the bus network by introducing new , more accessible buses , routemasters will not be disappearing completely transport for london still waiting for the bus they hail them as the climax of a series of buses designed in london , for london .
supporters point to their lightness , their new environmentally-friendly engines and their fuel economy compared with later , heavier double-deckers .
but wheelchair users can not get on them - and some people dislike them a lot .
transport consultant andrew braddock says routemasters are " quirky - as is almost anything built to a design effectively laid out in 1912 and around for nearly three times its expected life " .
" we 've stated to transport for london that we 're not happy about the heritage routes , " says disability rights commission spokesman patrick edwards .
he stresses that in 2017 it will be illegal to have public transport that is inaccessible and " tfl are opening themselves to legal action " .
routemaster platforms are fun for some , impossible for others tfl points out that the heritage route buses are in addition to the normal schedules on the 9 and 15 , and disabled people can access low floor , wheelchair-accessible buses on both routes .
mr edwards is not impressed with the argument that many disabled , elderly and frail people may have preferred routemasters because they had conductors .
that is suggesting that disabled people can only get around london " with the goodwill and behest of a helping hand " , he believes .
andrew braddock , formerly head of access and mobility at transport for london , accepts that " the total number of wheelchair users is inevitably small ... but the number of trips being made by this previously ignored group is growing all the time " .
transport for london says it encourages disabled people to use public transport and its bus fleet is wheelchair accessible - if you do n't count the 16 routemasters on the heritage routes - but , says mr braddock , " disabled people need to gain confidence that all the links in the chain will work when they make any journey . "
what of the future ?
andrew morgan , chairman of the routemaster association , regrets the abrupt way in which routemaster services in london were terminated .
" the original idea in 2001 was absolutely right in my opinion , " he said .
mayor ken livingstone had promised to retain the routemaster and increase the number of bus conductors .
ultimate " that would have given him breathing space to design a suitable replacement , not buy the next available thing out of the factory .
now we have things off the shelf and german bendy-buses , and the travel experience has not improved .
it 's gone backwards , " says mr morgan .
he claims the routemaster was " the ultimate design .. so well built , so well engineered that it kept going for more 50 years , and at the beginning of the 21st century it was re-engineered again up to modern standards . "
the last bus ?
key facts routemasters first entered service in 1956 in total , 2,876 were built some 1,300 still exist london transport said they would be phased out by 1978 they were last used on a regular route in 2005 the bus in summer holiday was not a routemaster it was an rt - the previous model a worthy successor would have the same merit of lightness , built in aluminium with no chassis , and would have a conductor - as well as having a low floor for accessibility .
would it have an open platform for jumping on and off ?
" where appropriate , " says andrew morgan .
doors could be included and closed on some sections of the route , but left open elsewhere .
for the routemasters , apart from rallies and private functions , only the heritage routes now remain .
tfl says it is pleased with the level of interest in the heritage routes and no changes or extensions to them are being considered at present .
andrew morgan thinks they are " moderately successful " .
he believes disability campaigners ' attitude to them may be " sour grapes , because they did n't quite win the battle " .
andrew braddock feels the buses ' limited role on the heritage routes makes sense , but adds : " whether american and japanese tourists really perceive a routemaster to be something different from the other 6,000 or so red double-deckers i frankly doubt . "
your memories of travelling on a routemaster : have no idea what a ' bendy-bus 'looks like as i have been in the usa for over 30 years , but i have wonderful memories of travelling on the old double-deckers to school and to my auntie 's house and all over london .
have a memory of being rather drunk coming home from a party and the conductor laying me out on the long seats so i could have a rest !
my uncle george was a conductor some 50 years ago .
we delighted in seeing him as the bus came closer .. he used the old tickets which he punched .
my sister and i used to jump from bus to bus in the west end on the way to work each day - quicker than being trampled on the tube !
the sight of st. paul 's always made me shudder in the early morning sunlight from the upper deck .
carole ricker , bluffton , usa the routemasters were great , i use to catch the 137 from oxford st to clapham common .
i always liked the wheel arch bench seats next to the platform , sometimes you would get a character conductor to keep you amused on your journey or if he did n't object you could stand on the platform and watch the london streets pass by .
hopping off before your stop to beat the traffic always made you smile .
the new bendy buses are so soulless , usually stuck in traffic just yards from a stop but with no escape possible .
travelling in london now is so boring and slower to boot !
tarquin cole , london , uk there are few things that so clearly symbolize london in the second half of the 1900s as the routemaster , and i fully support their being kept on the heritage routes for many years to come .
and if there is a legal issue with regard to wheelchair access , then simply take them off-route and make them a straight tourist attraction .
but do please keep them on the road - they have been a part of the making of london !
bruce , geneva , switzerland what a load of nonsense !
the very fact that the heritage buses are additional buses on routes already catered for by accessible buses should kill the issue .
i suppose we should also close the whispering gallery in st. paul 's to all visitors over accessibility .
after all , that would be ' fair ' .
as for it becoming illegal , what a joke .
london has new , accessible buses coming out of its ears !
what 's wrong with just a handful of the old ones .
in any case , i do n't think i 'd bother to use the heritage routes specially , but i like to see the buses around , and if there 's no one on them that simply wo n't happen .
the majority of people like them .
is this a democracy ?
jonathan h , kiev , ukraine i think the new buses across london are a disgrace .
if you sit downstairs near the back , it is so cramped. the windows barley let in hardly any air and during the summer months its so hot and stuffy. many people who can not find a seat downstairs often stand as the number of seats are limited compared to the route masters .
i 'm really dissapointed with ken for allowing the replacement of the route master to take its place .
fatima , the length of bendy buses make them a major hazard to anyone riding a bike or trying to cross the road .
what 's more , tfl seem to be finding that people simply do n't bother paying to ride these buses .
clearly , no more of these buses should be ordered .
will , london the non-disabled have rights too .
modern buses are a nightmare for the able-bodied , and particularly the elderly or temporarily infirm .
the lower decks of double deckers have virtually no seats , and no room to " move down the bus " , and getting to and from the upper deck is a white knuckle ride of jerking about and swaying -lrb- ok , some of that is bad driving -rrb- .
bendy buses are not much better , some of the seats are almost inaccessible to anybody who is n't 100 % fit .
i 'm not saying the routemaster was perfect , but it was a damned sight better than any of the replacements - long may they continue to grace our str ! eets !
paul , london i hope that the tfl continues to run these old buses on the special routes they should offer regular modern buses as well but the tourist love this kind of thing .
i know we do and enjoy riding on steam trains on our visits to the uk > barebear2 @ bellsouth.net , winter springs , florida usa it is right that these busses should remain on the heritage routes .
lrt should be allowed to dictate the design of a worthy successor that is suitable for london , not the boring , impractical , heavy and fuel-hungry and time-wasting current models .
we should be allowed to hop on and off where appropriate !
tom hopes , london , england its a few buses mostly operating as a novelty tourist attraction .
99.9 % of london buses are wheelchair accessible .
why spoil the fun for a few tourists ?
david s , london i doubt if patrick edwards of the disability right commission uses buses very often .
i do and i 've never seen a wheelchair user on the new buses in central london .
what i have seen is people frustrated at having to wait until the bus inches towards a bus stop before they can alight , instead of being able to get off in heavy traffic or at trafic lights .
how many people have had the doors closed in their faces and then watched as the bus only moves a few feet before waiting in a queue of traffic and not been able to jump on .
mike , london i love the routemasters !
not only are they a classic design but they are perfect in london because if the bus gets stuck in traffic , you can get off and walk rather than wait til the next stop .
having to wait til the next stop in traffic made me 20 minutes late this morning as the driver refused to open the doors - and i wanted to get off at the next stop which was about 100m down the road !
allie keith , united kingdom i lived in london in the bad old days of the routemaster , and loved them .
it was great to be able to run after them and hop on the back rather than having to wait for them to stop at a bus stop , and hop off again when close to your destination .
conductors served far more of a function than simply collecting tickets ¿ they helped people on and off , they acted as tourist information , and when i talk to people who have traveled to london on holiday some of their fondest memories are of the buses and how helpful the conductors were .
however , i would fully agree that they are unsuitable for the 21st century in terms of disabled access .
i used to work for an independent living scheme , being the ¿ arms and legs ¿ for a gentleman in a wheelchair , and got an idea of just how poorly served the wheelchair user is in london .

by trevor timpson bbc news more than 50 years since they appeared on london 's streets , the routemasters are still running - but not everyone is delighted .
routemasters are still rolling on in the age of the oystercard the veteran vehicle with its curvy design and its open platform has been called " the last bus to be a proper bus " .
many londoners remember fondly how they used to hop on and off them and pull the string to ring the bell .
but a disability rights commission spokesman says it is " a bashed-up old relic from a bygone age " and the fact that it is still running on two central london heritage routes is " a disappointment " .
a programme of repurchase and refurbishment - begun after the election of mayor ken livingstone in 2000 - stopped in 2003-4 , and the last full-scale route - the 159 - withdrew its routemasters in december 2005 .
what remained was the heritage routes - though only in the hours from 0930 to 1800 and only on the central part of two routes , the 9 -lrb- albert hall to aldwych -rrb- and 15 -lrb- tower of london to trafalgar square -rrb- .

"
what of the future ?
andrew morgan , chairman of the routemaster association , regrets the abrupt way in which routemaster services in london were terminated .
" the original idea in 2001 was absolutely right in my opinion , " he said .
mayor ken livingstone had promised to retain the routemaster and increase the number of bus conductors .
ultimate " that would have given him breathing space to design a suitable replacement , not buy the next available thing out of the factory .
now we have things off the shelf and german bendy-buses , and the travel experience has not improved .
it 's gone backwards , " says mr morgan .
he claims the routemaster was " the ultimate design .. so well built , so well engineered that it kept going for more 50 years , and at the beginning of the 21st century it was re-engineered again up to modern standards . "
the last bus ?
key facts routemasters first entered service in 1956 in total , 2,876 were built some 1,300 still exist london transport said they would be phased out by 1978 they were last used on a regular route in 2005 the bus in summer holiday was not a routemaster it was an rt - the previous model a worthy successor would have the same merit of lightness , built in aluminium with no chassis , and would have a conductor - as well as having a low floor for accessibility .
would it have an open platform for jumping on and off ?
" where appropriate , " says andrew morgan .
doors could be included and closed on some sections of the route , but left open elsewhere .
for the routemasters , apart from rallies and private functions , only the heritage routes now remain .
tfl says it is pleased with the level of interest in the heritage routes and no changes or extensions to them are being considered at present .
andrew morgan thinks they are " moderately successful " .
he believes disability campaigners ' attitude to them may be " sour grapes , because they did n't quite win the battle " .
andrew braddock feels the buses ' limited role on the heritage routes makes sense , but adds : " whether american and japanese tourists really perceive a routemaster to be something different from the other 6,000 or so red double-deckers i frankly doubt . "
your memories of travelling on a routemaster : have no idea what a ' bendy-bus 'looks like as i have been in the usa for over 30 years , but i have wonderful memories of travelling on the old double-deckers to school and to my auntie 's house and all over london .
have a memory of being rather drunk coming home from a party and the conductor laying me out on the long seats so i could have a rest !
my uncle george was a conductor some 50 years ago .
we delighted in seeing him as the bus came closer .. he used the old tickets which he punched .
my sister and i used to jump from bus to bus in the west end on the way to work each day - quicker than being trampled on the tube !
the sight of st. paul 's always made me shudder in the early morning sunlight from the upper deck .
carole ricker , bluffton , usa the routemasters were great , i use to catch the 137 from oxford st to clapham common .
i always liked the wheel arch bench seats next to the platform , sometimes you would get a character conductor to keep you amused on your journey or if he did n't object you could stand on the platform and watch the london streets pass by .
hopping off before your stop to beat the traffic always made you smile .
the new bendy buses are so soulless , usually stuck in traffic just yards from a stop but with no escape possible .
travelling in london now is so boring and slower to boot !
tarquin cole , london , uk there are few things that so clearly symbolize london in the second half of the 1900s as the routemaster , and i fully support their being kept on the heritage routes for many years to come .
and if there is a legal issue with regard to wheelchair access , then simply take them off-route and make them a straight tourist attraction .
but do please keep them on the road - they have been a part of the making of london !
bruce , geneva , switzerland what a load of nonsense !
the very fact that the heritage buses are additional buses on routes already catered for by accessible buses should kill the issue .
i suppose we should also close the whispering gallery in st. paul 's to all visitors over accessibility .
after all , that would be ' fair ' .
as for it becoming illegal , what a joke .
london has new , accessible buses coming out of its ears !
what 's wrong with just a handful of the old ones .
in any case , i do n't think i 'd bother to use the heritage routes specially , but i like to see the buses around , and if there 's no one on them that simply wo n't happen .
the majority of people like them .
is this a democracy ?
jonathan h , kiev , ukraine i think the new buses across london are a disgrace .
if you sit downstairs near the back , it is so cramped. the windows barley let in hardly any air and during the summer months its so hot and stuffy. many people who can not find a seat downstairs often stand as the number of seats are limited compared to the route masters .
i 'm really dissapointed with ken for allowing the replacement of the route master to take its place .
fatima , the length of bendy buses make them a major hazard to anyone riding a bike or trying to cross the road .
what 's more , tfl seem to be finding that people simply do n't bother paying to ride these buses .
clearly , no more of these buses should be ordered .
will , london the non-disabled have rights too .
modern buses are a nightmare for the able-bodied , and particularly the elderly or temporarily infirm .
the lower decks of double deckers have virtually no seats , and no room to " move down the bus " , and getting to and from the upper deck is a white knuckle ride of jerking about and swaying -lrb- ok , some of that is bad driving -rrb- .
bendy buses are not much better , some of the seats are almost inaccessible to anybody who is n't 100 % fit .
i 'm not saying the routemaster was perfect , but it was a damned sight better than any of the replacements - long may they continue to grace our str ! eets !
paul , london i hope that the tfl continues to run these old buses on the special routes they should offer regular modern buses as well but the tourist love this kind of thing .
i know we do and enjoy riding on steam trains on our visits to the uk > barebear2 @ bellsouth.net , winter springs , florida usa it is right that these busses should remain on the heritage routes .
lrt should be allowed to dictate the design of a worthy successor that is suitable for london , not the boring , impractical , heavy and fuel-hungry and time-wasting current models .
we should be allowed to hop on and off where appropriate !
tom hopes , london , england its a few buses mostly operating as a novelty tourist attraction .
99.9 % of london buses are wheelchair accessible .
why spoil the fun for a few tourists ?
david s , london i doubt if patrick edwards of the disability right commission uses buses very often .
i do and i 've never seen a wheelchair user on the new buses in central london .
what i have seen is people frustrated at having to wait until the bus inches towards a bus stop before they can alight , instead of being able to get off in heavy traffic or at trafic lights .
how many people have had the doors closed in their faces and then watched as the bus only moves a few feet before waiting in a queue of traffic and not been able to jump on .
mike , london i love the routemasters !
not only are they a classic design but they are perfect in london because if the bus gets stuck in traffic , you can get off and walk rather than wait til the next stop .
having to wait til the next stop in traffic made me 20 minutes late this morning as the driver refused to open the doors - and i wanted to get off at the next stop which was about 100m down the road !
allie keith , united kingdom i lived in london in the bad old days of the routemaster , and loved them .
it was great to be able to run after them and hop on the back rather than having to wait for them to stop at a bus stop , and hop off again when close to your destination .
conductors served far more of a function than simply collecting tickets ¿ they helped people on and off , they acted as tourist information , and when i talk to people who have traveled to london on holiday some of their fondest memories are of the buses and how helpful the conductors were .
however , i would fully agree that they are unsuitable for the 21st century in terms of disabled access .
i used to work for an independent living scheme , being the ¿ arms and legs ¿ for a gentleman in a wheelchair , and got an idea of just how poorly served the wheelchair user is in london .

by trevor timpson bbc news more than 50 years since they appeared on london 's streets , the routemasters are still running - but not everyone is delighted .
routemasters are still rolling on in the age of the oystercard the veteran vehicle with its curvy design and its open platform has been called " the last bus to be a proper bus " .
many londoners remember fondly how they used to hop on and off them and pull the string to ring the bell .
but a disability rights commission spokesman says it is " a bashed-up old relic from a bygone age " and the fact that it is still running on two central london heritage routes is " a disappointment " .
a programme of repurchase and refurbishment - begun after the election of mayor ken livingstone in 2000 - stopped in 2003-4 , and the last full-scale route - the 159 - withdrew its routemasters in december 2005 .
what remained was the heritage routes - though only in the hours from 0930 to 1800 and only on the central part of two routes , the 9 -lrb- albert hall to aldwych -rrb- and 15 -lrb- tower of london to trafalgar square -rrb- .

key facts routemasters first entered service in 1956 in total , 2,876 were built some 1,300 still exist london transport said they would be phased out by 1978 they were last used on a regular route in 2005 the bus in summer holiday was not a routemaster it was an rt - the previous model a worthy successor would have the same merit of lightness , built in aluminium with no chassis , and would have a conductor - as well as having a low floor for accessibility .
would it have an open platform for jumping on and off ?
" where appropriate , " says andrew morgan .
doors could be included and closed on some sections of the route , but left open elsewhere .
for the routemasters , apart from rallies and private functions , only the heritage routes now remain .
tfl says it is pleased with the level of interest in the heritage routes and no changes or extensions to them are being considered at present .
andrew morgan thinks they are " moderately successful " .
he believes disability campaigners ' attitude to them may be " sour grapes , because they did n't quite win the battle " .
andrew braddock feels the buses ' limited role on the heritage routes makes sense , but adds : " whether american and japanese tourists really perceive a routemaster to be something different from the other 6,000 or so red double-deckers i frankly doubt . "
your memories of travelling on a routemaster : have no idea what a ' bendy-bus 'looks like as i have been in the usa for over 30 years , but i have wonderful memories of travelling on the old double-deckers to school and to my auntie 's house and all over london .
have a memory of being rather drunk coming home from a party and the conductor laying me out on the long seats so i could have a rest !
my uncle george was a conductor some 50 years ago .
we delighted in seeing him as the bus came closer .. he used the old tickets which he punched .
my sister and i used to jump from bus to bus in the west end on the way to work each day - quicker than being trampled on the tube !
the sight of st. paul 's always made me shudder in the early morning sunlight from the upper deck .
carole ricker , bluffton , usa the routemasters were great , i use to catch the 137 from oxford st to clapham common .
i always liked the wheel arch bench seats next to the platform , sometimes you would get a character conductor to keep you amused on your journey or if he did n't object you could stand on the platform and watch the london streets pass by .
hopping off before your stop to beat the traffic always made you smile .
the new bendy buses are so soulless , usually stuck in traffic just yards from a stop but with no escape possible .
travelling in london now is so boring and slower to boot !
tarquin cole , london , uk there are few things that so clearly symbolize london in the second half of the 1900s as the routemaster , and i fully support their being kept on the heritage routes for many years to come .
and if there is a legal issue with regard to wheelchair access , then simply take them off-route and make them a straight tourist attraction .
but do please keep them on the road - they have been a part of the making of london !
bruce , geneva , switzerland what a load of nonsense !
the very fact that the heritage buses are additional buses on routes already catered for by accessible buses should kill the issue .
i suppose we should also close the whispering gallery in st. paul 's to all visitors over accessibility .
after all , that would be ' fair ' .
as for it becoming illegal , what a joke .
london has new , accessible buses coming out of its ears !
what 's wrong with just a handful of the old ones .
in any case , i do n't think i 'd bother to use the heritage routes specially , but i like to see the buses around , and if there 's no one on them that simply wo n't happen .
the majority of people like them .
is this a democracy ?
jonathan h , kiev , ukraine i think the new buses across london are a disgrace .
if you sit downstairs near the back , it is so cramped. the windows barley let in hardly any air and during the summer months its so hot and stuffy. many people who can not find a seat downstairs often stand as the number of seats are limited compared to the route masters .
i 'm really dissapointed with ken for allowing the replacement of the route master to take its place .
fatima , the length of bendy buses make them a major hazard to anyone riding a bike or trying to cross the road .
what 's more , tfl seem to be finding that people simply do n't bother paying to ride these buses .
clearly , no more of these buses should be ordered .
will , london the non-disabled have rights too .
modern buses are a nightmare for the able-bodied , and particularly the elderly or temporarily infirm .
the lower decks of double deckers have virtually no seats , and no room to " move down the bus " , and getting to and from the upper deck is a white knuckle ride of jerking about and swaying -lrb- ok , some of that is bad driving -rrb- .
bendy buses are not much better , some of the seats are almost inaccessible to anybody who is n't 100 % fit .
i 'm not saying the routemaster was perfect , but it was a damned sight better than any of the replacements - long may they continue to grace our str ! eets !
paul , london i hope that the tfl continues to run these old buses on the special routes they should offer regular modern buses as well but the tourist love this kind of thing .
i know we do and enjoy riding on steam trains on our visits to the uk > barebear2 @ bellsouth.net , winter springs , florida usa it is right that these busses should remain on the heritage routes .
lrt should be allowed to dictate the design of a worthy successor that is suitable for london , not the boring , impractical , heavy and fuel-hungry and time-wasting current models .
we should be allowed to hop on and off where appropriate !
tom hopes , london , england its a few buses mostly operating as a novelty tourist attraction .
99.9 % of london buses are wheelchair accessible .
why spoil the fun for a few tourists ?
david s , london i doubt if patrick edwards of the disability right commission uses buses very often .
i do and i 've never seen a wheelchair user on the new buses in central london .
what i have seen is people frustrated at having to wait until the bus inches towards a bus stop before they can alight , instead of being able to get off in heavy traffic or at trafic lights .
how many people have had the doors closed in their faces and then watched as the bus only moves a few feet before waiting in a queue of traffic and not been able to jump on .
mike , london i love the routemasters !
not only are they a classic design but they are perfect in london because if the bus gets stuck in traffic , you can get off and walk rather than wait til the next stop .
having to wait til the next stop in traffic made me 20 minutes late this morning as the driver refused to open the doors - and i wanted to get off at the next stop which was about 100m down the road !
allie keith , united kingdom i lived in london in the bad old days of the routemaster , and loved them .
it was great to be able to run after them and hop on the back rather than having to wait for them to stop at a bus stop , and hop off again when close to your destination .
conductors served far more of a function than simply collecting tickets ¿ they helped people on and off , they acted as tourist information , and when i talk to people who have traveled to london on holiday some of their fondest memories are of the buses and how helpful the conductors were .
however , i would fully agree that they are unsuitable for the 21st century in terms of disabled access .
i used to work for an independent living scheme , being the ¿ arms and legs ¿ for a gentleman in a wheelchair , and got an idea of just how poorly served the wheelchair user is in london .

so transport authorities are having to pay ever higher subsidies just to persuade companies to stick to these routes .
but the unregulated system does not allow transport authorities who are paying these subsidies to inspect the bus companies ' books so they can never be sure if a bus company would be making a loss without them or just not a sufficiently large profit .
" we 'd like some more transparency , " says david brown , passenger services director of the south yorkshire passenger transport executive , " so we can see and understand the reasons behind bus companies not wanting to run a service . "
in london , with much bigger subsidies more akin to european levels and with the mayor uniquely able to set the routes and the timetable , bus usage has soared by 59 % .
so big is london 's patronage now , ministers have claimed that overall bus use is increasing in the whole country .
bus lanes have improved journey times by 13 % for london buses this disguises the fact that the bus is in deep decline in most urban areas outside london , especially the large conurbations , save for a handful of places : telford , brighton , dorset , york , west sussex and cambridgeshire .

road pricing now they have promised to give transport authorities the powers to move towards a more regulated system closer to the london model .
but the bus companies are threatening a legal challenge and it may be another four years before there are clear benefits .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- are we there yet -pipe- still waiting for the bus bbc news / are we there yet graphics version bbc sport home tuesday , 20 march 2007 , 04:34 gmt still waiting for the bus by john ware ten years ago the new labour government promised better integration of transport and a greater role for the bus .
but an integrated transport system - " that eternal cliché " as stephen glaister , professor of transport and infrastructure at imperial college , london , so pungently puts it - means vastly more than park-and-ride schemes and bus and train timetables that match up .
ultimately , it is about weaning us off our addiction to unsustainable hyper-mobility by redesigning our towns and realigning all modes of transport so that we use our cars less , and our own two feet and public transport more .
the integrated dream burst upon the early blair years with a high voltage vision - the creation of the department for environment , transport and regions . "
at the heart of an integrated transport system must be the bus .
it remains the most widely used and most cost effective form of public transport " here were gathered all the indispensable components of an integrated system under one roof of the mightiest government department ever created , with deputy prime minister john prescott poised to fuse them into one coherent whole .
well , it did not happen .
though passionate about integration , mr prescott did not have sufficient clout with no 10 .
bus decline at their urging , successive transport ministers tried to pick away at his policies which they regarded as anti-car , like his idea for an out-of-town retail parking tax .
moreover , the link between the environment and transport was broken in the autumn of 2000 when , confronted by a blockade of petrol depots by tanker drivers , the chancellor abandoned the fuel escalator - the annual above-inflation increase in fuel duty - introduced by the tories to damp down demand . "
so congested are the roads that a modest shift from car use will require a massive increase in buses " at the heart of an integrated transport system must be the bus .
it remains the most widely used and most cost effective form of public transport .
but outside london , bus passengers have continued to defect to cars .
despite the government 's pledge to develop quality public transport , nothing they have done has reversed that decline .
transport authorities also say they need to get control of routes and bus timetables .
bigger subsidies the government , however , has allowed bus companies to determine both , which has led to a free-for-all .
the transport select committee says this unregulated bus system seems to have exacerbated the decline of the bus in the english regions as they focus on the most profitable routes at the expense of less profitable ones .
in isolated rural areas cars and taxis may well be more practical than buses carrying mostly fresh air .
but in semi-rural areas and the suburbs , buses are both socially necessary and the only public transport solution . "
it has taken the government nine years to acknowledge that the current deregulated model for buses outside london is n't working " yet more and more of these routes are being abandoned by bus companies because they are not making a satisfactory commercial return which many regard as being at least 10 % .
so transport authorities are having to pay ever higher subsidies just to persuade companies to stick to these routes .
but the unregulated system does not allow transport authorities who are paying these subsidies to inspect the bus companies ' books so they can never be sure if a bus company would be making a loss without them or just not a sufficiently large profit .

even some councils which received the highest government rating for their social services have fallen short in their protection of vulnerable adults .
the government 's director of inspection mike rourke told bbc file on 4 these adults need similar legal safeguards to child protection law .
minister ivan lewis said he is looking to strengthen adult protection .
file on 4 requested a detailed assessment of adult protection from the commission for social care inspection and found that a sixth of all 150 councils in england were failing .
we have campaigned for adult protection legislation to raise it to the same status as child protection kathryn stone , chief executive , voice uk family 's concern over ' abuse ' confirming the bbc 's analysis as a " serious " problem , mr rourke , the csci 's director of inspection , said : " our message is that councils have not got systems as tight as they should be and therefore can not be sure they are responding adequately to referrals - that 's our challenge to them . "
he said there were various reasons for the failure .
" for some it 's financial priorities , others it is competing priorities and for some it 's a lack of management grip , " he said .
disability campaign group voice uk said the figures prove that " no secrets " , a government policy set out in 2000 to stop the abuse and neglect of elderly or disabled people , has been poorly implemented .
kathryn stone , voice uk chief executive , " it might be argued it is not effective because there is no law to support it - we have campaigned for adult protection legislation to raise it to the same status as child protection . "
one case cited by the group is that of " james " , whose family allege he was raped and sexually abused by another resident while in sheltered accommodation .
the family also say £ 2,000 worth of property was stolen from him .
an independent review " largely upheld " the family 's complaints against halton council , in cheshire , but the james 's relatives said they have not received an apology and a satisfactory explanation from the council .
halton council refused to comment .
voice uk said the case illustrates a national pattern where families who allege relatives have been abused are seen as troublesome by local authorities .
campaigners for the elderly are also concerned at the lack of protection for elderly people .
ivan lewis said he is looking to strengthen adult protection gary fitzgerald , chief executive of action on elder abuse , called on care services minister ivan lewis to honour a pledge made by a previous minister to make all official agencies safeguard people at risk from abuse by setting tough targets in their appraisals .
" we are still waiting for progress , " he said .
mr lewis told the bbc it was unacceptable that one in six councils were failing to protect vulnerable adults .
he said the government and the charity comic relief are spending £ 650,000 to research the level of abuse on older people which is due to be published in the summer .

suffering a severe form of autism means the welfare of james , 39 , is always a concern for his family .
they say his condition makes him particularly suggestible and easy prey for others .
but the normal worries of his sister linda were heightened a year and a half ago when she began to suspect somebody was stealing from james , who was living in sheltered accommodation with no support from staff overnight .
he told his sister another resident was taking items from his bedroom and entering without his permission and had taken money from his trousers while he was still wearing them .
his family believe an estimated £ 2,000 was stolen over time but worse was to come .
linda was shocked when james 's behaviour in the shower one day seemed to indicate he had suffered sexual abuse and even rape .
there was no personal apology to james and no recognition of the hurt caused by failing to take proper steps to protect him linda , james 's sister " he started crying and i 'd never seen him crying .
he said this other person keeps hurting me , " she told bbc file on 4 .
" it was very distressing . "
another sister witnessed the same behaviour and the family 's fears increased when his daily care worker said that james told her another resident had been in the shower with him .
the care worker told the family and her bosses about the concerns .
his family are still seething at the " professionals meeting " called by halton borough council which they say was riddled with inaccuracies .
" we thought it was disgusting , they did n't even get his name correct ... it said there was no evidence of a change in his relationships but staff remarked how unresponsive he was and had not been out of his room for days , " said linda .
' poor notes ' an independent council report said the notes of the meeting were very poor .
it criticised the fact that neither the police nor several health professionals were present at what should have been a multi-agency meeting .
the care worker who knew him best was not invited to attend .
the council director of social services told the family that after a police investigation the crown prosecution service -lrb- cps -rrb- found there was insufficient evidence to take the case further .
yet when contacted the cps said no such case had been referred to it .
' no apology ' the independent report " largely upheld " the family 's complaints but linda said the council 's response has been inadequate .
" there was no personal apology to james and no recognition of the hurt caused by failing to take proper steps to protect him , " she said .

the council added : " at this stage it would be inappropriate to comment any further . "

by mark easton home editor , bbc news bbc home editor , mark easton , visited one english city to see if local views reflected a bbc poll 's findings on attitudes to the war in iraq , and if the war had changed political allegiances .
milton keynes ' architects have been invited to redesign najaf third think iraq war was right milton keynes seems a long way from the battlefields of iraq .
in our shrinking planet , though , one quickly finds links .
for instance , the designers of milton keynes have been invited to redesign the war-damaged iraqi city of najaf .
but i travelled to this rapidly-expanding buckinghamshire city to find out how , four years after the invasion of iraq , that war may have redesigned the social and political fabric of towns like milton keynes .
back in 2003 , if milton keynes is typical - about six out of every 10 people here supported the war .
today ?
a bbc poll shows six out of every 10 now believe the war was a mistake - although three out of every 10 people still think it was the right thing to do .
in one of the huge shopping centres that dominate milton keynes , i talked to shoppers about the war and was surprised how quickly you meet someone directly affected .
i spoke to the father of a soldier who had just returned from iraq .
" i am not happy about it " , he told me .
" i 'm not happy at all .
i did n't support the war but obviously you support the troops .
they 've got a job to do and they sign up to do it . "
it may well be much harder to get the british public to back other overseas adventures by the military because of what 's happened in iraq mark lancaster , mp for north east milton keynes his wife joined the conversation .
" they are doing a job , but the army does n't want to be there " , she said .
" they want to come home . "
at milton keynes railway station the message was more emphatic .
" end the occupation of iraq " demanded a " stop the war " banner draped over a trestle table .
tom bolton was one of the hundreds from the city who joined the million or more on the anti-war march in london four years ago .
" i am still as angry as ever about it " , he told me .
" we felt at the beginning that it was an illegal and immoral invasion that would cause unnecessary suffering and after four years of occupation too many lives are still being taken . "
as we chatted , a group of young men drove by and let loose a stream of racist invective at the protesters .
" nuke iraq " one angry face shouted - a hint that the war has put community relations under strain .
outside a local mosque i found graffiti which read " muslims hate you ... " and in the largely bengali community in duncombe street in bletchley a young asian man told me how , at the time of the invasion , tensions ran high .
" when it first started there were a few incidents in the street .
a few bricks and bottles were thrown at the mosque , " he told me .
" but now everything 's back to normal and people are just getting on with what they 're doing . "
it was a widespread view among muslims i met .
" i am more worried about paying the gas bill than what 's happening in iraq , " a young bangladeshi father told me at his garden gate .
political legacy back at the shopping centre , it was clear that however deep the passions over iraq may have been four years ago , it was not a burning issue for most today .
" it 's almost history " one man told me .
" you hear about it on the news and you hear about the soldiers who have been killed , but it 's kind of gone from the mind . "
is there a political legacy , though ?
the mp for north east milton keynes is mark lancaster , a conservative who believes his long-standing opposition to the war in iraq helped him win the seat at the last election .
now a tory whip , mr lancaster is also a major in the territorial army with experience in afghanistan , bosnia and kosovo .
i asked whether he thought the invasion of iraq had long-term consequences .
" it has had an impact on the political agenda " , he replied .
" it may well be much harder to get the british public to back other overseas adventures by the military because of what 's happened in iraq . "
continuing bloodshed however , our poll shows that almost six out of every 10 people would still support british military intervention overseas - to stop genocide or for disaster relief - even if there was no direct threat to britain .
and even mark lancaster agrees that iraq is not an issue on the doorstep these days .
as another shopper carrying a young baby put it to me : " i did the march at the time because i thought it was quite confusing as to why we were going there .
but now , sadly , because you hear about it less , it goes away from your mind . "
despite the continuing bloodshed , for milton keynes at least , it appears that the iraq war is fast heading into history .

" you hear about it on the news and you hear about the soldiers who have been killed , but it 's kind of gone from the mind . "
is there a political legacy , though ?
the mp for north east milton keynes is mark lancaster , a conservative who believes his long-standing opposition to the war in iraq helped him win the seat at the last election .
now a tory whip , mr lancaster is also a major in the territorial army with experience in afghanistan , bosnia and kosovo .
i asked whether he thought the invasion of iraq had long-term consequences .
" it has had an impact on the political agenda " , he replied .
" it may well be much harder to get the british public to back other overseas adventures by the military because of what 's happened in iraq . "
continuing bloodshed however , our poll shows that almost six out of every 10 people would still support british military intervention overseas - to stop genocide or for disaster relief - even if there was no direct threat to britain .
and even mark lancaster agrees that iraq is not an issue on the doorstep these days .
as another shopper carrying a young baby put it to me : " i did the march at the time because i thought it was quite confusing as to why we were going there .
but now , sadly , because you hear about it less , it goes away from your mind . "
despite the continuing bloodshed , for milton keynes at least , it appears that the iraq war is fast heading into history .

by mark easton home editor , bbc news bbc home editor , mark easton , visited one english city to see if local views reflected a bbc poll 's findings on attitudes to the war in iraq , and if the war had changed political allegiances .
milton keynes ' architects have been invited to redesign najaf third think iraq war was right milton keynes seems a long way from the battlefields of iraq .
in our shrinking planet , though , one quickly finds links .
for instance , the designers of milton keynes have been invited to redesign the war-damaged iraqi city of najaf .
but i travelled to this rapidly-expanding buckinghamshire city to find out how , four years after the invasion of iraq , that war may have redesigned the social and political fabric of towns like milton keynes .
back in 2003 , if milton keynes is typical - about six out of every 10 people here supported the war .
today ?
a bbc poll shows six out of every 10 now believe the war was a mistake - although three out of every 10 people still think it was the right thing to do .
in one of the huge shopping centres that dominate milton keynes , i talked to shoppers about the war and was surprised how quickly you meet someone directly affected .
i spoke to the father of a soldier who had just returned from iraq .
" i am not happy about it " , he told me .
" i 'm not happy at all .
i did n't support the war but obviously you support the troops .
they 've got a job to do and they sign up to do it . "
it may well be much harder to get the british public to back other overseas adventures by the military because of what 's happened in iraq mark lancaster , mp for north east milton keynes his wife joined the conversation .
" they are doing a job , but the army does n't want to be there " , she said .
" they want to come home . "
at milton keynes railway station the message was more emphatic .
" end the occupation of iraq " demanded a " stop the war " banner draped over a trestle table .
tom bolton was one of the hundreds from the city who joined the million or more on the anti-war march in london four years ago .
" i am still as angry as ever about it " , he told me .
" we felt at the beginning that it was an illegal and immoral invasion that would cause unnecessary suffering and after four years of occupation too many lives are still being taken . "
as we chatted , a group of young men drove by and let loose a stream of racist invective at the protesters .
" nuke iraq " one angry face shouted - a hint that the war has put community relations under strain .
outside a local mosque i found graffiti which read " muslims hate you ... " and in the largely bengali community in duncombe street in bletchley a young asian man told me how , at the time of the invasion , tensions ran high .
" when it first started there were a few incidents in the street .
a few bricks and bottles were thrown at the mosque , " he told me .
" but now everything 's back to normal and people are just getting on with what they 're doing . "
it was a widespread view among muslims i met .
" i am more worried about paying the gas bill than what 's happening in iraq , " a young bangladeshi father told me at his garden gate .

by mark easton home editor , bbc news bbc home editor , mark easton , visited one english city to see if local views reflected a bbc poll 's findings on attitudes to the war in iraq , and if the war had changed political allegiances .
milton keynes ' architects have been invited to redesign najaf third think iraq war was right milton keynes seems a long way from the battlefields of iraq .
in our shrinking planet , though , one quickly finds links .
for instance , the designers of milton keynes have been invited to redesign the war-damaged iraqi city of najaf .
but i travelled to this rapidly-expanding buckinghamshire city to find out how , four years after the invasion of iraq , that war may have redesigned the social and political fabric of towns like milton keynes .
back in 2003 , if milton keynes is typical - about six out of every 10 people here supported the war .
today ?
a bbc poll shows six out of every 10 now believe the war was a mistake - although three out of every 10 people still think it was the right thing to do .
in one of the huge shopping centres that dominate milton keynes , i talked to shoppers about the war and was surprised how quickly you meet someone directly affected .
i spoke to the father of a soldier who had just returned from iraq .
" i am not happy about it " , he told me .
" i 'm not happy at all .
i did n't support the war but obviously you support the troops .
they 've got a job to do and they sign up to do it . "
it may well be much harder to get the british public to back other overseas adventures by the military because of what 's happened in iraq mark lancaster , mp for north east milton keynes his wife joined the conversation .
" they are doing a job , but the army does n't want to be there " , she said .
" they want to come home . "
at milton keynes railway station the message was more emphatic .
" end the occupation of iraq " demanded a " stop the war " banner draped over a trestle table .
tom bolton was one of the hundreds from the city who joined the million or more on the anti-war march in london four years ago .
" i am still as angry as ever about it " , he told me .
" we felt at the beginning that it was an illegal and immoral invasion that would cause unnecessary suffering and after four years of occupation too many lives are still being taken . "
as we chatted , a group of young men drove by and let loose a stream of racist invective at the protesters .
" nuke iraq " one angry face shouted - a hint that the war has put community relations under strain .
outside a local mosque i found graffiti which read " muslims hate you ... " and in the largely bengali community in duncombe street in bletchley a young asian man told me how , at the time of the invasion , tensions ran high .
" when it first started there were a few incidents in the street .
a few bricks and bottles were thrown at the mosque , " he told me .
" but now everything 's back to normal and people are just getting on with what they 're doing . "
it was a widespread view among muslims i met .
" i am more worried about paying the gas bill than what 's happening in iraq , " a young bangladeshi father told me at his garden gate .
political legacy back at the shopping centre , it was clear that however deep the passions over iraq may have been four years ago , it was not a burning issue for most today .
" it 's almost history " one man told me .
" you hear about it on the news and you hear about the soldiers who have been killed , but it 's kind of gone from the mind . "
is there a political legacy , though ?
the mp for north east milton keynes is mark lancaster , a conservative who believes his long-standing opposition to the war in iraq helped him win the seat at the last election .
now a tory whip , mr lancaster is also a major in the territorial army with experience in afghanistan , bosnia and kosovo .
i asked whether he thought the invasion of iraq had long-term consequences .
" it has had an impact on the political agenda " , he replied .
" it may well be much harder to get the british public to back other overseas adventures by the military because of what 's happened in iraq . "
continuing bloodshed however , our poll shows that almost six out of every 10 people would still support british military intervention overseas - to stop genocide or for disaster relief - even if there was no direct threat to britain .
and even mark lancaster agrees that iraq is not an issue on the doorstep these days .
as another shopper carrying a young baby put it to me : " i did the march at the time because i thought it was quite confusing as to why we were going there .
but now , sadly , because you hear about it less , it goes away from your mind . "
despite the continuing bloodshed , for milton keynes at least , it appears that the iraq war is fast heading into history .

is there a political legacy , though ?
the mp for north east milton keynes is mark lancaster , a conservative who believes his long-standing opposition to the war in iraq helped him win the seat at the last election .

" it may well be much harder to get the british public to back other overseas adventures by the military because of what 's happened in iraq . "
continuing bloodshed however , our poll shows that almost six out of every 10 people would still support british military intervention overseas - to stop genocide or for disaster relief - even if there was no direct threat to britain .
and even mark lancaster agrees that iraq is not an issue on the doorstep these days .
as another shopper carrying a young baby put it to me : " i did the march at the time because i thought it was quite confusing as to why we were going there .
but now , sadly , because you hear about it less , it goes away from your mind . "
despite the continuing bloodshed , for milton keynes at least , it appears that the iraq war is fast heading into history .

by mark easton home editor , bbc news bbc home editor , mark easton , visited one english city to see if local views reflected a bbc poll 's findings on attitudes to the war in iraq , and if the war had changed political allegiances .
milton keynes ' architects have been invited to redesign najaf third think iraq war was right milton keynes seems a long way from the battlefields of iraq .
in our shrinking planet , though , one quickly finds links .
for instance , the designers of milton keynes have been invited to redesign the war-damaged iraqi city of najaf .
but i travelled to this rapidly-expanding buckinghamshire city to find out how , four years after the invasion of iraq , that war may have redesigned the social and political fabric of towns like milton keynes .
back in 2003 , if milton keynes is typical - about six out of every 10 people here supported the war .
today ?
a bbc poll shows six out of every 10 now believe the war was a mistake - although three out of every 10 people still think it was the right thing to do .
in one of the huge shopping centres that dominate milton keynes , i talked to shoppers about the war and was surprised how quickly you meet someone directly affected .
i spoke to the father of a soldier who had just returned from iraq .
" i am not happy about it " , he told me .
" i 'm not happy at all .
i did n't support the war but obviously you support the troops .
they 've got a job to do and they sign up to do it . "
it may well be much harder to get the british public to back other overseas adventures by the military because of what 's happened in iraq mark lancaster , mp for north east milton keynes his wife joined the conversation .
" they are doing a job , but the army does n't want to be there " , she said .
" they want to come home . "
at milton keynes railway station the message was more emphatic .
" end the occupation of iraq " demanded a " stop the war " banner draped over a trestle table .
tom bolton was one of the hundreds from the city who joined the million or more on the anti-war march in london four years ago .
" i am still as angry as ever about it " , he told me .
" we felt at the beginning that it was an illegal and immoral invasion that would cause unnecessary suffering and after four years of occupation too many lives are still being taken . "
as we chatted , a group of young men drove by and let loose a stream of racist invective at the protesters .
" nuke iraq " one angry face shouted - a hint that the war has put community relations under strain .
outside a local mosque i found graffiti which read " muslims hate you ... " and in the largely bengali community in duncombe street in bletchley a young asian man told me how , at the time of the invasion , tensions ran high .
" when it first started there were a few incidents in the street .
a few bricks and bottles were thrown at the mosque , " he told me .
" but now everything 's back to normal and people are just getting on with what they 're doing . "
it was a widespread view among muslims i met .
" i am more worried about paying the gas bill than what 's happening in iraq , " a young bangladeshi father told me at his garden gate .
political legacy back at the shopping centre , it was clear that however deep the passions over iraq may have been four years ago , it was not a burning issue for most today .

connah broom , from gronant , near prestatyn in denbighshire , has neuroblastoma which only affects around 80 children in britain each year .
his diary , put together with help from his grandfather jim , is published on a website set up to help raise funds to send him to america for treatment .
mr broom said they would even resort to selling their home to fund the trip .
he was inspired to set up the website after meeting the parents of a young girl with the condition at alder hey hospital in liverpool who were planning to do the same .
" it 's just to make people aware " he said .
" there are an awful lot of children in north wales going though all types of cancer and leukaemia . "

you would do absolutely anything if you thought it was going to do something for connah jim broom , connah 's grandfather connah lives with his grandparents jim and debbie , and his father chris .
mr broom explained : " before connah goes to bed , i take a few notes about what he remembers doing that day .
when he goes to bed i sit down and write it up .
" he sometimes needs a bit of prompting .
what sticks out in kids ' minds is things like going around to a friend 's house and playing power rangers . "
compiling the blog has been a boost to both connah and mr broom , who said : " we spend time together all day but then i sit down and cuddle him and talk everything through and it helps .
" just to talk through what he 's done also makes him realise he is doing stuff every day and not just sitting in front of the television . "
swimming and a friend 's birthday party have featured in the blog diagnosed last august , connah has tumours through his body and chemotherapy has had very little success .
his family are now investigating every possible treatment including therapy only available in america which will cost thousands of pounds .
there is only a one in five survival rate for neuroblastoma .
mr broom said he would even be willing to sell his house to raise the necessary funds to go to america .
" you would do anything , absolutely anything , if you thought it was going to do something for connah " he said .
" you 'd go anywhere , you 'd sit in the street and demonstrate or do whatever it takes .
any parent would . "
if it is not possible to send connah to america , the family have said any money raised will go towards research into the rare condition .

sir thomas picton , from haverfordwest , was the most senior officer to die at the battle of waterloo .
but he had earlier been governor of trinidad where an allegation of torture against him almost derailed his career .
at a high-profile trial in london , he was accused of forcing 13-year-old louisa calderon to stand on a sharpened spike while suspended from the ceiling .
this form of torture was dubbed " pictoning " at the trial .
he eventually cleared his name on appeal and went on to resume his military career .
today , his bust stands alongside that of owain glyndwr and other welsh heroes at city hall in cardiff .
he was a very hard unfeeling governor , he was regarded as a beast khafra kambon , trinidadian civil rights campaigner chris delaney , of carmarthen museum , told a bbc radio wales programme marking the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade : " he is remembered more for his military prowess , his military skills and the fact that he actually died at waterloo .
" he was quite clearly a hero of britain and if you look at biographies , this trial is a small stain on his character . "
but trinidadian historians say they have uncovered the full brutality of picton 's rule in trinidad .
" he had a very bad reputation as a governor , " civil rights campaigner khafra kambon told the programme .
" he was extremely harsh in the kind of punishments he meted out .
a magazine cartoon depicting the form of torture dubbed " pictoning " " there was a lot of terror associated with him .
he was a very hard , unfeeling governor , he was regarded as a beast . "
the programme tells how he introduced tough slave codes , raising the number of lashes which could be given to a slave from 25 to 39 .
he also introduced a 9pm curfew which slaves would receive 25 lashes for breaking .
slaves had traditionally been given saturdays off to grow food on their small plots or sell produce at market .
picton abolished this and fined owners who allowed it to continue .
executions and torture were common under picton 's regime said mr kambon .
" you have to see the kinds of punishments that were meted out ... the torture , the beheadings and the hangings .
the laws were extremely harsh .
the practice of slavery was extremely harsh , " he added .
" for minor offences - like if you stole some sugar - they would slit your nose .
if you do it again they would cut off your ears , " said kambon .

the uk 's third biggest bank says that the talks are at an early and exploratory stage and there can be no certainty of a transaction being done .
a barclays-abn merger would create a bank with 47 million customers and 220,000 staff worldwide .
it also may prompt other bids for abn - and for barclays itself , analysts said .
on monday , the dutch firm 's shares rose 8 % in response to the news , but barclays shares closed down 0.8 % as investors awaited more information about the situation .
rescue party in recent years , abn - the netherlands ' biggest bank - has cut jobs to control costs so it can expand into new markets and face down more competition .
barclays , the uk 's third-largest bank , wants access to abn 's foreign businesses , in particular its asian operations , analysts said . "
simply to have got to the stage where it is in exclusive merger talks with abn is quite a feat " robert peston , bbc business editor barclays and abn held talks two years ago when they first explored the possibility of a merger .
" it has been the great dream of britain 's big banks to merge with a large continental rival , and for barclays that dream may at last be coming true , " said the bbc 's business editor robert peston .
" simply to have got to the stage where it is in exclusive merger talks with abn is quite a feat , given the political , regulatory and culture obstacles to such cross-border deals . "
royal bank of scotland and italy 's capitalia are among banking groups who are also thought to be interested in buying some or all of abn 's businesses .
in recent months two uk hedge funds - tci and toscafund - have criticised the dutch bank for its poor performance and both are understood to be calling for a shake-up at the group .

bp 's texas city plant , south of houston , was hit by a fatal explosion in 2005 , which also injured 180 people .
a report by the us chemical safety board on tuesday is set to conclude that there were deep-seated failures in the way bp dealt with safety .
the report is likely to highlight cost-cutting measures at the refinery .
bp has denied that budget cuts were to blame for the texas city disaster .
' big problem ' the report is expected to allege that over several years warning signs of impending catastrophe at texas city were not heeded , and that bp chief executive lord browne and directors " did not exercise effective safety oversight " .
bp had said in their early reports that this was a one-off , that texas city was unique in these problems - from my experience and the experience of our investigators we did n't believe that could be the case carolyn merritt , us chemical safety board chairman the report will cap a year of bad news for bp , including an oil spill in alaska , which has seriously damaged the company 's image .
in january , bp announced that lord browne would step down in july , 17 months earlier than planned .
the chairman of the us chemical safety board , carolyn merritt , says not enough had been done at the highest levels of bp to check on how budget cuts had affected safety .
" the big problem is that we did not find any evaluation being done by anybody at any level that said these cuts were impacting safety , " says ms merritt .
she told radio 4 's the world tonight that investigators had begun to suspect much wider safety problems at bp soon after starting their inquiry in 2005 .
' system failures ' " bp had said in their early reports that this was a one-off , that texas city was unique in these problems .
from my experience and the experience of our investigators we did n't believe that could be the case , " says ms merritt .
she said suspicions were raised when the investigation team found evidence of " failure to identify very serious near-miss accidents ... and problems with equipment that was not repaired " .
in a previous safety report on bp 's safety culture , the company admitted " management system failures " .
it said it was trying to improve safety at its refineries .
' never go back ' what happened here was something that should never have happened kristof harris , bp engineer bp engineer kristof harris was injured when a mobile office sited near the seat of the explosion was destroyed .
a dozen of his workmates were killed .
he told the bbc that he had had 14 operations and was on pain-killers and anti-depressants .
he has a badly damaged foot and says that what he misses most is playing ball games with his children .
" my life was sports , on my own and with my kids , " says mr harris .
" i have a psychiatrist and i tell her that i live about 10 % of the life that i used to live before the explosion .
so i 've lost 90 % of my life in the last 18 months . "
" what happened here was something that should never have happened . "
mr harris says he still feels loyalty to bp , but he is not certain he can ever go back to work at the plant .
" i had 12 people that died , and many more were mangled .
my job is to keep them safe , and i was betrayed by mistakes ... and that 's very hard to deal with , " he says .
clear statement trade union official sonny sanders , of the united steel workers , says he will be cautious about trusting bp in the future .
he says to restore his faith in the company he would want a clear statement from bp 's lord browne about the role he played in cost-cutting policies .
" if the decision was made at his level to cut budgets throughout bp and its holdings worldwide , then lord browne is culpable in regards to this explosion , " says mr sanders .
" if he was not directly responsible then he is at least a party to these decisions and should be held responsible because he is the ceo of the company . "
bp refused bbc requests to visit the texas city plant and to interview a senior executive about the refinery disaster .

bp 's texas city plant , south of houston , was hit by a fatal explosion in 2005 , which also injured 180 people .
a report by the us chemical safety board on tuesday is set to conclude that there were deep-seated failures in the way bp dealt with safety .
the report is likely to highlight cost-cutting measures at the refinery .
bp has denied that budget cuts were to blame for the texas city disaster .
' big problem ' the report is expected to allege that over several years warning signs of impending catastrophe at texas city were not heeded , and that bp chief executive lord browne and directors " did not exercise effective safety oversight " .
bp had said in their early reports that this was a one-off , that texas city was unique in these problems - from my experience and the experience of our investigators we did n't believe that could be the case carolyn merritt , us chemical safety board chairman the report will cap a year of bad news for bp , including an oil spill in alaska , which has seriously damaged the company 's image .
in january , bp announced that lord browne would step down in july , 17 months earlier than planned .
the chairman of the us chemical safety board , carolyn merritt , says not enough had been done at the highest levels of bp to check on how budget cuts had affected safety .
" the big problem is that we did not find any evaluation being done by anybody at any level that said these cuts were impacting safety , " says ms merritt .
she told radio 4 's the world tonight that investigators had begun to suspect much wider safety problems at bp soon after starting their inquiry in 2005 .
' system failures ' " bp had said in their early reports that this was a one-off , that texas city was unique in these problems .
from my experience and the experience of our investigators we did n't believe that could be the case , " says ms merritt .
she said suspicions were raised when the investigation team found evidence of " failure to identify very serious near-miss accidents ... and problems with equipment that was not repaired " .
in a previous safety report on bp 's safety culture , the company admitted " management system failures " .
it said it was trying to improve safety at its refineries .

he told the bbc that he had had 14 operations and was on pain-killers and anti-depressants .
he has a badly damaged foot and says that what he misses most is playing ball games with his children .
" my life was sports , on my own and with my kids , " says mr harris .
" i have a psychiatrist and i tell her that i live about 10 % of the life that i used to live before the explosion .
so i 've lost 90 % of my life in the last 18 months . "
" what happened here was something that should never have happened . "
mr harris says he still feels loyalty to bp , but he is not certain he can ever go back to work at the plant .
" i had 12 people that died , and many more were mangled .
my job is to keep them safe , and i was betrayed by mistakes ... and that 's very hard to deal with , " he says .
clear statement trade union official sonny sanders , of the united steel workers , says he will be cautious about trusting bp in the future .
he says to restore his faith in the company he would want a clear statement from bp 's lord browne about the role he played in cost-cutting policies .
" if the decision was made at his level to cut budgets throughout bp and its holdings worldwide , then lord browne is culpable in regards to this explosion , " says mr sanders .

the easy walk service has been developed by il village , a firm in turin in northern italy .
it is currently being tested by a group of 30 people from the italian blind union who are providing feedback .
the plan is for easy walk to be launched to blind and partially sighted people in piedmont in the autumn .
easy walk uses a mobile phone that runs the symbian operating system , a small bluetooth gps receiver , text to speech software called talks -lrb- though rival products are also compatible -rrb- and a call centre that will operate around the clock seven days a week .
it requires just two dedicated keys on the mobile phone - one which , when pressed , tells the user their exact location including the house or building number and the other one alerts the call centre that the person needs assistance with navigation .
an operator will then call the blind person , find out where it is they need to go and stay on the line with them providing step by step instructions .
easy walk is the brainchild of andrea de paoli , il village 's technology officer .
" what is really important is that behind all that stuff there is a call centre with a human being that can help you and who understands your needs , " he said .
' guardian angel ' this is a concept that mr de paoli refers to as having a " guardian angel " who makes sure that anyone using the system gets to where they need to go .
because easy walk uses digital maps , in theory the call centre staff would be able to provide guidance to a user anywhere in europe .
the system has already been tested across the border in france and switzerland .
the first phase of the project has resulted in 95 % accuracy in determining a user 's exact location and mr de paoli intends to rebuild the system from scratch for the second phase of testing to achieve 100 % reliability .
" easy walk is very important to help me to go to the places that i do n't know , " said federico borgna who is leading the group of 30 testers from the italian blind union .
" it gives me more confidence because i usually walk by myself but i have to know the way - easy walk helps me to go where i do n't know the way . "
mr borgna also uses the technology on trains or trams to pinpoint his exact location in order to know when to get off .
thanks to the feedback of mr borgna and his colleagues , the system is now able to deliver information in a way that is most useful for blind people .
" if the call centre tells you that you have to go straight on for 200m and then turn right , for me this has no meaning , " he said .
" for me it is important that you tell me that i have to go for two blocks , cross two streets and then turn right - i know when i am crossing a street but i do n't know what 200m is . "
the trial phase has been financed by the regional administration of piedmont which has invested £ 50,000 but it is now looking for partners or sponsors before easy walk is made generally available this year .
" this region is doing its best to bring about a free service , " said elio federici head of mobile telecommunications for the piedmont regional government .
" our idea - and the philosophy of our president , mercedes bresso - is that this service should be free of charge to the end user . "
mr federici estimates that the service will cost approximately £ 300 per person to implement .
il village has already set up another call centre service - easy contact - that makes phone calls on behalf of deaf people who have no speech who send in requests by text message .
other regions of italy have already bought the service and il village is hoping for similar success to follow the launch of easy walk .

the easy walk service has been developed by il village , a firm in turin in northern italy .
it is currently being tested by a group of 30 people from the italian blind union who are providing feedback .
the plan is for easy walk to be launched to blind and partially sighted people in piedmont in the autumn .
easy walk uses a mobile phone that runs the symbian operating system , a small bluetooth gps receiver , text to speech software called talks -lrb- though rival products are also compatible -rrb- and a call centre that will operate around the clock seven days a week .
it requires just two dedicated keys on the mobile phone - one which , when pressed , tells the user their exact location including the house or building number and the other one alerts the call centre that the person needs assistance with navigation .
an operator will then call the blind person , find out where it is they need to go and stay on the line with them providing step by step instructions .
easy walk is the brainchild of andrea de paoli , il village 's technology officer .
" what is really important is that behind all that stuff there is a call centre with a human being that can help you and who understands your needs , " he said .
' guardian angel ' this is a concept that mr de paoli refers to as having a " guardian angel " who makes sure that anyone using the system gets to where they need to go .
because easy walk uses digital maps , in theory the call centre staff would be able to provide guidance to a user anywhere in europe .
the system has already been tested across the border in france and switzerland .
the first phase of the project has resulted in 95 % accuracy in determining a user 's exact location and mr de paoli intends to rebuild the system from scratch for the second phase of testing to achieve 100 % reliability .
" easy walk is very important to help me to go to the places that i do n't know , " said federico borgna who is leading the group of 30 testers from the italian blind union .
federico borgna -lrb- left -rrb- has been assisting andrea de paoli -lrb- right -rrb- " it gives me more confidence because i usually walk by myself but i have to know the way - easy walk helps me to go where i do n't know the way . "
mr borgna also uses the technology on trains or trams to pinpoint his exact location in order to know when to get off .
thanks to the feedback of mr borgna and his colleagues , the system is now able to deliver information in a way that is most useful for blind people .
" if the call centre tells you that you have to go straight on for 200m and then turn right , for me this has no meaning , " he said .
" for me it is important that you tell me that i have to go for two blocks , cross two streets and then turn right - i know when i am crossing a street but i do n't know what 200m is . "
the trial phase has been financed by the regional administration of piedmont which has invested £ 50,000 but it is now looking for partners or sponsors before easy walk is made generally available this year .
" this region is doing its best to bring about a free service , " said elio federici head of mobile telecommunications for the piedmont regional government .
" our idea - and the philosophy of our president , mercedes bresso - is that this service should be free of charge to the end user . "
mr federici estimates that the service will cost approximately £ 300 per person to implement .

the trial phase has been financed by the regional administration of piedmont which has invested £ 50,000 but it is now looking for partners or sponsors before easy walk is made generally available this year .
" this region is doing its best to bring about a free service , " said elio federici head of mobile telecommunications for the piedmont regional government .
" our idea - and the philosophy of our president , mercedes bresso - is that this service should be free of charge to the end user . "
mr federici estimates that the service will cost approximately £ 300 per person to implement .
il village has already set up another call centre service - easy contact - that makes phone calls on behalf of deaf people who have no speech who send in requests by text message .
other regions of italy have already bought the service and il village is hoping for similar success to follow the launch of easy walk .
