ss officer karl hoecker 's album also includes rare photos at auschwitz of josef mengele , the nazi doctor known as the " angel of death " who conducted gruesome experiments on camp inmates in the name of medicine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef mengele features in some of the auschwitz photos the photos give a rare glimpse of some of the men who ran auschwitz , enjoying time off and evidently disconnected from the horror in which more than one million nazi prisoners died .
" it 's hard to fathom the kind of people who ran these camps , " museum director sara bloomfield said .
" these unique photographs vividly illustrate the contented world they enjoyed while overseeing a world of unimaginable suffering . "
nazis seen relaxing as if on holiday hoecker , the adjutant to the death camp 's commander from may 1944 until its evacuation in january 1945 , catalogues his stay at the most notorious nazi killing site in much the same way as someone might present memories of a trip to a holiday idyll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those in the pictures seem oblivious to the horrors nearby he is seen lighting a candle on a christmas tree , petting his favourite german shepherd and passing out blueberries to young german women sitting on a fence .
other camp leaders and nazi officials also appear in the images .
in one photo , hoecker is shown laughing , flanked by young women and an accordion player , as their sing-along on a bridge is apparently cut short by the weather .
the picture carries the jaunty caption : " rain out of a clear blue sky . "
many of the pictures were taken when auschwitz 's gas chambers and crematoriums were operating at and above capacity as hungarian jews were being deported to auschwitz , the museum said .
carefree moments during the holocaust on the same day hoecker passed out blueberries to the female auxiliaries on the fence , 150 prisoners arrived on a transport to auschwitz .
the ss chose 21 men and 12 women for work , then killed the others in the gas chambers , the museum said .
when hoecker lit the christmas tree in december 1944 , soviet troops were advancing westward through what is modern poland and the camp 's liberation was just weeks away .
museum officials say the album is only the second known collection of photographs taken at auschwitz .
the album was recently donated by a retired us army intelligence officer who found it in an abandoned frankfurt apartment in 1946 , the year after world war ii ended .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz was liberated in early 1945 the nazis abandoned auschwitz in january 1945 and hoecker joined auschwitz commander richard baer in fleeing to germany .
after the third reich surrendered in may 1945 , he returned to his job at a small-town bank .
as post-war west germany increasingly confronted the nazi past , hoecker was convicted in 1965 of the murder of thousands of auschwitz inmates and served five years in prison .
he died in 2000 at age 88 in germany , according to the museum . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's nipping at lufthansa , but still lags way behind germany 's largest airline .
within one year , air berlin , europe 's third largest low-cost airline , has greatly expanded its route system by acquiring dba , a domestic carrier , and ltu , which operates charter and scheduled flights from düsseldorf to far flung destinations in the americas , asia and africa . then on thursday , sept .
20 , air berlin announced its expansion drive to take over condor , a rival charter airline which offers long haul flights from major german cities to popular holiday destinations worldwide .
different brands for different markets air berlin is also aggressively undercutting lufthansa by offering one-way service from düsseldorf to new york at 129 euros -lrb- $ 182 -rrb- starting in november .
lufthansa 's lowest fare on the same route is currently 333 euros roundtrip .
a fresh coat of paint with the air berlin logo will appear on refurbished ltu jets heading to lucrative business destinations such as new york , los angeles and shanghai , in keeping with the company 's tradition of serving european capitals and major cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin eyes business destinations such as new york the ltu brand , however , will also remain , as it is already established moniker for holiday spots such as montego bay and the canary islands , company spokeswoman angelika schwaff said .
from budge to business class founded in 1978 by a former pan am pilot in the then divided german capital , air berlin started as a budget charter airline with two jets .
it was bought by german investors after reunification and is now the 10th largest air carrier in europe , which has been floated publicly since spring of 2006 .
the acquisition of condor , which is subject to approval from the german cartel office , would expand the air berlin group 's fleet by 35 jets to a total of 166 aircraft with another 25 wide-body boeing 787 dreamliners on order .
unlike its chief low-cost european no-frills rivals easyjet and ryanair , air berlin is more upscale and is cleverly targeting the traditional lufthansa customer in the business segment of the market , according to martina noss , an analyst who follows the german travel industry for norddeutsche landesbank . " they will be offering premium business class with more service and comfort , and will be able to use their vast domestic network from dba to feed into the long-haul ltu flights , " noss said .
" it 's a smart move to focus on the much more profitable business segment . "
but it will take time to streamline the three very different airlines that serve nearly 100 - sometimes overlapping - destinations , she added .
still the air berlin group , which carried nearly 20 million passengers last year , is valued at 854 million euros on the stock exchange and is a distant second to german behemoth lufthansa .
one of europe 's largest airlines , lufthansa has a market capitalization of 9.5 billion euros , and carried 53.4 million passengers in 2006 .
condor : the last mile for ltu 's long hauls the addition of condor , which offers a popular and exotic array of holiday destinations , would complement ltu 's long-haul flight network , air berlin ceo joachim hunold said at a press conference on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condor routes should complement the overseas network the charter airline would be purchased in two phases .
in february 2009 , air berlin would acquire a 75.1 percent of condor in a share swap with british-german travel group thomas cook , which will hold just under 30 percent of air berlin .
the deal is expected to be worth over 500 million euros , depending on the airline 's stock price in the next 17 months .
the second phase would come a year later when air berlin would exercise purchase options to acquire the remaining 24.9 percent stake in condor from lufthansa .
airline analysts said they did not expect lufthansa to oppose the deal since air berlin , even with condor , would not pose a significant threat to its core business .
segment specific air berlin is a prime example of increasing consolidation in the airline industry , where most major carriers are offering a bit of everything tailored to all market segments , according to eric heymann , an aviation and transport analyst at deutsche bank 's research group .
" there 's hardly any airline which offers only scheduled services or any purely low-cost charter airline anymore , " he said .
" various business models are converging , with airline companies offering a broad range of services for all types of travelers . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" after some brothers and sisters were arrested -lrb- may allah free them -rrb- and the forum and blog of the gimf were removed , we say this : the gimf still exists and will continue its work , " a statement from the front republished by reuters said .
" to the kuffar -lrb- infidels -rrb- who try to fight us , we say : you can do what you like , make as many arrests as you like ... you will not reach your goal , " the statement continued .

the reappearance of the german-language site comes at a time when the authorities in germany are on their highest alert after three men were arrested earlier this month over an alleged plot to commit " massive bomb attacks " against us interests in the country .
one of the new german gimf sites contains several online responses .
one , allegedly from a student in germany , read : " brothers , i would like to be in contact with you because i want to become a mujahedeen -lrb- warrior -rrb- after i finish my studies , inshaallah -lrb- god willing -rrb- . "
investigators said it was impossible to say whether the comment was genuine , but the german authorities have expressed great concern that the message of radical groups affiliated or sympathetic to al qaeda is now being broadcast in german .
the increase in number and the speed of these german-language sites in getting established is creating a new and difficult front for anti-terror organizations .
the gimf material was located via search engines and would have been accessible to anyone with allegiances to islamist terror groups .

it 's nipping at lufthansa , but still lags way behind germany 's largest airline .
within one year , air berlin , europe 's third largest low-cost airline , has greatly expanded its route system by acquiring dba , a domestic carrier , and ltu , which operates charter and scheduled flights from düsseldorf to far flung destinations in the americas , asia and africa . then on thursday , sept .
20 , air berlin announced its expansion drive to take over condor , a rival charter airline which offers long haul flights from major german cities to popular holiday destinations worldwide .
different brands for different markets air berlin is also aggressively undercutting lufthansa by offering one-way service from düsseldorf to new york at 129 euros -lrb- $ 182 -rrb- starting in november .
lufthansa 's lowest fare on the same route is currently 333 euros roundtrip .
a fresh coat of paint with the air berlin logo will appear on refurbished ltu jets heading to lucrative business destinations such as new york , los angeles and shanghai , in keeping with the company 's tradition of serving european capitals and major cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin eyes business destinations such as new york the ltu brand , however , will also remain , as it is already established moniker for holiday spots such as montego bay and the canary islands , company spokeswoman angelika schwaff said .
from budge to business class founded in 1978 by a former pan am pilot in the then divided german capital , air berlin started as a budget charter airline with two jets .
it was bought by german investors after reunification and is now the 10th largest air carrier in europe , which has been floated publicly since spring of 2006 .
the acquisition of condor , which is subject to approval from the german cartel office , would expand the air berlin group 's fleet by 35 jets to a total of 166 aircraft with another 25 wide-body boeing 787 dreamliners on order .
unlike its chief low-cost european no-frills rivals easyjet and ryanair , air berlin is more upscale and is cleverly targeting the traditional lufthansa customer in the business segment of the market , according to martina noss , an analyst who follows the german travel industry for norddeutsche landesbank . " they will be offering premium business class with more service and comfort , and will be able to use their vast domestic network from dba to feed into the long-haul ltu flights , " noss said .

the deal is expected to be worth over 500 million euros , depending on the airline 's stock price in the next 17 months .
the second phase would come a year later when air berlin would exercise purchase options to acquire the remaining 24.9 percent stake in condor from lufthansa .

in february 2009 , air berlin would acquire a 75.1 percent of condor in a share swap with british-german travel group thomas cook , which will hold just under 30 percent of air berlin .
the deal is expected to be worth over 500 million euros , depending on the airline 's stock price in the next 17 months .
the second phase would come a year later when air berlin would exercise purchase options to acquire the remaining 24.9 percent stake in condor from lufthansa .
airline analysts said they did not expect lufthansa to oppose the deal since air berlin , even with condor , would not pose a significant threat to its core business .
segment specific air berlin is a prime example of increasing consolidation in the airline industry , where most major carriers are offering a bit of everything tailored to all market segments , according to eric heymann , an aviation and transport analyst at deutsche bank 's research group .
" there 's hardly any airline which offers only scheduled services or any purely low-cost charter airline anymore , " he said .
" various business models are converging , with airline companies offering a broad range of services for all types of travelers . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 22.09.2007 takeovers enable air berlin to expand rapidly overseas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ltu 's international routes enabled air berlin to enter the long-haul market air berlin 's latest move to buy the charter airline condor complements its acquisition of two other german carriers with an extensive network of domestic and international routes that compete with lufthansa . air berlin has squashed rumors of being a takeover candidate by going on a buying spree , gobbling up two german rivals - and eying a third .
it 's nipping at lufthansa , but still lags way behind germany 's largest airline .
within one year , air berlin , europe 's third largest low-cost airline , has greatly expanded its route system by acquiring dba , a domestic carrier , and ltu , which operates charter and scheduled flights from düsseldorf to far flung destinations in the americas , asia and africa . then on thursday , sept .
20 , air berlin announced its expansion drive to take over condor , a rival charter airline which offers long haul flights from major german cities to popular holiday destinations worldwide .
different brands for different markets air berlin is also aggressively undercutting lufthansa by offering one-way service from düsseldorf to new york at 129 euros -lrb- $ 182 -rrb- starting in november .
lufthansa 's lowest fare on the same route is currently 333 euros roundtrip .
a fresh coat of paint with the air berlin logo will appear on refurbished ltu jets heading to lucrative business destinations such as new york , los angeles and shanghai , in keeping with the company 's tradition of serving european capitals and major cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin eyes business destinations such as new york the ltu brand , however , will also remain , as it is already established moniker for holiday spots such as montego bay and the canary islands , company spokeswoman angelika schwaff said .
from budge to business class founded in 1978 by a former pan am pilot in the then divided german capital , air berlin started as a budget charter airline with two jets .
it was bought by german investors after reunification and is now the 10th largest air carrier in europe , which has been floated publicly since spring of 2006 .
the acquisition of condor , which is subject to approval from the german cartel office , would expand the air berlin group 's fleet by 35 jets to a total of 166 aircraft with another 25 wide-body boeing 787 dreamliners on order .
unlike its chief low-cost european no-frills rivals easyjet and ryanair , air berlin is more upscale and is cleverly targeting the traditional lufthansa customer in the business segment of the market , according to martina noss , an analyst who follows the german travel industry for norddeutsche landesbank . " they will be offering premium business class with more service and comfort , and will be able to use their vast domestic network from dba to feed into the long-haul ltu flights , " noss said .
" it 's a smart move to focus on the much more profitable business segment . "
but it will take time to streamline the three very different airlines that serve nearly 100 - sometimes overlapping - destinations , she added .
still the air berlin group , which carried nearly 20 million passengers last year , is valued at 854 million euros on the stock exchange and is a distant second to german behemoth lufthansa .
one of europe 's largest airlines , lufthansa has a market capitalization of 9.5 billion euros , and carried 53.4 million passengers in 2006 .
condor : the last mile for ltu 's long hauls the addition of condor , which offers a popular and exotic array of holiday destinations , would complement ltu 's long-haul flight network , air berlin ceo joachim hunold said at a press conference on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condor routes should complement the overseas network the charter airline would be purchased in two phases .
in february 2009 , air berlin would acquire a 75.1 percent of condor in a share swap with british-german travel group thomas cook , which will hold just under 30 percent of air berlin .
the deal is expected to be worth over 500 million euros , depending on the airline 's stock price in the next 17 months .
the second phase would come a year later when air berlin would exercise purchase options to acquire the remaining 24.9 percent stake in condor from lufthansa .
airline analysts said they did not expect lufthansa to oppose the deal since air berlin , even with condor , would not pose a significant threat to its core business .
segment specific air berlin is a prime example of increasing consolidation in the airline industry , where most major carriers are offering a bit of everything tailored to all market segments , according to eric heymann , an aviation and transport analyst at deutsche bank 's research group .
" there 's hardly any airline which offers only scheduled services or any purely low-cost charter airline anymore , " he said .
" various business models are converging , with airline companies offering a broad range of services for all types of travelers . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's nipping at lufthansa , but still lags way behind germany 's largest airline .
within one year , air berlin , europe 's third largest low-cost airline , has greatly expanded its route system by acquiring dba , a domestic carrier , and ltu , which operates charter and scheduled flights from düsseldorf to far flung destinations in the americas , asia and africa . then on thursday , sept .
20 , air berlin announced its expansion drive to take over condor , a rival charter airline which offers long haul flights from major german cities to popular holiday destinations worldwide .
different brands for different markets air berlin is also aggressively undercutting lufthansa by offering one-way service from düsseldorf to new york at 129 euros -lrb- $ 182 -rrb- starting in november .
lufthansa 's lowest fare on the same route is currently 333 euros roundtrip .
a fresh coat of paint with the air berlin logo will appear on refurbished ltu jets heading to lucrative business destinations such as new york , los angeles and shanghai , in keeping with the company 's tradition of serving european capitals and major cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin eyes business destinations such as new york the ltu brand , however , will also remain , as it is already established moniker for holiday spots such as montego bay and the canary islands , company spokeswoman angelika schwaff said .
from budge to business class founded in 1978 by a former pan am pilot in the then divided german capital , air berlin started as a budget charter airline with two jets .
it was bought by german investors after reunification and is now the 10th largest air carrier in europe , which has been floated publicly since spring of 2006 .
the acquisition of condor , which is subject to approval from the german cartel office , would expand the air berlin group 's fleet by 35 jets to a total of 166 aircraft with another 25 wide-body boeing 787 dreamliners on order .
unlike its chief low-cost european no-frills rivals easyjet and ryanair , air berlin is more upscale and is cleverly targeting the traditional lufthansa customer in the business segment of the market , according to martina noss , an analyst who follows the german travel industry for norddeutsche landesbank . " they will be offering premium business class with more service and comfort , and will be able to use their vast domestic network from dba to feed into the long-haul ltu flights , " noss said .
" it 's a smart move to focus on the much more profitable business segment . "
but it will take time to streamline the three very different airlines that serve nearly 100 - sometimes overlapping - destinations , she added .
still the air berlin group , which carried nearly 20 million passengers last year , is valued at 854 million euros on the stock exchange and is a distant second to german behemoth lufthansa .
one of europe 's largest airlines , lufthansa has a market capitalization of 9.5 billion euros , and carried 53.4 million passengers in 2006 .
condor : the last mile for ltu 's long hauls the addition of condor , which offers a popular and exotic array of holiday destinations , would complement ltu 's long-haul flight network , air berlin ceo joachim hunold said at a press conference on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condor routes should complement the overseas network the charter airline would be purchased in two phases .
in february 2009 , air berlin would acquire a 75.1 percent of condor in a share swap with british-german travel group thomas cook , which will hold just under 30 percent of air berlin .
the deal is expected to be worth over 500 million euros , depending on the airline 's stock price in the next 17 months .
the second phase would come a year later when air berlin would exercise purchase options to acquire the remaining 24.9 percent stake in condor from lufthansa .
airline analysts said they did not expect lufthansa to oppose the deal since air berlin , even with condor , would not pose a significant threat to its core business .
segment specific air berlin is a prime example of increasing consolidation in the airline industry , where most major carriers are offering a bit of everything tailored to all market segments , according to eric heymann , an aviation and transport analyst at deutsche bank 's research group .

it 's nipping at lufthansa , but still lags way behind germany 's largest airline .
within one year , air berlin , europe 's third largest low-cost airline , has greatly expanded its route system by acquiring dba , a domestic carrier , and ltu , which operates charter and scheduled flights from düsseldorf to far flung destinations in the americas , asia and africa . then on thursday , sept .
20 , air berlin announced its expansion drive to take over condor , a rival charter airline which offers long haul flights from major german cities to popular holiday destinations worldwide .
different brands for different markets air berlin is also aggressively undercutting lufthansa by offering one-way service from düsseldorf to new york at 129 euros -lrb- $ 182 -rrb- starting in november .
lufthansa 's lowest fare on the same route is currently 333 euros roundtrip .
a fresh coat of paint with the air berlin logo will appear on refurbished ltu jets heading to lucrative business destinations such as new york , los angeles and shanghai , in keeping with the company 's tradition of serving european capitals and major cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin eyes business destinations such as new york the ltu brand , however , will also remain , as it is already established moniker for holiday spots such as montego bay and the canary islands , company spokeswoman angelika schwaff said .
from budge to business class founded in 1978 by a former pan am pilot in the then divided german capital , air berlin started as a budget charter airline with two jets .
it was bought by german investors after reunification and is now the 10th largest air carrier in europe , which has been floated publicly since spring of 2006 .
the acquisition of condor , which is subject to approval from the german cartel office , would expand the air berlin group 's fleet by 35 jets to a total of 166 aircraft with another 25 wide-body boeing 787 dreamliners on order .
unlike its chief low-cost european no-frills rivals easyjet and ryanair , air berlin is more upscale and is cleverly targeting the traditional lufthansa customer in the business segment of the market , according to martina noss , an analyst who follows the german travel industry for norddeutsche landesbank . " they will be offering premium business class with more service and comfort , and will be able to use their vast domestic network from dba to feed into the long-haul ltu flights , " noss said .
" it 's a smart move to focus on the much more profitable business segment . "
but it will take time to streamline the three very different airlines that serve nearly 100 - sometimes overlapping - destinations , she added .
still the air berlin group , which carried nearly 20 million passengers last year , is valued at 854 million euros on the stock exchange and is a distant second to german behemoth lufthansa .
one of europe 's largest airlines , lufthansa has a market capitalization of 9.5 billion euros , and carried 53.4 million passengers in 2006 .
condor : the last mile for ltu 's long hauls the addition of condor , which offers a popular and exotic array of holiday destinations , would complement ltu 's long-haul flight network , air berlin ceo joachim hunold said at a press conference on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condor routes should complement the overseas network the charter airline would be purchased in two phases .
in february 2009 , air berlin would acquire a 75.1 percent of condor in a share swap with british-german travel group thomas cook , which will hold just under 30 percent of air berlin .
the deal is expected to be worth over 500 million euros , depending on the airline 's stock price in the next 17 months .
the second phase would come a year later when air berlin would exercise purchase options to acquire the remaining 24.9 percent stake in condor from lufthansa .
airline analysts said they did not expect lufthansa to oppose the deal since air berlin , even with condor , would not pose a significant threat to its core business .
segment specific air berlin is a prime example of increasing consolidation in the airline industry , where most major carriers are offering a bit of everything tailored to all market segments , according to eric heymann , an aviation and transport analyst at deutsche bank 's research group .
" there 's hardly any airline which offers only scheduled services or any purely low-cost charter airline anymore , " he said .
" various business models are converging , with airline companies offering a broad range of services for all types of travelers . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ss officer karl hoecker 's album also includes rare photos at auschwitz of josef mengele , the nazi doctor known as the " angel of death " who conducted gruesome experiments on camp inmates in the name of medicine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef mengele features in some of the auschwitz photos the photos give a rare glimpse of some of the men who ran auschwitz , enjoying time off and evidently disconnected from the horror in which more than one million nazi prisoners died .
" it 's hard to fathom the kind of people who ran these camps , " museum director sara bloomfield said .
" these unique photographs vividly illustrate the contented world they enjoyed while overseeing a world of unimaginable suffering . "
nazis seen relaxing as if on holiday hoecker , the adjutant to the death camp 's commander from may 1944 until its evacuation in january 1945 , catalogues his stay at the most notorious nazi killing site in much the same way as someone might present memories of a trip to a holiday idyll .

in one photo , hoecker is shown laughing , flanked by young women and an accordion player , as their sing-along on a bridge is apparently cut short by the weather .
the picture carries the jaunty caption : " rain out of a clear blue sky . "
many of the pictures were taken when auschwitz 's gas chambers and crematoriums were operating at and above capacity as hungarian jews were being deported to auschwitz , the museum said .
carefree moments during the holocaust on the same day hoecker passed out blueberries to the female auxiliaries on the fence , 150 prisoners arrived on a transport to auschwitz .
the ss chose 21 men and 12 women for work , then killed the others in the gas chambers , the museum said .
when hoecker lit the christmas tree in december 1944 , soviet troops were advancing westward through what is modern poland and the camp 's liberation was just weeks away .
museum officials say the album is only the second known collection of photographs taken at auschwitz .
the album was recently donated by a retired us army intelligence officer who found it in an abandoned frankfurt apartment in 1946 , the year after world war ii ended .

" after some brothers and sisters were arrested -lrb- may allah free them -rrb- and the forum and blog of the gimf were removed , we say this : the gimf still exists and will continue its work , " a statement from the front republished by reuters said .
" to the kuffar -lrb- infidels -rrb- who try to fight us , we say : you can do what you like , make as many arrests as you like ... you will not reach your goal , " the statement continued .
" we will always keep going until we achieve victory or martyrdom . "
hunting down and shutting off radical islamist web sites is extremely difficult .
most times , the web sites relocate within minutes of being identified , showing up at new internet addresses .
taking down islamist sites a difficult job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorists use the web to recruit for future attacks " this can be done in minutes , " said harald summa , chief executive of eco , an association of german internet enterprises .
" it can be automated .
you will never catch it .
once you try to hit it , it 's already at another destination , another point . "
the reappearance of the german-language site comes at a time when the authorities in germany are on their highest alert after three men were arrested earlier this month over an alleged plot to commit " massive bomb attacks " against us interests in the country .
one of the new german gimf sites contains several online responses .
one , allegedly from a student in germany , read : " brothers , i would like to be in contact with you because i want to become a mujahedeen -lrb- warrior -rrb- after i finish my studies , inshaallah -lrb- god willing -rrb- . "
investigators said it was impossible to say whether the comment was genuine , but the german authorities have expressed great concern that the message of radical groups affiliated or sympathetic to al qaeda is now being broadcast in german .
the increase in number and the speed of these german-language sites in getting established is creating a new and difficult front for anti-terror organizations .
the gimf material was located via search engines and would have been accessible to anyone with allegiances to islamist terror groups .
germany , austria on alert after terror arrests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german anti-terror units swooped to prevent massive attacks the arrest of a suspect connected to the gimf in austria also highlights again the struggle the austrian authorities are currently engaged in with extremists in their own country .
in an unconnected operation a week after the german arrests , austrian police captured three people with alleged al qaeda links who are suspected of posting a video last march threatening attacks against germany and austria .
use of the internet for spreading propaganda and recruiting potential terrorists was an issue at this year 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in heiligendamm in germany .
the g8 leaders vowed to work together to combat " terrorist and criminal abuse " of modern communications technology in june .
meanwhile , the european union 's justice and security commissioner franco frattini is due to present proposals next month to block access to web sites that contain instructions for bomb-making in another attempt to disarm the terrorists of their latest weapon .
his plan is similar to one presented this week by german justice minister brigitte zypries .
her ministry proposed legislation that , if passed by parliament , would make the preparation of terrorist acts , as well as the instruction of such actions , a criminal offence .
if convicted , offenders would face up to 10 years in prison . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ss officer karl hoecker 's album also includes rare photos at auschwitz of josef mengele , the nazi doctor known as the " angel of death " who conducted gruesome experiments on camp inmates in the name of medicine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef mengele features in some of the auschwitz photos the photos give a rare glimpse of some of the men who ran auschwitz , enjoying time off and evidently disconnected from the horror in which more than one million nazi prisoners died .
" it 's hard to fathom the kind of people who ran these camps , " museum director sara bloomfield said .
" these unique photographs vividly illustrate the contented world they enjoyed while overseeing a world of unimaginable suffering . "
nazis seen relaxing as if on holiday hoecker , the adjutant to the death camp 's commander from may 1944 until its evacuation in january 1945 , catalogues his stay at the most notorious nazi killing site in much the same way as someone might present memories of a trip to a holiday idyll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those in the pictures seem oblivious to the horrors nearby he is seen lighting a candle on a christmas tree , petting his favourite german shepherd and passing out blueberries to young german women sitting on a fence .
other camp leaders and nazi officials also appear in the images .
in one photo , hoecker is shown laughing , flanked by young women and an accordion player , as their sing-along on a bridge is apparently cut short by the weather .
the picture carries the jaunty caption : " rain out of a clear blue sky . "
many of the pictures were taken when auschwitz 's gas chambers and crematoriums were operating at and above capacity as hungarian jews were being deported to auschwitz , the museum said .
carefree moments during the holocaust on the same day hoecker passed out blueberries to the female auxiliaries on the fence , 150 prisoners arrived on a transport to auschwitz .
the ss chose 21 men and 12 women for work , then killed the others in the gas chambers , the museum said .
when hoecker lit the christmas tree in december 1944 , soviet troops were advancing westward through what is modern poland and the camp 's liberation was just weeks away .
museum officials say the album is only the second known collection of photographs taken at auschwitz .
the album was recently donated by a retired us army intelligence officer who found it in an abandoned frankfurt apartment in 1946 , the year after world war ii ended .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz was liberated in early 1945 the nazis abandoned auschwitz in january 1945 and hoecker joined auschwitz commander richard baer in fleeing to germany .
after the third reich surrendered in may 1945 , he returned to his job at a small-town bank .
as post-war west germany increasingly confronted the nazi past , hoecker was convicted in 1965 of the murder of thousands of auschwitz inmates and served five years in prison .
he died in 2000 at age 88 in germany , according to the museum . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's nipping at lufthansa , but still lags way behind germany 's largest airline .
within one year , air berlin , europe 's third largest low-cost airline , has greatly expanded its route system by acquiring dba , a domestic carrier , and ltu , which operates charter and scheduled flights from düsseldorf to far flung destinations in the americas , asia and africa . then on thursday , sept .
20 , air berlin announced its expansion drive to take over condor , a rival charter airline which offers long haul flights from major german cities to popular holiday destinations worldwide .
different brands for different markets air berlin is also aggressively undercutting lufthansa by offering one-way service from düsseldorf to new york at 129 euros -lrb- $ 182 -rrb- starting in november .
lufthansa 's lowest fare on the same route is currently 333 euros roundtrip .
a fresh coat of paint with the air berlin logo will appear on refurbished ltu jets heading to lucrative business destinations such as new york , los angeles and shanghai , in keeping with the company 's tradition of serving european capitals and major cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin eyes business destinations such as new york the ltu brand , however , will also remain , as it is already established moniker for holiday spots such as montego bay and the canary islands , company spokeswoman angelika schwaff said .
from budge to business class founded in 1978 by a former pan am pilot in the then divided german capital , air berlin started as a budget charter airline with two jets .
it was bought by german investors after reunification and is now the 10th largest air carrier in europe , which has been floated publicly since spring of 2006 .
the acquisition of condor , which is subject to approval from the german cartel office , would expand the air berlin group 's fleet by 35 jets to a total of 166 aircraft with another 25 wide-body boeing 787 dreamliners on order .
unlike its chief low-cost european no-frills rivals easyjet and ryanair , air berlin is more upscale and is cleverly targeting the traditional lufthansa customer in the business segment of the market , according to martina noss , an analyst who follows the german travel industry for norddeutsche landesbank . " they will be offering premium business class with more service and comfort , and will be able to use their vast domestic network from dba to feed into the long-haul ltu flights , " noss said .
" it 's a smart move to focus on the much more profitable business segment . "
but it will take time to streamline the three very different airlines that serve nearly 100 - sometimes overlapping - destinations , she added .
still the air berlin group , which carried nearly 20 million passengers last year , is valued at 854 million euros on the stock exchange and is a distant second to german behemoth lufthansa .
one of europe 's largest airlines , lufthansa has a market capitalization of 9.5 billion euros , and carried 53.4 million passengers in 2006 .
condor : the last mile for ltu 's long hauls the addition of condor , which offers a popular and exotic array of holiday destinations , would complement ltu 's long-haul flight network , air berlin ceo joachim hunold said at a press conference on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condor routes should complement the overseas network the charter airline would be purchased in two phases .
in february 2009 , air berlin would acquire a 75.1 percent of condor in a share swap with british-german travel group thomas cook , which will hold just under 30 percent of air berlin .
the deal is expected to be worth over 500 million euros , depending on the airline 's stock price in the next 17 months .
the second phase would come a year later when air berlin would exercise purchase options to acquire the remaining 24.9 percent stake in condor from lufthansa .
airline analysts said they did not expect lufthansa to oppose the deal since air berlin , even with condor , would not pose a significant threat to its core business .
segment specific air berlin is a prime example of increasing consolidation in the airline industry , where most major carriers are offering a bit of everything tailored to all market segments , according to eric heymann , an aviation and transport analyst at deutsche bank 's research group .
" there 's hardly any airline which offers only scheduled services or any purely low-cost charter airline anymore , " he said .
" various business models are converging , with airline companies offering a broad range of services for all types of travelers . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's nipping at lufthansa , but still lags way behind germany 's largest airline .
within one year , air berlin , europe 's third largest low-cost airline , has greatly expanded its route system by acquiring dba , a domestic carrier , and ltu , which operates charter and scheduled flights from düsseldorf to far flung destinations in the americas , asia and africa . then on thursday , sept .
20 , air berlin announced its expansion drive to take over condor , a rival charter airline which offers long haul flights from major german cities to popular holiday destinations worldwide .
different brands for different markets air berlin is also aggressively undercutting lufthansa by offering one-way service from düsseldorf to new york at 129 euros -lrb- $ 182 -rrb- starting in november .
lufthansa 's lowest fare on the same route is currently 333 euros roundtrip .
a fresh coat of paint with the air berlin logo will appear on refurbished ltu jets heading to lucrative business destinations such as new york , los angeles and shanghai , in keeping with the company 's tradition of serving european capitals and major cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin eyes business destinations such as new york the ltu brand , however , will also remain , as it is already established moniker for holiday spots such as montego bay and the canary islands , company spokeswoman angelika schwaff said .
from budge to business class founded in 1978 by a former pan am pilot in the then divided german capital , air berlin started as a budget charter airline with two jets .
it was bought by german investors after reunification and is now the 10th largest air carrier in europe , which has been floated publicly since spring of 2006 .
the acquisition of condor , which is subject to approval from the german cartel office , would expand the air berlin group 's fleet by 35 jets to a total of 166 aircraft with another 25 wide-body boeing 787 dreamliners on order .
unlike its chief low-cost european no-frills rivals easyjet and ryanair , air berlin is more upscale and is cleverly targeting the traditional lufthansa customer in the business segment of the market , according to martina noss , an analyst who follows the german travel industry for norddeutsche landesbank . " they will be offering premium business class with more service and comfort , and will be able to use their vast domestic network from dba to feed into the long-haul ltu flights , " noss said .
" it 's a smart move to focus on the much more profitable business segment . "
but it will take time to streamline the three very different airlines that serve nearly 100 - sometimes overlapping - destinations , she added .
still the air berlin group , which carried nearly 20 million passengers last year , is valued at 854 million euros on the stock exchange and is a distant second to german behemoth lufthansa .
one of europe 's largest airlines , lufthansa has a market capitalization of 9.5 billion euros , and carried 53.4 million passengers in 2006 .
condor : the last mile for ltu 's long hauls the addition of condor , which offers a popular and exotic array of holiday destinations , would complement ltu 's long-haul flight network , air berlin ceo joachim hunold said at a press conference on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condor routes should complement the overseas network the charter airline would be purchased in two phases .
in february 2009 , air berlin would acquire a 75.1 percent of condor in a share swap with british-german travel group thomas cook , which will hold just under 30 percent of air berlin .
the deal is expected to be worth over 500 million euros , depending on the airline 's stock price in the next 17 months .
the second phase would come a year later when air berlin would exercise purchase options to acquire the remaining 24.9 percent stake in condor from lufthansa .
airline analysts said they did not expect lufthansa to oppose the deal since air berlin , even with condor , would not pose a significant threat to its core business .
segment specific air berlin is a prime example of increasing consolidation in the airline industry , where most major carriers are offering a bit of everything tailored to all market segments , according to eric heymann , an aviation and transport analyst at deutsche bank 's research group .
" there 's hardly any airline which offers only scheduled services or any purely low-cost charter airline anymore , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 22.09.2007 german al qaeda mouthpiece resurfaces online despite arrests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : links to al qaeda videos and calls for recruits were published online by the gimf despite the best efforts of security authorities on both sides of the atlantic , a german-language mouthpiece for al qaeda has resurfaced on the web a week after suspects linked to it were arrested in austria and canada . the " global islamic media front " -lrb- gimf -rrb- , which has been attempting to recruit volunteer translators on the internet as well as posting al qaeda videos , vowed to defy the authorities trying to track it down .
" after some brothers and sisters were arrested -lrb- may allah free them -rrb- and the forum and blog of the gimf were removed , we say this : the gimf still exists and will continue its work , " a statement from the front republished by reuters said .
" to the kuffar -lrb- infidels -rrb- who try to fight us , we say : you can do what you like , make as many arrests as you like ... you will not reach your goal , " the statement continued .
" we will always keep going until we achieve victory or martyrdom . "
hunting down and shutting off radical islamist web sites is extremely difficult .
most times , the web sites relocate within minutes of being identified , showing up at new internet addresses .
taking down islamist sites a difficult job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorists use the web to recruit for future attacks " this can be done in minutes , " said harald summa , chief executive of eco , an association of german internet enterprises .
" it can be automated .
you will never catch it .
once you try to hit it , it 's already at another destination , another point . "
the reappearance of the german-language site comes at a time when the authorities in germany are on their highest alert after three men were arrested earlier this month over an alleged plot to commit " massive bomb attacks " against us interests in the country .
one of the new german gimf sites contains several online responses .
one , allegedly from a student in germany , read : " brothers , i would like to be in contact with you because i want to become a mujahedeen -lrb- warrior -rrb- after i finish my studies , inshaallah -lrb- god willing -rrb- . "
investigators said it was impossible to say whether the comment was genuine , but the german authorities have expressed great concern that the message of radical groups affiliated or sympathetic to al qaeda is now being broadcast in german .
the increase in number and the speed of these german-language sites in getting established is creating a new and difficult front for anti-terror organizations .
the gimf material was located via search engines and would have been accessible to anyone with allegiances to islamist terror groups .
germany , austria on alert after terror arrests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german anti-terror units swooped to prevent massive attacks the arrest of a suspect connected to the gimf in austria also highlights again the struggle the austrian authorities are currently engaged in with extremists in their own country .
in an unconnected operation a week after the german arrests , austrian police captured three people with alleged al qaeda links who are suspected of posting a video last march threatening attacks against germany and austria .
use of the internet for spreading propaganda and recruiting potential terrorists was an issue at this year 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in heiligendamm in germany .
the g8 leaders vowed to work together to combat " terrorist and criminal abuse " of modern communications technology in june .
meanwhile , the european union 's justice and security commissioner franco frattini is due to present proposals next month to block access to web sites that contain instructions for bomb-making in another attempt to disarm the terrorists of their latest weapon .
his plan is similar to one presented this week by german justice minister brigitte zypries .
her ministry proposed legislation that , if passed by parliament , would make the preparation of terrorist acts , as well as the instruction of such actions , a criminal offence .
if convicted , offenders would face up to 10 years in prison . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

different brands for different markets air berlin is also aggressively undercutting lufthansa by offering one-way service from düsseldorf to new york at 129 euros -lrb- $ 182 -rrb- starting in november .
lufthansa 's lowest fare on the same route is currently 333 euros roundtrip .
a fresh coat of paint with the air berlin logo will appear on refurbished ltu jets heading to lucrative business destinations such as new york , los angeles and shanghai , in keeping with the company 's tradition of serving european capitals and major cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin eyes business destinations such as new york the ltu brand , however , will also remain , as it is already established moniker for holiday spots such as montego bay and the canary islands , company spokeswoman angelika schwaff said .
from budge to business class founded in 1978 by a former pan am pilot in the then divided german capital , air berlin started as a budget charter airline with two jets .
it was bought by german investors after reunification and is now the 10th largest air carrier in europe , which has been floated publicly since spring of 2006 .
the acquisition of condor , which is subject to approval from the german cartel office , would expand the air berlin group 's fleet by 35 jets to a total of 166 aircraft with another 25 wide-body boeing 787 dreamliners on order .
unlike its chief low-cost european no-frills rivals easyjet and ryanair , air berlin is more upscale and is cleverly targeting the traditional lufthansa customer in the business segment of the market , according to martina noss , an analyst who follows the german travel industry for norddeutsche landesbank . " they will be offering premium business class with more service and comfort , and will be able to use their vast domestic network from dba to feed into the long-haul ltu flights , " noss said .
" it 's a smart move to focus on the much more profitable business segment . "
but it will take time to streamline the three very different airlines that serve nearly 100 - sometimes overlapping - destinations , she added .
still the air berlin group , which carried nearly 20 million passengers last year , is valued at 854 million euros on the stock exchange and is a distant second to german behemoth lufthansa .
one of europe 's largest airlines , lufthansa has a market capitalization of 9.5 billion euros , and carried 53.4 million passengers in 2006 .
condor : the last mile for ltu 's long hauls the addition of condor , which offers a popular and exotic array of holiday destinations , would complement ltu 's long-haul flight network , air berlin ceo joachim hunold said at a press conference on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condor routes should complement the overseas network the charter airline would be purchased in two phases .
in february 2009 , air berlin would acquire a 75.1 percent of condor in a share swap with british-german travel group thomas cook , which will hold just under 30 percent of air berlin .
the deal is expected to be worth over 500 million euros , depending on the airline 's stock price in the next 17 months .
the second phase would come a year later when air berlin would exercise purchase options to acquire the remaining 24.9 percent stake in condor from lufthansa .
airline analysts said they did not expect lufthansa to oppose the deal since air berlin , even with condor , would not pose a significant threat to its core business .
segment specific air berlin is a prime example of increasing consolidation in the airline industry , where most major carriers are offering a bit of everything tailored to all market segments , according to eric heymann , an aviation and transport analyst at deutsche bank 's research group .
" there 's hardly any airline which offers only scheduled services or any purely low-cost charter airline anymore , " he said .

it 's nipping at lufthansa , but still lags way behind germany 's largest airline .
within one year , air berlin , europe 's third largest low-cost airline , has greatly expanded its route system by acquiring dba , a domestic carrier , and ltu , which operates charter and scheduled flights from düsseldorf to far flung destinations in the americas , asia and africa . then on thursday , sept .
20 , air berlin announced its expansion drive to take over condor , a rival charter airline which offers long haul flights from major german cities to popular holiday destinations worldwide .
different brands for different markets air berlin is also aggressively undercutting lufthansa by offering one-way service from düsseldorf to new york at 129 euros -lrb- $ 182 -rrb- starting in november .
lufthansa 's lowest fare on the same route is currently 333 euros roundtrip .
a fresh coat of paint with the air berlin logo will appear on refurbished ltu jets heading to lucrative business destinations such as new york , los angeles and shanghai , in keeping with the company 's tradition of serving european capitals and major cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin eyes business destinations such as new york the ltu brand , however , will also remain , as it is already established moniker for holiday spots such as montego bay and the canary islands , company spokeswoman angelika schwaff said .
from budge to business class founded in 1978 by a former pan am pilot in the then divided german capital , air berlin started as a budget charter airline with two jets .
it was bought by german investors after reunification and is now the 10th largest air carrier in europe , which has been floated publicly since spring of 2006 .
the acquisition of condor , which is subject to approval from the german cartel office , would expand the air berlin group 's fleet by 35 jets to a total of 166 aircraft with another 25 wide-body boeing 787 dreamliners on order .
unlike its chief low-cost european no-frills rivals easyjet and ryanair , air berlin is more upscale and is cleverly targeting the traditional lufthansa customer in the business segment of the market , according to martina noss , an analyst who follows the german travel industry for norddeutsche landesbank . " they will be offering premium business class with more service and comfort , and will be able to use their vast domestic network from dba to feed into the long-haul ltu flights , " noss said .
" it 's a smart move to focus on the much more profitable business segment . "
but it will take time to streamline the three very different airlines that serve nearly 100 - sometimes overlapping - destinations , she added .
still the air berlin group , which carried nearly 20 million passengers last year , is valued at 854 million euros on the stock exchange and is a distant second to german behemoth lufthansa .
one of europe 's largest airlines , lufthansa has a market capitalization of 9.5 billion euros , and carried 53.4 million passengers in 2006 .
condor : the last mile for ltu 's long hauls the addition of condor , which offers a popular and exotic array of holiday destinations , would complement ltu 's long-haul flight network , air berlin ceo joachim hunold said at a press conference on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condor routes should complement the overseas network the charter airline would be purchased in two phases .
in february 2009 , air berlin would acquire a 75.1 percent of condor in a share swap with british-german travel group thomas cook , which will hold just under 30 percent of air berlin .
the deal is expected to be worth over 500 million euros , depending on the airline 's stock price in the next 17 months .
the second phase would come a year later when air berlin would exercise purchase options to acquire the remaining 24.9 percent stake in condor from lufthansa .
airline analysts said they did not expect lufthansa to oppose the deal since air berlin , even with condor , would not pose a significant threat to its core business .
segment specific air berlin is a prime example of increasing consolidation in the airline industry , where most major carriers are offering a bit of everything tailored to all market segments , according to eric heymann , an aviation and transport analyst at deutsche bank 's research group .
" there 's hardly any airline which offers only scheduled services or any purely low-cost charter airline anymore , " he said .
" various business models are converging , with airline companies offering a broad range of services for all types of travelers . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's nipping at lufthansa , but still lags way behind germany 's largest airline .
within one year , air berlin , europe 's third largest low-cost airline , has greatly expanded its route system by acquiring dba , a domestic carrier , and ltu , which operates charter and scheduled flights from düsseldorf to far flung destinations in the americas , asia and africa . then on thursday , sept .
20 , air berlin announced its expansion drive to take over condor , a rival charter airline which offers long haul flights from major german cities to popular holiday destinations worldwide .
different brands for different markets air berlin is also aggressively undercutting lufthansa by offering one-way service from düsseldorf to new york at 129 euros -lrb- $ 182 -rrb- starting in november .
lufthansa 's lowest fare on the same route is currently 333 euros roundtrip .
a fresh coat of paint with the air berlin logo will appear on refurbished ltu jets heading to lucrative business destinations such as new york , los angeles and shanghai , in keeping with the company 's tradition of serving european capitals and major cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin eyes business destinations such as new york the ltu brand , however , will also remain , as it is already established moniker for holiday spots such as montego bay and the canary islands , company spokeswoman angelika schwaff said .
from budge to business class founded in 1978 by a former pan am pilot in the then divided german capital , air berlin started as a budget charter airline with two jets .
it was bought by german investors after reunification and is now the 10th largest air carrier in europe , which has been floated publicly since spring of 2006 .
the acquisition of condor , which is subject to approval from the german cartel office , would expand the air berlin group 's fleet by 35 jets to a total of 166 aircraft with another 25 wide-body boeing 787 dreamliners on order .
unlike its chief low-cost european no-frills rivals easyjet and ryanair , air berlin is more upscale and is cleverly targeting the traditional lufthansa customer in the business segment of the market , according to martina noss , an analyst who follows the german travel industry for norddeutsche landesbank . " they will be offering premium business class with more service and comfort , and will be able to use their vast domestic network from dba to feed into the long-haul ltu flights , " noss said .
" it 's a smart move to focus on the much more profitable business segment . "
but it will take time to streamline the three very different airlines that serve nearly 100 - sometimes overlapping - destinations , she added .
still the air berlin group , which carried nearly 20 million passengers last year , is valued at 854 million euros on the stock exchange and is a distant second to german behemoth lufthansa .

condor : the last mile for ltu 's long hauls the addition of condor , which offers a popular and exotic array of holiday destinations , would complement ltu 's long-haul flight network , air berlin ceo joachim hunold said at a press conference on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condor routes should complement the overseas network the charter airline would be purchased in two phases .

it 's nipping at lufthansa , but still lags way behind germany 's largest airline .
within one year , air berlin , europe 's third largest low-cost airline , has greatly expanded its route system by acquiring dba , a domestic carrier , and ltu , which operates charter and scheduled flights from düsseldorf to far flung destinations in the americas , asia and africa . then on thursday , sept .
20 , air berlin announced its expansion drive to take over condor , a rival charter airline which offers long haul flights from major german cities to popular holiday destinations worldwide .
different brands for different markets air berlin is also aggressively undercutting lufthansa by offering one-way service from düsseldorf to new york at 129 euros -lrb- $ 182 -rrb- starting in november .
lufthansa 's lowest fare on the same route is currently 333 euros roundtrip .
a fresh coat of paint with the air berlin logo will appear on refurbished ltu jets heading to lucrative business destinations such as new york , los angeles and shanghai , in keeping with the company 's tradition of serving european capitals and major cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin eyes business destinations such as new york the ltu brand , however , will also remain , as it is already established moniker for holiday spots such as montego bay and the canary islands , company spokeswoman angelika schwaff said .
from budge to business class founded in 1978 by a former pan am pilot in the then divided german capital , air berlin started as a budget charter airline with two jets .
it was bought by german investors after reunification and is now the 10th largest air carrier in europe , which has been floated publicly since spring of 2006 .
the acquisition of condor , which is subject to approval from the german cartel office , would expand the air berlin group 's fleet by 35 jets to a total of 166 aircraft with another 25 wide-body boeing 787 dreamliners on order .
unlike its chief low-cost european no-frills rivals easyjet and ryanair , air berlin is more upscale and is cleverly targeting the traditional lufthansa customer in the business segment of the market , according to martina noss , an analyst who follows the german travel industry for norddeutsche landesbank . " they will be offering premium business class with more service and comfort , and will be able to use their vast domestic network from dba to feed into the long-haul ltu flights , " noss said .
" it 's a smart move to focus on the much more profitable business segment . "
but it will take time to streamline the three very different airlines that serve nearly 100 - sometimes overlapping - destinations , she added .
still the air berlin group , which carried nearly 20 million passengers last year , is valued at 854 million euros on the stock exchange and is a distant second to german behemoth lufthansa .
one of europe 's largest airlines , lufthansa has a market capitalization of 9.5 billion euros , and carried 53.4 million passengers in 2006 .
condor : the last mile for ltu 's long hauls the addition of condor , which offers a popular and exotic array of holiday destinations , would complement ltu 's long-haul flight network , air berlin ceo joachim hunold said at a press conference on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condor routes should complement the overseas network the charter airline would be purchased in two phases .
in february 2009 , air berlin would acquire a 75.1 percent of condor in a share swap with british-german travel group thomas cook , which will hold just under 30 percent of air berlin .
the deal is expected to be worth over 500 million euros , depending on the airline 's stock price in the next 17 months .
the second phase would come a year later when air berlin would exercise purchase options to acquire the remaining 24.9 percent stake in condor from lufthansa .
airline analysts said they did not expect lufthansa to oppose the deal since air berlin , even with condor , would not pose a significant threat to its core business .
segment specific air berlin is a prime example of increasing consolidation in the airline industry , where most major carriers are offering a bit of everything tailored to all market segments , according to eric heymann , an aviation and transport analyst at deutsche bank 's research group .

ss officer karl hoecker 's album also includes rare photos at auschwitz of josef mengele , the nazi doctor known as the " angel of death " who conducted gruesome experiments on camp inmates in the name of medicine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef mengele features in some of the auschwitz photos the photos give a rare glimpse of some of the men who ran auschwitz , enjoying time off and evidently disconnected from the horror in which more than one million nazi prisoners died .
" it 's hard to fathom the kind of people who ran these camps , " museum director sara bloomfield said .
" these unique photographs vividly illustrate the contented world they enjoyed while overseeing a world of unimaginable suffering . "
nazis seen relaxing as if on holiday hoecker , the adjutant to the death camp 's commander from may 1944 until its evacuation in january 1945 , catalogues his stay at the most notorious nazi killing site in much the same way as someone might present memories of a trip to a holiday idyll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those in the pictures seem oblivious to the horrors nearby he is seen lighting a candle on a christmas tree , petting his favourite german shepherd and passing out blueberries to young german women sitting on a fence .
other camp leaders and nazi officials also appear in the images .
in one photo , hoecker is shown laughing , flanked by young women and an accordion player , as their sing-along on a bridge is apparently cut short by the weather .
the picture carries the jaunty caption : " rain out of a clear blue sky . "
many of the pictures were taken when auschwitz 's gas chambers and crematoriums were operating at and above capacity as hungarian jews were being deported to auschwitz , the museum said .
carefree moments during the holocaust on the same day hoecker passed out blueberries to the female auxiliaries on the fence , 150 prisoners arrived on a transport to auschwitz .
the ss chose 21 men and 12 women for work , then killed the others in the gas chambers , the museum said .
when hoecker lit the christmas tree in december 1944 , soviet troops were advancing westward through what is modern poland and the camp 's liberation was just weeks away .
museum officials say the album is only the second known collection of photographs taken at auschwitz .
the album was recently donated by a retired us army intelligence officer who found it in an abandoned frankfurt apartment in 1946 , the year after world war ii ended .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz was liberated in early 1945 the nazis abandoned auschwitz in january 1945 and hoecker joined auschwitz commander richard baer in fleeing to germany .
after the third reich surrendered in may 1945 , he returned to his job at a small-town bank .
as post-war west germany increasingly confronted the nazi past , hoecker was convicted in 1965 of the murder of thousands of auschwitz inmates and served five years in prison .
he died in 2000 at age 88 in germany , according to the museum . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" after some brothers and sisters were arrested -lrb- may allah free them -rrb- and the forum and blog of the gimf were removed , we say this : the gimf still exists and will continue its work , " a statement from the front republished by reuters said .
" to the kuffar -lrb- infidels -rrb- who try to fight us , we say : you can do what you like , make as many arrests as you like ... you will not reach your goal , " the statement continued .
" we will always keep going until we achieve victory or martyrdom . "
hunting down and shutting off radical islamist web sites is extremely difficult .
most times , the web sites relocate within minutes of being identified , showing up at new internet addresses .
taking down islamist sites a difficult job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorists use the web to recruit for future attacks " this can be done in minutes , " said harald summa , chief executive of eco , an association of german internet enterprises .
" it can be automated .
you will never catch it .
once you try to hit it , it 's already at another destination , another point . "
the reappearance of the german-language site comes at a time when the authorities in germany are on their highest alert after three men were arrested earlier this month over an alleged plot to commit " massive bomb attacks " against us interests in the country .
one of the new german gimf sites contains several online responses .
one , allegedly from a student in germany , read : " brothers , i would like to be in contact with you because i want to become a mujahedeen -lrb- warrior -rrb- after i finish my studies , inshaallah -lrb- god willing -rrb- . "
investigators said it was impossible to say whether the comment was genuine , but the german authorities have expressed great concern that the message of radical groups affiliated or sympathetic to al qaeda is now being broadcast in german .
the increase in number and the speed of these german-language sites in getting established is creating a new and difficult front for anti-terror organizations .
the gimf material was located via search engines and would have been accessible to anyone with allegiances to islamist terror groups .
germany , austria on alert after terror arrests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german anti-terror units swooped to prevent massive attacks the arrest of a suspect connected to the gimf in austria also highlights again the struggle the austrian authorities are currently engaged in with extremists in their own country .
in an unconnected operation a week after the german arrests , austrian police captured three people with alleged al qaeda links who are suspected of posting a video last march threatening attacks against germany and austria .
use of the internet for spreading propaganda and recruiting potential terrorists was an issue at this year 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in heiligendamm in germany .
the g8 leaders vowed to work together to combat " terrorist and criminal abuse " of modern communications technology in june .
meanwhile , the european union 's justice and security commissioner franco frattini is due to present proposals next month to block access to web sites that contain instructions for bomb-making in another attempt to disarm the terrorists of their latest weapon .
his plan is similar to one presented this week by german justice minister brigitte zypries .
her ministry proposed legislation that , if passed by parliament , would make the preparation of terrorist acts , as well as the instruction of such actions , a criminal offence .
if convicted , offenders would face up to 10 years in prison . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the reappearance of the german-language site comes at a time when the authorities in germany are on their highest alert after three men were arrested earlier this month over an alleged plot to commit " massive bomb attacks " against us interests in the country .
one of the new german gimf sites contains several online responses .
one , allegedly from a student in germany , read : " brothers , i would like to be in contact with you because i want to become a mujahedeen -lrb- warrior -rrb- after i finish my studies , inshaallah -lrb- god willing -rrb- . "
investigators said it was impossible to say whether the comment was genuine , but the german authorities have expressed great concern that the message of radical groups affiliated or sympathetic to al qaeda is now being broadcast in german .
the increase in number and the speed of these german-language sites in getting established is creating a new and difficult front for anti-terror organizations .
the gimf material was located via search engines and would have been accessible to anyone with allegiances to islamist terror groups .

use of the internet for spreading propaganda and recruiting potential terrorists was an issue at this year 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in heiligendamm in germany .
the g8 leaders vowed to work together to combat " terrorist and criminal abuse " of modern communications technology in june .
meanwhile , the european union 's justice and security commissioner franco frattini is due to present proposals next month to block access to web sites that contain instructions for bomb-making in another attempt to disarm the terrorists of their latest weapon .
his plan is similar to one presented this week by german justice minister brigitte zypries .

ss officer karl hoecker 's album also includes rare photos at auschwitz of josef mengele , the nazi doctor known as the " angel of death " who conducted gruesome experiments on camp inmates in the name of medicine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef mengele features in some of the auschwitz photos the photos give a rare glimpse of some of the men who ran auschwitz , enjoying time off and evidently disconnected from the horror in which more than one million nazi prisoners died .
" it 's hard to fathom the kind of people who ran these camps , " museum director sara bloomfield said .
" these unique photographs vividly illustrate the contented world they enjoyed while overseeing a world of unimaginable suffering . "
nazis seen relaxing as if on holiday hoecker , the adjutant to the death camp 's commander from may 1944 until its evacuation in january 1945 , catalogues his stay at the most notorious nazi killing site in much the same way as someone might present memories of a trip to a holiday idyll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those in the pictures seem oblivious to the horrors nearby he is seen lighting a candle on a christmas tree , petting his favourite german shepherd and passing out blueberries to young german women sitting on a fence .
other camp leaders and nazi officials also appear in the images .
in one photo , hoecker is shown laughing , flanked by young women and an accordion player , as their sing-along on a bridge is apparently cut short by the weather .
the picture carries the jaunty caption : " rain out of a clear blue sky . "
many of the pictures were taken when auschwitz 's gas chambers and crematoriums were operating at and above capacity as hungarian jews were being deported to auschwitz , the museum said .
carefree moments during the holocaust on the same day hoecker passed out blueberries to the female auxiliaries on the fence , 150 prisoners arrived on a transport to auschwitz .
the ss chose 21 men and 12 women for work , then killed the others in the gas chambers , the museum said .
when hoecker lit the christmas tree in december 1944 , soviet troops were advancing westward through what is modern poland and the camp 's liberation was just weeks away .
museum officials say the album is only the second known collection of photographs taken at auschwitz .
the album was recently donated by a retired us army intelligence officer who found it in an abandoned frankfurt apartment in 1946 , the year after world war ii ended .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz was liberated in early 1945 the nazis abandoned auschwitz in january 1945 and hoecker joined auschwitz commander richard baer in fleeing to germany .
after the third reich surrendered in may 1945 , he returned to his job at a small-town bank .
as post-war west germany increasingly confronted the nazi past , hoecker was convicted in 1965 of the murder of thousands of auschwitz inmates and served five years in prison .
he died in 2000 at age 88 in germany , according to the museum . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is accused of setting fire to several cans of petrol and causing damage worth 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 700,000 -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 22.09.2007 german al qaeda mouthpiece resurfaces online despite arrests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : links to al qaeda videos and calls for recruits were published online by the gimf despite the best efforts of security authorities on both sides of the atlantic , a german-language mouthpiece for al qaeda has resurfaced on the web a week after suspects linked to it were arrested in austria and canada . the " global islamic media front " -lrb- gimf -rrb- , which has been attempting to recruit volunteer translators on the internet as well as posting al qaeda videos , vowed to defy the authorities trying to track it down .
" after some brothers and sisters were arrested -lrb- may allah free them -rrb- and the forum and blog of the gimf were removed , we say this : the gimf still exists and will continue its work , " a statement from the front republished by reuters said .
" to the kuffar -lrb- infidels -rrb- who try to fight us , we say : you can do what you like , make as many arrests as you like ... you will not reach your goal , " the statement continued .
" we will always keep going until we achieve victory or martyrdom . "
hunting down and shutting off radical islamist web sites is extremely difficult .
most times , the web sites relocate within minutes of being identified , showing up at new internet addresses .
taking down islamist sites a difficult job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorists use the web to recruit for future attacks " this can be done in minutes , " said harald summa , chief executive of eco , an association of german internet enterprises .
" it can be automated .
you will never catch it .
once you try to hit it , it 's already at another destination , another point . "
the reappearance of the german-language site comes at a time when the authorities in germany are on their highest alert after three men were arrested earlier this month over an alleged plot to commit " massive bomb attacks " against us interests in the country .
one of the new german gimf sites contains several online responses .
one , allegedly from a student in germany , read : " brothers , i would like to be in contact with you because i want to become a mujahedeen -lrb- warrior -rrb- after i finish my studies , inshaallah -lrb- god willing -rrb- . "
investigators said it was impossible to say whether the comment was genuine , but the german authorities have expressed great concern that the message of radical groups affiliated or sympathetic to al qaeda is now being broadcast in german .
the increase in number and the speed of these german-language sites in getting established is creating a new and difficult front for anti-terror organizations .
the gimf material was located via search engines and would have been accessible to anyone with allegiances to islamist terror groups .
germany , austria on alert after terror arrests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german anti-terror units swooped to prevent massive attacks the arrest of a suspect connected to the gimf in austria also highlights again the struggle the austrian authorities are currently engaged in with extremists in their own country .
in an unconnected operation a week after the german arrests , austrian police captured three people with alleged al qaeda links who are suspected of posting a video last march threatening attacks against germany and austria .
use of the internet for spreading propaganda and recruiting potential terrorists was an issue at this year 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in heiligendamm in germany .
the g8 leaders vowed to work together to combat " terrorist and criminal abuse " of modern communications technology in june .
meanwhile , the european union 's justice and security commissioner franco frattini is due to present proposals next month to block access to web sites that contain instructions for bomb-making in another attempt to disarm the terrorists of their latest weapon .
his plan is similar to one presented this week by german justice minister brigitte zypries .
her ministry proposed legislation that , if passed by parliament , would make the preparation of terrorist acts , as well as the instruction of such actions , a criminal offence .
if convicted , offenders would face up to 10 years in prison . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ss officer karl hoecker 's album also includes rare photos at auschwitz of josef mengele , the nazi doctor known as the " angel of death " who conducted gruesome experiments on camp inmates in the name of medicine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef mengele features in some of the auschwitz photos the photos give a rare glimpse of some of the men who ran auschwitz , enjoying time off and evidently disconnected from the horror in which more than one million nazi prisoners died .
" it 's hard to fathom the kind of people who ran these camps , " museum director sara bloomfield said .
" these unique photographs vividly illustrate the contented world they enjoyed while overseeing a world of unimaginable suffering . "
nazis seen relaxing as if on holiday hoecker , the adjutant to the death camp 's commander from may 1944 until its evacuation in january 1945 , catalogues his stay at the most notorious nazi killing site in much the same way as someone might present memories of a trip to a holiday idyll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those in the pictures seem oblivious to the horrors nearby he is seen lighting a candle on a christmas tree , petting his favourite german shepherd and passing out blueberries to young german women sitting on a fence .
other camp leaders and nazi officials also appear in the images .
in one photo , hoecker is shown laughing , flanked by young women and an accordion player , as their sing-along on a bridge is apparently cut short by the weather .
the picture carries the jaunty caption : " rain out of a clear blue sky . "
many of the pictures were taken when auschwitz 's gas chambers and crematoriums were operating at and above capacity as hungarian jews were being deported to auschwitz , the museum said .
carefree moments during the holocaust on the same day hoecker passed out blueberries to the female auxiliaries on the fence , 150 prisoners arrived on a transport to auschwitz .
the ss chose 21 men and 12 women for work , then killed the others in the gas chambers , the museum said .
when hoecker lit the christmas tree in december 1944 , soviet troops were advancing westward through what is modern poland and the camp 's liberation was just weeks away .
museum officials say the album is only the second known collection of photographs taken at auschwitz .
the album was recently donated by a retired us army intelligence officer who found it in an abandoned frankfurt apartment in 1946 , the year after world war ii ended .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz was liberated in early 1945 the nazis abandoned auschwitz in january 1945 and hoecker joined auschwitz commander richard baer in fleeing to germany .
after the third reich surrendered in may 1945 , he returned to his job at a small-town bank .
as post-war west germany increasingly confronted the nazi past , hoecker was convicted in 1965 of the murder of thousands of auschwitz inmates and served five years in prison .
he died in 2000 at age 88 in germany , according to the museum . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 22.09.2007 german al qaeda mouthpiece resurfaces online despite arrests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : links to al qaeda videos and calls for recruits were published online by the gimf despite the best efforts of security authorities on both sides of the atlantic , a german-language mouthpiece for al qaeda has resurfaced on the web a week after suspects linked to it were arrested in austria and canada . the " global islamic media front " -lrb- gimf -rrb- , which has been attempting to recruit volunteer translators on the internet as well as posting al qaeda videos , vowed to defy the authorities trying to track it down .
" after some brothers and sisters were arrested -lrb- may allah free them -rrb- and the forum and blog of the gimf were removed , we say this : the gimf still exists and will continue its work , " a statement from the front republished by reuters said .
" to the kuffar -lrb- infidels -rrb- who try to fight us , we say : you can do what you like , make as many arrests as you like ... you will not reach your goal , " the statement continued .
" we will always keep going until we achieve victory or martyrdom . "
hunting down and shutting off radical islamist web sites is extremely difficult .
most times , the web sites relocate within minutes of being identified , showing up at new internet addresses .
taking down islamist sites a difficult job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorists use the web to recruit for future attacks " this can be done in minutes , " said harald summa , chief executive of eco , an association of german internet enterprises .
" it can be automated .
you will never catch it .
once you try to hit it , it 's already at another destination , another point . "
the reappearance of the german-language site comes at a time when the authorities in germany are on their highest alert after three men were arrested earlier this month over an alleged plot to commit " massive bomb attacks " against us interests in the country .
one of the new german gimf sites contains several online responses .
one , allegedly from a student in germany , read : " brothers , i would like to be in contact with you because i want to become a mujahedeen -lrb- warrior -rrb- after i finish my studies , inshaallah -lrb- god willing -rrb- . "
investigators said it was impossible to say whether the comment was genuine , but the german authorities have expressed great concern that the message of radical groups affiliated or sympathetic to al qaeda is now being broadcast in german .
the increase in number and the speed of these german-language sites in getting established is creating a new and difficult front for anti-terror organizations .
the gimf material was located via search engines and would have been accessible to anyone with allegiances to islamist terror groups .
germany , austria on alert after terror arrests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german anti-terror units swooped to prevent massive attacks the arrest of a suspect connected to the gimf in austria also highlights again the struggle the austrian authorities are currently engaged in with extremists in their own country .
in an unconnected operation a week after the german arrests , austrian police captured three people with alleged al qaeda links who are suspected of posting a video last march threatening attacks against germany and austria .
use of the internet for spreading propaganda and recruiting potential terrorists was an issue at this year 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in heiligendamm in germany .
the g8 leaders vowed to work together to combat " terrorist and criminal abuse " of modern communications technology in june .
meanwhile , the european union 's justice and security commissioner franco frattini is due to present proposals next month to block access to web sites that contain instructions for bomb-making in another attempt to disarm the terrorists of their latest weapon .
his plan is similar to one presented this week by german justice minister brigitte zypries .
her ministry proposed legislation that , if passed by parliament , would make the preparation of terrorist acts , as well as the instruction of such actions , a criminal offence .
if convicted , offenders would face up to 10 years in prison . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's nipping at lufthansa , but still lags way behind germany 's largest airline .

from budge to business class founded in 1978 by a former pan am pilot in the then divided german capital , air berlin started as a budget charter airline with two jets .
it was bought by german investors after reunification and is now the 10th largest air carrier in europe , which has been floated publicly since spring of 2006 .
the acquisition of condor , which is subject to approval from the german cartel office , would expand the air berlin group 's fleet by 35 jets to a total of 166 aircraft with another 25 wide-body boeing 787 dreamliners on order .
unlike its chief low-cost european no-frills rivals easyjet and ryanair , air berlin is more upscale and is cleverly targeting the traditional lufthansa customer in the business segment of the market , according to martina noss , an analyst who follows the german travel industry for norddeutsche landesbank . " they will be offering premium business class with more service and comfort , and will be able to use their vast domestic network from dba to feed into the long-haul ltu flights , " noss said .

in february 2009 , air berlin would acquire a 75.1 percent of condor in a share swap with british-german travel group thomas cook , which will hold just under 30 percent of air berlin .
the deal is expected to be worth over 500 million euros , depending on the airline 's stock price in the next 17 months .
the second phase would come a year later when air berlin would exercise purchase options to acquire the remaining 24.9 percent stake in condor from lufthansa .
airline analysts said they did not expect lufthansa to oppose the deal since air berlin , even with condor , would not pose a significant threat to its core business .

unlike its chief low-cost european no-frills rivals easyjet and ryanair , air berlin is more upscale and is cleverly targeting the traditional lufthansa customer in the business segment of the market , according to martina noss , an analyst who follows the german travel industry for norddeutsche landesbank . " they will be offering premium business class with more service and comfort , and will be able to use their vast domestic network from dba to feed into the long-haul ltu flights , " noss said .
" it 's a smart move to focus on the much more profitable business segment . "
but it will take time to streamline the three very different airlines that serve nearly 100 - sometimes overlapping - destinations , she added .
still the air berlin group , which carried nearly 20 million passengers last year , is valued at 854 million euros on the stock exchange and is a distant second to german behemoth lufthansa .
one of europe 's largest airlines , lufthansa has a market capitalization of 9.5 billion euros , and carried 53.4 million passengers in 2006 .
condor : the last mile for ltu 's long hauls the addition of condor , which offers a popular and exotic array of holiday destinations , would complement ltu 's long-haul flight network , air berlin ceo joachim hunold said at a press conference on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condor routes should complement the overseas network the charter airline would be purchased in two phases .
in february 2009 , air berlin would acquire a 75.1 percent of condor in a share swap with british-german travel group thomas cook , which will hold just under 30 percent of air berlin .
the deal is expected to be worth over 500 million euros , depending on the airline 's stock price in the next 17 months .
the second phase would come a year later when air berlin would exercise purchase options to acquire the remaining 24.9 percent stake in condor from lufthansa .
airline analysts said they did not expect lufthansa to oppose the deal since air berlin , even with condor , would not pose a significant threat to its core business .
segment specific air berlin is a prime example of increasing consolidation in the airline industry , where most major carriers are offering a bit of everything tailored to all market segments , according to eric heymann , an aviation and transport analyst at deutsche bank 's research group .
" there 's hardly any airline which offers only scheduled services or any purely low-cost charter airline anymore , " he said .
" various business models are converging , with airline companies offering a broad range of services for all types of travelers . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ss officer karl hoecker 's album also includes rare photos at auschwitz of josef mengele , the nazi doctor known as the " angel of death " who conducted gruesome experiments on camp inmates in the name of medicine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef mengele features in some of the auschwitz photos the photos give a rare glimpse of some of the men who ran auschwitz , enjoying time off and evidently disconnected from the horror in which more than one million nazi prisoners died .
" it 's hard to fathom the kind of people who ran these camps , " museum director sara bloomfield said .
" these unique photographs vividly illustrate the contented world they enjoyed while overseeing a world of unimaginable suffering . "
nazis seen relaxing as if on holiday hoecker , the adjutant to the death camp 's commander from may 1944 until its evacuation in january 1945 , catalogues his stay at the most notorious nazi killing site in much the same way as someone might present memories of a trip to a holiday idyll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those in the pictures seem oblivious to the horrors nearby he is seen lighting a candle on a christmas tree , petting his favourite german shepherd and passing out blueberries to young german women sitting on a fence .
other camp leaders and nazi officials also appear in the images .
in one photo , hoecker is shown laughing , flanked by young women and an accordion player , as their sing-along on a bridge is apparently cut short by the weather .
the picture carries the jaunty caption : " rain out of a clear blue sky . "
many of the pictures were taken when auschwitz 's gas chambers and crematoriums were operating at and above capacity as hungarian jews were being deported to auschwitz , the museum said .
carefree moments during the holocaust on the same day hoecker passed out blueberries to the female auxiliaries on the fence , 150 prisoners arrived on a transport to auschwitz .
the ss chose 21 men and 12 women for work , then killed the others in the gas chambers , the museum said .
when hoecker lit the christmas tree in december 1944 , soviet troops were advancing westward through what is modern poland and the camp 's liberation was just weeks away .
museum officials say the album is only the second known collection of photographs taken at auschwitz .
the album was recently donated by a retired us army intelligence officer who found it in an abandoned frankfurt apartment in 1946 , the year after world war ii ended .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz was liberated in early 1945 the nazis abandoned auschwitz in january 1945 and hoecker joined auschwitz commander richard baer in fleeing to germany .
after the third reich surrendered in may 1945 , he returned to his job at a small-town bank .
as post-war west germany increasingly confronted the nazi past , hoecker was convicted in 1965 of the murder of thousands of auschwitz inmates and served five years in prison .
he died in 2000 at age 88 in germany , according to the museum . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 22.09.2007 german al qaeda mouthpiece resurfaces online despite arrests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : links to al qaeda videos and calls for recruits were published online by the gimf despite the best efforts of security authorities on both sides of the atlantic , a german-language mouthpiece for al qaeda has resurfaced on the web a week after suspects linked to it were arrested in austria and canada . the " global islamic media front " -lrb- gimf -rrb- , which has been attempting to recruit volunteer translators on the internet as well as posting al qaeda videos , vowed to defy the authorities trying to track it down .
" after some brothers and sisters were arrested -lrb- may allah free them -rrb- and the forum and blog of the gimf were removed , we say this : the gimf still exists and will continue its work , " a statement from the front republished by reuters said .
" to the kuffar -lrb- infidels -rrb- who try to fight us , we say : you can do what you like , make as many arrests as you like ... you will not reach your goal , " the statement continued .
" we will always keep going until we achieve victory or martyrdom . "
hunting down and shutting off radical islamist web sites is extremely difficult .
most times , the web sites relocate within minutes of being identified , showing up at new internet addresses .
taking down islamist sites a difficult job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorists use the web to recruit for future attacks " this can be done in minutes , " said harald summa , chief executive of eco , an association of german internet enterprises .
" it can be automated .
you will never catch it .
once you try to hit it , it 's already at another destination , another point . "
the reappearance of the german-language site comes at a time when the authorities in germany are on their highest alert after three men were arrested earlier this month over an alleged plot to commit " massive bomb attacks " against us interests in the country .
one of the new german gimf sites contains several online responses .
one , allegedly from a student in germany , read : " brothers , i would like to be in contact with you because i want to become a mujahedeen -lrb- warrior -rrb- after i finish my studies , inshaallah -lrb- god willing -rrb- . "
investigators said it was impossible to say whether the comment was genuine , but the german authorities have expressed great concern that the message of radical groups affiliated or sympathetic to al qaeda is now being broadcast in german .
the increase in number and the speed of these german-language sites in getting established is creating a new and difficult front for anti-terror organizations .
the gimf material was located via search engines and would have been accessible to anyone with allegiances to islamist terror groups .
germany , austria on alert after terror arrests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german anti-terror units swooped to prevent massive attacks the arrest of a suspect connected to the gimf in austria also highlights again the struggle the austrian authorities are currently engaged in with extremists in their own country .
in an unconnected operation a week after the german arrests , austrian police captured three people with alleged al qaeda links who are suspected of posting a video last march threatening attacks against germany and austria .
use of the internet for spreading propaganda and recruiting potential terrorists was an issue at this year 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in heiligendamm in germany .
the g8 leaders vowed to work together to combat " terrorist and criminal abuse " of modern communications technology in june .
meanwhile , the european union 's justice and security commissioner franco frattini is due to present proposals next month to block access to web sites that contain instructions for bomb-making in another attempt to disarm the terrorists of their latest weapon .
his plan is similar to one presented this week by german justice minister brigitte zypries .
her ministry proposed legislation that , if passed by parliament , would make the preparation of terrorist acts , as well as the instruction of such actions , a criminal offence .
if convicted , offenders would face up to 10 years in prison . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's nipping at lufthansa , but still lags way behind germany 's largest airline .
within one year , air berlin , europe 's third largest low-cost airline , has greatly expanded its route system by acquiring dba , a domestic carrier , and ltu , which operates charter and scheduled flights from düsseldorf to far flung destinations in the americas , asia and africa . then on thursday , sept .
20 , air berlin announced its expansion drive to take over condor , a rival charter airline which offers long haul flights from major german cities to popular holiday destinations worldwide .
different brands for different markets air berlin is also aggressively undercutting lufthansa by offering one-way service from düsseldorf to new york at 129 euros -lrb- $ 182 -rrb- starting in november .
lufthansa 's lowest fare on the same route is currently 333 euros roundtrip .
a fresh coat of paint with the air berlin logo will appear on refurbished ltu jets heading to lucrative business destinations such as new york , los angeles and shanghai , in keeping with the company 's tradition of serving european capitals and major cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin eyes business destinations such as new york the ltu brand , however , will also remain , as it is already established moniker for holiday spots such as montego bay and the canary islands , company spokeswoman angelika schwaff said .
from budge to business class founded in 1978 by a former pan am pilot in the then divided german capital , air berlin started as a budget charter airline with two jets .
it was bought by german investors after reunification and is now the 10th largest air carrier in europe , which has been floated publicly since spring of 2006 .
the acquisition of condor , which is subject to approval from the german cartel office , would expand the air berlin group 's fleet by 35 jets to a total of 166 aircraft with another 25 wide-body boeing 787 dreamliners on order .
unlike its chief low-cost european no-frills rivals easyjet and ryanair , air berlin is more upscale and is cleverly targeting the traditional lufthansa customer in the business segment of the market , according to martina noss , an analyst who follows the german travel industry for norddeutsche landesbank . " they will be offering premium business class with more service and comfort , and will be able to use their vast domestic network from dba to feed into the long-haul ltu flights , " noss said .
" it 's a smart move to focus on the much more profitable business segment . "
but it will take time to streamline the three very different airlines that serve nearly 100 - sometimes overlapping - destinations , she added .
still the air berlin group , which carried nearly 20 million passengers last year , is valued at 854 million euros on the stock exchange and is a distant second to german behemoth lufthansa .
one of europe 's largest airlines , lufthansa has a market capitalization of 9.5 billion euros , and carried 53.4 million passengers in 2006 .
condor : the last mile for ltu 's long hauls the addition of condor , which offers a popular and exotic array of holiday destinations , would complement ltu 's long-haul flight network , air berlin ceo joachim hunold said at a press conference on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condor routes should complement the overseas network the charter airline would be purchased in two phases .
in february 2009 , air berlin would acquire a 75.1 percent of condor in a share swap with british-german travel group thomas cook , which will hold just under 30 percent of air berlin .
the deal is expected to be worth over 500 million euros , depending on the airline 's stock price in the next 17 months .
the second phase would come a year later when air berlin would exercise purchase options to acquire the remaining 24.9 percent stake in condor from lufthansa .
airline analysts said they did not expect lufthansa to oppose the deal since air berlin , even with condor , would not pose a significant threat to its core business .
segment specific air berlin is a prime example of increasing consolidation in the airline industry , where most major carriers are offering a bit of everything tailored to all market segments , according to eric heymann , an aviation and transport analyst at deutsche bank 's research group .
" there 's hardly any airline which offers only scheduled services or any purely low-cost charter airline anymore , " he said .
" various business models are converging , with airline companies offering a broad range of services for all types of travelers . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , they wo n't pursue the extradition of cia agents suspected of kidnapping a german national after washington signaled that it wo n't cooperate , according to news reports . german officials will not press their us counterparts to arrest a team of 13 cia agents , who are suspected of illegally detaining a lebanese-born german national , khaled el masri , after he was wrongfully suspected of terrorism . german newsmagazine der spiegel , in an advance report on its monday issue , wrote that berlin does not plan to forward an extradition request by munich prosecutors to arrest the agents linked to the detention of el masri in macedonia in december 2003 . masri still suffering from imprisonment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el masri is now facing criminal charges himself prosecutors issued warrants for the agents at the end of january , accusing the unnamed suspects of wrongfully imprisoning el masri and causing him serious bodily harm . el masri , 44 , told a german parliamentary inquiry he had been flown to afghanistan and tortured over a five-month period . earlier this month , he was indicted for an arson attack on a cash-and-carry market .
he is accused of setting fire to several cans of petrol and causing damage worth 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 700,000 -rrb- .
his lawyer , manfred gnjidic , has blamed masri 's behavior on the events of 2004 . justice minister wants to avoid coalition trouble according to the magazine , the german justice ministry inquired in washington about how a request would be handled and was informed in clear terms that the agents would not be arrested . justice minister brigitte zypries then reportedly decided not to press the issue in order not to exacerbate divisions within the grand coalition government of chancellor angela merkel , the magazine said .

ss officer karl hoecker 's album also includes rare photos at auschwitz of josef mengele , the nazi doctor known as the " angel of death " who conducted gruesome experiments on camp inmates in the name of medicine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef mengele features in some of the auschwitz photos the photos give a rare glimpse of some of the men who ran auschwitz , enjoying time off and evidently disconnected from the horror in which more than one million nazi prisoners died .
" it 's hard to fathom the kind of people who ran these camps , " museum director sara bloomfield said .
" these unique photographs vividly illustrate the contented world they enjoyed while overseeing a world of unimaginable suffering . "
nazis seen relaxing as if on holiday hoecker , the adjutant to the death camp 's commander from may 1944 until its evacuation in january 1945 , catalogues his stay at the most notorious nazi killing site in much the same way as someone might present memories of a trip to a holiday idyll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those in the pictures seem oblivious to the horrors nearby he is seen lighting a candle on a christmas tree , petting his favourite german shepherd and passing out blueberries to young german women sitting on a fence .
other camp leaders and nazi officials also appear in the images .
in one photo , hoecker is shown laughing , flanked by young women and an accordion player , as their sing-along on a bridge is apparently cut short by the weather .
the picture carries the jaunty caption : " rain out of a clear blue sky . "
many of the pictures were taken when auschwitz 's gas chambers and crematoriums were operating at and above capacity as hungarian jews were being deported to auschwitz , the museum said .
carefree moments during the holocaust on the same day hoecker passed out blueberries to the female auxiliaries on the fence , 150 prisoners arrived on a transport to auschwitz .
the ss chose 21 men and 12 women for work , then killed the others in the gas chambers , the museum said .
when hoecker lit the christmas tree in december 1944 , soviet troops were advancing westward through what is modern poland and the camp 's liberation was just weeks away .
museum officials say the album is only the second known collection of photographs taken at auschwitz .
the album was recently donated by a retired us army intelligence officer who found it in an abandoned frankfurt apartment in 1946 , the year after world war ii ended .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz was liberated in early 1945 the nazis abandoned auschwitz in january 1945 and hoecker joined auschwitz commander richard baer in fleeing to germany .
after the third reich surrendered in may 1945 , he returned to his job at a small-town bank .
as post-war west germany increasingly confronted the nazi past , hoecker was convicted in 1965 of the murder of thousands of auschwitz inmates and served five years in prison .

" after some brothers and sisters were arrested -lrb- may allah free them -rrb- and the forum and blog of the gimf were removed , we say this : the gimf still exists and will continue its work , " a statement from the front republished by reuters said .
" to the kuffar -lrb- infidels -rrb- who try to fight us , we say : you can do what you like , make as many arrests as you like ... you will not reach your goal , " the statement continued .
" we will always keep going until we achieve victory or martyrdom . "
hunting down and shutting off radical islamist web sites is extremely difficult .
most times , the web sites relocate within minutes of being identified , showing up at new internet addresses .
taking down islamist sites a difficult job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorists use the web to recruit for future attacks " this can be done in minutes , " said harald summa , chief executive of eco , an association of german internet enterprises .
" it can be automated .
you will never catch it .
once you try to hit it , it 's already at another destination , another point . "
the reappearance of the german-language site comes at a time when the authorities in germany are on their highest alert after three men were arrested earlier this month over an alleged plot to commit " massive bomb attacks " against us interests in the country .
one of the new german gimf sites contains several online responses .
one , allegedly from a student in germany , read : " brothers , i would like to be in contact with you because i want to become a mujahedeen -lrb- warrior -rrb- after i finish my studies , inshaallah -lrb- god willing -rrb- . "
investigators said it was impossible to say whether the comment was genuine , but the german authorities have expressed great concern that the message of radical groups affiliated or sympathetic to al qaeda is now being broadcast in german .
the increase in number and the speed of these german-language sites in getting established is creating a new and difficult front for anti-terror organizations .
the gimf material was located via search engines and would have been accessible to anyone with allegiances to islamist terror groups .
germany , austria on alert after terror arrests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german anti-terror units swooped to prevent massive attacks the arrest of a suspect connected to the gimf in austria also highlights again the struggle the austrian authorities are currently engaged in with extremists in their own country .
in an unconnected operation a week after the german arrests , austrian police captured three people with alleged al qaeda links who are suspected of posting a video last march threatening attacks against germany and austria .
use of the internet for spreading propaganda and recruiting potential terrorists was an issue at this year 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in heiligendamm in germany .
the g8 leaders vowed to work together to combat " terrorist and criminal abuse " of modern communications technology in june .
meanwhile , the european union 's justice and security commissioner franco frattini is due to present proposals next month to block access to web sites that contain instructions for bomb-making in another attempt to disarm the terrorists of their latest weapon .
his plan is similar to one presented this week by german justice minister brigitte zypries .
her ministry proposed legislation that , if passed by parliament , would make the preparation of terrorist acts , as well as the instruction of such actions , a criminal offence .
if convicted , offenders would face up to 10 years in prison . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 22.09.2007 german al qaeda mouthpiece resurfaces online despite arrests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : links to al qaeda videos and calls for recruits were published online by the gimf despite the best efforts of security authorities on both sides of the atlantic , a german-language mouthpiece for al qaeda has resurfaced on the web a week after suspects linked to it were arrested in austria and canada . the " global islamic media front " -lrb- gimf -rrb- , which has been attempting to recruit volunteer translators on the internet as well as posting al qaeda videos , vowed to defy the authorities trying to track it down .
" after some brothers and sisters were arrested -lrb- may allah free them -rrb- and the forum and blog of the gimf were removed , we say this : the gimf still exists and will continue its work , " a statement from the front republished by reuters said .
" to the kuffar -lrb- infidels -rrb- who try to fight us , we say : you can do what you like , make as many arrests as you like ... you will not reach your goal , " the statement continued .
" we will always keep going until we achieve victory or martyrdom . "
hunting down and shutting off radical islamist web sites is extremely difficult .
most times , the web sites relocate within minutes of being identified , showing up at new internet addresses .
taking down islamist sites a difficult job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorists use the web to recruit for future attacks " this can be done in minutes , " said harald summa , chief executive of eco , an association of german internet enterprises .
" it can be automated .
you will never catch it .
once you try to hit it , it 's already at another destination , another point . "
the reappearance of the german-language site comes at a time when the authorities in germany are on their highest alert after three men were arrested earlier this month over an alleged plot to commit " massive bomb attacks " against us interests in the country .
one of the new german gimf sites contains several online responses .
one , allegedly from a student in germany , read : " brothers , i would like to be in contact with you because i want to become a mujahedeen -lrb- warrior -rrb- after i finish my studies , inshaallah -lrb- god willing -rrb- . "
investigators said it was impossible to say whether the comment was genuine , but the german authorities have expressed great concern that the message of radical groups affiliated or sympathetic to al qaeda is now being broadcast in german .
the increase in number and the speed of these german-language sites in getting established is creating a new and difficult front for anti-terror organizations .
the gimf material was located via search engines and would have been accessible to anyone with allegiances to islamist terror groups .
germany , austria on alert after terror arrests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german anti-terror units swooped to prevent massive attacks the arrest of a suspect connected to the gimf in austria also highlights again the struggle the austrian authorities are currently engaged in with extremists in their own country .
in an unconnected operation a week after the german arrests , austrian police captured three people with alleged al qaeda links who are suspected of posting a video last march threatening attacks against germany and austria .
use of the internet for spreading propaganda and recruiting potential terrorists was an issue at this year 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in heiligendamm in germany .
the g8 leaders vowed to work together to combat " terrorist and criminal abuse " of modern communications technology in june .
meanwhile , the european union 's justice and security commissioner franco frattini is due to present proposals next month to block access to web sites that contain instructions for bomb-making in another attempt to disarm the terrorists of their latest weapon .
his plan is similar to one presented this week by german justice minister brigitte zypries .
her ministry proposed legislation that , if passed by parliament , would make the preparation of terrorist acts , as well as the instruction of such actions , a criminal offence .
if convicted , offenders would face up to 10 years in prison . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opinion : german politicians create terror as they warn of it with their alarmist comments to the media about impending terror attacks , interior minister schäuble and other german politicians are spreading fear and terror , says peter philipp .
-lrb- 21.09.2007 -rrb- germany intends to criminalize terrorist preparation germany 's justice minister plans to extend the country 's anti-terror laws .
in the future , preparing an attack or receiving explicit training for a violent act will be punishable by up to 10 years in prison .
-lrb- 18.09.2007 -rrb- eu ministers to announce new counter-terrorism czar eu officials said a new counter-terrorism chief would oversee the bloc 's efforts to prevent future attacks .
the position 's limited power , however , means the " czar " will have to work closely with national governments .

it 's nipping at lufthansa , but still lags way behind germany 's largest airline .
within one year , air berlin , europe 's third largest low-cost airline , has greatly expanded its route system by acquiring dba , a domestic carrier , and ltu , which operates charter and scheduled flights from düsseldorf to far flung destinations in the americas , asia and africa . then on thursday , sept .
20 , air berlin announced its expansion drive to take over condor , a rival charter airline which offers long haul flights from major german cities to popular holiday destinations worldwide .
different brands for different markets air berlin is also aggressively undercutting lufthansa by offering one-way service from düsseldorf to new york at 129 euros -lrb- $ 182 -rrb- starting in november .
lufthansa 's lowest fare on the same route is currently 333 euros roundtrip .
a fresh coat of paint with the air berlin logo will appear on refurbished ltu jets heading to lucrative business destinations such as new york , los angeles and shanghai , in keeping with the company 's tradition of serving european capitals and major cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin eyes business destinations such as new york the ltu brand , however , will also remain , as it is already established moniker for holiday spots such as montego bay and the canary islands , company spokeswoman angelika schwaff said .
from budge to business class founded in 1978 by a former pan am pilot in the then divided german capital , air berlin started as a budget charter airline with two jets .
it was bought by german investors after reunification and is now the 10th largest air carrier in europe , which has been floated publicly since spring of 2006 .
the acquisition of condor , which is subject to approval from the german cartel office , would expand the air berlin group 's fleet by 35 jets to a total of 166 aircraft with another 25 wide-body boeing 787 dreamliners on order .
unlike its chief low-cost european no-frills rivals easyjet and ryanair , air berlin is more upscale and is cleverly targeting the traditional lufthansa customer in the business segment of the market , according to martina noss , an analyst who follows the german travel industry for norddeutsche landesbank . " they will be offering premium business class with more service and comfort , and will be able to use their vast domestic network from dba to feed into the long-haul ltu flights , " noss said .
" it 's a smart move to focus on the much more profitable business segment . "
but it will take time to streamline the three very different airlines that serve nearly 100 - sometimes overlapping - destinations , she added .
still the air berlin group , which carried nearly 20 million passengers last year , is valued at 854 million euros on the stock exchange and is a distant second to german behemoth lufthansa .
one of europe 's largest airlines , lufthansa has a market capitalization of 9.5 billion euros , and carried 53.4 million passengers in 2006 .
condor : the last mile for ltu 's long hauls the addition of condor , which offers a popular and exotic array of holiday destinations , would complement ltu 's long-haul flight network , air berlin ceo joachim hunold said at a press conference on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condor routes should complement the overseas network the charter airline would be purchased in two phases .
in february 2009 , air berlin would acquire a 75.1 percent of condor in a share swap with british-german travel group thomas cook , which will hold just under 30 percent of air berlin .
the deal is expected to be worth over 500 million euros , depending on the airline 's stock price in the next 17 months .
the second phase would come a year later when air berlin would exercise purchase options to acquire the remaining 24.9 percent stake in condor from lufthansa .
airline analysts said they did not expect lufthansa to oppose the deal since air berlin , even with condor , would not pose a significant threat to its core business .
segment specific air berlin is a prime example of increasing consolidation in the airline industry , where most major carriers are offering a bit of everything tailored to all market segments , according to eric heymann , an aviation and transport analyst at deutsche bank 's research group .

ss officer karl hoecker 's album also includes rare photos at auschwitz of josef mengele , the nazi doctor known as the " angel of death " who conducted gruesome experiments on camp inmates in the name of medicine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef mengele features in some of the auschwitz photos the photos give a rare glimpse of some of the men who ran auschwitz , enjoying time off and evidently disconnected from the horror in which more than one million nazi prisoners died .
" it 's hard to fathom the kind of people who ran these camps , " museum director sara bloomfield said .
" these unique photographs vividly illustrate the contented world they enjoyed while overseeing a world of unimaginable suffering . "
nazis seen relaxing as if on holiday hoecker , the adjutant to the death camp 's commander from may 1944 until its evacuation in january 1945 , catalogues his stay at the most notorious nazi killing site in much the same way as someone might present memories of a trip to a holiday idyll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those in the pictures seem oblivious to the horrors nearby he is seen lighting a candle on a christmas tree , petting his favourite german shepherd and passing out blueberries to young german women sitting on a fence .
other camp leaders and nazi officials also appear in the images .
in one photo , hoecker is shown laughing , flanked by young women and an accordion player , as their sing-along on a bridge is apparently cut short by the weather .
the picture carries the jaunty caption : " rain out of a clear blue sky . "
many of the pictures were taken when auschwitz 's gas chambers and crematoriums were operating at and above capacity as hungarian jews were being deported to auschwitz , the museum said .
carefree moments during the holocaust on the same day hoecker passed out blueberries to the female auxiliaries on the fence , 150 prisoners arrived on a transport to auschwitz .
the ss chose 21 men and 12 women for work , then killed the others in the gas chambers , the museum said .
when hoecker lit the christmas tree in december 1944 , soviet troops were advancing westward through what is modern poland and the camp 's liberation was just weeks away .
museum officials say the album is only the second known collection of photographs taken at auschwitz .
the album was recently donated by a retired us army intelligence officer who found it in an abandoned frankfurt apartment in 1946 , the year after world war ii ended .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz was liberated in early 1945 the nazis abandoned auschwitz in january 1945 and hoecker joined auschwitz commander richard baer in fleeing to germany .
after the third reich surrendered in may 1945 , he returned to his job at a small-town bank .
as post-war west germany increasingly confronted the nazi past , hoecker was convicted in 1965 of the murder of thousands of auschwitz inmates and served five years in prison .
he died in 2000 at age 88 in germany , according to the museum . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" after some brothers and sisters were arrested -lrb- may allah free them -rrb- and the forum and blog of the gimf were removed , we say this : the gimf still exists and will continue its work , " a statement from the front republished by reuters said .
" to the kuffar -lrb- infidels -rrb- who try to fight us , we say : you can do what you like , make as many arrests as you like ... you will not reach your goal , " the statement continued .
" we will always keep going until we achieve victory or martyrdom . "

" it can be automated .

the reappearance of the german-language site comes at a time when the authorities in germany are on their highest alert after three men were arrested earlier this month over an alleged plot to commit " massive bomb attacks " against us interests in the country .
one of the new german gimf sites contains several online responses .
one , allegedly from a student in germany , read : " brothers , i would like to be in contact with you because i want to become a mujahedeen -lrb- warrior -rrb- after i finish my studies , inshaallah -lrb- god willing -rrb- . "
investigators said it was impossible to say whether the comment was genuine , but the german authorities have expressed great concern that the message of radical groups affiliated or sympathetic to al qaeda is now being broadcast in german .
the increase in number and the speed of these german-language sites in getting established is creating a new and difficult front for anti-terror organizations .
the gimf material was located via search engines and would have been accessible to anyone with allegiances to islamist terror groups .

meanwhile , the european union 's justice and security commissioner franco frattini is due to present proposals next month to block access to web sites that contain instructions for bomb-making in another attempt to disarm the terrorists of their latest weapon .
his plan is similar to one presented this week by german justice minister brigitte zypries .

" after some brothers and sisters were arrested -lrb- may allah free them -rrb- and the forum and blog of the gimf were removed , we say this : the gimf still exists and will continue its work , " a statement from the front republished by reuters said .
" to the kuffar -lrb- infidels -rrb- who try to fight us , we say : you can do what you like , make as many arrests as you like ... you will not reach your goal , " the statement continued .
" we will always keep going until we achieve victory or martyrdom . "
hunting down and shutting off radical islamist web sites is extremely difficult .
most times , the web sites relocate within minutes of being identified , showing up at new internet addresses .
taking down islamist sites a difficult job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorists use the web to recruit for future attacks " this can be done in minutes , " said harald summa , chief executive of eco , an association of german internet enterprises .
" it can be automated .
you will never catch it .
once you try to hit it , it 's already at another destination , another point . "
the reappearance of the german-language site comes at a time when the authorities in germany are on their highest alert after three men were arrested earlier this month over an alleged plot to commit " massive bomb attacks " against us interests in the country .
one of the new german gimf sites contains several online responses .
one , allegedly from a student in germany , read : " brothers , i would like to be in contact with you because i want to become a mujahedeen -lrb- warrior -rrb- after i finish my studies , inshaallah -lrb- god willing -rrb- . "
investigators said it was impossible to say whether the comment was genuine , but the german authorities have expressed great concern that the message of radical groups affiliated or sympathetic to al qaeda is now being broadcast in german .
the increase in number and the speed of these german-language sites in getting established is creating a new and difficult front for anti-terror organizations .
the gimf material was located via search engines and would have been accessible to anyone with allegiances to islamist terror groups .
germany , austria on alert after terror arrests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german anti-terror units swooped to prevent massive attacks the arrest of a suspect connected to the gimf in austria also highlights again the struggle the austrian authorities are currently engaged in with extremists in their own country .
in an unconnected operation a week after the german arrests , austrian police captured three people with alleged al qaeda links who are suspected of posting a video last march threatening attacks against germany and austria .
use of the internet for spreading propaganda and recruiting potential terrorists was an issue at this year 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in heiligendamm in germany .
the g8 leaders vowed to work together to combat " terrorist and criminal abuse " of modern communications technology in june .
meanwhile , the european union 's justice and security commissioner franco frattini is due to present proposals next month to block access to web sites that contain instructions for bomb-making in another attempt to disarm the terrorists of their latest weapon .
his plan is similar to one presented this week by german justice minister brigitte zypries .
her ministry proposed legislation that , if passed by parliament , would make the preparation of terrorist acts , as well as the instruction of such actions , a criminal offence .
if convicted , offenders would face up to 10 years in prison . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ss officer karl hoecker 's album also includes rare photos at auschwitz of josef mengele , the nazi doctor known as the " angel of death " who conducted gruesome experiments on camp inmates in the name of medicine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef mengele features in some of the auschwitz photos the photos give a rare glimpse of some of the men who ran auschwitz , enjoying time off and evidently disconnected from the horror in which more than one million nazi prisoners died .
" it 's hard to fathom the kind of people who ran these camps , " museum director sara bloomfield said .
" these unique photographs vividly illustrate the contented world they enjoyed while overseeing a world of unimaginable suffering . "
nazis seen relaxing as if on holiday hoecker , the adjutant to the death camp 's commander from may 1944 until its evacuation in january 1945 , catalogues his stay at the most notorious nazi killing site in much the same way as someone might present memories of a trip to a holiday idyll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those in the pictures seem oblivious to the horrors nearby he is seen lighting a candle on a christmas tree , petting his favourite german shepherd and passing out blueberries to young german women sitting on a fence .
other camp leaders and nazi officials also appear in the images .
in one photo , hoecker is shown laughing , flanked by young women and an accordion player , as their sing-along on a bridge is apparently cut short by the weather .
the picture carries the jaunty caption : " rain out of a clear blue sky . "
many of the pictures were taken when auschwitz 's gas chambers and crematoriums were operating at and above capacity as hungarian jews were being deported to auschwitz , the museum said .
carefree moments during the holocaust on the same day hoecker passed out blueberries to the female auxiliaries on the fence , 150 prisoners arrived on a transport to auschwitz .
the ss chose 21 men and 12 women for work , then killed the others in the gas chambers , the museum said .
when hoecker lit the christmas tree in december 1944 , soviet troops were advancing westward through what is modern poland and the camp 's liberation was just weeks away .
museum officials say the album is only the second known collection of photographs taken at auschwitz .
the album was recently donated by a retired us army intelligence officer who found it in an abandoned frankfurt apartment in 1946 , the year after world war ii ended .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz was liberated in early 1945 the nazis abandoned auschwitz in january 1945 and hoecker joined auschwitz commander richard baer in fleeing to germany .
after the third reich surrendered in may 1945 , he returned to his job at a small-town bank .
as post-war west germany increasingly confronted the nazi past , hoecker was convicted in 1965 of the murder of thousands of auschwitz inmates and served five years in prison .
he died in 2000 at age 88 in germany , according to the museum . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ss officer karl hoecker 's album also includes rare photos at auschwitz of josef mengele , the nazi doctor known as the " angel of death " who conducted gruesome experiments on camp inmates in the name of medicine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef mengele features in some of the auschwitz photos the photos give a rare glimpse of some of the men who ran auschwitz , enjoying time off and evidently disconnected from the horror in which more than one million nazi prisoners died .
" it 's hard to fathom the kind of people who ran these camps , " museum director sara bloomfield said .
" these unique photographs vividly illustrate the contented world they enjoyed while overseeing a world of unimaginable suffering . "
nazis seen relaxing as if on holiday hoecker , the adjutant to the death camp 's commander from may 1944 until its evacuation in january 1945 , catalogues his stay at the most notorious nazi killing site in much the same way as someone might present memories of a trip to a holiday idyll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those in the pictures seem oblivious to the horrors nearby he is seen lighting a candle on a christmas tree , petting his favourite german shepherd and passing out blueberries to young german women sitting on a fence .
other camp leaders and nazi officials also appear in the images .
in one photo , hoecker is shown laughing , flanked by young women and an accordion player , as their sing-along on a bridge is apparently cut short by the weather .
the picture carries the jaunty caption : " rain out of a clear blue sky . "
many of the pictures were taken when auschwitz 's gas chambers and crematoriums were operating at and above capacity as hungarian jews were being deported to auschwitz , the museum said .
carefree moments during the holocaust on the same day hoecker passed out blueberries to the female auxiliaries on the fence , 150 prisoners arrived on a transport to auschwitz .
the ss chose 21 men and 12 women for work , then killed the others in the gas chambers , the museum said .
when hoecker lit the christmas tree in december 1944 , soviet troops were advancing westward through what is modern poland and the camp 's liberation was just weeks away .
museum officials say the album is only the second known collection of photographs taken at auschwitz .
the album was recently donated by a retired us army intelligence officer who found it in an abandoned frankfurt apartment in 1946 , the year after world war ii ended .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz was liberated in early 1945 the nazis abandoned auschwitz in january 1945 and hoecker joined auschwitz commander richard baer in fleeing to germany .
after the third reich surrendered in may 1945 , he returned to his job at a small-town bank .
as post-war west germany increasingly confronted the nazi past , hoecker was convicted in 1965 of the murder of thousands of auschwitz inmates and served five years in prison .
he died in 2000 at age 88 in germany , according to the museum . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 22.09.2007 takeovers enable air berlin to expand rapidly overseas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ltu 's international routes enabled air berlin to enter the long-haul market air berlin 's latest move to buy the charter airline condor complements its acquisition of two other german carriers with an extensive network of domestic and international routes that compete with lufthansa . air berlin has squashed rumors of being a takeover candidate by going on a buying spree , gobbling up two german rivals - and eying a third .
it 's nipping at lufthansa , but still lags way behind germany 's largest airline .
within one year , air berlin , europe 's third largest low-cost airline , has greatly expanded its route system by acquiring dba , a domestic carrier , and ltu , which operates charter and scheduled flights from düsseldorf to far flung destinations in the americas , asia and africa . then on thursday , sept .
20 , air berlin announced its expansion drive to take over condor , a rival charter airline which offers long haul flights from major german cities to popular holiday destinations worldwide .
different brands for different markets air berlin is also aggressively undercutting lufthansa by offering one-way service from düsseldorf to new york at 129 euros -lrb- $ 182 -rrb- starting in november .
lufthansa 's lowest fare on the same route is currently 333 euros roundtrip .
a fresh coat of paint with the air berlin logo will appear on refurbished ltu jets heading to lucrative business destinations such as new york , los angeles and shanghai , in keeping with the company 's tradition of serving european capitals and major cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin eyes business destinations such as new york the ltu brand , however , will also remain , as it is already established moniker for holiday spots such as montego bay and the canary islands , company spokeswoman angelika schwaff said .
from budge to business class founded in 1978 by a former pan am pilot in the then divided german capital , air berlin started as a budget charter airline with two jets .
it was bought by german investors after reunification and is now the 10th largest air carrier in europe , which has been floated publicly since spring of 2006 .
the acquisition of condor , which is subject to approval from the german cartel office , would expand the air berlin group 's fleet by 35 jets to a total of 166 aircraft with another 25 wide-body boeing 787 dreamliners on order .
unlike its chief low-cost european no-frills rivals easyjet and ryanair , air berlin is more upscale and is cleverly targeting the traditional lufthansa customer in the business segment of the market , according to martina noss , an analyst who follows the german travel industry for norddeutsche landesbank . " they will be offering premium business class with more service and comfort , and will be able to use their vast domestic network from dba to feed into the long-haul ltu flights , " noss said .
" it 's a smart move to focus on the much more profitable business segment . "
but it will take time to streamline the three very different airlines that serve nearly 100 - sometimes overlapping - destinations , she added .
still the air berlin group , which carried nearly 20 million passengers last year , is valued at 854 million euros on the stock exchange and is a distant second to german behemoth lufthansa .
one of europe 's largest airlines , lufthansa has a market capitalization of 9.5 billion euros , and carried 53.4 million passengers in 2006 .
condor : the last mile for ltu 's long hauls the addition of condor , which offers a popular and exotic array of holiday destinations , would complement ltu 's long-haul flight network , air berlin ceo joachim hunold said at a press conference on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condor routes should complement the overseas network the charter airline would be purchased in two phases .
in february 2009 , air berlin would acquire a 75.1 percent of condor in a share swap with british-german travel group thomas cook , which will hold just under 30 percent of air berlin .
the deal is expected to be worth over 500 million euros , depending on the airline 's stock price in the next 17 months .
the second phase would come a year later when air berlin would exercise purchase options to acquire the remaining 24.9 percent stake in condor from lufthansa .
airline analysts said they did not expect lufthansa to oppose the deal since air berlin , even with condor , would not pose a significant threat to its core business .
segment specific air berlin is a prime example of increasing consolidation in the airline industry , where most major carriers are offering a bit of everything tailored to all market segments , according to eric heymann , an aviation and transport analyst at deutsche bank 's research group .
" there 's hardly any airline which offers only scheduled services or any purely low-cost charter airline anymore , " he said .
" various business models are converging , with airline companies offering a broad range of services for all types of travelers . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ss officer karl hoecker 's album also includes rare photos at auschwitz of josef mengele , the nazi doctor known as the " angel of death " who conducted gruesome experiments on camp inmates in the name of medicine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef mengele features in some of the auschwitz photos the photos give a rare glimpse of some of the men who ran auschwitz , enjoying time off and evidently disconnected from the horror in which more than one million nazi prisoners died .
" it 's hard to fathom the kind of people who ran these camps , " museum director sara bloomfield said .
" these unique photographs vividly illustrate the contented world they enjoyed while overseeing a world of unimaginable suffering . "
nazis seen relaxing as if on holiday hoecker , the adjutant to the death camp 's commander from may 1944 until its evacuation in january 1945 , catalogues his stay at the most notorious nazi killing site in much the same way as someone might present memories of a trip to a holiday idyll .

in one photo , hoecker is shown laughing , flanked by young women and an accordion player , as their sing-along on a bridge is apparently cut short by the weather .
the picture carries the jaunty caption : " rain out of a clear blue sky . "
many of the pictures were taken when auschwitz 's gas chambers and crematoriums were operating at and above capacity as hungarian jews were being deported to auschwitz , the museum said .
carefree moments during the holocaust on the same day hoecker passed out blueberries to the female auxiliaries on the fence , 150 prisoners arrived on a transport to auschwitz .
the ss chose 21 men and 12 women for work , then killed the others in the gas chambers , the museum said .
when hoecker lit the christmas tree in december 1944 , soviet troops were advancing westward through what is modern poland and the camp 's liberation was just weeks away .
museum officials say the album is only the second known collection of photographs taken at auschwitz .
the album was recently donated by a retired us army intelligence officer who found it in an abandoned frankfurt apartment in 1946 , the year after world war ii ended .

22 , they wo n't pursue the extradition of cia agents suspected of kidnapping a german national after washington signaled that it wo n't cooperate , according to news reports . german officials will not press their us counterparts to arrest a team of 13 cia agents , who are suspected of illegally detaining a lebanese-born german national , khaled el masri , after he was wrongfully suspected of terrorism . german newsmagazine der spiegel , in an advance report on its monday issue , wrote that berlin does not plan to forward an extradition request by munich prosecutors to arrest the agents linked to the detention of el masri in macedonia in december 2003 . masri still suffering from imprisonment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el masri is now facing criminal charges himself prosecutors issued warrants for the agents at the end of january , accusing the unnamed suspects of wrongfully imprisoning el masri and causing him serious bodily harm . el masri , 44 , told a german parliamentary inquiry he had been flown to afghanistan and tortured over a five-month period . earlier this month , he was indicted for an arson attack on a cash-and-carry market .
he is accused of setting fire to several cans of petrol and causing damage worth 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 700,000 -rrb- .

it 's nipping at lufthansa , but still lags way behind germany 's largest airline .
within one year , air berlin , europe 's third largest low-cost airline , has greatly expanded its route system by acquiring dba , a domestic carrier , and ltu , which operates charter and scheduled flights from düsseldorf to far flung destinations in the americas , asia and africa . then on thursday , sept .
20 , air berlin announced its expansion drive to take over condor , a rival charter airline which offers long haul flights from major german cities to popular holiday destinations worldwide .
different brands for different markets air berlin is also aggressively undercutting lufthansa by offering one-way service from düsseldorf to new york at 129 euros -lrb- $ 182 -rrb- starting in november .
lufthansa 's lowest fare on the same route is currently 333 euros roundtrip .
a fresh coat of paint with the air berlin logo will appear on refurbished ltu jets heading to lucrative business destinations such as new york , los angeles and shanghai , in keeping with the company 's tradition of serving european capitals and major cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air berlin eyes business destinations such as new york the ltu brand , however , will also remain , as it is already established moniker for holiday spots such as montego bay and the canary islands , company spokeswoman angelika schwaff said .
from budge to business class founded in 1978 by a former pan am pilot in the then divided german capital , air berlin started as a budget charter airline with two jets .
it was bought by german investors after reunification and is now the 10th largest air carrier in europe , which has been floated publicly since spring of 2006 .
the acquisition of condor , which is subject to approval from the german cartel office , would expand the air berlin group 's fleet by 35 jets to a total of 166 aircraft with another 25 wide-body boeing 787 dreamliners on order .
unlike its chief low-cost european no-frills rivals easyjet and ryanair , air berlin is more upscale and is cleverly targeting the traditional lufthansa customer in the business segment of the market , according to martina noss , an analyst who follows the german travel industry for norddeutsche landesbank . " they will be offering premium business class with more service and comfort , and will be able to use their vast domestic network from dba to feed into the long-haul ltu flights , " noss said .
" it 's a smart move to focus on the much more profitable business segment . "
but it will take time to streamline the three very different airlines that serve nearly 100 - sometimes overlapping - destinations , she added .
still the air berlin group , which carried nearly 20 million passengers last year , is valued at 854 million euros on the stock exchange and is a distant second to german behemoth lufthansa .
one of europe 's largest airlines , lufthansa has a market capitalization of 9.5 billion euros , and carried 53.4 million passengers in 2006 .
condor : the last mile for ltu 's long hauls the addition of condor , which offers a popular and exotic array of holiday destinations , would complement ltu 's long-haul flight network , air berlin ceo joachim hunold said at a press conference on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condor routes should complement the overseas network the charter airline would be purchased in two phases .
in february 2009 , air berlin would acquire a 75.1 percent of condor in a share swap with british-german travel group thomas cook , which will hold just under 30 percent of air berlin .
the deal is expected to be worth over 500 million euros , depending on the airline 's stock price in the next 17 months .
the second phase would come a year later when air berlin would exercise purchase options to acquire the remaining 24.9 percent stake in condor from lufthansa .
airline analysts said they did not expect lufthansa to oppose the deal since air berlin , even with condor , would not pose a significant threat to its core business .
segment specific air berlin is a prime example of increasing consolidation in the airline industry , where most major carriers are offering a bit of everything tailored to all market segments , according to eric heymann , an aviation and transport analyst at deutsche bank 's research group .

ss officer karl hoecker 's album also includes rare photos at auschwitz of josef mengele , the nazi doctor known as the " angel of death " who conducted gruesome experiments on camp inmates in the name of medicine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef mengele features in some of the auschwitz photos the photos give a rare glimpse of some of the men who ran auschwitz , enjoying time off and evidently disconnected from the horror in which more than one million nazi prisoners died .
" it 's hard to fathom the kind of people who ran these camps , " museum director sara bloomfield said .
" these unique photographs vividly illustrate the contented world they enjoyed while overseeing a world of unimaginable suffering . "
nazis seen relaxing as if on holiday hoecker , the adjutant to the death camp 's commander from may 1944 until its evacuation in january 1945 , catalogues his stay at the most notorious nazi killing site in much the same way as someone might present memories of a trip to a holiday idyll .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those in the pictures seem oblivious to the horrors nearby he is seen lighting a candle on a christmas tree , petting his favourite german shepherd and passing out blueberries to young german women sitting on a fence .
other camp leaders and nazi officials also appear in the images .
in one photo , hoecker is shown laughing , flanked by young women and an accordion player , as their sing-along on a bridge is apparently cut short by the weather .
the picture carries the jaunty caption : " rain out of a clear blue sky . "
many of the pictures were taken when auschwitz 's gas chambers and crematoriums were operating at and above capacity as hungarian jews were being deported to auschwitz , the museum said .
carefree moments during the holocaust on the same day hoecker passed out blueberries to the female auxiliaries on the fence , 150 prisoners arrived on a transport to auschwitz .
the ss chose 21 men and 12 women for work , then killed the others in the gas chambers , the museum said .
when hoecker lit the christmas tree in december 1944 , soviet troops were advancing westward through what is modern poland and the camp 's liberation was just weeks away .
museum officials say the album is only the second known collection of photographs taken at auschwitz .
the album was recently donated by a retired us army intelligence officer who found it in an abandoned frankfurt apartment in 1946 , the year after world war ii ended .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz was liberated in early 1945 the nazis abandoned auschwitz in january 1945 and hoecker joined auschwitz commander richard baer in fleeing to germany .
after the third reich surrendered in may 1945 , he returned to his job at a small-town bank .
as post-war west germany increasingly confronted the nazi past , hoecker was convicted in 1965 of the murder of thousands of auschwitz inmates and served five years in prison .
he died in 2000 at age 88 in germany , according to the museum . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gen sir richard dannatt said soldiers were sometimes greeted with indifference on returning from service .
he contrasted the attitude in britain with support for soldiers among people in the united states .
a " willingness to serve in such an atmosphere again " could be sapped , he said in a speech in london .
when a young soldier has been fighting in basra or helmand , he wants to know that the people in their local pub know and understand what he has been doing and why gen dannatt is britain failing its soldiers ?
gen dannatt 's speech gen dannatt told the international institute for strategic studies : " soldiers want to be understood and they want to be respected for their commitment .
" when a young soldier has been fighting in basra or helmand , he wants to know that the people in their local pub know and understand what he has been doing and why . "
" soldiers are genuinely concerned when they come back from iraq to hear the population that sent them being occasionally dismissive or indifferent about their achievements , " he added .
gen dannatt compared the situations in the uk and the us , where firms offer discounts to serving soldiers and people shake the hand of those in uniform .
he said that , in the uk , " we still have a nation that , at times , seems immune to homeless and psychologically-damaged soldiers " .
" as operational commitments have become more intense , so has the need for support from the nation , " he said .

christopher lee , historian " we must move from being a society that uses the military as a political and media football and more towards seeing the military for what it is . "
that was " the instrument of foreign policy conducted by a democratically-elected government acting in the name of the people " .
but the historian christopher lee told bbc radio 4 's today programme that there was a long-standing british tradition of wanting to turn a blind eye to returning soldiers .
he said : " the british have a sort of tradition , or traditional habit , of saying the war 's over now , so please we do n't really want to talk about it .
" i 'm not sure he 's right about a growing gulf .
i think it is something that has always been there . "
in response to gen dannatt 's calls for home-coming parades for british soldiers , mr lee said : " what victory parade would you have ?
what victory has there been ? "
campaign support gen dannatt also called for a radical rethink on the equipment used in the british army .
he said that " too often we have been seduced by high technology " .
i think the real problem is that the armed forces are at war and the country is n't major general patrick cordingley he called for more money to be spent on " getting the very lowest level right " .
this involved " equipping the man first and building the system around him " , gen dannatt added .
major general patrick cordingley , who commanded the desert rats during the 1991 gulf war , agreed there was a lack of understanding about the role of armed forces in iraq and afghanistan .
" i think the real problem is that the armed forces are at war and the country is n't , therefore there is an inevitable misunderstanding of what our armed forces are doing , " he told bbc news 24 .
there was a great difference between the public 's attitude to the first gulf war and the second , he said .
" the first gulf war was seen to be just , was seen to be the correct thing to do and the country was right behind everybody who went down and what went on .
" the second gulf war was a very different situation indeed - probably not just , perhaps not even legal and a 50-50 split in the country - not a popular war . "
he added that he believed the media and the ministry of defence were partly to blame for not explaining what members of the armed forces were doing in iraq and afghanistan .

that was " the instrument of foreign policy conducted by a democratically-elected government acting in the name of the people " .
but the historian christopher lee told bbc radio 4 's today programme that there was a long-standing british tradition of wanting to turn a blind eye to returning soldiers .
he said : " the british have a sort of tradition , or traditional habit , of saying the war 's over now , so please we do n't really want to talk about it .
" i 'm not sure he 's right about a growing gulf .

he added that he believed the media and the ministry of defence were partly to blame for not explaining what members of the armed forces were doing in iraq and afghanistan .

he said : " the british have a sort of tradition , or traditional habit , of saying the war 's over now , so please we do n't really want to talk about it .
" i 'm not sure he 's right about a growing gulf .

" the second gulf war was a very different situation indeed - probably not just , perhaps not even legal and a 50-50 split in the country - not a popular war . "
he added that he believed the media and the ministry of defence were partly to blame for not explaining what members of the armed forces were doing in iraq and afghanistan .

bbc news -pipe- europe -pipe- will the french buy sarkozy reforms ?

by emma jane kirby bbc news , paris watching nicolas sarkozy 's pension and civil service reform speeches this week , i was struck by the number of times he used emphatic phrases such as " i will not give in " and " i will see this through to end " juxtaposed with conciliatory terms like " negotiation " and " by mutual agreement " .
president sarkozy insists that france needs to change and that nothing will derail his ambitious programme of reform .
but at the same time , he is not so confident as to ignore the warnings of history .
the last time a government tried to interfere with pension benefits back in 1995 , the country reacted with three weeks of mass strikes which brought the nation to a grinding halt .
unions mobilising with that in mind , the president has to tread a little more cautiously than he would like .
france 's powerful unions are already mobilising .
the big transport unions have called for a day of action on 17 october and may well be supported by others .
they are responding to the president 's announcement on tuesday that he is proposing to end the pension perks enjoyed by some public sector workers , like train drivers and electricity workers , which allow them to retire on full benefits as early as 50 .
the scheme was created in the post-war era to attract skilled workers for the reconstruction effort and was also in recompense for jobs which , at the time , were thought to be dangerous .
such a system now costs the government around 6bn euros -lrb- £ 4.18bn ; $ 8bn -rrb- a year and mr sarkozy insists the state coffers simply do not have enough money any more for these generous handouts .
only if negotiations with the unions fail would he force through a solution , he promised , but the unions are clearly taking no chances .
a day after he announced the proposed pension reforms , the french president declared that with more than 5 million civil servants , france is a little top heavy and needs to be pruned back .
over the past 20 years , the state has hired nearly a million extra civil servants whose function has not always been too clear .
under the new plans , one out of two public servant retirees would not be replaced while other workers could be bought out .

by emma jane kirby bbc news , paris mr sarkozy has ruffled union feathers with his reform plans watching nicolas sarkozy 's pension and civil service reform speeches this week , i was struck by the number of times he used emphatic phrases such as " i will not give in " and " i will see this through to end " juxtaposed with conciliatory terms like " negotiation " and " by mutual agreement " .
president sarkozy insists that france needs to change and that nothing will derail his ambitious programme of reform .
but at the same time , he is not so confident as to ignore the warnings of history .
the last time a government tried to interfere with pension benefits back in 1995 , the country reacted with three weeks of mass strikes which brought the nation to a grinding halt .
unions mobilising with that in mind , the president has to tread a little more cautiously than he would like .
france 's powerful unions are already mobilising .
the big transport unions have called for a day of action on 17 october and may well be supported by others .
they are responding to the president 's announcement on tuesday that he is proposing to end the pension perks enjoyed by some public sector workers , like train drivers and electricity workers , which allow them to retire on full benefits as early as 50 .
the scheme was created in the post-war era to attract skilled workers for the reconstruction effort and was also in recompense for jobs which , at the time , were thought to be dangerous .
mr sarkozy 's high approval ratings leave him room to gamble such a system now costs the government around 6bn euros -lrb- £ 4.18bn ; $ 8bn -rrb- a year and mr sarkozy insists the state coffers simply do not have enough money any more for these generous handouts .
only if negotiations with the unions fail would he force through a solution , he promised , but the unions are clearly taking no chances .
a day after he announced the proposed pension reforms , the french president declared that with more than 5 million civil servants , france is a little top heavy and needs to be pruned back .

dog with a bone but can he promise them that his proposed public service cuts will not leave their hospitals or state-run child care facilities under-staffed ?
despite a small drop , sarkozy 's high approval ratings give him some room to gamble .
the unions may be calling for a strike , but after 12 years of what many saw as inertia under jacques chirac , this new , younger man of action is largely admired .
his speeches may be a little repetitive , indeed some in the french press complain he is a bit like a stuck record .
but nicolas sarkozy remains true to his election mantra : " work more to earn more . "
like a dog with a bone , the president will not let it drop .
if mr sarkozy has his way , not only will pension perks and surplus civil servants go , but the rules of the 35-hour week which he blames for hiking unemployment will also be further relaxed .
france elected this man because they wanted change - but will there be just too many changes for the french to stomach all at once ?
