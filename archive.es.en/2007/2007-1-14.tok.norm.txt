" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film " the road to guantanamo " by michael winterbottom a madrid tribunal specializing in terrorist cases in october 2006 also released another former guantanamo inmate , lahcen ikassrien , saying there was no proof that he belonged to a spanish al qaeda cell . nine british citizens were arrested upon their return from cuba but not charged with any offense .
no proceedings were brought against a turk living in germany , nor against a swede and a dane with dual algerian nationality . " the reason there 's been no successful prosecution is because the overwhelming majority of people have n't committed a crime , " lawyer clive stafford-smith , who has represented several guantanamo detainees , told the afp news agency .
" it 's indicative of the fact that a lot of innocent people were swept up in the net . " catalogue of horrors all the men 's gave similar accounts of what happened to them in guantanamo .

14 , 2002 .
five years later , the bundeswehr is still active in afghanistan and peace seems far off . representatives from four of afghanistan 's political groups met with united nations officials outside bonn on nov .
27 , 2001 to discuss democratic reconstruction in the war-torn country .
the following week , the group of diplomats signed the bonn agreement , setting the future course for the international cooperation in afghanistan . the architects of the treaty agreed it was impossible to attain stability without international involvement . while the us-led mission enduring freedom was conceived primarily to counter the taliban militias and the al qaeda terror organization , the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- was put in place by the un in late december 2001 to contribute to security in kabul and surrounding areas . mission expanded , mandate extended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thirty-seven countries have sent soldiers to be part of isaf at the outset , isaf was comprised of 4,000 soldiers from 18 countries , including germany , and mandated for one year . the residents of kabul had lived with violence for years and many were ambivalent toward the isaf mission , which quickly extended its initial mandate . " my feeling was that the international community had decided to put an end to the continuous war in afghanistan , " karim wahidi , a civil servant in kabul , said about the first isaf troops in kabul .
" we were hopeful that we would never see the war criminals in power again . " at the petition of the afghan government and with the support of the un , it was decided at the nato summit in istanbul in june 2004 that the isaf mission should gradually be expanded to cover all of afghanistan - even the more peaceful areas in the north and northeast . meanwhile , isaf had grown to 33,000 soldiers from 37 countries .
this included 2,700 troops from the german bundeswehr , mainly stationed in the north . mixed reactions from residents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is a crucial part of reconstruction afghans in the quieter northern parts of the country tend to be more satisfied with the foreign peacekeeping mission than the people living in the south . " the situation in puli khomri is very good , " soraya said about the town where she studies in northern afghanistan .
" isaf provides for people 's security and helps us . " german troops are active in the province reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in the north , where they seek to contribute to the country 's precarious development process and prevent violence . in the south , however , where civilians are surrounded by combat situations , the attitudes are noticably more bitter . " the mood has changed in kandahar , " said abdul qadiem patyal , a journalist in southern afghanistan .
" at first , the people saw isaf as a source of stability and security .
unfortunately , the situation has changed , and isaf is facing hate and rejection from the people .
isaf reacts hastily and nervously - to suicide attacks , for example - which means that civilians also get wounded or killed . " civilian death toll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has requested german reconnaissance planes in afghanistan the radical islamic uprising in afghanistan , particularly in the south , took a toll of 4,000 lives last year alone .
around 1,000 of those were civilians . " i believe that 's the only mistake that we 've made , " said isaf spokesperson richard nugee .
" we 're making a huge effort to avoid civilian deaths in the coming year . " five years after the start of germany 's mandate in afghanistan , the talk in berlin is centered on expanding involvement rather than reducing it .
nato has asked germany to send five to six tornado reconnaissance places for use throughout the whole country . the 250 soldiers that would accompany the planes could potentially be deployed to the more dangerous combat areas in the south .
the german government has said it will decide in january on sending the planes . said musa samimy -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany may send spy planes to southern afghanistan germany said it would decide soon whether to send tornado jets for reconnaissance duties to violence-wracked southern afghanistan in order to bolster nato forces .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film " the road to guantanamo " by michael winterbottom a madrid tribunal specializing in terrorist cases in october 2006 also released another former guantanamo inmate , lahcen ikassrien , saying there was no proof that he belonged to a spanish al qaeda cell . nine british citizens were arrested upon their return from cuba but not charged with any offense .
no proceedings were brought against a turk living in germany , nor against a swede and a dane with dual algerian nationality . " the reason there 's been no successful prosecution is because the overwhelming majority of people have n't committed a crime , " lawyer clive stafford-smith , who has represented several guantanamo detainees , told the afp news agency .
" it 's indicative of the fact that a lot of innocent people were swept up in the net . " catalogue of horrors all the men 's gave similar accounts of what happened to them in guantanamo . " there was always psychological torture , but the last month they used more physical torture , " mehdi ghezali told swedish radio a month after his return to sweden in july 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz came back to germany in 2006 german-born turk murat kurnaz - who spent four years in guantanamo between 2002 and 2006 - said he would be given electric shocks on his feet if he refused to admit he was a member of al qaeda . " our treatment at guantanamo was worse than animals , " slimane hadj abderahamane said on his 2004 return to denmark . french detainees described being kicked , punched and insulted , chained to the floor by their hands and threatened with dogs or shotguns during interrogation . ikassrien , who said he spent three months with his hands and feet shackled , recounted how he was asked , but refused , to sign an agreement to allow his gangrenous arm to be amputated .
in one instance , he said he spent three days in a container with rats , naked and without food or water . writing to deal with the past the former detainees have dealt with the aftermath of their imprisonment in different ways , some preferring silence , others using their position to speak out against guantanamo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shafiq rasul , left , ruhal ahmed , center and asif iqbal are the tipton three shafiq rasul , ruhal ahmed and asif iqbal - known as the " tipton taliban " after their hometown in england 's west midlands - and jamal al-harith , from manchester , england , have sought damages in the us courts . two of the former french prisoners have also taken the legal route , bringing action for " arbitrary detention , kidnap and illegal confinement " ; a third wants damages for " kidnap , illegal confinement " and " acts of torture and cruelty . " the tipton three have actively campaigned with amnesty international for the camp 's closure and were the subject of a docu-drama , " the road to guantanamo , " directed by michael winterbottom . another of the nine britons held , moazzam begg , has been equally vocal and wrote a book - " enemy combatant : a british muslim 's journey to guantanamo and back " - about his experiences .

14 , 2002 .
five years later , the bundeswehr is still active in afghanistan and peace seems far off . representatives from four of afghanistan 's political groups met with united nations officials outside bonn on nov .
27 , 2001 to discuss democratic reconstruction in the war-torn country .
the following week , the group of diplomats signed the bonn agreement , setting the future course for the international cooperation in afghanistan . the architects of the treaty agreed it was impossible to attain stability without international involvement . while the us-led mission enduring freedom was conceived primarily to counter the taliban militias and the al qaeda terror organization , the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- was put in place by the un in late december 2001 to contribute to security in kabul and surrounding areas . mission expanded , mandate extended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thirty-seven countries have sent soldiers to be part of isaf at the outset , isaf was comprised of 4,000 soldiers from 18 countries , including germany , and mandated for one year . the residents of kabul had lived with violence for years and many were ambivalent toward the isaf mission , which quickly extended its initial mandate . " my feeling was that the international community had decided to put an end to the continuous war in afghanistan , " karim wahidi , a civil servant in kabul , said about the first isaf troops in kabul .
" we were hopeful that we would never see the war criminals in power again . " at the petition of the afghan government and with the support of the un , it was decided at the nato summit in istanbul in june 2004 that the isaf mission should gradually be expanded to cover all of afghanistan - even the more peaceful areas in the north and northeast . meanwhile , isaf had grown to 33,000 soldiers from 37 countries .
this included 2,700 troops from the german bundeswehr , mainly stationed in the north . mixed reactions from residents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is a crucial part of reconstruction afghans in the quieter northern parts of the country tend to be more satisfied with the foreign peacekeeping mission than the people living in the south . " the situation in puli khomri is very good , " soraya said about the town where she studies in northern afghanistan .
" isaf provides for people 's security and helps us . " german troops are active in the province reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in the north , where they seek to contribute to the country 's precarious development process and prevent violence . in the south , however , where civilians are surrounded by combat situations , the attitudes are noticably more bitter . " the mood has changed in kandahar , " said abdul qadiem patyal , a journalist in southern afghanistan .
" at first , the people saw isaf as a source of stability and security .
unfortunately , the situation has changed , and isaf is facing hate and rejection from the people .
isaf reacts hastily and nervously - to suicide attacks , for example - which means that civilians also get wounded or killed . " civilian death toll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has requested german reconnaissance planes in afghanistan the radical islamic uprising in afghanistan , particularly in the south , took a toll of 4,000 lives last year alone .
around 1,000 of those were civilians . " i believe that 's the only mistake that we 've made , " said isaf spokesperson richard nugee .
" we 're making a huge effort to avoid civilian deaths in the coming year . " five years after the start of germany 's mandate in afghanistan , the talk in berlin is centered on expanding involvement rather than reducing it .

14 to 16 . germany currently runs the rotating presidency of the eu . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble has said he would seek to broaden access to asylum-seekers ' fingerprints for both eu police and justice authorities .
at present such data can only be used by asylum officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble for the first time , eu ministers are also expected to look at ways of opening up channels for legal immigration to help combat labor shortages in europe .
however , the focus will be on giving foreigners temporary migration opportunities to meet specific eu labor market needs . eu officials have said that the bloc must try to attract economic migrants , " particularly those who are highly skilled , " to compensate for falling birth rates and an ageing population .
member states , however , would keep their right to determine national quotas on immigration .
eu officials say about half a million illegal immigrants enter the bloc each year .
spain , italy and greece are in the front line in the struggle to curb the flow .

however , the focus will be on giving foreigners temporary migration opportunities to meet specific eu labor market needs . eu officials have said that the bloc must try to attract economic migrants , " particularly those who are highly skilled , " to compensate for falling birth rates and an ageing population .
member states , however , would keep their right to determine national quotas on immigration .
eu officials say about half a million illegal immigrants enter the bloc each year .
spain , italy and greece are in the front line in the struggle to curb the flow .

14 , 2002 .
five years later , the bundeswehr is still active in afghanistan and peace seems far off . representatives from four of afghanistan 's political groups met with united nations officials outside bonn on nov .
27 , 2001 to discuss democratic reconstruction in the war-torn country .
the following week , the group of diplomats signed the bonn agreement , setting the future course for the international cooperation in afghanistan . the architects of the treaty agreed it was impossible to attain stability without international involvement . while the us-led mission enduring freedom was conceived primarily to counter the taliban militias and the al qaeda terror organization , the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- was put in place by the un in late december 2001 to contribute to security in kabul and surrounding areas . mission expanded , mandate extended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thirty-seven countries have sent soldiers to be part of isaf at the outset , isaf was comprised of 4,000 soldiers from 18 countries , including germany , and mandated for one year . the residents of kabul had lived with violence for years and many were ambivalent toward the isaf mission , which quickly extended its initial mandate . " my feeling was that the international community had decided to put an end to the continuous war in afghanistan , " karim wahidi , a civil servant in kabul , said about the first isaf troops in kabul .
" we were hopeful that we would never see the war criminals in power again . " at the petition of the afghan government and with the support of the un , it was decided at the nato summit in istanbul in june 2004 that the isaf mission should gradually be expanded to cover all of afghanistan - even the more peaceful areas in the north and northeast . meanwhile , isaf had grown to 33,000 soldiers from 37 countries .
this included 2,700 troops from the german bundeswehr , mainly stationed in the north . mixed reactions from residents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is a crucial part of reconstruction afghans in the quieter northern parts of the country tend to be more satisfied with the foreign peacekeeping mission than the people living in the south . " the situation in puli khomri is very good , " soraya said about the town where she studies in northern afghanistan .
" isaf provides for people 's security and helps us . " german troops are active in the province reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in the north , where they seek to contribute to the country 's precarious development process and prevent violence . in the south , however , where civilians are surrounded by combat situations , the attitudes are noticably more bitter . " the mood has changed in kandahar , " said abdul qadiem patyal , a journalist in southern afghanistan .
" at first , the people saw isaf as a source of stability and security .
unfortunately , the situation has changed , and isaf is facing hate and rejection from the people .
isaf reacts hastily and nervously - to suicide attacks , for example - which means that civilians also get wounded or killed . " civilian death toll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has requested german reconnaissance planes in afghanistan the radical islamic uprising in afghanistan , particularly in the south , took a toll of 4,000 lives last year alone .
around 1,000 of those were civilians . " i believe that 's the only mistake that we 've made , " said isaf spokesperson richard nugee .
" we 're making a huge effort to avoid civilian deaths in the coming year . " five years after the start of germany 's mandate in afghanistan , the talk in berlin is centered on expanding involvement rather than reducing it .
nato has asked germany to send five to six tornado reconnaissance places for use throughout the whole country . the 250 soldiers that would accompany the planes could potentially be deployed to the more dangerous combat areas in the south .
the german government has said it will decide in january on sending the planes . said musa samimy -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany may send spy planes to southern afghanistan germany said it would decide soon whether to send tornado jets for reconnaissance duties to violence-wracked southern afghanistan in order to bolster nato forces .

14 , 2002 .
five years later , the bundeswehr is still active in afghanistan and peace seems far off . representatives from four of afghanistan 's political groups met with united nations officials outside bonn on nov .
27 , 2001 to discuss democratic reconstruction in the war-torn country .
the following week , the group of diplomats signed the bonn agreement , setting the future course for the international cooperation in afghanistan . the architects of the treaty agreed it was impossible to attain stability without international involvement . while the us-led mission enduring freedom was conceived primarily to counter the taliban militias and the al qaeda terror organization , the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- was put in place by the un in late december 2001 to contribute to security in kabul and surrounding areas . mission expanded , mandate extended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thirty-seven countries have sent soldiers to be part of isaf at the outset , isaf was comprised of 4,000 soldiers from 18 countries , including germany , and mandated for one year . the residents of kabul had lived with violence for years and many were ambivalent toward the isaf mission , which quickly extended its initial mandate . " my feeling was that the international community had decided to put an end to the continuous war in afghanistan , " karim wahidi , a civil servant in kabul , said about the first isaf troops in kabul .
" we were hopeful that we would never see the war criminals in power again . " at the petition of the afghan government and with the support of the un , it was decided at the nato summit in istanbul in june 2004 that the isaf mission should gradually be expanded to cover all of afghanistan - even the more peaceful areas in the north and northeast . meanwhile , isaf had grown to 33,000 soldiers from 37 countries .
this included 2,700 troops from the german bundeswehr , mainly stationed in the north . mixed reactions from residents bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is a crucial part of reconstruction afghans in the quieter northern parts of the country tend to be more satisfied with the foreign peacekeeping mission than the people living in the south . " the situation in puli khomri is very good , " soraya said about the town where she studies in northern afghanistan .
" isaf provides for people 's security and helps us . " german troops are active in the province reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- in the north , where they seek to contribute to the country 's precarious development process and prevent violence . in the south , however , where civilians are surrounded by combat situations , the attitudes are noticably more bitter . " the mood has changed in kandahar , " said abdul qadiem patyal , a journalist in southern afghanistan .
" at first , the people saw isaf as a source of stability and security .
unfortunately , the situation has changed , and isaf is facing hate and rejection from the people .
isaf reacts hastily and nervously - to suicide attacks , for example - which means that civilians also get wounded or killed . " civilian death toll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato has requested german reconnaissance planes in afghanistan the radical islamic uprising in afghanistan , particularly in the south , took a toll of 4,000 lives last year alone .
around 1,000 of those were civilians . " i believe that 's the only mistake that we 've made , " said isaf spokesperson richard nugee .
" we 're making a huge effort to avoid civilian deaths in the coming year . " five years after the start of germany 's mandate in afghanistan , the talk in berlin is centered on expanding involvement rather than reducing it .
nato has asked germany to send five to six tornado reconnaissance places for use throughout the whole country . the 250 soldiers that would accompany the planes could potentially be deployed to the more dangerous combat areas in the south .
the german government has said it will decide in january on sending the planes . said musa samimy -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany may send spy planes to southern afghanistan germany said it would decide soon whether to send tornado jets for reconnaissance duties to violence-wracked southern afghanistan in order to bolster nato forces .

" our treatment at guantanamo was worse than animals , " slimane hadj abderahamane said on his 2004 return to denmark . french detainees described being kicked , punched and insulted , chained to the floor by their hands and threatened with dogs or shotguns during interrogation . ikassrien , who said he spent three months with his hands and feet shackled , recounted how he was asked , but refused , to sign an agreement to allow his gangrenous arm to be amputated .
in one instance , he said he spent three days in a container with rats , naked and without food or water . writing to deal with the past the former detainees have dealt with the aftermath of their imprisonment in different ways , some preferring silence , others using their position to speak out against guantanamo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shafiq rasul , left , ruhal ahmed , center and asif iqbal are the tipton three shafiq rasul , ruhal ahmed and asif iqbal - known as the " tipton taliban " after their hometown in england 's west midlands - and jamal al-harith , from manchester , england , have sought damages in the us courts . two of the former french prisoners have also taken the legal route , bringing action for " arbitrary detention , kidnap and illegal confinement " ; a third wants damages for " kidnap , illegal confinement " and " acts of torture and cruelty . " the tipton three have actively campaigned with amnesty international for the camp 's closure and were the subject of a docu-drama , " the road to guantanamo , " directed by michael winterbottom . another of the nine britons held , moazzam begg , has been equally vocal and wrote a book - " enemy combatant : a british muslim 's journey to guantanamo and back " - about his experiences .

" forced sex work in nazi concentration camps " covers a system that ran in 10 camps between 1942 and 1945 .
most of the women involved were prisoners at ravensbrück , about 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- north of berlin . male prisoners were allowed visits to the sex slaves to boost their productivity in the nazi arms factories during world war ii . the foundation said that encouraging sex with women was also a means of curbing homosexuality , which the nazis feared would " break out " among male prisoners confined to their own camps . trauma and shame women who were held at the brothels often suffered enduring psychological trauma and many did not apply for reparations after their liberation in 1945 due to the shame they felt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people from 40 nations were imprisoned at ravensbrück forced prostitution in concentration camps was the subject of an exhibition in vienna in 2005 . the new exhibit at ravensbrück , which runs until sept .

nine police forces and police authorities responsible for patrolling the country 's largest airports will meet airport bosses this week .
a spokesman for the metropolitan police authority said heathrow owner baa pays £ 38m a year for police patrols , £ 10m less than it costs scotland yard .
eight other airports are legally obliged to pay towards policing .
gatwick , stansted , birmingham , manchester , prestwick , edinburgh , glasgow and aberdeen are also covered by the 1982 civil aviation act .
mpa chairman len duvall said : " it is unfair to expect taxpayers to have to bear the costs for policing what are commercial enterprises , often earning huge profits .
funding issue " police forces spend a substantial amount of their resources on keeping our major airports safe - a position made more vital due to the increased threat from terrorism .
" we need to work out an equitable agreement that enables us to maintain cover at our airports , keep all airport users safe and ensure we do not have an excessive drain on our budgets to the detriment of our wider police services . "
a spokesman for baa - which runs six of the nine airports which pay for policing - said the funding issue was already being reviewed by the government .
" we look forward to working with the mpa on this and await the findings of the current report into the financing of designated airports , " he added .
the meeting will be at heathrow on tuesday .

some were also poisoned by swallowing lead weights used for fishing before they were banned .
local anglers ' said it was not always possible to retrieve tackle .
dan sidley , co-founder of the charity , said they had boxes full of discarded fishing line and lead weights that had been removed from swans .
lead weight ban he said : " many of the swans that are brought in here die because they have ingested lead weights and it 's horrific .
" the amount of line we take off these swans is sickening and it does need to be addressed . "
bob hutchinson , from the york and district anglers , said : " it 's not a case of anglers leaving tackle or losing tackle or throwing it away .
" it 's quite expensive so they tend not to throw it away .
" it 's unfortunate that sometimes a bird does get hurt but anglers do try to retrieve the tackle but sometimes they are not able to and unfortunately that 's where the problem occurs . "
