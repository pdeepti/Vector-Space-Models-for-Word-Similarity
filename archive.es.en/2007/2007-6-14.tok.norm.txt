the change implements 11 eu guidelines and affects areas such as spousal immigration , integration and residency regulations . the 500 pages of the new rules were approved by 398 of the parliament 's 614 members , with the no votes coming from opposition parties , but also from some members of the social democratic party , a partner in germany 's current ruling coalition . besides incorporating eu guidelines on immigration into national law , the reform adds further amendments to an immigration law passed in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reform package did not pass the bundestag without opposition the government 's plan is aimed at cracking down on forced marriages , requiring that a spouse be 18 before entering the country .
in line with the moves in other nations , berlin has also introduced a requirement for those seeking to move to the country to have basic german language skills .
some foreigners entering the country will be asked to provide a digital photograph and fingerprints . under the law about 100,000 foreigners whose applications for asylum have been rejected will be able to stay in the country indefinitely provided they find a job by the end of 2009 . following are some of the key areas of the reform : new rules for spouses spouses who are citizens of non-eu countries can only join their partners if they are over the age of 18 and can demonstrate a basic knowledge of german before coming , although citizens who do not normally need visas to come to germany , such as americans or japanese , do not have to demonstrate ability in german .
there are also exceptions for highly skilled workers and entrepreneurs .
the age requirement is meant to discourage forced marriages . integration courses obligatory integration course have been introduced .
if foreigners refuse to take the courses , they can be fined .
those on social welfare can have their benefits cut by up to 30 percent . labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : highly skilled workers or those founding companies in germany will have it easier it will be easier for foreigners to immigrate who wish to invest or create jobs in germany .
the reform lowers the minimum investment amount from one million to 500,000 euros -lrb- from roughly $ 1.3 million to $ 665,000 -rrb- and the number of jobs created from 10 to five . domestic security as a reaction to the suitcases bomb plot of july 2006 , applicants for visas exceeding three months will be fingerprinted and " reference persons " for applicants in germany can be investigated by security services . citizenship in order to gain citizenship , foreigners will in future attest that they " understand the legal and societal systems and way of life in germany . " right of residence a right of residence section of the reform provides a grandfather clause for foreigners who have been in the country for years with " tolerated " status .
they will have the right to stay if , as of july 1 , they have lived in germany for at least eight years .
for families with children , the requirement is six years .
they must also be self-supporting , able to speak german and have no criminal record .
those without jobs will be given probationary period and have until the end of 2009 to find work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one critic slammed the reform as " racial classification " according to economic usefulness critics argue the reform goes beyond what the eu requires and makes life worse for many immigrants already living in germany , while making immigration in general more difficult .
hartfrid wolff , a parliamentarian with the free-market liberal fdp party , called the reform " piecemeal , " and lacking an overall concept on controlling and guiding immigration .
green party politician josef winkler went further , calling the draft " harmful , cheap and disgraceful . " but german interior minister wolfgang schäuble defended the compromise and praised in particular the parts of the reform which encourage integration . " integration has to work , " he said , adding that the federal , state and local governments all must work together toward that goal . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he could be a killer a squirrel with aggression issues acted out in the southern german town of passau , injuring three people before his last victim finished him off with a crutch . the bavarian town of passau , on the austrian border , is usually a fairly quiet place , with man and nature living in relative harmony .
but this week , the bucolic balance was thrown off when a squirrel went berserk , terrorizing three in a biting rampage that ended only with his death . his first victim was a 70-year-old woman , who was sitting peacefully in her living room when she was surprised by the sensation of small claws on her back .
the squirrel had jumped through a window and onto the woman , soon sinking its teeth into her hand .
acorns were n't on this little guy 's mind , arteries apparently were . terrified , the woman ran out into the street in a panic , managing to shake the squirrel off . but the creature , whipped into a frenzy , immediately found another victim .
he jumped onto a nearby construction worker , injuring him on the hand and arm .
the fellow was finally able to fight the furry demon off with a measuring pole . still on the hunt for blood , the tiny terror then ran into the garden of a 72-year-old retiree . " the squirrel massively attacked him on the arms , hand and thigh , " said a local police spokesperson .
so the senior citizen used the only weapon at his disposal - his crutch . he clubbed the ruthless rodent to death . how the squirrel obtained his bloodlust is still unclear , although experts have said its behavior could be linked to the mating season or the squirrel could have been diseased . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is developing a space tourist plane to be completed by 2012 . the space arm of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- has announced plans to develop a spacecraft for tourists .
the vessel would offer travelers a 90-minute suborbital flight , including three minutes of weightlessness , at an altitude of more than 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- . according to francois auque , the president of eads astrium , the fare in space could total some 150,000 to 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 200,000 - $ 267,000 -rrb- .
this compared to $ 25 million for the few space tourists flying in the narrow capsule of the russian rocket " soyuz , " auque said . the russian space authority currently holds the monopoly in space tourism .
it offers flights to the international space station iss . " we are offering a profitable system and have given ourselves until early 2008 to find industrial partners to share the risk , private investment of around one billion euros and an operator for the journey , " auque told 2,500 vip guests in the french capital paris on wednesday evening .
" we will not do it without that . " a deep desire to enter space the aircraft , which eads plans to start developing next year , will be in operation from 2012 .
auque said eads expected the space tourist market to total 20,000 passengers a year by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spaceshipone successfully completed its first flight in 2004 " we want to serve a third of this , " auque said .
" we believe in this market . " according to auque , people had a deep desire to enter space . " we want to rouse european ambitions in the process , " he said . eads is competing with the us company spaceship , which is working on a successor for the legendary spaceshipone .
this spacecraft , which uses a hybrid rocket motor , completed the first privately funded human space flight in 2004 .
spaceship is aiming to offer suborbital flights for less than 100,000 euros in the near future . no threat from virgin galactic the eads space jet will take off and land conventionally from a standard airport using jet engines .
once it is airborne at an attitude of some 12 kilometers , though , the rocket engines will be ignited to give sufficient acceleration to reach the altitude of 100 kilometers .
then , the engines will be shut down so that passengers can experience zero gravity in space . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the craft 's seats balance themselves during the flight " we have ruled out the idea of a simple rocket , which can not be used again , " said robert laine , eads astrium 's technical director . the company was also not in favor of a small vessel attached to a large plane , the idea chosen by richard branson 's virgin galactic , he said . " this seems to us less safe , " laine said . virgin plans to offer space flights from 2009 .
but eads astrium said it was not concerned about entering the space race later , given " the qualities of the solution proposed by astrium which can take off and land on any runway , and the possibilities of the market . " the guests at the paris event were shown a full-sized model of the craft 's forward section .
the cabin , created by australian born designer marc newson , will be able to hold four passengers .

they will also discuss the kremlin 's offer to cooperate with the americans on the program . the talks mark the first time that the military alliance has included the us shield , which has deeply angered russia , in its own barely nascent plans to build a missile shield to cover all 26 nato allies . " nato 's approach is based on the principle of the indivisibility of allied security and on transparency with our partners , of course including russia , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said as he opened the meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer gets the meeting underway washington announced in january that it wants to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic linked to an early warning system , probably in the caucasus , all to be operational by 2013 . the shield is aimed at countering attacks from nations that washington regards as " rogue states " such as iran . unprotected areas the problem for nato is that four members - bulgaria , romania , greece and turkey - are only partly covered or left out of the umbrella all together , undermining this very " indivisibility of allied security . " to resolve this , the alliance is likely to " bolt on " to the us shield a smaller missile system - an " in-theater " type usually used to protect troops in battle - which it is developing and hopes to have in use by 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brdy military zone in the czech republic where the us wants to place a radar base " the cost of a complementary system would be a small fraction of the cost of a full and independent missile system for nato , " said senior nato defense planning official john colston ahead of the talks . any progress in the talks is likely to inflame emotions in russia , which has conducted a highly-public ballistic missile test in response to its former cold war foe 's plans , and raised the possibility of turning its arms towards europe . possible cooperation the meeting also takes place as nato and russia review a key soviet-era arms pact - the conventional forces in europe treaty - in vienna , which the allies refuse to endorse , while moscow claims that its restrictions are unfair . amid the heightened rhetoric , exacerbated by elections in russia late this year , president vladimir putin surprised his us counterpart george w. bush by proposing that they set up a joint us-russian radar base in azerbaijan . us and russian officials are studying the proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch members of the nato force in afghanistan " the most interesting part of it was that it was bush and putin both together , " dutch defense minister elmert van middelkoop said as he arrived for the talks .
" so it 's interesting for nato to consider it and i think it can be a part of the pacification of the subject . " the military alliance has not yet said whether the azeri base could work , as it might be too close to iran to be effective against long-range missiles . " we have an expression in britain : ' it 's not rocket science , " ' colston said .
" the trouble with missile defense is that it is rocket science . " the 26 defense chiefs , including us defense secretary robert gates , will also seek clarification from their russian counterpart anatoly serdyukov on moscow 's surprise offer . afghan civilians ministers are also due to review operations in afghanistan as concerns grow about civilian casualties in the country .
the talks come just days after us forces inadvertently killed seven policeman in an air strike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civilian casualties caused by nato troops are hurting the alliance 's standing among the population de hoop scheffer has said he wants to explore ways of improving cooperation between the afghan army , us troops and nato forces in the country .
the nato chief has also called for additional training of soldiers in the afghan national army . nato is worried that the recent wave of civilian deaths and damage to civilian property in afghanistan risks eroding european public support for the mission .

it came after days of fighting between rival fatah and hamas factions that have left over 80 people dead .
michel , who expressed concern over the " growing humanitarian tragedy in gaza , " also appealed to both sides .
" the palestinians have already suffered far too much .
i strongly urge the warring parties to put away their guns and work together for the good of their people , " he said .
laws breached bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with gaza descending into civil war , a humanitarian tragedy is in the making he also urged fatah and hamas to abide by international conventions . " the warring parties must respect the principles of international humanitarian law and do everything possible to facilitate safe access by relief agencies to the civilian population , " michel said . hardline islamist hamas fighters on wednesday advanced their campaign to defeat the rival fatah movement in the gaza strip amid warnings that the deadly showdown could lead to an all-out palestinian civil war . the us-based human rights watch has accused both sides of committing war crimes during their battles , which have turned hospitals into battlegrounds . some senior palestinians have blamed the escalation of violence in the area on the eu 's direct aid embargo imposed on the hamas government after it came to power last january .
they say it has undermined the entire palestinian authority . lack of security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miltant hamas fighters have practically seized control of gaza the eu suspended all 16 of its relief projects in the territory funded by the commission 's humanitarian aid department -lrb- echo -rrb- due to the lack of security . michel said , " i fervently hope that the projects can resume very soon .
this is a time when people desperately need protection and support . " the un has also temporarily called off its relief operations in the area following the death of two un relief and works agency employees caught in the crossfire .

" this seems to us less safe , " laine said . virgin plans to offer space flights from 2009 .

the opposition green party is even threatening to take the case to the federal constitutional court . the german defense ministry confirmed earlier this week that it had sent tornado surveillance jets to take aerial photographs of the g8 premises in heiligendamm and the surroundings .
the action had included flights over a g8 protestors ' camp in nearby reddelich . the mission had occurred at the request of police , said defense minister franz josef jung , a member of the ruling coalition partner christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : the reddelich camp was of interest to authorities according to the defense ministry , the deployment involved technical assistance to g8 organizers .
its aim was to recognize changes in soil conditions , as well as manipulations in major roads , it said . leading opposition politician hans-christian ströbele from the green party got the debate rolling after a protestor in the reddelich camp informed him about the flights .
ströbele said the use of tornados was a violation of the constitution .
he has threatened to bring the case before the constitutional court in karlsruhe . heiligendamm is not afghanistan critics of the deployment said the jets were similar to those used by the german air force in afghanistan to find taliban guerrillas .

jung 's predecessor peter struck from the spd would have never approved such an action , he said . the g8 summit was not the first time tornados have been deployed as official support .
awacs jets patrolled areas during the soccer world cup last year , as well as during pope benedict 's visit to germany .
they are also used , for example , to monitor the repercussions of natural disasters . debate continues on domestic military deployment the issue was on the agenda wednesday at meetings of the parliamentary interior and defense committees in berlin .

it did not violate any personal rights .
" there was no photographic material taken of individual persons . " the military , which also provided awacs airspace monitoring at the g8 summit , said it made no secret of the fact that it filmed the area in may and june . the coalition partners have been arguing for some time whether the military can be deployed within germany 's borders for defense purposes .

" wiefelspütz said police should have used their own helicopters for filming . " the defense minister is apparently lacking political instinct , " wiefelspütz told the daily passauer neue presse .
jung 's predecessor peter struck from the spd would have never approved such an action , he said . the g8 summit was not the first time tornados have been deployed as official support .
awacs jets patrolled areas during the soccer world cup last year , as well as during pope benedict 's visit to germany .
they are also used , for example , to monitor the repercussions of natural disasters . debate continues on domestic military deployment the issue was on the agenda wednesday at meetings of the parliamentary interior and defense committees in berlin .
merkel 's own cdu said it could not understand the outrage . " the mission was not only justified , but necessary , " said wolfgang bosbach , deputy parliamentary head of the cdu .
it did not violate any personal rights .
" there was no photographic material taken of individual persons . " the military , which also provided awacs airspace monitoring at the g8 summit , said it made no secret of the fact that it filmed the area in may and june . the coalition partners have been arguing for some time whether the military can be deployed within germany 's borders for defense purposes .
this would go beyond simple administrative or technical assistance .

he could be a killer a squirrel with aggression issues acted out in the southern german town of passau , injuring three people before his last victim finished him off with a crutch . the bavarian town of passau , on the austrian border , is usually a fairly quiet place , with man and nature living in relative harmony .
but this week , the bucolic balance was thrown off when a squirrel went berserk , terrorizing three in a biting rampage that ended only with his death . his first victim was a 70-year-old woman , who was sitting peacefully in her living room when she was surprised by the sensation of small claws on her back .
the squirrel had jumped through a window and onto the woman , soon sinking its teeth into her hand .
acorns were n't on this little guy 's mind , arteries apparently were . terrified , the woman ran out into the street in a panic , managing to shake the squirrel off . but the creature , whipped into a frenzy , immediately found another victim .
he jumped onto a nearby construction worker , injuring him on the hand and arm .
the fellow was finally able to fight the furry demon off with a measuring pole . still on the hunt for blood , the tiny terror then ran into the garden of a 72-year-old retiree . " the squirrel massively attacked him on the arms , hand and thigh , " said a local police spokesperson .
so the senior citizen used the only weapon at his disposal - his crutch . he clubbed the ruthless rodent to death . how the squirrel obtained his bloodlust is still unclear , although experts have said its behavior could be linked to the mating season or the squirrel could have been diseased . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the opposition green party is even threatening to take the case to the federal constitutional court . the german defense ministry confirmed earlier this week that it had sent tornado surveillance jets to take aerial photographs of the g8 premises in heiligendamm and the surroundings .
the action had included flights over a g8 protestors ' camp in nearby reddelich . the mission had occurred at the request of police , said defense minister franz josef jung , a member of the ruling coalition partner christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : the reddelich camp was of interest to authorities according to the defense ministry , the deployment involved technical assistance to g8 organizers .
its aim was to recognize changes in soil conditions , as well as manipulations in major roads , it said . leading opposition politician hans-christian ströbele from the green party got the debate rolling after a protestor in the reddelich camp informed him about the flights .
ströbele said the use of tornados was a violation of the constitution .
he has threatened to bring the case before the constitutional court in karlsruhe . heiligendamm is not afghanistan critics of the deployment said the jets were similar to those used by the german air force in afghanistan to find taliban guerrillas .

jung 's predecessor peter struck from the spd would have never approved such an action , he said . the g8 summit was not the first time tornados have been deployed as official support .
awacs jets patrolled areas during the soccer world cup last year , as well as during pope benedict 's visit to germany .
they are also used , for example , to monitor the repercussions of natural disasters . debate continues on domestic military deployment the issue was on the agenda wednesday at meetings of the parliamentary interior and defense committees in berlin .
merkel 's own cdu said it could not understand the outrage . " the mission was not only justified , but necessary , " said wolfgang bosbach , deputy parliamentary head of the cdu .
it did not violate any personal rights .
" there was no photographic material taken of individual persons . " the military , which also provided awacs airspace monitoring at the g8 summit , said it made no secret of the fact that it filmed the area in may and june . the coalition partners have been arguing for some time whether the military can be deployed within germany 's borders for defense purposes .

it could be a big step back for angela merkel , who wants an eu treaty passed . speaking after talks in london with czech prime minister mirek topolanek , blair said there would be no deal at the brussels summit on june 21 and 22 unless demands for a eu constitution were set aside .
it could prove a big setback to german chancellor angela merkel , who has made getting the eu constitution back on track after defeats at the polls by the french and the dutch a priority of germany 's eu presidency , which ends this month .
blair told a news conference in downing street that there would be " real difficulties " between some of the 27 eu members due attend .
' amending treaty ' referring to french-german moves to resurrect aspects of the european constitution , soundly defeated in referenda in france and the netherlands two years ago , blair said he would sign up only to an " amending treaty . "
" frankly , in order to get an agreement , the type of issues we are talking about are going to have to be satisfied , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants to restart movement towards an eu constitution his comments came after talks with topolanek , who had expressed a " similar approach " on the issue of the constitution , blair indicated .
blair said there was " no point " returning to the constitution , and added that the eu should be looking at " smaller measures to make it more effective to the needs of countries . "
he said there was a " real desire " in europe to move on from the issue of the constitution to other matters of " huge importance , " such as energy , migration , economic issues and defence .
sarkozy visit earlier wednesday , blair 's office announced that french president nicolas sarkozy would visit london for crucial pre-summit talks on june 19 .
for the first time , blair and his successor , gordon brown , would be joint hosts of the meeting with sarkozy , an advocate of a " simplified treaty that would allow the implementation of the essential institutional advances contained in the eu constitution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown will soon be filling blair 's shoes such efforts have been dismissed as an attempt to " reintroduce the constitution through the back door " by commentators in london .
the blair-brown double act comes only days before brown is expected to be elected labour party leader , followed by blair 's final departure from power on june 27 .
blair 's spokesman said the meeting with sarkozy on june 19 was agreed at the recent group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in germany .
sarkozy 's claim that he and blair had agreed on the " framework " for a revised mini-constitution has not been backed up by officials in london .
" what 's important when you have got a new french president is that you get a chance to explore at greater length than is possible at a bilateral his position in the run-up to discussions at the summit , " said blair 's official spokesman .
gordon brown 's role the meeting , with the inclusion of brown in a " new role , " would therefore be " useful from several perspectives . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french said " non , " the british leadership is n't too wild on the idea either " we have always said there will be close consultations , as there always are before a summit , between colleagues in government .
but it will be the prime minister who will present the government position at the summit . "
the brown camp has expressed fears that blair could be prepared to sign up to a controversial deal on the eu constitution just days before he leaves office . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french proposal to end eu crisis makes headway french president nicolas sarkozy 's idea of a simplified treaty designed to end the european union 's constitional crisis appears to be gaining support .

" it is necessary that everyone in parliament who decides about foreign deployments sees this memorial in order to be aware of how large their personal responsibility is , " said guido westerwelle , head of the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . but jung , a member of the ruling coalition partner christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , wants the structure to stand within the ministry 's premises in berlin . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he could be a killer a squirrel with aggression issues acted out in the southern german town of passau , injuring three people before his last victim finished him off with a crutch . the bavarian town of passau , on the austrian border , is usually a fairly quiet place , with man and nature living in relative harmony .
but this week , the bucolic balance was thrown off when a squirrel went berserk , terrorizing three in a biting rampage that ended only with his death . his first victim was a 70-year-old woman , who was sitting peacefully in her living room when she was surprised by the sensation of small claws on her back .
the squirrel had jumped through a window and onto the woman , soon sinking its teeth into her hand .
acorns were n't on this little guy 's mind , arteries apparently were . terrified , the woman ran out into the street in a panic , managing to shake the squirrel off . but the creature , whipped into a frenzy , immediately found another victim .
he jumped onto a nearby construction worker , injuring him on the hand and arm .
the fellow was finally able to fight the furry demon off with a measuring pole . still on the hunt for blood , the tiny terror then ran into the garden of a 72-year-old retiree . " the squirrel massively attacked him on the arms , hand and thigh , " said a local police spokesperson .
so the senior citizen used the only weapon at his disposal - his crutch . he clubbed the ruthless rodent to death . how the squirrel obtained his bloodlust is still unclear , although experts have said its behavior could be linked to the mating season or the squirrel could have been diseased . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it could be a big step back for angela merkel , who wants an eu treaty passed . speaking after talks in london with czech prime minister mirek topolanek , blair said there would be no deal at the brussels summit on june 21 and 22 unless demands for a eu constitution were set aside .
it could prove a big setback to german chancellor angela merkel , who has made getting the eu constitution back on track after defeats at the polls by the french and the dutch a priority of germany 's eu presidency , which ends this month .
blair told a news conference in downing street that there would be " real difficulties " between some of the 27 eu members due attend .
' amending treaty ' referring to french-german moves to resurrect aspects of the european constitution , soundly defeated in referenda in france and the netherlands two years ago , blair said he would sign up only to an " amending treaty . "
" frankly , in order to get an agreement , the type of issues we are talking about are going to have to be satisfied , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants to restart movement towards an eu constitution his comments came after talks with topolanek , who had expressed a " similar approach " on the issue of the constitution , blair indicated .
blair said there was " no point " returning to the constitution , and added that the eu should be looking at " smaller measures to make it more effective to the needs of countries . "
he said there was a " real desire " in europe to move on from the issue of the constitution to other matters of " huge importance , " such as energy , migration , economic issues and defence .
sarkozy visit earlier wednesday , blair 's office announced that french president nicolas sarkozy would visit london for crucial pre-summit talks on june 19 .
for the first time , blair and his successor , gordon brown , would be joint hosts of the meeting with sarkozy , an advocate of a " simplified treaty that would allow the implementation of the essential institutional advances contained in the eu constitution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown will soon be filling blair 's shoes such efforts have been dismissed as an attempt to " reintroduce the constitution through the back door " by commentators in london .
the blair-brown double act comes only days before brown is expected to be elected labour party leader , followed by blair 's final departure from power on june 27 .
blair 's spokesman said the meeting with sarkozy on june 19 was agreed at the recent group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in germany .
sarkozy 's claim that he and blair had agreed on the " framework " for a revised mini-constitution has not been backed up by officials in london .
" what 's important when you have got a new french president is that you get a chance to explore at greater length than is possible at a bilateral his position in the run-up to discussions at the summit , " said blair 's official spokesman .
gordon brown 's role the meeting , with the inclusion of brown in a " new role , " would therefore be " useful from several perspectives . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french said " non , " the british leadership is n't too wild on the idea either " we have always said there will be close consultations , as there always are before a summit , between colleagues in government .
but it will be the prime minister who will present the government position at the summit . "

and she has warned of the repercussions if no agreement is made . " this is not just up to us , but we will do our part .
if that does n't succeed , it will not be the downfall of europe , but it will have extremely serious consequences for the future of europe , " merkel said .
she stressed that there was still a lot to do to move forward the debate on the draft constitution , which was rejected by french and dutch voters in referendums in 2005 .
merkel also cautioned that a solution to the dispute with poland was not yet in sight in her speech to the german parliament on thursday , a week ahead of the eu summit in brussels . but shortly afterwards , polish president lech kaczynski signalled that poland would seek a compromise over its opposition to the proposed voting system . kaczynski said he wanted to avoid the isolation of his country over the issue . glimmer of hope ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and dutch no votes propelled the eu into crisis warsaw had threatened to veto a deal on the future of the charter because of the planned changes , which poland says favor the bloc 's bigger states . germany is currently the holder of the rotating presidency , but its tenure ends at the end of june .
merkel had declared it her goal to break the deadlock over the eu treaty . the chancellor reiterated her position that the draft constitution would not be completely abandoned when any new treaty is drawn up .
" we want to keep the substance of the treaty without over-burdening people , " she told lawmakers .
" any solution we do find must be in a form that helps europe . "
the chancellor said it was essential to find a solution to the treaty issue so that a bloc that has enlarged into eastern and southern europe is " able to function properly . "
the eu has expanded from a 15 to a 27-member bloc over the last three years , making reform necessary . challenging times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was more positive about eu achievements at heiligendamm " europe faces great challenges both within , and more importantly , outside its borders , " she said .
in addition , merkel stressed that it was necessary for a new constitution to better meet the wishes of european citizens .
this would involve making clearer the division of power between the bloc and its member states .
fears about the creation of a european super-state must also be taken into account , merkel told legislators . the chancellor gave a more positive evaluation of what had been achieved at the g8 summit , in particular over climate change , during her bundestag speech .
she said that without the eu 's agreement on binding emission reduction goals the agreements reached at heiligendamm would have been " completely inconceivable .

they will also discuss the kremlin 's offer to cooperate with the americans on the program . the talks mark the first time that the military alliance has included the us shield , which has deeply angered russia , in its own barely nascent plans to build a missile shield to cover all 26 nato allies . " nato 's approach is based on the principle of the indivisibility of allied security and on transparency with our partners , of course including russia , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said as he opened the meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer gets the meeting underway washington announced in january that it wants to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic linked to an early warning system , probably in the caucasus , all to be operational by 2013 . the shield is aimed at countering attacks from nations that washington regards as " rogue states " such as iran . unprotected areas the problem for nato is that four members - bulgaria , romania , greece and turkey - are only partly covered or left out of the umbrella all together , undermining this very " indivisibility of allied security . " to resolve this , the alliance is likely to " bolt on " to the us shield a smaller missile system - an " in-theater " type usually used to protect troops in battle - which it is developing and hopes to have in use by 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brdy military zone in the czech republic where the us wants to place a radar base " the cost of a complementary system would be a small fraction of the cost of a full and independent missile system for nato , " said senior nato defense planning official john colston ahead of the talks . any progress in the talks is likely to inflame emotions in russia , which has conducted a highly-public ballistic missile test in response to its former cold war foe 's plans , and raised the possibility of turning its arms towards europe . possible cooperation the meeting also takes place as nato and russia review a key soviet-era arms pact - the conventional forces in europe treaty - in vienna , which the allies refuse to endorse , while moscow claims that its restrictions are unfair . amid the heightened rhetoric , exacerbated by elections in russia late this year , president vladimir putin surprised his us counterpart george w. bush by proposing that they set up a joint us-russian radar base in azerbaijan . us and russian officials are studying the proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch members of the nato force in afghanistan " the most interesting part of it was that it was bush and putin both together , " dutch defense minister elmert van middelkoop said as he arrived for the talks .
" so it 's interesting for nato to consider it and i think it can be a part of the pacification of the subject . " the military alliance has not yet said whether the azeri base could work , as it might be too close to iran to be effective against long-range missiles . " we have an expression in britain : ' it 's not rocket science , " ' colston said .
" the trouble with missile defense is that it is rocket science . " the 26 defense chiefs , including us defense secretary robert gates , will also seek clarification from their russian counterpart anatoly serdyukov on moscow 's surprise offer . afghan civilians ministers are also due to review operations in afghanistan as concerns grow about civilian casualties in the country .
the talks come just days after us forces inadvertently killed seven policeman in an air strike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civilian casualties caused by nato troops are hurting the alliance 's standing among the population de hoop scheffer has said he wants to explore ways of improving cooperation between the afghan army , us troops and nato forces in the country .
the nato chief has also called for additional training of soldiers in the afghan national army . nato is worried that the recent wave of civilian deaths and damage to civilian property in afghanistan risks eroding european public support for the mission .

they will also discuss the kremlin 's offer to cooperate with the americans on the program . the talks mark the first time that the military alliance has included the us shield , which has deeply angered russia , in its own barely nascent plans to build a missile shield to cover all 26 nato allies . " nato 's approach is based on the principle of the indivisibility of allied security and on transparency with our partners , of course including russia , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said as he opened the meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer gets the meeting underway washington announced in january that it wants to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic linked to an early warning system , probably in the caucasus , all to be operational by 2013 . the shield is aimed at countering attacks from nations that washington regards as " rogue states " such as iran . unprotected areas the problem for nato is that four members - bulgaria , romania , greece and turkey - are only partly covered or left out of the umbrella all together , undermining this very " indivisibility of allied security . " to resolve this , the alliance is likely to " bolt on " to the us shield a smaller missile system - an " in-theater " type usually used to protect troops in battle - which it is developing and hopes to have in use by 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brdy military zone in the czech republic where the us wants to place a radar base " the cost of a complementary system would be a small fraction of the cost of a full and independent missile system for nato , " said senior nato defense planning official john colston ahead of the talks . any progress in the talks is likely to inflame emotions in russia , which has conducted a highly-public ballistic missile test in response to its former cold war foe 's plans , and raised the possibility of turning its arms towards europe . possible cooperation the meeting also takes place as nato and russia review a key soviet-era arms pact - the conventional forces in europe treaty - in vienna , which the allies refuse to endorse , while moscow claims that its restrictions are unfair . amid the heightened rhetoric , exacerbated by elections in russia late this year , president vladimir putin surprised his us counterpart george w. bush by proposing that they set up a joint us-russian radar base in azerbaijan . us and russian officials are studying the proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch members of the nato force in afghanistan " the most interesting part of it was that it was bush and putin both together , " dutch defense minister elmert van middelkoop said as he arrived for the talks .
" so it 's interesting for nato to consider it and i think it can be a part of the pacification of the subject . " the military alliance has not yet said whether the azeri base could work , as it might be too close to iran to be effective against long-range missiles . " we have an expression in britain : ' it 's not rocket science , " ' colston said .
" the trouble with missile defense is that it is rocket science . " the 26 defense chiefs , including us defense secretary robert gates , will also seek clarification from their russian counterpart anatoly serdyukov on moscow 's surprise offer . afghan civilians ministers are also due to review operations in afghanistan as concerns grow about civilian casualties in the country .
the talks come just days after us forces inadvertently killed seven policeman in an air strike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civilian casualties caused by nato troops are hurting the alliance 's standing among the population de hoop scheffer has said he wants to explore ways of improving cooperation between the afghan army , us troops and nato forces in the country .
the nato chief has also called for additional training of soldiers in the afghan national army . nato is worried that the recent wave of civilian deaths and damage to civilian property in afghanistan risks eroding european public support for the mission .
it also damages nato 's drive to win the hearts and minds of the afghan people . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we see such a decision as a step aimed at destroying the existing security system , creating new dividing lines on the european continent , " he was quoted as saying .
but a senior us official said serdyukov did not repeat recent russian threats to target europe and did not place conditions on a counter-proposal from russian president vladimir putin for a joint us-russian radar in gabala , azerbaijan .
us defense secretary robert gates made clear that " we intend to continue our talks with poland and the czech republic , " the official said , speaking on condition of anonymity .

outside the umbrella nato defense ministers agreed to assess the political and military implications of the us missile defense plan with an eye to what nato would have to do to defend areas in southern europe not under its umbrella .
the assessment is to be completed by february 2008 ahead of a nato summit in bucharest to inform allied deliberations on fielding a theater missile defense system that could be " bolted on " to the us system , nato officials said .

and she has warned of the repercussions if no agreement is made . " this is not just up to us , but we will do our part .
if that does n't succeed , it will not be the downfall of europe , but it will have extremely serious consequences for the future of europe , " merkel said .
she stressed that there was still a lot to do to move forward the debate on the draft constitution , which was rejected by french and dutch voters in referendums in 2005 .
merkel also cautioned that a solution to the dispute with poland was not yet in sight in her speech to the german parliament on thursday , a week ahead of the eu summit in brussels . but shortly afterwards , polish president lech kaczynski signalled that poland would seek a compromise over its opposition to the proposed voting system . kaczynski said he wanted to avoid the isolation of his country over the issue . glimmer of hope ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and dutch no votes propelled the eu into crisis warsaw had threatened to veto a deal on the future of the charter because of the planned changes , which poland says favor the bloc 's bigger states . germany is currently the holder of the rotating presidency , but its tenure ends at the end of june .
merkel had declared it her goal to break the deadlock over the eu treaty . the chancellor reiterated her position that the draft constitution would not be completely abandoned when any new treaty is drawn up .
" we want to keep the substance of the treaty without over-burdening people , " she told lawmakers .
" any solution we do find must be in a form that helps europe . "
the chancellor said it was essential to find a solution to the treaty issue so that a bloc that has enlarged into eastern and southern europe is " able to function properly . "
the eu has expanded from a 15 to a 27-member bloc over the last three years , making reform necessary . challenging times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was more positive about eu achievements at heiligendamm " europe faces great challenges both within , and more importantly , outside its borders , " she said .
in addition , merkel stressed that it was necessary for a new constitution to better meet the wishes of european citizens .
this would involve making clearer the division of power between the bloc and its member states .
fears about the creation of a european super-state must also be taken into account , merkel told legislators . the chancellor gave a more positive evaluation of what had been achieved at the g8 summit , in particular over climate change , during her bundestag speech .
she said that without the eu 's agreement on binding emission reduction goals the agreements reached at heiligendamm would have been " completely inconceivable .

"
" we see such a decision as a step aimed at destroying the existing security system , creating new dividing lines on the european continent , " he was quoted as saying .
but a senior us official said serdyukov did not repeat recent russian threats to target europe and did not place conditions on a counter-proposal from russian president vladimir putin for a joint us-russian radar in gabala , azerbaijan .

outside the umbrella nato defense ministers agreed to assess the political and military implications of the us missile defense plan with an eye to what nato would have to do to defend areas in southern europe not under its umbrella .
the assessment is to be completed by february 2008 ahead of a nato summit in bucharest to inform allied deliberations on fielding a theater missile defense system that could be " bolted on " to the us system , nato officials said .
the study was " a recognition that the us discussion and proposals with poland and the czech republic are a : a fact , b : that they are moving forward , and c : that nato work ... on missile defense needs to take that into account , " said nato spokesman james appathurai .
appathurai said none of the 26 member countries had opposed the us plans .
" nato will now move forward to assess the political and military implications of the us missile system proposals , " he said .
nato ministers then met in a separate session with serdyukov in what one nato diplomat described as " calm and cold . "

airing differences on saturday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov urged washington to freeze work with poland and the czech republic on its missile shield , concerned that continued talks might worsen the iranian nuclear stand-off .

it is developing a space tourist plane to be completed by 2012 . the space arm of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- has announced plans to develop a spacecraft for tourists .
the vessel would offer travelers a 90-minute suborbital flight , including three minutes of weightlessness , at an altitude of more than 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- . according to francois auque , the president of eads astrium , the fare in space could total some 150,000 to 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 200,000 - $ 267,000 -rrb- .
this compared to $ 25 million for the few space tourists flying in the narrow capsule of the russian rocket " soyuz , " auque said . the russian space authority currently holds the monopoly in space tourism .

"
" we see such a decision as a step aimed at destroying the existing security system , creating new dividing lines on the european continent , " he was quoted as saying .
but a senior us official said serdyukov did not repeat recent russian threats to target europe and did not place conditions on a counter-proposal from russian president vladimir putin for a joint us-russian radar in gabala , azerbaijan .
us defense secretary robert gates made clear that " we intend to continue our talks with poland and the czech republic , " the official said , speaking on condition of anonymity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates and putin , in april " what he has said today is that we want to work with russia on what role gabala might play .

outside the umbrella nato defense ministers agreed to assess the political and military implications of the us missile defense plan with an eye to what nato would have to do to defend areas in southern europe not under its umbrella .
the assessment is to be completed by february 2008 ahead of a nato summit in bucharest to inform allied deliberations on fielding a theater missile defense system that could be " bolted on " to the us system , nato officials said .
the study was " a recognition that the us discussion and proposals with poland and the czech republic are a : a fact , b : that they are moving forward , and c : that nato work ... on missile defense needs to take that into account , " said nato spokesman james appathurai .
appathurai said none of the 26 member countries had opposed the us plans .
" nato will now move forward to assess the political and military implications of the us missile system proposals , " he said .
nato ministers then met in a separate session with serdyukov in what one nato diplomat described as " calm and cold . "

airing differences on saturday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov urged washington to freeze work with poland and the czech republic on its missile shield , concerned that continued talks might worsen the iranian nuclear stand-off .

it is developing a space tourist plane to be completed by 2012 . the space arm of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- has announced plans to develop a spacecraft for tourists .
the vessel would offer travelers a 90-minute suborbital flight , including three minutes of weightlessness , at an altitude of more than 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- . according to francois auque , the president of eads astrium , the fare in space could total some 150,000 to 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 200,000 - $ 267,000 -rrb- .
this compared to $ 25 million for the few space tourists flying in the narrow capsule of the russian rocket " soyuz , " auque said . the russian space authority currently holds the monopoly in space tourism .
it offers flights to the international space station iss . " we are offering a profitable system and have given ourselves until early 2008 to find industrial partners to share the risk , private investment of around one billion euros and an operator for the journey , " auque told 2,500 vip guests in the french capital paris on wednesday evening .
" we will not do it without that . " a deep desire to enter space the aircraft , which eads plans to start developing next year , will be in operation from 2012 .
auque said eads expected the space tourist market to total 20,000 passengers a year by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spaceshipone successfully completed its first flight in 2004 " we want to serve a third of this , " auque said .
" we believe in this market . " according to auque , people had a deep desire to enter space . " we want to rouse european ambitions in the process , " he said . eads is competing with the us company spaceship , which is working on a successor for the legendary spaceshipone .
this spacecraft , which uses a hybrid rocket motor , completed the first privately funded human space flight in 2004 .
spaceship is aiming to offer suborbital flights for less than 100,000 euros in the near future . no threat from virgin galactic the eads space jet will take off and land conventionally from a standard airport using jet engines .
once it is airborne at an attitude of some 12 kilometers , though , the rocket engines will be ignited to give sufficient acceleration to reach the altitude of 100 kilometers .
then , the engines will be shut down so that passengers can experience zero gravity in space . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the craft 's seats balance themselves during the flight " we have ruled out the idea of a simple rocket , which can not be used again , " said robert laine , eads astrium 's technical director . the company was also not in favor of a small vessel attached to a large plane , the idea chosen by richard branson 's virgin galactic , he said . " this seems to us less safe , " laine said . virgin plans to offer space flights from 2009 .
but eads astrium said it was not concerned about entering the space race later , given " the qualities of the solution proposed by astrium which can take off and land on any runway , and the possibilities of the market . " the guests at the paris event were shown a full-sized model of the craft 's forward section .

it could be a big step back for angela merkel , who wants an eu treaty passed . speaking after talks in london with czech prime minister mirek topolanek , blair said there would be no deal at the brussels summit on june 21 and 22 unless demands for a eu constitution were set aside .
it could prove a big setback to german chancellor angela merkel , who has made getting the eu constitution back on track after defeats at the polls by the french and the dutch a priority of germany 's eu presidency , which ends this month .
blair told a news conference in downing street that there would be " real difficulties " between some of the 27 eu members due attend .
' amending treaty ' referring to french-german moves to resurrect aspects of the european constitution , soundly defeated in referenda in france and the netherlands two years ago , blair said he would sign up only to an " amending treaty . "
" frankly , in order to get an agreement , the type of issues we are talking about are going to have to be satisfied , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants to restart movement towards an eu constitution his comments came after talks with topolanek , who had expressed a " similar approach " on the issue of the constitution , blair indicated .
blair said there was " no point " returning to the constitution , and added that the eu should be looking at " smaller measures to make it more effective to the needs of countries . "
he said there was a " real desire " in europe to move on from the issue of the constitution to other matters of " huge importance , " such as energy , migration , economic issues and defence .
sarkozy visit earlier wednesday , blair 's office announced that french president nicolas sarkozy would visit london for crucial pre-summit talks on june 19 .
for the first time , blair and his successor , gordon brown , would be joint hosts of the meeting with sarkozy , an advocate of a " simplified treaty that would allow the implementation of the essential institutional advances contained in the eu constitution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown will soon be filling blair 's shoes such efforts have been dismissed as an attempt to " reintroduce the constitution through the back door " by commentators in london .
the blair-brown double act comes only days before brown is expected to be elected labour party leader , followed by blair 's final departure from power on june 27 .
blair 's spokesman said the meeting with sarkozy on june 19 was agreed at the recent group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in germany .
sarkozy 's claim that he and blair had agreed on the " framework " for a revised mini-constitution has not been backed up by officials in london .
" what 's important when you have got a new french president is that you get a chance to explore at greater length than is possible at a bilateral his position in the run-up to discussions at the summit , " said blair 's official spokesman .
gordon brown 's role the meeting , with the inclusion of brown in a " new role , " would therefore be " useful from several perspectives . "

it could be a big step back for angela merkel , who wants an eu treaty passed . speaking after talks in london with czech prime minister mirek topolanek , blair said there would be no deal at the brussels summit on june 21 and 22 unless demands for a eu constitution were set aside .
it could prove a big setback to german chancellor angela merkel , who has made getting the eu constitution back on track after defeats at the polls by the french and the dutch a priority of germany 's eu presidency , which ends this month .
blair told a news conference in downing street that there would be " real difficulties " between some of the 27 eu members due attend .
' amending treaty ' referring to french-german moves to resurrect aspects of the european constitution , soundly defeated in referenda in france and the netherlands two years ago , blair said he would sign up only to an " amending treaty . "
" frankly , in order to get an agreement , the type of issues we are talking about are going to have to be satisfied , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants to restart movement towards an eu constitution his comments came after talks with topolanek , who had expressed a " similar approach " on the issue of the constitution , blair indicated .
blair said there was " no point " returning to the constitution , and added that the eu should be looking at " smaller measures to make it more effective to the needs of countries . "
he said there was a " real desire " in europe to move on from the issue of the constitution to other matters of " huge importance , " such as energy , migration , economic issues and defence .
sarkozy visit earlier wednesday , blair 's office announced that french president nicolas sarkozy would visit london for crucial pre-summit talks on june 19 .
for the first time , blair and his successor , gordon brown , would be joint hosts of the meeting with sarkozy , an advocate of a " simplified treaty that would allow the implementation of the essential institutional advances contained in the eu constitution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown will soon be filling blair 's shoes such efforts have been dismissed as an attempt to " reintroduce the constitution through the back door " by commentators in london .
the blair-brown double act comes only days before brown is expected to be elected labour party leader , followed by blair 's final departure from power on june 27 .
blair 's spokesman said the meeting with sarkozy on june 19 was agreed at the recent group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in germany .
sarkozy 's claim that he and blair had agreed on the " framework " for a revised mini-constitution has not been backed up by officials in london .
" what 's important when you have got a new french president is that you get a chance to explore at greater length than is possible at a bilateral his position in the run-up to discussions at the summit , " said blair 's official spokesman .
gordon brown 's role the meeting , with the inclusion of brown in a " new role , " would therefore be " useful from several perspectives . "

the opposition green party is even threatening to take the case to the federal constitutional court . the german defense ministry confirmed earlier this week that it had sent tornado surveillance jets to take aerial photographs of the g8 premises in heiligendamm and the surroundings .
the action had included flights over a g8 protestors ' camp in nearby reddelich . the mission had occurred at the request of police , said defense minister franz josef jung , a member of the ruling coalition partner christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : the reddelich camp was of interest to authorities according to the defense ministry , the deployment involved technical assistance to g8 organizers .
its aim was to recognize changes in soil conditions , as well as manipulations in major roads , it said . leading opposition politician hans-christian ströbele from the green party got the debate rolling after a protestor in the reddelich camp informed him about the flights .
ströbele said the use of tornados was a violation of the constitution .
he has threatened to bring the case before the constitutional court in karlsruhe . heiligendamm is not afghanistan critics of the deployment said the jets were similar to those used by the german air force in afghanistan to find taliban guerrillas .

" wiefelspütz said police should have used their own helicopters for filming . " the defense minister is apparently lacking political instinct , " wiefelspütz told the daily passauer neue presse .
jung 's predecessor peter struck from the spd would have never approved such an action , he said . the g8 summit was not the first time tornados have been deployed as official support .
awacs jets patrolled areas during the soccer world cup last year , as well as during pope benedict 's visit to germany .
they are also used , for example , to monitor the repercussions of natural disasters . debate continues on domestic military deployment the issue was on the agenda wednesday at meetings of the parliamentary interior and defense committees in berlin .

it did not violate any personal rights .
" there was no photographic material taken of individual persons . " the military , which also provided awacs airspace monitoring at the g8 summit , said it made no secret of the fact that it filmed the area in may and june . the coalition partners have been arguing for some time whether the military can be deployed within germany 's borders for defense purposes .

and she has warned of the repercussions if no agreement is made . " this is not just up to us , but we will do our part .
if that does n't succeed , it will not be the downfall of europe , but it will have extremely serious consequences for the future of europe , " merkel said .
she stressed that there was still a lot to do to move forward the debate on the draft constitution , which was rejected by french and dutch voters in referendums in 2005 .
merkel also cautioned that a solution to the dispute with poland was not yet in sight in her speech to the german parliament on thursday , a week ahead of the eu summit in brussels . but shortly afterwards , polish president lech kaczynski signalled that poland would seek a compromise over its opposition to the proposed voting system . kaczynski said he wanted to avoid the isolation of his country over the issue . glimmer of hope ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and dutch no votes propelled the eu into crisis warsaw had threatened to veto a deal on the future of the charter because of the planned changes , which poland says favor the bloc 's bigger states . germany is currently the holder of the rotating presidency , but its tenure ends at the end of june .

" we want to keep the substance of the treaty without over-burdening people , " she told lawmakers .
" any solution we do find must be in a form that helps europe . "
the chancellor said it was essential to find a solution to the treaty issue so that a bloc that has enlarged into eastern and southern europe is " able to function properly . "
the eu has expanded from a 15 to a 27-member bloc over the last three years , making reform necessary . challenging times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was more positive about eu achievements at heiligendamm " europe faces great challenges both within , and more importantly , outside its borders , " she said .
in addition , merkel stressed that it was necessary for a new constitution to better meet the wishes of european citizens .
this would involve making clearer the division of power between the bloc and its member states .
fears about the creation of a european super-state must also be taken into account , merkel told legislators . the chancellor gave a more positive evaluation of what had been achieved at the g8 summit , in particular over climate change , during her bundestag speech .

and she has warned of the repercussions if no agreement is made . " this is not just up to us , but we will do our part .
if that does n't succeed , it will not be the downfall of europe , but it will have extremely serious consequences for the future of europe , " merkel said .
she stressed that there was still a lot to do to move forward the debate on the draft constitution , which was rejected by french and dutch voters in referendums in 2005 .
merkel also cautioned that a solution to the dispute with poland was not yet in sight in her speech to the german parliament on thursday , a week ahead of the eu summit in brussels . but shortly afterwards , polish president lech kaczynski signalled that poland would seek a compromise over its opposition to the proposed voting system . kaczynski said he wanted to avoid the isolation of his country over the issue . glimmer of hope ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and dutch no votes propelled the eu into crisis warsaw had threatened to veto a deal on the future of the charter because of the planned changes , which poland says favor the bloc 's bigger states . germany is currently the holder of the rotating presidency , but its tenure ends at the end of june .
merkel had declared it her goal to break the deadlock over the eu treaty . the chancellor reiterated her position that the draft constitution would not be completely abandoned when any new treaty is drawn up .
" we want to keep the substance of the treaty without over-burdening people , " she told lawmakers .
" any solution we do find must be in a form that helps europe . "
the chancellor said it was essential to find a solution to the treaty issue so that a bloc that has enlarged into eastern and southern europe is " able to function properly . "
the eu has expanded from a 15 to a 27-member bloc over the last three years , making reform necessary . challenging times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was more positive about eu achievements at heiligendamm " europe faces great challenges both within , and more importantly , outside its borders , " she said .
in addition , merkel stressed that it was necessary for a new constitution to better meet the wishes of european citizens .
this would involve making clearer the division of power between the bloc and its member states .
fears about the creation of a european super-state must also be taken into account , merkel told legislators . the chancellor gave a more positive evaluation of what had been achieved at the g8 summit , in particular over climate change , during her bundestag speech .
she said that without the eu 's agreement on binding emission reduction goals the agreements reached at heiligendamm would have been " completely inconceivable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 14.06.2007 germany unveils model for fallen soldier memorial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial will be encased in bronze the defense ministry has presented plans for a memorial honoring those soldiers who have lost their lives since the bundeswehr was founded over 50 years ago .
but politicians disagree on a suitable location . the soldier 's memorial will be a narrow structure encased in bronze .
its surface will be embossed to depict its significance , said munich architect andreas meck . " half of an identity disk is portrayed , which represents those who died in service for the bundeswehr , " said meck , who designed the winning concept .
every soldier in service wears these oval-shaped disks .
when he or she dies , half of the disk is broken off and serves as a record of death . the soldier 's memorial , 41 meters -lrb- 45 yards -rrb- long and 10 meters -lrb- 11 yards -rrb- high , will be divided .
there will be a larger , more open space , as well as a smaller , blackened room .
the latter will only be lit by an opening in the ceiling .
a monolith will serve as a place for visitors to lay flowers and wreaths . meck 's concept will allow for both private and state or public mourning .
a sliding wall will make the memorial accessible from the ministry side and for civilians from the street .
the structure will bear the inscription : " our bundeswehr 's dead - for peace , justice and freedom . " the project costs are estimated at three million euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- and will be completed in mid-2008 . a common memorial was overdue bundeswehr inspector general wolfgang schneiderhan said meck 's concept moved and appealed to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense ministry wants to erect the memorial on its premises according to schneiderhan , building this central memorial was " not just appropriate , but overdue . "
up to now , the army , navy and air force each commemorate their fallen soldiers separately . the idea for a central memorial came to defense minister franz josef jung when he visited the afghan capital kabul in 2005 .
germans soldiers there had erected their own memorial for their fallen comrades . since then , jung has been keen on such a structure in germany . all parliamentarians should see the memorial since the bundeswehr was founded in may 1955 , over 2,600 members of the armed forces have died in duty , for example , in aircraft crashes or accidents during maneuvers . to date , 69 soldiers have fallen abroad - the most recent were three soldiers killed in a suicide bombing in afghanistan last month . several politicians would like to see the memorial erected near the bundestag due to its central importance .

but politicians disagree on a suitable location . the soldier 's memorial will be a narrow structure encased in bronze .
its surface will be embossed to depict its significance , said munich architect andreas meck . " half of an identity disk is portrayed , which represents those who died in service for the bundeswehr , " said meck , who designed the winning concept .
every soldier in service wears these oval-shaped disks .
when he or she dies , half of the disk is broken off and serves as a record of death . the soldier 's memorial , 41 meters -lrb- 45 yards -rrb- long and 10 meters -lrb- 11 yards -rrb- high , will be divided .
there will be a larger , more open space , as well as a smaller , blackened room .
the latter will only be lit by an opening in the ceiling .
a monolith will serve as a place for visitors to lay flowers and wreaths . meck 's concept will allow for both private and state or public mourning .
a sliding wall will make the memorial accessible from the ministry side and for civilians from the street .
the structure will bear the inscription : " our bundeswehr 's dead - for peace , justice and freedom . " the project costs are estimated at three million euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- and will be completed in mid-2008 . a common memorial was overdue bundeswehr inspector general wolfgang schneiderhan said meck 's concept moved and appealed to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense ministry wants to erect the memorial on its premises according to schneiderhan , building this central memorial was " not just appropriate , but overdue . "
up to now , the army , navy and air force each commemorate their fallen soldiers separately . the idea for a central memorial came to defense minister franz josef jung when he visited the afghan capital kabul in 2005 .
germans soldiers there had erected their own memorial for their fallen comrades . since then , jung has been keen on such a structure in germany . all parliamentarians should see the memorial since the bundeswehr was founded in may 1955 , over 2,600 members of the armed forces have died in duty , for example , in aircraft crashes or accidents during maneuvers . to date , 69 soldiers have fallen abroad - the most recent were three soldiers killed in a suicide bombing in afghanistan last month . several politicians would like to see the memorial erected near the bundestag due to its central importance . " it is necessary that everyone in parliament who decides about foreign deployments sees this memorial in order to be aware of how large their personal responsibility is , " said guido westerwelle , head of the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . but jung , a member of the ruling coalition partner christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , wants the structure to stand within the ministry 's premises in berlin . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it could be a big step back for angela merkel , who wants an eu treaty passed . speaking after talks in london with czech prime minister mirek topolanek , blair said there would be no deal at the brussels summit on june 21 and 22 unless demands for a eu constitution were set aside .
it could prove a big setback to german chancellor angela merkel , who has made getting the eu constitution back on track after defeats at the polls by the french and the dutch a priority of germany 's eu presidency , which ends this month .
blair told a news conference in downing street that there would be " real difficulties " between some of the 27 eu members due attend .
' amending treaty ' referring to french-german moves to resurrect aspects of the european constitution , soundly defeated in referenda in france and the netherlands two years ago , blair said he would sign up only to an " amending treaty . "
" frankly , in order to get an agreement , the type of issues we are talking about are going to have to be satisfied , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants to restart movement towards an eu constitution his comments came after talks with topolanek , who had expressed a " similar approach " on the issue of the constitution , blair indicated .
blair said there was " no point " returning to the constitution , and added that the eu should be looking at " smaller measures to make it more effective to the needs of countries . "
he said there was a " real desire " in europe to move on from the issue of the constitution to other matters of " huge importance , " such as energy , migration , economic issues and defence .
sarkozy visit earlier wednesday , blair 's office announced that french president nicolas sarkozy would visit london for crucial pre-summit talks on june 19 .
for the first time , blair and his successor , gordon brown , would be joint hosts of the meeting with sarkozy , an advocate of a " simplified treaty that would allow the implementation of the essential institutional advances contained in the eu constitution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown will soon be filling blair 's shoes such efforts have been dismissed as an attempt to " reintroduce the constitution through the back door " by commentators in london .
the blair-brown double act comes only days before brown is expected to be elected labour party leader , followed by blair 's final departure from power on june 27 .
blair 's spokesman said the meeting with sarkozy on june 19 was agreed at the recent group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in germany .
sarkozy 's claim that he and blair had agreed on the " framework " for a revised mini-constitution has not been backed up by officials in london .
" what 's important when you have got a new french president is that you get a chance to explore at greater length than is possible at a bilateral his position in the run-up to discussions at the summit , " said blair 's official spokesman .
gordon brown 's role the meeting , with the inclusion of brown in a " new role , " would therefore be " useful from several perspectives . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french said " non , " the british leadership is n't too wild on the idea either " we have always said there will be close consultations , as there always are before a summit , between colleagues in government .
but it will be the prime minister who will present the government position at the summit . "

it came after days of fighting between rival fatah and hamas factions that have left over 80 people dead .
michel , who expressed concern over the " growing humanitarian tragedy in gaza , " also appealed to both sides .
" the palestinians have already suffered far too much .
i strongly urge the warring parties to put away their guns and work together for the good of their people , " he said .
laws breached bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with gaza descending into civil war , a humanitarian tragedy is in the making he also urged fatah and hamas to abide by international conventions . " the warring parties must respect the principles of international humanitarian law and do everything possible to facilitate safe access by relief agencies to the civilian population , " michel said . hardline islamist hamas fighters on wednesday advanced their campaign to defeat the rival fatah movement in the gaza strip amid warnings that the deadly showdown could lead to an all-out palestinian civil war . the us-based human rights watch has accused both sides of committing war crimes during their battles , which have turned hospitals into battlegrounds . some senior palestinians have blamed the escalation of violence in the area on the eu 's direct aid embargo imposed on the hamas government after it came to power last january .
they say it has undermined the entire palestinian authority . lack of security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miltant hamas fighters have practically seized control of gaza the eu suspended all 16 of its relief projects in the territory funded by the commission 's humanitarian aid department -lrb- echo -rrb- due to the lack of security . michel said , " i fervently hope that the projects can resume very soon .
this is a time when people desperately need protection and support . " the un has also temporarily called off its relief operations in the area following the death of two un relief and works agency employees caught in the crossfire .
last year , the commission provided 84 million euros -lrb- $ 112 million -rrb- for humanitarian operations in the palestinian territories and 60 million euros have been earmarked for this year so far . dw staff / afp -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the opposition green party is even threatening to take the case to the federal constitutional court . the german defense ministry confirmed earlier this week that it had sent tornado surveillance jets to take aerial photographs of the g8 premises in heiligendamm and the surroundings .
the action had included flights over a g8 protestors ' camp in nearby reddelich . the mission had occurred at the request of police , said defense minister franz josef jung , a member of the ruling coalition partner christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : the reddelich camp was of interest to authorities according to the defense ministry , the deployment involved technical assistance to g8 organizers .
its aim was to recognize changes in soil conditions , as well as manipulations in major roads , it said . leading opposition politician hans-christian ströbele from the green party got the debate rolling after a protestor in the reddelich camp informed him about the flights .
ströbele said the use of tornados was a violation of the constitution .
he has threatened to bring the case before the constitutional court in karlsruhe . heiligendamm is not afghanistan critics of the deployment said the jets were similar to those used by the german air force in afghanistan to find taliban guerrillas . " protestors are n't taliban , after all , " said niels annen , a foreign affairs expert for the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the cdu 's coalition partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tornado cameras documented the g8 protestors ' camp dieter wiefelspütz , the spd 's interior spokesman , said the mission was legal , but politically " extremely foolish and insensitive . " wiefelspütz said police should have used their own helicopters for filming . " the defense minister is apparently lacking political instinct , " wiefelspütz told the daily passauer neue presse .
jung 's predecessor peter struck from the spd would have never approved such an action , he said . the g8 summit was not the first time tornados have been deployed as official support .
awacs jets patrolled areas during the soccer world cup last year , as well as during pope benedict 's visit to germany .
they are also used , for example , to monitor the repercussions of natural disasters . debate continues on domestic military deployment the issue was on the agenda wednesday at meetings of the parliamentary interior and defense committees in berlin .
merkel 's own cdu said it could not understand the outrage . " the mission was not only justified , but necessary , " said wolfgang bosbach , deputy parliamentary head of the cdu .
it did not violate any personal rights .
" there was no photographic material taken of individual persons . " the military , which also provided awacs airspace monitoring at the g8 summit , said it made no secret of the fact that it filmed the area in may and june . the coalition partners have been arguing for some time whether the military can be deployed within germany 's borders for defense purposes .
this would go beyond simple administrative or technical assistance .

and she has warned of the repercussions if no agreement is made . " this is not just up to us , but we will do our part .
if that does n't succeed , it will not be the downfall of europe , but it will have extremely serious consequences for the future of europe , " merkel said .
she stressed that there was still a lot to do to move forward the debate on the draft constitution , which was rejected by french and dutch voters in referendums in 2005 .
merkel also cautioned that a solution to the dispute with poland was not yet in sight in her speech to the german parliament on thursday , a week ahead of the eu summit in brussels . but shortly afterwards , polish president lech kaczynski signalled that poland would seek a compromise over its opposition to the proposed voting system . kaczynski said he wanted to avoid the isolation of his country over the issue . glimmer of hope ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and dutch no votes propelled the eu into crisis warsaw had threatened to veto a deal on the future of the charter because of the planned changes , which poland says favor the bloc 's bigger states . germany is currently the holder of the rotating presidency , but its tenure ends at the end of june .
merkel had declared it her goal to break the deadlock over the eu treaty . the chancellor reiterated her position that the draft constitution would not be completely abandoned when any new treaty is drawn up .
" we want to keep the substance of the treaty without over-burdening people , " she told lawmakers .
" any solution we do find must be in a form that helps europe . "
the chancellor said it was essential to find a solution to the treaty issue so that a bloc that has enlarged into eastern and southern europe is " able to function properly . "
the eu has expanded from a 15 to a 27-member bloc over the last three years , making reform necessary . challenging times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was more positive about eu achievements at heiligendamm " europe faces great challenges both within , and more importantly , outside its borders , " she said .
in addition , merkel stressed that it was necessary for a new constitution to better meet the wishes of european citizens .
this would involve making clearer the division of power between the bloc and its member states .
fears about the creation of a european super-state must also be taken into account , merkel told legislators . the chancellor gave a more positive evaluation of what had been achieved at the g8 summit , in particular over climate change , during her bundestag speech .
she said that without the eu 's agreement on binding emission reduction goals the agreements reached at heiligendamm would have been " completely inconceivable .

he could be a killer a squirrel with aggression issues acted out in the southern german town of passau , injuring three people before his last victim finished him off with a crutch . the bavarian town of passau , on the austrian border , is usually a fairly quiet place , with man and nature living in relative harmony .
but this week , the bucolic balance was thrown off when a squirrel went berserk , terrorizing three in a biting rampage that ended only with his death . his first victim was a 70-year-old woman , who was sitting peacefully in her living room when she was surprised by the sensation of small claws on her back .
the squirrel had jumped through a window and onto the woman , soon sinking its teeth into her hand .
acorns were n't on this little guy 's mind , arteries apparently were . terrified , the woman ran out into the street in a panic , managing to shake the squirrel off . but the creature , whipped into a frenzy , immediately found another victim .
he jumped onto a nearby construction worker , injuring him on the hand and arm .
the fellow was finally able to fight the furry demon off with a measuring pole . still on the hunt for blood , the tiny terror then ran into the garden of a 72-year-old retiree . " the squirrel massively attacked him on the arms , hand and thigh , " said a local police spokesperson .
so the senior citizen used the only weapon at his disposal - his crutch . he clubbed the ruthless rodent to death . how the squirrel obtained his bloodlust is still unclear , although experts have said its behavior could be linked to the mating season or the squirrel could have been diseased . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and she has warned of the repercussions if no agreement is made . " this is not just up to us , but we will do our part .
if that does n't succeed , it will not be the downfall of europe , but it will have extremely serious consequences for the future of europe , " merkel said .
she stressed that there was still a lot to do to move forward the debate on the draft constitution , which was rejected by french and dutch voters in referendums in 2005 .
merkel also cautioned that a solution to the dispute with poland was not yet in sight in her speech to the german parliament on thursday , a week ahead of the eu summit in brussels . but shortly afterwards , polish president lech kaczynski signalled that poland would seek a compromise over its opposition to the proposed voting system . kaczynski said he wanted to avoid the isolation of his country over the issue . glimmer of hope ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and dutch no votes propelled the eu into crisis warsaw had threatened to veto a deal on the future of the charter because of the planned changes , which poland says favor the bloc 's bigger states . germany is currently the holder of the rotating presidency , but its tenure ends at the end of june .
merkel had declared it her goal to break the deadlock over the eu treaty . the chancellor reiterated her position that the draft constitution would not be completely abandoned when any new treaty is drawn up .
" we want to keep the substance of the treaty without over-burdening people , " she told lawmakers .
" any solution we do find must be in a form that helps europe . "
the chancellor said it was essential to find a solution to the treaty issue so that a bloc that has enlarged into eastern and southern europe is " able to function properly . "
the eu has expanded from a 15 to a 27-member bloc over the last three years , making reform necessary . challenging times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was more positive about eu achievements at heiligendamm " europe faces great challenges both within , and more importantly , outside its borders , " she said .
in addition , merkel stressed that it was necessary for a new constitution to better meet the wishes of european citizens .
this would involve making clearer the division of power between the bloc and its member states .
fears about the creation of a european super-state must also be taken into account , merkel told legislators . the chancellor gave a more positive evaluation of what had been achieved at the g8 summit , in particular over climate change , during her bundestag speech .
she said that without the eu 's agreement on binding emission reduction goals the agreements reached at heiligendamm would have been " completely inconceivable .

but politicians disagree on a suitable location . the soldier 's memorial will be a narrow structure encased in bronze .
its surface will be embossed to depict its significance , said munich architect andreas meck . " half of an identity disk is portrayed , which represents those who died in service for the bundeswehr , " said meck , who designed the winning concept .
every soldier in service wears these oval-shaped disks .
when he or she dies , half of the disk is broken off and serves as a record of death . the soldier 's memorial , 41 meters -lrb- 45 yards -rrb- long and 10 meters -lrb- 11 yards -rrb- high , will be divided .
there will be a larger , more open space , as well as a smaller , blackened room .
the latter will only be lit by an opening in the ceiling .
a monolith will serve as a place for visitors to lay flowers and wreaths . meck 's concept will allow for both private and state or public mourning .
a sliding wall will make the memorial accessible from the ministry side and for civilians from the street .
the structure will bear the inscription : " our bundeswehr 's dead - for peace , justice and freedom . " the project costs are estimated at three million euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- and will be completed in mid-2008 . a common memorial was overdue bundeswehr inspector general wolfgang schneiderhan said meck 's concept moved and appealed to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense ministry wants to erect the memorial on its premises according to schneiderhan , building this central memorial was " not just appropriate , but overdue . "
up to now , the army , navy and air force each commemorate their fallen soldiers separately . the idea for a central memorial came to defense minister franz josef jung when he visited the afghan capital kabul in 2005 .
germans soldiers there had erected their own memorial for their fallen comrades . since then , jung has been keen on such a structure in germany . all parliamentarians should see the memorial since the bundeswehr was founded in may 1955 , over 2,600 members of the armed forces have died in duty , for example , in aircraft crashes or accidents during maneuvers . to date , 69 soldiers have fallen abroad - the most recent were three soldiers killed in a suicide bombing in afghanistan last month . several politicians would like to see the memorial erected near the bundestag due to its central importance . " it is necessary that everyone in parliament who decides about foreign deployments sees this memorial in order to be aware of how large their personal responsibility is , " said guido westerwelle , head of the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . but jung , a member of the ruling coalition partner christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , wants the structure to stand within the ministry 's premises in berlin . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and she has warned of the repercussions if no agreement is made . " this is not just up to us , but we will do our part .
if that does n't succeed , it will not be the downfall of europe , but it will have extremely serious consequences for the future of europe , " merkel said .
she stressed that there was still a lot to do to move forward the debate on the draft constitution , which was rejected by french and dutch voters in referendums in 2005 .
merkel also cautioned that a solution to the dispute with poland was not yet in sight in her speech to the german parliament on thursday , a week ahead of the eu summit in brussels . but shortly afterwards , polish president lech kaczynski signalled that poland would seek a compromise over its opposition to the proposed voting system . kaczynski said he wanted to avoid the isolation of his country over the issue . glimmer of hope ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and dutch no votes propelled the eu into crisis warsaw had threatened to veto a deal on the future of the charter because of the planned changes , which poland says favor the bloc 's bigger states . germany is currently the holder of the rotating presidency , but its tenure ends at the end of june .
merkel had declared it her goal to break the deadlock over the eu treaty . the chancellor reiterated her position that the draft constitution would not be completely abandoned when any new treaty is drawn up .
" we want to keep the substance of the treaty without over-burdening people , " she told lawmakers .
" any solution we do find must be in a form that helps europe . "
the chancellor said it was essential to find a solution to the treaty issue so that a bloc that has enlarged into eastern and southern europe is " able to function properly . "
the eu has expanded from a 15 to a 27-member bloc over the last three years , making reform necessary . challenging times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was more positive about eu achievements at heiligendamm " europe faces great challenges both within , and more importantly , outside its borders , " she said .
in addition , merkel stressed that it was necessary for a new constitution to better meet the wishes of european citizens .
this would involve making clearer the division of power between the bloc and its member states .
fears about the creation of a european super-state must also be taken into account , merkel told legislators . the chancellor gave a more positive evaluation of what had been achieved at the g8 summit , in particular over climate change , during her bundestag speech .
she said that without the eu 's agreement on binding emission reduction goals the agreements reached at heiligendamm would have been " completely inconceivable .

it could be a big step back for angela merkel , who wants an eu treaty passed . speaking after talks in london with czech prime minister mirek topolanek , blair said there would be no deal at the brussels summit on june 21 and 22 unless demands for a eu constitution were set aside .
it could prove a big setback to german chancellor angela merkel , who has made getting the eu constitution back on track after defeats at the polls by the french and the dutch a priority of germany 's eu presidency , which ends this month .
blair told a news conference in downing street that there would be " real difficulties " between some of the 27 eu members due attend .
' amending treaty ' referring to french-german moves to resurrect aspects of the european constitution , soundly defeated in referenda in france and the netherlands two years ago , blair said he would sign up only to an " amending treaty . "
" frankly , in order to get an agreement , the type of issues we are talking about are going to have to be satisfied , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants to restart movement towards an eu constitution his comments came after talks with topolanek , who had expressed a " similar approach " on the issue of the constitution , blair indicated .
blair said there was " no point " returning to the constitution , and added that the eu should be looking at " smaller measures to make it more effective to the needs of countries . "
he said there was a " real desire " in europe to move on from the issue of the constitution to other matters of " huge importance , " such as energy , migration , economic issues and defence .
sarkozy visit earlier wednesday , blair 's office announced that french president nicolas sarkozy would visit london for crucial pre-summit talks on june 19 .
for the first time , blair and his successor , gordon brown , would be joint hosts of the meeting with sarkozy , an advocate of a " simplified treaty that would allow the implementation of the essential institutional advances contained in the eu constitution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown will soon be filling blair 's shoes such efforts have been dismissed as an attempt to " reintroduce the constitution through the back door " by commentators in london .
the blair-brown double act comes only days before brown is expected to be elected labour party leader , followed by blair 's final departure from power on june 27 .
blair 's spokesman said the meeting with sarkozy on june 19 was agreed at the recent group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in germany .
sarkozy 's claim that he and blair had agreed on the " framework " for a revised mini-constitution has not been backed up by officials in london .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 14.06.2007 nato ministers discuss us missile shield at talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato headquarters in brussels at nato talks in brussels , defense ministers stepped up discussion on us plans to extend its missile shield into europe .
they will also discuss the kremlin 's offer to cooperate with the americans on the program . the talks mark the first time that the military alliance has included the us shield , which has deeply angered russia , in its own barely nascent plans to build a missile shield to cover all 26 nato allies . " nato 's approach is based on the principle of the indivisibility of allied security and on transparency with our partners , of course including russia , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said as he opened the meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer gets the meeting underway washington announced in january that it wants to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic linked to an early warning system , probably in the caucasus , all to be operational by 2013 . the shield is aimed at countering attacks from nations that washington regards as " rogue states " such as iran . unprotected areas the problem for nato is that four members - bulgaria , romania , greece and turkey - are only partly covered or left out of the umbrella all together , undermining this very " indivisibility of allied security . " to resolve this , the alliance is likely to " bolt on " to the us shield a smaller missile system - an " in-theater " type usually used to protect troops in battle - which it is developing and hopes to have in use by 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brdy military zone in the czech republic where the us wants to place a radar base " the cost of a complementary system would be a small fraction of the cost of a full and independent missile system for nato , " said senior nato defense planning official john colston ahead of the talks . any progress in the talks is likely to inflame emotions in russia , which has conducted a highly-public ballistic missile test in response to its former cold war foe 's plans , and raised the possibility of turning its arms towards europe . possible cooperation the meeting also takes place as nato and russia review a key soviet-era arms pact - the conventional forces in europe treaty - in vienna , which the allies refuse to endorse , while moscow claims that its restrictions are unfair . amid the heightened rhetoric , exacerbated by elections in russia late this year , president vladimir putin surprised his us counterpart george w. bush by proposing that they set up a joint us-russian radar base in azerbaijan . us and russian officials are studying the proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch members of the nato force in afghanistan " the most interesting part of it was that it was bush and putin both together , " dutch defense minister elmert van middelkoop said as he arrived for the talks .
" so it 's interesting for nato to consider it and i think it can be a part of the pacification of the subject . " the military alliance has not yet said whether the azeri base could work , as it might be too close to iran to be effective against long-range missiles . " we have an expression in britain : ' it 's not rocket science , " ' colston said .
" the trouble with missile defense is that it is rocket science . " the 26 defense chiefs , including us defense secretary robert gates , will also seek clarification from their russian counterpart anatoly serdyukov on moscow 's surprise offer . afghan civilians ministers are also due to review operations in afghanistan as concerns grow about civilian casualties in the country .
the talks come just days after us forces inadvertently killed seven policeman in an air strike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civilian casualties caused by nato troops are hurting the alliance 's standing among the population de hoop scheffer has said he wants to explore ways of improving cooperation between the afghan army , us troops and nato forces in the country .
the nato chief has also called for additional training of soldiers in the afghan national army . nato is worried that the recent wave of civilian deaths and damage to civilian property in afghanistan risks eroding european public support for the mission .
it also damages nato 's drive to win the hearts and minds of the afghan people . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it could be a big step back for angela merkel , who wants an eu treaty passed . speaking after talks in london with czech prime minister mirek topolanek , blair said there would be no deal at the brussels summit on june 21 and 22 unless demands for a eu constitution were set aside .
it could prove a big setback to german chancellor angela merkel , who has made getting the eu constitution back on track after defeats at the polls by the french and the dutch a priority of germany 's eu presidency , which ends this month .
blair told a news conference in downing street that there would be " real difficulties " between some of the 27 eu members due attend .
' amending treaty ' referring to french-german moves to resurrect aspects of the european constitution , soundly defeated in referenda in france and the netherlands two years ago , blair said he would sign up only to an " amending treaty . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants to restart movement towards an eu constitution his comments came after talks with topolanek , who had expressed a " similar approach " on the issue of the constitution , blair indicated .
blair said there was " no point " returning to the constitution , and added that the eu should be looking at " smaller measures to make it more effective to the needs of countries . "
he said there was a " real desire " in europe to move on from the issue of the constitution to other matters of " huge importance , " such as energy , migration , economic issues and defence .
sarkozy visit earlier wednesday , blair 's office announced that french president nicolas sarkozy would visit london for crucial pre-summit talks on june 19 .
for the first time , blair and his successor , gordon brown , would be joint hosts of the meeting with sarkozy , an advocate of a " simplified treaty that would allow the implementation of the essential institutional advances contained in the eu constitution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown will soon be filling blair 's shoes such efforts have been dismissed as an attempt to " reintroduce the constitution through the back door " by commentators in london .
the blair-brown double act comes only days before brown is expected to be elected labour party leader , followed by blair 's final departure from power on june 27 .
blair 's spokesman said the meeting with sarkozy on june 19 was agreed at the recent group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in germany .
sarkozy 's claim that he and blair had agreed on the " framework " for a revised mini-constitution has not been backed up by officials in london .
" what 's important when you have got a new french president is that you get a chance to explore at greater length than is possible at a bilateral his position in the run-up to discussions at the summit , " said blair 's official spokesman .
gordon brown 's role the meeting , with the inclusion of brown in a " new role , " would therefore be " useful from several perspectives . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french said " non , " the british leadership is n't too wild on the idea either " we have always said there will be close consultations , as there always are before a summit , between colleagues in government .

they will also discuss the kremlin 's offer to cooperate with the americans on the program . the talks mark the first time that the military alliance has included the us shield , which has deeply angered russia , in its own barely nascent plans to build a missile shield to cover all 26 nato allies . " nato 's approach is based on the principle of the indivisibility of allied security and on transparency with our partners , of course including russia , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said as he opened the meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer gets the meeting underway washington announced in january that it wants to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic linked to an early warning system , probably in the caucasus , all to be operational by 2013 . the shield is aimed at countering attacks from nations that washington regards as " rogue states " such as iran . unprotected areas the problem for nato is that four members - bulgaria , romania , greece and turkey - are only partly covered or left out of the umbrella all together , undermining this very " indivisibility of allied security . " to resolve this , the alliance is likely to " bolt on " to the us shield a smaller missile system - an " in-theater " type usually used to protect troops in battle - which it is developing and hopes to have in use by 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brdy military zone in the czech republic where the us wants to place a radar base " the cost of a complementary system would be a small fraction of the cost of a full and independent missile system for nato , " said senior nato defense planning official john colston ahead of the talks . any progress in the talks is likely to inflame emotions in russia , which has conducted a highly-public ballistic missile test in response to its former cold war foe 's plans , and raised the possibility of turning its arms towards europe . possible cooperation the meeting also takes place as nato and russia review a key soviet-era arms pact - the conventional forces in europe treaty - in vienna , which the allies refuse to endorse , while moscow claims that its restrictions are unfair . amid the heightened rhetoric , exacerbated by elections in russia late this year , president vladimir putin surprised his us counterpart george w. bush by proposing that they set up a joint us-russian radar base in azerbaijan . us and russian officials are studying the proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch members of the nato force in afghanistan " the most interesting part of it was that it was bush and putin both together , " dutch defense minister elmert van middelkoop said as he arrived for the talks .
" so it 's interesting for nato to consider it and i think it can be a part of the pacification of the subject . " the military alliance has not yet said whether the azeri base could work , as it might be too close to iran to be effective against long-range missiles . " we have an expression in britain : ' it 's not rocket science , " ' colston said .
" the trouble with missile defense is that it is rocket science . " the 26 defense chiefs , including us defense secretary robert gates , will also seek clarification from their russian counterpart anatoly serdyukov on moscow 's surprise offer . afghan civilians ministers are also due to review operations in afghanistan as concerns grow about civilian casualties in the country .
the talks come just days after us forces inadvertently killed seven policeman in an air strike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civilian casualties caused by nato troops are hurting the alliance 's standing among the population de hoop scheffer has said he wants to explore ways of improving cooperation between the afghan army , us troops and nato forces in the country .
the nato chief has also called for additional training of soldiers in the afghan national army . nato is worried that the recent wave of civilian deaths and damage to civilian property in afghanistan risks eroding european public support for the mission .
it also damages nato 's drive to win the hearts and minds of the afghan people . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is developing a space tourist plane to be completed by 2012 . the space arm of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- has announced plans to develop a spacecraft for tourists .
the vessel would offer travelers a 90-minute suborbital flight , including three minutes of weightlessness , at an altitude of more than 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- . according to francois auque , the president of eads astrium , the fare in space could total some 150,000 to 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 200,000 - $ 267,000 -rrb- .
this compared to $ 25 million for the few space tourists flying in the narrow capsule of the russian rocket " soyuz , " auque said . the russian space authority currently holds the monopoly in space tourism .
it offers flights to the international space station iss . " we are offering a profitable system and have given ourselves until early 2008 to find industrial partners to share the risk , private investment of around one billion euros and an operator for the journey , " auque told 2,500 vip guests in the french capital paris on wednesday evening .
" we will not do it without that . " a deep desire to enter space the aircraft , which eads plans to start developing next year , will be in operation from 2012 .
auque said eads expected the space tourist market to total 20,000 passengers a year by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spaceshipone successfully completed its first flight in 2004 " we want to serve a third of this , " auque said .
" we believe in this market . " according to auque , people had a deep desire to enter space . " we want to rouse european ambitions in the process , " he said . eads is competing with the us company spaceship , which is working on a successor for the legendary spaceshipone .
this spacecraft , which uses a hybrid rocket motor , completed the first privately funded human space flight in 2004 .
spaceship is aiming to offer suborbital flights for less than 100,000 euros in the near future . no threat from virgin galactic the eads space jet will take off and land conventionally from a standard airport using jet engines .
once it is airborne at an attitude of some 12 kilometers , though , the rocket engines will be ignited to give sufficient acceleration to reach the altitude of 100 kilometers .
then , the engines will be shut down so that passengers can experience zero gravity in space . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the craft 's seats balance themselves during the flight " we have ruled out the idea of a simple rocket , which can not be used again , " said robert laine , eads astrium 's technical director . the company was also not in favor of a small vessel attached to a large plane , the idea chosen by richard branson 's virgin galactic , he said . " this seems to us less safe , " laine said . virgin plans to offer space flights from 2009 .
but eads astrium said it was not concerned about entering the space race later , given " the qualities of the solution proposed by astrium which can take off and land on any runway , and the possibilities of the market . " the guests at the paris event were shown a full-sized model of the craft 's forward section .
the cabin , created by australian born designer marc newson , will be able to hold four passengers .

he could be a killer a squirrel with aggression issues acted out in the southern german town of passau , injuring three people before his last victim finished him off with a crutch . the bavarian town of passau , on the austrian border , is usually a fairly quiet place , with man and nature living in relative harmony .
but this week , the bucolic balance was thrown off when a squirrel went berserk , terrorizing three in a biting rampage that ended only with his death . his first victim was a 70-year-old woman , who was sitting peacefully in her living room when she was surprised by the sensation of small claws on her back .
the squirrel had jumped through a window and onto the woman , soon sinking its teeth into her hand .
acorns were n't on this little guy 's mind , arteries apparently were . terrified , the woman ran out into the street in a panic , managing to shake the squirrel off . but the creature , whipped into a frenzy , immediately found another victim .
he jumped onto a nearby construction worker , injuring him on the hand and arm .
the fellow was finally able to fight the furry demon off with a measuring pole . still on the hunt for blood , the tiny terror then ran into the garden of a 72-year-old retiree . " the squirrel massively attacked him on the arms , hand and thigh , " said a local police spokesperson .
so the senior citizen used the only weapon at his disposal - his crutch . he clubbed the ruthless rodent to death . how the squirrel obtained his bloodlust is still unclear , although experts have said its behavior could be linked to the mating season or the squirrel could have been diseased . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the change implements 11 eu guidelines and affects areas such as spousal immigration , integration and residency regulations . the 500 pages of the new rules were approved by 398 of the parliament 's 614 members , with the no votes coming from opposition parties , but also from some members of the social democratic party , a partner in germany 's current ruling coalition . besides incorporating eu guidelines on immigration into national law , the reform adds further amendments to an immigration law passed in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reform package did not pass the bundestag without opposition the government 's plan is aimed at cracking down on forced marriages , requiring that a spouse be 18 before entering the country .
in line with the moves in other nations , berlin has also introduced a requirement for those seeking to move to the country to have basic german language skills .
some foreigners entering the country will be asked to provide a digital photograph and fingerprints . under the law about 100,000 foreigners whose applications for asylum have been rejected will be able to stay in the country indefinitely provided they find a job by the end of 2009 . following are some of the key areas of the reform : new rules for spouses spouses who are citizens of non-eu countries can only join their partners if they are over the age of 18 and can demonstrate a basic knowledge of german before coming , although citizens who do not normally need visas to come to germany , such as americans or japanese , do not have to demonstrate ability in german .
there are also exceptions for highly skilled workers and entrepreneurs .
the age requirement is meant to discourage forced marriages . integration courses obligatory integration course have been introduced .
if foreigners refuse to take the courses , they can be fined .
those on social welfare can have their benefits cut by up to 30 percent . labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : highly skilled workers or those founding companies in germany will have it easier it will be easier for foreigners to immigrate who wish to invest or create jobs in germany .
the reform lowers the minimum investment amount from one million to 500,000 euros -lrb- from roughly $ 1.3 million to $ 665,000 -rrb- and the number of jobs created from 10 to five . domestic security as a reaction to the suitcases bomb plot of july 2006 , applicants for visas exceeding three months will be fingerprinted and " reference persons " for applicants in germany can be investigated by security services . citizenship in order to gain citizenship , foreigners will in future attest that they " understand the legal and societal systems and way of life in germany . " right of residence a right of residence section of the reform provides a grandfather clause for foreigners who have been in the country for years with " tolerated " status .
they will have the right to stay if , as of july 1 , they have lived in germany for at least eight years .
for families with children , the requirement is six years .
they must also be self-supporting , able to speak german and have no criminal record .
those without jobs will be given probationary period and have until the end of 2009 to find work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one critic slammed the reform as " racial classification " according to economic usefulness critics argue the reform goes beyond what the eu requires and makes life worse for many immigrants already living in germany , while making immigration in general more difficult .
hartfrid wolff , a parliamentarian with the free-market liberal fdp party , called the reform " piecemeal , " and lacking an overall concept on controlling and guiding immigration .
green party politician josef winkler went further , calling the draft " harmful , cheap and disgraceful . " but german interior minister wolfgang schäuble defended the compromise and praised in particular the parts of the reform which encourage integration . " integration has to work , " he said , adding that the federal , state and local governments all must work together toward that goal . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it came after days of fighting between rival fatah and hamas factions that have left over 80 people dead .
michel , who expressed concern over the " growing humanitarian tragedy in gaza , " also appealed to both sides .
" the palestinians have already suffered far too much .

but politicians disagree on a suitable location . the soldier 's memorial will be a narrow structure encased in bronze .
its surface will be embossed to depict its significance , said munich architect andreas meck . " half of an identity disk is portrayed , which represents those who died in service for the bundeswehr , " said meck , who designed the winning concept .
every soldier in service wears these oval-shaped disks .
when he or she dies , half of the disk is broken off and serves as a record of death . the soldier 's memorial , 41 meters -lrb- 45 yards -rrb- long and 10 meters -lrb- 11 yards -rrb- high , will be divided .
there will be a larger , more open space , as well as a smaller , blackened room .
the latter will only be lit by an opening in the ceiling .
a monolith will serve as a place for visitors to lay flowers and wreaths . meck 's concept will allow for both private and state or public mourning .
a sliding wall will make the memorial accessible from the ministry side and for civilians from the street .
the structure will bear the inscription : " our bundeswehr 's dead - for peace , justice and freedom . " the project costs are estimated at three million euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- and will be completed in mid-2008 . a common memorial was overdue bundeswehr inspector general wolfgang schneiderhan said meck 's concept moved and appealed to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense ministry wants to erect the memorial on its premises according to schneiderhan , building this central memorial was " not just appropriate , but overdue . "
up to now , the army , navy and air force each commemorate their fallen soldiers separately . the idea for a central memorial came to defense minister franz josef jung when he visited the afghan capital kabul in 2005 .
germans soldiers there had erected their own memorial for their fallen comrades . since then , jung has been keen on such a structure in germany . all parliamentarians should see the memorial since the bundeswehr was founded in may 1955 , over 2,600 members of the armed forces have died in duty , for example , in aircraft crashes or accidents during maneuvers . to date , 69 soldiers have fallen abroad - the most recent were three soldiers killed in a suicide bombing in afghanistan last month . several politicians would like to see the memorial erected near the bundestag due to its central importance . " it is necessary that everyone in parliament who decides about foreign deployments sees this memorial in order to be aware of how large their personal responsibility is , " said guido westerwelle , head of the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . but jung , a member of the ruling coalition partner christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , wants the structure to stand within the ministry 's premises in berlin . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it came after days of fighting between rival fatah and hamas factions that have left over 80 people dead .
michel , who expressed concern over the " growing humanitarian tragedy in gaza , " also appealed to both sides .
" the palestinians have already suffered far too much .
i strongly urge the warring parties to put away their guns and work together for the good of their people , " he said .

this is a time when people desperately need protection and support . " the un has also temporarily called off its relief operations in the area following the death of two un relief and works agency employees caught in the crossfire .

he could be a killer a squirrel with aggression issues acted out in the southern german town of passau , injuring three people before his last victim finished him off with a crutch . the bavarian town of passau , on the austrian border , is usually a fairly quiet place , with man and nature living in relative harmony .
but this week , the bucolic balance was thrown off when a squirrel went berserk , terrorizing three in a biting rampage that ended only with his death . his first victim was a 70-year-old woman , who was sitting peacefully in her living room when she was surprised by the sensation of small claws on her back .
the squirrel had jumped through a window and onto the woman , soon sinking its teeth into her hand .
acorns were n't on this little guy 's mind , arteries apparently were . terrified , the woman ran out into the street in a panic , managing to shake the squirrel off . but the creature , whipped into a frenzy , immediately found another victim .
he jumped onto a nearby construction worker , injuring him on the hand and arm .
the fellow was finally able to fight the furry demon off with a measuring pole . still on the hunt for blood , the tiny terror then ran into the garden of a 72-year-old retiree . " the squirrel massively attacked him on the arms , hand and thigh , " said a local police spokesperson .
so the senior citizen used the only weapon at his disposal - his crutch . he clubbed the ruthless rodent to death . how the squirrel obtained his bloodlust is still unclear , although experts have said its behavior could be linked to the mating season or the squirrel could have been diseased . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" to resolve this , the alliance is likely to " bolt on " to the us shield a smaller missile system - an " in-theater " type usually used to protect troops in battle - which it is developing and hopes to have in use by 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brdy military zone in the czech republic where the us wants to place a radar base " the cost of a complementary system would be a small fraction of the cost of a full and independent missile system for nato , " said senior nato defense planning official john colston ahead of the talks . any progress in the talks is likely to inflame emotions in russia , which has conducted a highly-public ballistic missile test in response to its former cold war foe 's plans , and raised the possibility of turning its arms towards europe . possible cooperation the meeting also takes place as nato and russia review a key soviet-era arms pact - the conventional forces in europe treaty - in vienna , which the allies refuse to endorse , while moscow claims that its restrictions are unfair . amid the heightened rhetoric , exacerbated by elections in russia late this year , president vladimir putin surprised his us counterpart george w. bush by proposing that they set up a joint us-russian radar base in azerbaijan . us and russian officials are studying the proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch members of the nato force in afghanistan " the most interesting part of it was that it was bush and putin both together , " dutch defense minister elmert van middelkoop said as he arrived for the talks .
" so it 's interesting for nato to consider it and i think it can be a part of the pacification of the subject . " the military alliance has not yet said whether the azeri base could work , as it might be too close to iran to be effective against long-range missiles . " we have an expression in britain : ' it 's not rocket science , " ' colston said .
" the trouble with missile defense is that it is rocket science . " the 26 defense chiefs , including us defense secretary robert gates , will also seek clarification from their russian counterpart anatoly serdyukov on moscow 's surprise offer . afghan civilians ministers are also due to review operations in afghanistan as concerns grow about civilian casualties in the country .
the talks come just days after us forces inadvertently killed seven policeman in an air strike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civilian casualties caused by nato troops are hurting the alliance 's standing among the population de hoop scheffer has said he wants to explore ways of improving cooperation between the afghan army , us troops and nato forces in the country .
the nato chief has also called for additional training of soldiers in the afghan national army . nato is worried that the recent wave of civilian deaths and damage to civilian property in afghanistan risks eroding european public support for the mission .

but politicians disagree on a suitable location . the soldier 's memorial will be a narrow structure encased in bronze .
its surface will be embossed to depict its significance , said munich architect andreas meck . " half of an identity disk is portrayed , which represents those who died in service for the bundeswehr , " said meck , who designed the winning concept .
every soldier in service wears these oval-shaped disks .
when he or she dies , half of the disk is broken off and serves as a record of death . the soldier 's memorial , 41 meters -lrb- 45 yards -rrb- long and 10 meters -lrb- 11 yards -rrb- high , will be divided .
there will be a larger , more open space , as well as a smaller , blackened room .
the latter will only be lit by an opening in the ceiling .
a monolith will serve as a place for visitors to lay flowers and wreaths . meck 's concept will allow for both private and state or public mourning .
a sliding wall will make the memorial accessible from the ministry side and for civilians from the street .
the structure will bear the inscription : " our bundeswehr 's dead - for peace , justice and freedom . " the project costs are estimated at three million euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- and will be completed in mid-2008 . a common memorial was overdue bundeswehr inspector general wolfgang schneiderhan said meck 's concept moved and appealed to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense ministry wants to erect the memorial on its premises according to schneiderhan , building this central memorial was " not just appropriate , but overdue . "
up to now , the army , navy and air force each commemorate their fallen soldiers separately . the idea for a central memorial came to defense minister franz josef jung when he visited the afghan capital kabul in 2005 .
germans soldiers there had erected their own memorial for their fallen comrades . since then , jung has been keen on such a structure in germany . all parliamentarians should see the memorial since the bundeswehr was founded in may 1955 , over 2,600 members of the armed forces have died in duty , for example , in aircraft crashes or accidents during maneuvers . to date , 69 soldiers have fallen abroad - the most recent were three soldiers killed in a suicide bombing in afghanistan last month . several politicians would like to see the memorial erected near the bundestag due to its central importance . " it is necessary that everyone in parliament who decides about foreign deployments sees this memorial in order to be aware of how large their personal responsibility is , " said guido westerwelle , head of the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . but jung , a member of the ruling coalition partner christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , wants the structure to stand within the ministry 's premises in berlin . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is developing a space tourist plane to be completed by 2012 . the space arm of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- has announced plans to develop a spacecraft for tourists .
the vessel would offer travelers a 90-minute suborbital flight , including three minutes of weightlessness , at an altitude of more than 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- . according to francois auque , the president of eads astrium , the fare in space could total some 150,000 to 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 200,000 - $ 267,000 -rrb- .
this compared to $ 25 million for the few space tourists flying in the narrow capsule of the russian rocket " soyuz , " auque said . the russian space authority currently holds the monopoly in space tourism .
it offers flights to the international space station iss . " we are offering a profitable system and have given ourselves until early 2008 to find industrial partners to share the risk , private investment of around one billion euros and an operator for the journey , " auque told 2,500 vip guests in the french capital paris on wednesday evening .
" we will not do it without that . " a deep desire to enter space the aircraft , which eads plans to start developing next year , will be in operation from 2012 .
auque said eads expected the space tourist market to total 20,000 passengers a year by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spaceshipone successfully completed its first flight in 2004 " we want to serve a third of this , " auque said .
" we believe in this market . " according to auque , people had a deep desire to enter space . " we want to rouse european ambitions in the process , " he said . eads is competing with the us company spaceship , which is working on a successor for the legendary spaceshipone .
this spacecraft , which uses a hybrid rocket motor , completed the first privately funded human space flight in 2004 .
spaceship is aiming to offer suborbital flights for less than 100,000 euros in the near future . no threat from virgin galactic the eads space jet will take off and land conventionally from a standard airport using jet engines .
once it is airborne at an attitude of some 12 kilometers , though , the rocket engines will be ignited to give sufficient acceleration to reach the altitude of 100 kilometers .
then , the engines will be shut down so that passengers can experience zero gravity in space . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the craft 's seats balance themselves during the flight " we have ruled out the idea of a simple rocket , which can not be used again , " said robert laine , eads astrium 's technical director . the company was also not in favor of a small vessel attached to a large plane , the idea chosen by richard branson 's virgin galactic , he said . " this seems to us less safe , " laine said . virgin plans to offer space flights from 2009 .
but eads astrium said it was not concerned about entering the space race later , given " the qualities of the solution proposed by astrium which can take off and land on any runway , and the possibilities of the market . " the guests at the paris event were shown a full-sized model of the craft 's forward section .
the cabin , created by australian born designer marc newson , will be able to hold four passengers .

the opposition green party is even threatening to take the case to the federal constitutional court . the german defense ministry confirmed earlier this week that it had sent tornado surveillance jets to take aerial photographs of the g8 premises in heiligendamm and the surroundings .
the action had included flights over a g8 protestors ' camp in nearby reddelich . the mission had occurred at the request of police , said defense minister franz josef jung , a member of the ruling coalition partner christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : the reddelich camp was of interest to authorities according to the defense ministry , the deployment involved technical assistance to g8 organizers .
its aim was to recognize changes in soil conditions , as well as manipulations in major roads , it said . leading opposition politician hans-christian ströbele from the green party got the debate rolling after a protestor in the reddelich camp informed him about the flights .
ströbele said the use of tornados was a violation of the constitution .
he has threatened to bring the case before the constitutional court in karlsruhe . heiligendamm is not afghanistan critics of the deployment said the jets were similar to those used by the german air force in afghanistan to find taliban guerrillas .

jung 's predecessor peter struck from the spd would have never approved such an action , he said . the g8 summit was not the first time tornados have been deployed as official support .
awacs jets patrolled areas during the soccer world cup last year , as well as during pope benedict 's visit to germany .
they are also used , for example , to monitor the repercussions of natural disasters . debate continues on domestic military deployment the issue was on the agenda wednesday at meetings of the parliamentary interior and defense committees in berlin .

it did not violate any personal rights .
" there was no photographic material taken of individual persons . " the military , which also provided awacs airspace monitoring at the g8 summit , said it made no secret of the fact that it filmed the area in may and june . the coalition partners have been arguing for some time whether the military can be deployed within germany 's borders for defense purposes .

it is developing a space tourist plane to be completed by 2012 . the space arm of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- has announced plans to develop a spacecraft for tourists .
the vessel would offer travelers a 90-minute suborbital flight , including three minutes of weightlessness , at an altitude of more than 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- . according to francois auque , the president of eads astrium , the fare in space could total some 150,000 to 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 200,000 - $ 267,000 -rrb- .
this compared to $ 25 million for the few space tourists flying in the narrow capsule of the russian rocket " soyuz , " auque said . the russian space authority currently holds the monopoly in space tourism .
it offers flights to the international space station iss . " we are offering a profitable system and have given ourselves until early 2008 to find industrial partners to share the risk , private investment of around one billion euros and an operator for the journey , " auque told 2,500 vip guests in the french capital paris on wednesday evening .
" we will not do it without that . " a deep desire to enter space the aircraft , which eads plans to start developing next year , will be in operation from 2012 .
auque said eads expected the space tourist market to total 20,000 passengers a year by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spaceshipone successfully completed its first flight in 2004 " we want to serve a third of this , " auque said .
" we believe in this market . " according to auque , people had a deep desire to enter space . " we want to rouse european ambitions in the process , " he said . eads is competing with the us company spaceship , which is working on a successor for the legendary spaceshipone .
this spacecraft , which uses a hybrid rocket motor , completed the first privately funded human space flight in 2004 .
spaceship is aiming to offer suborbital flights for less than 100,000 euros in the near future . no threat from virgin galactic the eads space jet will take off and land conventionally from a standard airport using jet engines .
once it is airborne at an attitude of some 12 kilometers , though , the rocket engines will be ignited to give sufficient acceleration to reach the altitude of 100 kilometers .
then , the engines will be shut down so that passengers can experience zero gravity in space . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the craft 's seats balance themselves during the flight " we have ruled out the idea of a simple rocket , which can not be used again , " said robert laine , eads astrium 's technical director . the company was also not in favor of a small vessel attached to a large plane , the idea chosen by richard branson 's virgin galactic , he said . " this seems to us less safe , " laine said . virgin plans to offer space flights from 2009 .
but eads astrium said it was not concerned about entering the space race later , given " the qualities of the solution proposed by astrium which can take off and land on any runway , and the possibilities of the market . " the guests at the paris event were shown a full-sized model of the craft 's forward section .
the cabin , created by australian born designer marc newson , will be able to hold four passengers .

he could be a killer a squirrel with aggression issues acted out in the southern german town of passau , injuring three people before his last victim finished him off with a crutch . the bavarian town of passau , on the austrian border , is usually a fairly quiet place , with man and nature living in relative harmony .
but this week , the bucolic balance was thrown off when a squirrel went berserk , terrorizing three in a biting rampage that ended only with his death . his first victim was a 70-year-old woman , who was sitting peacefully in her living room when she was surprised by the sensation of small claws on her back .
the squirrel had jumped through a window and onto the woman , soon sinking its teeth into her hand .
acorns were n't on this little guy 's mind , arteries apparently were . terrified , the woman ran out into the street in a panic , managing to shake the squirrel off . but the creature , whipped into a frenzy , immediately found another victim .
he jumped onto a nearby construction worker , injuring him on the hand and arm .
the fellow was finally able to fight the furry demon off with a measuring pole . still on the hunt for blood , the tiny terror then ran into the garden of a 72-year-old retiree . " the squirrel massively attacked him on the arms , hand and thigh , " said a local police spokesperson .
so the senior citizen used the only weapon at his disposal - his crutch . he clubbed the ruthless rodent to death . how the squirrel obtained his bloodlust is still unclear , although experts have said its behavior could be linked to the mating season or the squirrel could have been diseased . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the opposition green party is even threatening to take the case to the federal constitutional court . the german defense ministry confirmed earlier this week that it had sent tornado surveillance jets to take aerial photographs of the g8 premises in heiligendamm and the surroundings .

its aim was to recognize changes in soil conditions , as well as manipulations in major roads , it said . leading opposition politician hans-christian ströbele from the green party got the debate rolling after a protestor in the reddelich camp informed him about the flights .
ströbele said the use of tornados was a violation of the constitution .

the opposition green party is even threatening to take the case to the federal constitutional court . the german defense ministry confirmed earlier this week that it had sent tornado surveillance jets to take aerial photographs of the g8 premises in heiligendamm and the surroundings .
the action had included flights over a g8 protestors ' camp in nearby reddelich . the mission had occurred at the request of police , said defense minister franz josef jung , a member of the ruling coalition partner christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : the reddelich camp was of interest to authorities according to the defense ministry , the deployment involved technical assistance to g8 organizers .
its aim was to recognize changes in soil conditions , as well as manipulations in major roads , it said . leading opposition politician hans-christian ströbele from the green party got the debate rolling after a protestor in the reddelich camp informed him about the flights .
ströbele said the use of tornados was a violation of the constitution .
he has threatened to bring the case before the constitutional court in karlsruhe . heiligendamm is not afghanistan critics of the deployment said the jets were similar to those used by the german air force in afghanistan to find taliban guerrillas . " protestors are n't taliban , after all , " said niels annen , a foreign affairs expert for the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the cdu 's coalition partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tornado cameras documented the g8 protestors ' camp dieter wiefelspütz , the spd 's interior spokesman , said the mission was legal , but politically " extremely foolish and insensitive . " wiefelspütz said police should have used their own helicopters for filming . " the defense minister is apparently lacking political instinct , " wiefelspütz told the daily passauer neue presse .
jung 's predecessor peter struck from the spd would have never approved such an action , he said . the g8 summit was not the first time tornados have been deployed as official support .
awacs jets patrolled areas during the soccer world cup last year , as well as during pope benedict 's visit to germany .
they are also used , for example , to monitor the repercussions of natural disasters . debate continues on domestic military deployment the issue was on the agenda wednesday at meetings of the parliamentary interior and defense committees in berlin .
merkel 's own cdu said it could not understand the outrage . " the mission was not only justified , but necessary , " said wolfgang bosbach , deputy parliamentary head of the cdu .
it did not violate any personal rights .
" there was no photographic material taken of individual persons . " the military , which also provided awacs airspace monitoring at the g8 summit , said it made no secret of the fact that it filmed the area in may and june . the coalition partners have been arguing for some time whether the military can be deployed within germany 's borders for defense purposes .

she stressed that there was still a lot to do to move forward the debate on the draft constitution , which was rejected by french and dutch voters in referendums in 2005 .
merkel also cautioned that a solution to the dispute with poland was not yet in sight in her speech to the german parliament on thursday , a week ahead of the eu summit in brussels . but shortly afterwards , polish president lech kaczynski signalled that poland would seek a compromise over its opposition to the proposed voting system . kaczynski said he wanted to avoid the isolation of his country over the issue . glimmer of hope ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and dutch no votes propelled the eu into crisis warsaw had threatened to veto a deal on the future of the charter because of the planned changes , which poland says favor the bloc 's bigger states . germany is currently the holder of the rotating presidency , but its tenure ends at the end of june .

and she has warned of the repercussions if no agreement is made . " this is not just up to us , but we will do our part .
if that does n't succeed , it will not be the downfall of europe , but it will have extremely serious consequences for the future of europe , " merkel said .
she stressed that there was still a lot to do to move forward the debate on the draft constitution , which was rejected by french and dutch voters in referendums in 2005 .
merkel also cautioned that a solution to the dispute with poland was not yet in sight in her speech to the german parliament on thursday , a week ahead of the eu summit in brussels . but shortly afterwards , polish president lech kaczynski signalled that poland would seek a compromise over its opposition to the proposed voting system . kaczynski said he wanted to avoid the isolation of his country over the issue . glimmer of hope ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and dutch no votes propelled the eu into crisis warsaw had threatened to veto a deal on the future of the charter because of the planned changes , which poland says favor the bloc 's bigger states . germany is currently the holder of the rotating presidency , but its tenure ends at the end of june .
merkel had declared it her goal to break the deadlock over the eu treaty . the chancellor reiterated her position that the draft constitution would not be completely abandoned when any new treaty is drawn up .
" we want to keep the substance of the treaty without over-burdening people , " she told lawmakers .
" any solution we do find must be in a form that helps europe . "
the chancellor said it was essential to find a solution to the treaty issue so that a bloc that has enlarged into eastern and southern europe is " able to function properly . "
the eu has expanded from a 15 to a 27-member bloc over the last three years , making reform necessary . challenging times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was more positive about eu achievements at heiligendamm " europe faces great challenges both within , and more importantly , outside its borders , " she said .
in addition , merkel stressed that it was necessary for a new constitution to better meet the wishes of european citizens .
this would involve making clearer the division of power between the bloc and its member states .
fears about the creation of a european super-state must also be taken into account , merkel told legislators . the chancellor gave a more positive evaluation of what had been achieved at the g8 summit , in particular over climate change , during her bundestag speech .
she said that without the eu 's agreement on binding emission reduction goals the agreements reached at heiligendamm would have been " completely inconceivable .

they will also discuss the kremlin 's offer to cooperate with the americans on the program . the talks mark the first time that the military alliance has included the us shield , which has deeply angered russia , in its own barely nascent plans to build a missile shield to cover all 26 nato allies . " nato 's approach is based on the principle of the indivisibility of allied security and on transparency with our partners , of course including russia , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said as he opened the meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer gets the meeting underway washington announced in january that it wants to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic linked to an early warning system , probably in the caucasus , all to be operational by 2013 . the shield is aimed at countering attacks from nations that washington regards as " rogue states " such as iran . unprotected areas the problem for nato is that four members - bulgaria , romania , greece and turkey - are only partly covered or left out of the umbrella all together , undermining this very " indivisibility of allied security . " to resolve this , the alliance is likely to " bolt on " to the us shield a smaller missile system - an " in-theater " type usually used to protect troops in battle - which it is developing and hopes to have in use by 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brdy military zone in the czech republic where the us wants to place a radar base " the cost of a complementary system would be a small fraction of the cost of a full and independent missile system for nato , " said senior nato defense planning official john colston ahead of the talks . any progress in the talks is likely to inflame emotions in russia , which has conducted a highly-public ballistic missile test in response to its former cold war foe 's plans , and raised the possibility of turning its arms towards europe . possible cooperation the meeting also takes place as nato and russia review a key soviet-era arms pact - the conventional forces in europe treaty - in vienna , which the allies refuse to endorse , while moscow claims that its restrictions are unfair . amid the heightened rhetoric , exacerbated by elections in russia late this year , president vladimir putin surprised his us counterpart george w. bush by proposing that they set up a joint us-russian radar base in azerbaijan . us and russian officials are studying the proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch members of the nato force in afghanistan " the most interesting part of it was that it was bush and putin both together , " dutch defense minister elmert van middelkoop said as he arrived for the talks .
" so it 's interesting for nato to consider it and i think it can be a part of the pacification of the subject . " the military alliance has not yet said whether the azeri base could work , as it might be too close to iran to be effective against long-range missiles . " we have an expression in britain : ' it 's not rocket science , " ' colston said .
" the trouble with missile defense is that it is rocket science . " the 26 defense chiefs , including us defense secretary robert gates , will also seek clarification from their russian counterpart anatoly serdyukov on moscow 's surprise offer . afghan civilians ministers are also due to review operations in afghanistan as concerns grow about civilian casualties in the country .
the talks come just days after us forces inadvertently killed seven policeman in an air strike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civilian casualties caused by nato troops are hurting the alliance 's standing among the population de hoop scheffer has said he wants to explore ways of improving cooperation between the afghan army , us troops and nato forces in the country .
the nato chief has also called for additional training of soldiers in the afghan national army . nato is worried that the recent wave of civilian deaths and damage to civilian property in afghanistan risks eroding european public support for the mission .

"
" we see such a decision as a step aimed at destroying the existing security system , creating new dividing lines on the european continent , " he was quoted as saying .
but a senior us official said serdyukov did not repeat recent russian threats to target europe and did not place conditions on a counter-proposal from russian president vladimir putin for a joint us-russian radar in gabala , azerbaijan .

the assessment is to be completed by february 2008 ahead of a nato summit in bucharest to inform allied deliberations on fielding a theater missile defense system that could be " bolted on " to the us system , nato officials said .

they will also discuss the kremlin 's offer to cooperate with the americans on the program . the talks mark the first time that the military alliance has included the us shield , which has deeply angered russia , in its own barely nascent plans to build a missile shield to cover all 26 nato allies . " nato 's approach is based on the principle of the indivisibility of allied security and on transparency with our partners , of course including russia , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said as he opened the meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer gets the meeting underway washington announced in january that it wants to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic linked to an early warning system , probably in the caucasus , all to be operational by 2013 . the shield is aimed at countering attacks from nations that washington regards as " rogue states " such as iran . unprotected areas the problem for nato is that four members - bulgaria , romania , greece and turkey - are only partly covered or left out of the umbrella all together , undermining this very " indivisibility of allied security . " to resolve this , the alliance is likely to " bolt on " to the us shield a smaller missile system - an " in-theater " type usually used to protect troops in battle - which it is developing and hopes to have in use by 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brdy military zone in the czech republic where the us wants to place a radar base " the cost of a complementary system would be a small fraction of the cost of a full and independent missile system for nato , " said senior nato defense planning official john colston ahead of the talks . any progress in the talks is likely to inflame emotions in russia , which has conducted a highly-public ballistic missile test in response to its former cold war foe 's plans , and raised the possibility of turning its arms towards europe . possible cooperation the meeting also takes place as nato and russia review a key soviet-era arms pact - the conventional forces in europe treaty - in vienna , which the allies refuse to endorse , while moscow claims that its restrictions are unfair . amid the heightened rhetoric , exacerbated by elections in russia late this year , president vladimir putin surprised his us counterpart george w. bush by proposing that they set up a joint us-russian radar base in azerbaijan . us and russian officials are studying the proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch members of the nato force in afghanistan " the most interesting part of it was that it was bush and putin both together , " dutch defense minister elmert van middelkoop said as he arrived for the talks .

if that does n't succeed , it will not be the downfall of europe , but it will have extremely serious consequences for the future of europe , " merkel said .
she stressed that there was still a lot to do to move forward the debate on the draft constitution , which was rejected by french and dutch voters in referendums in 2005 .
merkel also cautioned that a solution to the dispute with poland was not yet in sight in her speech to the german parliament on thursday , a week ahead of the eu summit in brussels . but shortly afterwards , polish president lech kaczynski signalled that poland would seek a compromise over its opposition to the proposed voting system . kaczynski said he wanted to avoid the isolation of his country over the issue . glimmer of hope ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and dutch no votes propelled the eu into crisis warsaw had threatened to veto a deal on the future of the charter because of the planned changes , which poland says favor the bloc 's bigger states . germany is currently the holder of the rotating presidency , but its tenure ends at the end of june .

" we want to keep the substance of the treaty without over-burdening people , " she told lawmakers .
" any solution we do find must be in a form that helps europe . "
the chancellor said it was essential to find a solution to the treaty issue so that a bloc that has enlarged into eastern and southern europe is " able to function properly . "
the eu has expanded from a 15 to a 27-member bloc over the last three years , making reform necessary . challenging times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was more positive about eu achievements at heiligendamm " europe faces great challenges both within , and more importantly , outside its borders , " she said .
in addition , merkel stressed that it was necessary for a new constitution to better meet the wishes of european citizens .
this would involve making clearer the division of power between the bloc and its member states .
fears about the creation of a european super-state must also be taken into account , merkel told legislators . the chancellor gave a more positive evaluation of what had been achieved at the g8 summit , in particular over climate change , during her bundestag speech .

the opposition green party is even threatening to take the case to the federal constitutional court . the german defense ministry confirmed earlier this week that it had sent tornado surveillance jets to take aerial photographs of the g8 premises in heiligendamm and the surroundings .
the action had included flights over a g8 protestors ' camp in nearby reddelich . the mission had occurred at the request of police , said defense minister franz josef jung , a member of the ruling coalition partner christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : the reddelich camp was of interest to authorities according to the defense ministry , the deployment involved technical assistance to g8 organizers .
its aim was to recognize changes in soil conditions , as well as manipulations in major roads , it said . leading opposition politician hans-christian ströbele from the green party got the debate rolling after a protestor in the reddelich camp informed him about the flights .
ströbele said the use of tornados was a violation of the constitution .
he has threatened to bring the case before the constitutional court in karlsruhe . heiligendamm is not afghanistan critics of the deployment said the jets were similar to those used by the german air force in afghanistan to find taliban guerrillas . " protestors are n't taliban , after all , " said niels annen , a foreign affairs expert for the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the cdu 's coalition partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tornado cameras documented the g8 protestors ' camp dieter wiefelspütz , the spd 's interior spokesman , said the mission was legal , but politically " extremely foolish and insensitive . " wiefelspütz said police should have used their own helicopters for filming . " the defense minister is apparently lacking political instinct , " wiefelspütz told the daily passauer neue presse .
jung 's predecessor peter struck from the spd would have never approved such an action , he said . the g8 summit was not the first time tornados have been deployed as official support .
awacs jets patrolled areas during the soccer world cup last year , as well as during pope benedict 's visit to germany .
they are also used , for example , to monitor the repercussions of natural disasters . debate continues on domestic military deployment the issue was on the agenda wednesday at meetings of the parliamentary interior and defense committees in berlin .
merkel 's own cdu said it could not understand the outrage . " the mission was not only justified , but necessary , " said wolfgang bosbach , deputy parliamentary head of the cdu .
it did not violate any personal rights .
" there was no photographic material taken of individual persons . " the military , which also provided awacs airspace monitoring at the g8 summit , said it made no secret of the fact that it filmed the area in may and june . the coalition partners have been arguing for some time whether the military can be deployed within germany 's borders for defense purposes .

the action had included flights over a g8 protestors ' camp in nearby reddelich . the mission had occurred at the request of police , said defense minister franz josef jung , a member of the ruling coalition partner christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : the reddelich camp was of interest to authorities according to the defense ministry , the deployment involved technical assistance to g8 organizers .
its aim was to recognize changes in soil conditions , as well as manipulations in major roads , it said . leading opposition politician hans-christian ströbele from the green party got the debate rolling after a protestor in the reddelich camp informed him about the flights .
ströbele said the use of tornados was a violation of the constitution .
he has threatened to bring the case before the constitutional court in karlsruhe . heiligendamm is not afghanistan critics of the deployment said the jets were similar to those used by the german air force in afghanistan to find taliban guerrillas .

jung 's predecessor peter struck from the spd would have never approved such an action , he said . the g8 summit was not the first time tornados have been deployed as official support .
awacs jets patrolled areas during the soccer world cup last year , as well as during pope benedict 's visit to germany .
they are also used , for example , to monitor the repercussions of natural disasters . debate continues on domestic military deployment the issue was on the agenda wednesday at meetings of the parliamentary interior and defense committees in berlin .

it did not violate any personal rights .

" the military , which also provided awacs airspace monitoring at the g8 summit , said it made no secret of the fact that it filmed the area in may and june . the coalition partners have been arguing for some time whether the military can be deployed within germany 's borders for defense purposes .

it could be a big step back for angela merkel , who wants an eu treaty passed . speaking after talks in london with czech prime minister mirek topolanek , blair said there would be no deal at the brussels summit on june 21 and 22 unless demands for a eu constitution were set aside .
it could prove a big setback to german chancellor angela merkel , who has made getting the eu constitution back on track after defeats at the polls by the french and the dutch a priority of germany 's eu presidency , which ends this month .
blair told a news conference in downing street that there would be " real difficulties " between some of the 27 eu members due attend .
' amending treaty ' referring to french-german moves to resurrect aspects of the european constitution , soundly defeated in referenda in france and the netherlands two years ago , blair said he would sign up only to an " amending treaty . "
" frankly , in order to get an agreement , the type of issues we are talking about are going to have to be satisfied , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants to restart movement towards an eu constitution his comments came after talks with topolanek , who had expressed a " similar approach " on the issue of the constitution , blair indicated .
blair said there was " no point " returning to the constitution , and added that the eu should be looking at " smaller measures to make it more effective to the needs of countries . "
he said there was a " real desire " in europe to move on from the issue of the constitution to other matters of " huge importance , " such as energy , migration , economic issues and defence .
sarkozy visit earlier wednesday , blair 's office announced that french president nicolas sarkozy would visit london for crucial pre-summit talks on june 19 .
for the first time , blair and his successor , gordon brown , would be joint hosts of the meeting with sarkozy , an advocate of a " simplified treaty that would allow the implementation of the essential institutional advances contained in the eu constitution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown will soon be filling blair 's shoes such efforts have been dismissed as an attempt to " reintroduce the constitution through the back door " by commentators in london .
the blair-brown double act comes only days before brown is expected to be elected labour party leader , followed by blair 's final departure from power on june 27 .
blair 's spokesman said the meeting with sarkozy on june 19 was agreed at the recent group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in germany .
sarkozy 's claim that he and blair had agreed on the " framework " for a revised mini-constitution has not been backed up by officials in london .
" what 's important when you have got a new french president is that you get a chance to explore at greater length than is possible at a bilateral his position in the run-up to discussions at the summit , " said blair 's official spokesman .
gordon brown 's role the meeting , with the inclusion of brown in a " new role , " would therefore be " useful from several perspectives . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french said " non , " the british leadership is n't too wild on the idea either " we have always said there will be close consultations , as there always are before a summit , between colleagues in government .
but it will be the prime minister who will present the government position at the summit . "
the brown camp has expressed fears that blair could be prepared to sign up to a controversial deal on the eu constitution just days before he leaves office . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french proposal to end eu crisis makes headway french president nicolas sarkozy 's idea of a simplified treaty designed to end the european union 's constitional crisis appears to be gaining support .

the change implements 11 eu guidelines and affects areas such as spousal immigration , integration and residency regulations . the 500 pages of the new rules were approved by 398 of the parliament 's 614 members , with the no votes coming from opposition parties , but also from some members of the social democratic party , a partner in germany 's current ruling coalition . besides incorporating eu guidelines on immigration into national law , the reform adds further amendments to an immigration law passed in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reform package did not pass the bundestag without opposition the government 's plan is aimed at cracking down on forced marriages , requiring that a spouse be 18 before entering the country .
in line with the moves in other nations , berlin has also introduced a requirement for those seeking to move to the country to have basic german language skills .
some foreigners entering the country will be asked to provide a digital photograph and fingerprints . under the law about 100,000 foreigners whose applications for asylum have been rejected will be able to stay in the country indefinitely provided they find a job by the end of 2009 . following are some of the key areas of the reform : new rules for spouses spouses who are citizens of non-eu countries can only join their partners if they are over the age of 18 and can demonstrate a basic knowledge of german before coming , although citizens who do not normally need visas to come to germany , such as americans or japanese , do not have to demonstrate ability in german .
there are also exceptions for highly skilled workers and entrepreneurs .
the age requirement is meant to discourage forced marriages . integration courses obligatory integration course have been introduced .
if foreigners refuse to take the courses , they can be fined .
those on social welfare can have their benefits cut by up to 30 percent . labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : highly skilled workers or those founding companies in germany will have it easier it will be easier for foreigners to immigrate who wish to invest or create jobs in germany .
the reform lowers the minimum investment amount from one million to 500,000 euros -lrb- from roughly $ 1.3 million to $ 665,000 -rrb- and the number of jobs created from 10 to five . domestic security as a reaction to the suitcases bomb plot of july 2006 , applicants for visas exceeding three months will be fingerprinted and " reference persons " for applicants in germany can be investigated by security services . citizenship in order to gain citizenship , foreigners will in future attest that they " understand the legal and societal systems and way of life in germany . " right of residence a right of residence section of the reform provides a grandfather clause for foreigners who have been in the country for years with " tolerated " status .
they will have the right to stay if , as of july 1 , they have lived in germany for at least eight years .
for families with children , the requirement is six years .
they must also be self-supporting , able to speak german and have no criminal record .
those without jobs will be given probationary period and have until the end of 2009 to find work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one critic slammed the reform as " racial classification " according to economic usefulness critics argue the reform goes beyond what the eu requires and makes life worse for many immigrants already living in germany , while making immigration in general more difficult .
hartfrid wolff , a parliamentarian with the free-market liberal fdp party , called the reform " piecemeal , " and lacking an overall concept on controlling and guiding immigration .
green party politician josef winkler went further , calling the draft " harmful , cheap and disgraceful . " but german interior minister wolfgang schäuble defended the compromise and praised in particular the parts of the reform which encourage integration . " integration has to work , " he said , adding that the federal , state and local governments all must work together toward that goal . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and she has warned of the repercussions if no agreement is made . " this is not just up to us , but we will do our part .
if that does n't succeed , it will not be the downfall of europe , but it will have extremely serious consequences for the future of europe , " merkel said .
she stressed that there was still a lot to do to move forward the debate on the draft constitution , which was rejected by french and dutch voters in referendums in 2005 .
merkel also cautioned that a solution to the dispute with poland was not yet in sight in her speech to the german parliament on thursday , a week ahead of the eu summit in brussels . but shortly afterwards , polish president lech kaczynski signalled that poland would seek a compromise over its opposition to the proposed voting system . kaczynski said he wanted to avoid the isolation of his country over the issue . glimmer of hope ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and dutch no votes propelled the eu into crisis warsaw had threatened to veto a deal on the future of the charter because of the planned changes , which poland says favor the bloc 's bigger states . germany is currently the holder of the rotating presidency , but its tenure ends at the end of june .
merkel had declared it her goal to break the deadlock over the eu treaty . the chancellor reiterated her position that the draft constitution would not be completely abandoned when any new treaty is drawn up .
" we want to keep the substance of the treaty without over-burdening people , " she told lawmakers .
" any solution we do find must be in a form that helps europe . "
the chancellor said it was essential to find a solution to the treaty issue so that a bloc that has enlarged into eastern and southern europe is " able to function properly . "
the eu has expanded from a 15 to a 27-member bloc over the last three years , making reform necessary . challenging times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was more positive about eu achievements at heiligendamm " europe faces great challenges both within , and more importantly , outside its borders , " she said .
in addition , merkel stressed that it was necessary for a new constitution to better meet the wishes of european citizens .
this would involve making clearer the division of power between the bloc and its member states .
fears about the creation of a european super-state must also be taken into account , merkel told legislators . the chancellor gave a more positive evaluation of what had been achieved at the g8 summit , in particular over climate change , during her bundestag speech .
she said that without the eu 's agreement on binding emission reduction goals the agreements reached at heiligendamm would have been " completely inconceivable .

but politicians disagree on a suitable location . the soldier 's memorial will be a narrow structure encased in bronze .
its surface will be embossed to depict its significance , said munich architect andreas meck . " half of an identity disk is portrayed , which represents those who died in service for the bundeswehr , " said meck , who designed the winning concept .
every soldier in service wears these oval-shaped disks .
when he or she dies , half of the disk is broken off and serves as a record of death . the soldier 's memorial , 41 meters -lrb- 45 yards -rrb- long and 10 meters -lrb- 11 yards -rrb- high , will be divided .
there will be a larger , more open space , as well as a smaller , blackened room .
the latter will only be lit by an opening in the ceiling .
a monolith will serve as a place for visitors to lay flowers and wreaths . meck 's concept will allow for both private and state or public mourning .
a sliding wall will make the memorial accessible from the ministry side and for civilians from the street .
the structure will bear the inscription : " our bundeswehr 's dead - for peace , justice and freedom . " the project costs are estimated at three million euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- and will be completed in mid-2008 . a common memorial was overdue bundeswehr inspector general wolfgang schneiderhan said meck 's concept moved and appealed to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense ministry wants to erect the memorial on its premises according to schneiderhan , building this central memorial was " not just appropriate , but overdue . "
up to now , the army , navy and air force each commemorate their fallen soldiers separately . the idea for a central memorial came to defense minister franz josef jung when he visited the afghan capital kabul in 2005 .
germans soldiers there had erected their own memorial for their fallen comrades . since then , jung has been keen on such a structure in germany . all parliamentarians should see the memorial since the bundeswehr was founded in may 1955 , over 2,600 members of the armed forces have died in duty , for example , in aircraft crashes or accidents during maneuvers . to date , 69 soldiers have fallen abroad - the most recent were three soldiers killed in a suicide bombing in afghanistan last month . several politicians would like to see the memorial erected near the bundestag due to its central importance . " it is necessary that everyone in parliament who decides about foreign deployments sees this memorial in order to be aware of how large their personal responsibility is , " said guido westerwelle , head of the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . but jung , a member of the ruling coalition partner christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , wants the structure to stand within the ministry 's premises in berlin . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the change implements 11 eu guidelines and affects areas such as spousal immigration , integration and residency regulations . the 500 pages of the new rules were approved by 398 of the parliament 's 614 members , with the no votes coming from opposition parties , but also from some members of the social democratic party , a partner in germany 's current ruling coalition . besides incorporating eu guidelines on immigration into national law , the reform adds further amendments to an immigration law passed in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reform package did not pass the bundestag without opposition the government 's plan is aimed at cracking down on forced marriages , requiring that a spouse be 18 before entering the country .
in line with the moves in other nations , berlin has also introduced a requirement for those seeking to move to the country to have basic german language skills .
some foreigners entering the country will be asked to provide a digital photograph and fingerprints . under the law about 100,000 foreigners whose applications for asylum have been rejected will be able to stay in the country indefinitely provided they find a job by the end of 2009 . following are some of the key areas of the reform : new rules for spouses spouses who are citizens of non-eu countries can only join their partners if they are over the age of 18 and can demonstrate a basic knowledge of german before coming , although citizens who do not normally need visas to come to germany , such as americans or japanese , do not have to demonstrate ability in german .
there are also exceptions for highly skilled workers and entrepreneurs .
the age requirement is meant to discourage forced marriages . integration courses obligatory integration course have been introduced .
if foreigners refuse to take the courses , they can be fined .
those on social welfare can have their benefits cut by up to 30 percent . labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : highly skilled workers or those founding companies in germany will have it easier it will be easier for foreigners to immigrate who wish to invest or create jobs in germany .
the reform lowers the minimum investment amount from one million to 500,000 euros -lrb- from roughly $ 1.3 million to $ 665,000 -rrb- and the number of jobs created from 10 to five . domestic security as a reaction to the suitcases bomb plot of july 2006 , applicants for visas exceeding three months will be fingerprinted and " reference persons " for applicants in germany can be investigated by security services . citizenship in order to gain citizenship , foreigners will in future attest that they " understand the legal and societal systems and way of life in germany . " right of residence a right of residence section of the reform provides a grandfather clause for foreigners who have been in the country for years with " tolerated " status .
they will have the right to stay if , as of july 1 , they have lived in germany for at least eight years .
for families with children , the requirement is six years .
they must also be self-supporting , able to speak german and have no criminal record .
those without jobs will be given probationary period and have until the end of 2009 to find work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one critic slammed the reform as " racial classification " according to economic usefulness critics argue the reform goes beyond what the eu requires and makes life worse for many immigrants already living in germany , while making immigration in general more difficult .
hartfrid wolff , a parliamentarian with the free-market liberal fdp party , called the reform " piecemeal , " and lacking an overall concept on controlling and guiding immigration .
green party politician josef winkler went further , calling the draft " harmful , cheap and disgraceful . " but german interior minister wolfgang schäuble defended the compromise and praised in particular the parts of the reform which encourage integration . " integration has to work , " he said , adding that the federal , state and local governments all must work together toward that goal . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel also cautioned that a solution to the dispute with poland was not yet in sight in her speech to the german parliament on thursday , a week ahead of the eu summit in brussels . but shortly afterwards , polish president lech kaczynski signalled that poland would seek a compromise over its opposition to the proposed voting system . kaczynski said he wanted to avoid the isolation of his country over the issue . glimmer of hope ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and dutch no votes propelled the eu into crisis warsaw had threatened to veto a deal on the future of the charter because of the planned changes , which poland says favor the bloc 's bigger states . germany is currently the holder of the rotating presidency , but its tenure ends at the end of june .

" we want to keep the substance of the treaty without over-burdening people , " she told lawmakers .
" any solution we do find must be in a form that helps europe . "
the chancellor said it was essential to find a solution to the treaty issue so that a bloc that has enlarged into eastern and southern europe is " able to function properly . "

but politicians disagree on a suitable location . the soldier 's memorial will be a narrow structure encased in bronze .
its surface will be embossed to depict its significance , said munich architect andreas meck . " half of an identity disk is portrayed , which represents those who died in service for the bundeswehr , " said meck , who designed the winning concept .
every soldier in service wears these oval-shaped disks .
when he or she dies , half of the disk is broken off and serves as a record of death . the soldier 's memorial , 41 meters -lrb- 45 yards -rrb- long and 10 meters -lrb- 11 yards -rrb- high , will be divided .
there will be a larger , more open space , as well as a smaller , blackened room .
the latter will only be lit by an opening in the ceiling .
a monolith will serve as a place for visitors to lay flowers and wreaths . meck 's concept will allow for both private and state or public mourning .
a sliding wall will make the memorial accessible from the ministry side and for civilians from the street .
the structure will bear the inscription : " our bundeswehr 's dead - for peace , justice and freedom . " the project costs are estimated at three million euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- and will be completed in mid-2008 . a common memorial was overdue bundeswehr inspector general wolfgang schneiderhan said meck 's concept moved and appealed to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense ministry wants to erect the memorial on its premises according to schneiderhan , building this central memorial was " not just appropriate , but overdue . "
up to now , the army , navy and air force each commemorate their fallen soldiers separately . the idea for a central memorial came to defense minister franz josef jung when he visited the afghan capital kabul in 2005 .
germans soldiers there had erected their own memorial for their fallen comrades . since then , jung has been keen on such a structure in germany . all parliamentarians should see the memorial since the bundeswehr was founded in may 1955 , over 2,600 members of the armed forces have died in duty , for example , in aircraft crashes or accidents during maneuvers . to date , 69 soldiers have fallen abroad - the most recent were three soldiers killed in a suicide bombing in afghanistan last month . several politicians would like to see the memorial erected near the bundestag due to its central importance . " it is necessary that everyone in parliament who decides about foreign deployments sees this memorial in order to be aware of how large their personal responsibility is , " said guido westerwelle , head of the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . but jung , a member of the ruling coalition partner christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , wants the structure to stand within the ministry 's premises in berlin . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it could be a big step back for angela merkel , who wants an eu treaty passed . speaking after talks in london with czech prime minister mirek topolanek , blair said there would be no deal at the brussels summit on june 21 and 22 unless demands for a eu constitution were set aside .
it could prove a big setback to german chancellor angela merkel , who has made getting the eu constitution back on track after defeats at the polls by the french and the dutch a priority of germany 's eu presidency , which ends this month .
blair told a news conference in downing street that there would be " real difficulties " between some of the 27 eu members due attend .
' amending treaty ' referring to french-german moves to resurrect aspects of the european constitution , soundly defeated in referenda in france and the netherlands two years ago , blair said he would sign up only to an " amending treaty . "
" frankly , in order to get an agreement , the type of issues we are talking about are going to have to be satisfied , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants to restart movement towards an eu constitution his comments came after talks with topolanek , who had expressed a " similar approach " on the issue of the constitution , blair indicated .
blair said there was " no point " returning to the constitution , and added that the eu should be looking at " smaller measures to make it more effective to the needs of countries . "
he said there was a " real desire " in europe to move on from the issue of the constitution to other matters of " huge importance , " such as energy , migration , economic issues and defence .
sarkozy visit earlier wednesday , blair 's office announced that french president nicolas sarkozy would visit london for crucial pre-summit talks on june 19 .
for the first time , blair and his successor , gordon brown , would be joint hosts of the meeting with sarkozy , an advocate of a " simplified treaty that would allow the implementation of the essential institutional advances contained in the eu constitution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown will soon be filling blair 's shoes such efforts have been dismissed as an attempt to " reintroduce the constitution through the back door " by commentators in london .
the blair-brown double act comes only days before brown is expected to be elected labour party leader , followed by blair 's final departure from power on june 27 .
blair 's spokesman said the meeting with sarkozy on june 19 was agreed at the recent group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in germany .
sarkozy 's claim that he and blair had agreed on the " framework " for a revised mini-constitution has not been backed up by officials in london .
" what 's important when you have got a new french president is that you get a chance to explore at greater length than is possible at a bilateral his position in the run-up to discussions at the summit , " said blair 's official spokesman .
gordon brown 's role the meeting , with the inclusion of brown in a " new role , " would therefore be " useful from several perspectives . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french said " non , " the british leadership is n't too wild on the idea either " we have always said there will be close consultations , as there always are before a summit , between colleagues in government .
but it will be the prime minister who will present the government position at the summit . "

"
" we see such a decision as a step aimed at destroying the existing security system , creating new dividing lines on the european continent , " he was quoted as saying .
but a senior us official said serdyukov did not repeat recent russian threats to target europe and did not place conditions on a counter-proposal from russian president vladimir putin for a joint us-russian radar in gabala , azerbaijan .
us defense secretary robert gates made clear that " we intend to continue our talks with poland and the czech republic , " the official said , speaking on condition of anonymity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates and putin , in april " what he has said today is that we want to work with russia on what role gabala might play .
we also simultaneously need to continue the work at nato and we need to continue the negotiations with poland and the czech republic . "
outside the umbrella nato defense ministers agreed to assess the political and military implications of the us missile defense plan with an eye to what nato would have to do to defend areas in southern europe not under its umbrella .
the assessment is to be completed by february 2008 ahead of a nato summit in bucharest to inform allied deliberations on fielding a theater missile defense system that could be " bolted on " to the us system , nato officials said .
the study was " a recognition that the us discussion and proposals with poland and the czech republic are a : a fact , b : that they are moving forward , and c : that nato work ... on missile defense needs to take that into account , " said nato spokesman james appathurai .
appathurai said none of the 26 member countries had opposed the us plans .
" nato will now move forward to assess the political and military implications of the us missile system proposals , " he said .
nato ministers then met in a separate session with serdyukov in what one nato diplomat described as " calm and cold . "
" each side simply restated its own arguments .
there were no harsh words , but then there was no progress either , " the diplomat said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serdyukov warned nato the us official described it as a " very workmanlike session . "
" he made no threats today .
there were no linkages with regard to gabala .
allies were very welcoming of russia 's interest in cooperating on missile defense , " the official said .
airing differences on saturday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov urged washington to freeze work with poland and the czech republic on its missile shield , concerned that continued talks might worsen the iranian nuclear stand-off .
appathurai said the nato-russia council would remain a forum in which both sides could air their differences over missile defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many czechs oppose the plans washington announced in january that it wants to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic linked to an early warning system , probably in the caucasus , all to be operational by 2013 .
the shield is aimed at countering attacks from nations that washington regards as " rogue states " such as iran .
the problem for nato is that four members - bulgaria , romania , greece and turkey - are only partly covered or left out of the umbrella all together , undermining the principle of " indivisibility of allied security .

"
" we see such a decision as a step aimed at destroying the existing security system , creating new dividing lines on the european continent , " he was quoted as saying .
but a senior us official said serdyukov did not repeat recent russian threats to target europe and did not place conditions on a counter-proposal from russian president vladimir putin for a joint us-russian radar in gabala , azerbaijan .
us defense secretary robert gates made clear that " we intend to continue our talks with poland and the czech republic , " the official said , speaking on condition of anonymity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates and putin , in april " what he has said today is that we want to work with russia on what role gabala might play .
we also simultaneously need to continue the work at nato and we need to continue the negotiations with poland and the czech republic . "
outside the umbrella nato defense ministers agreed to assess the political and military implications of the us missile defense plan with an eye to what nato would have to do to defend areas in southern europe not under its umbrella .
the assessment is to be completed by february 2008 ahead of a nato summit in bucharest to inform allied deliberations on fielding a theater missile defense system that could be " bolted on " to the us system , nato officials said .
the study was " a recognition that the us discussion and proposals with poland and the czech republic are a : a fact , b : that they are moving forward , and c : that nato work ... on missile defense needs to take that into account , " said nato spokesman james appathurai .
appathurai said none of the 26 member countries had opposed the us plans .
" nato will now move forward to assess the political and military implications of the us missile system proposals , " he said .
nato ministers then met in a separate session with serdyukov in what one nato diplomat described as " calm and cold . "
" each side simply restated its own arguments .
there were no harsh words , but then there was no progress either , " the diplomat said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serdyukov warned nato the us official described it as a " very workmanlike session . "
" he made no threats today .
there were no linkages with regard to gabala .
allies were very welcoming of russia 's interest in cooperating on missile defense , " the official said .
airing differences on saturday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov urged washington to freeze work with poland and the czech republic on its missile shield , concerned that continued talks might worsen the iranian nuclear stand-off .
appathurai said the nato-russia council would remain a forum in which both sides could air their differences over missile defense .

the shield is aimed at countering attacks from nations that washington regards as " rogue states " such as iran .

the change implements 11 eu guidelines and affects areas such as spousal immigration , integration and residency regulations . the 500 pages of the new rules were approved by 398 of the parliament 's 614 members , with the no votes coming from opposition parties , but also from some members of the social democratic party , a partner in germany 's current ruling coalition . besides incorporating eu guidelines on immigration into national law , the reform adds further amendments to an immigration law passed in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reform package did not pass the bundestag without opposition the government 's plan is aimed at cracking down on forced marriages , requiring that a spouse be 18 before entering the country .
in line with the moves in other nations , berlin has also introduced a requirement for those seeking to move to the country to have basic german language skills .
some foreigners entering the country will be asked to provide a digital photograph and fingerprints . under the law about 100,000 foreigners whose applications for asylum have been rejected will be able to stay in the country indefinitely provided they find a job by the end of 2009 . following are some of the key areas of the reform : new rules for spouses spouses who are citizens of non-eu countries can only join their partners if they are over the age of 18 and can demonstrate a basic knowledge of german before coming , although citizens who do not normally need visas to come to germany , such as americans or japanese , do not have to demonstrate ability in german .
there are also exceptions for highly skilled workers and entrepreneurs .
the age requirement is meant to discourage forced marriages . integration courses obligatory integration course have been introduced .
if foreigners refuse to take the courses , they can be fined .
those on social welfare can have their benefits cut by up to 30 percent . labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : highly skilled workers or those founding companies in germany will have it easier it will be easier for foreigners to immigrate who wish to invest or create jobs in germany .
the reform lowers the minimum investment amount from one million to 500,000 euros -lrb- from roughly $ 1.3 million to $ 665,000 -rrb- and the number of jobs created from 10 to five . domestic security as a reaction to the suitcases bomb plot of july 2006 , applicants for visas exceeding three months will be fingerprinted and " reference persons " for applicants in germany can be investigated by security services . citizenship in order to gain citizenship , foreigners will in future attest that they " understand the legal and societal systems and way of life in germany . " right of residence a right of residence section of the reform provides a grandfather clause for foreigners who have been in the country for years with " tolerated " status .
they will have the right to stay if , as of july 1 , they have lived in germany for at least eight years .
for families with children , the requirement is six years .
they must also be self-supporting , able to speak german and have no criminal record .
those without jobs will be given probationary period and have until the end of 2009 to find work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one critic slammed the reform as " racial classification " according to economic usefulness critics argue the reform goes beyond what the eu requires and makes life worse for many immigrants already living in germany , while making immigration in general more difficult .
hartfrid wolff , a parliamentarian with the free-market liberal fdp party , called the reform " piecemeal , " and lacking an overall concept on controlling and guiding immigration .
green party politician josef winkler went further , calling the draft " harmful , cheap and disgraceful . " but german interior minister wolfgang schäuble defended the compromise and praised in particular the parts of the reform which encourage integration . " integration has to work , " he said , adding that the federal , state and local governments all must work together toward that goal . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they will also discuss the kremlin 's offer to cooperate with the americans on the program . the talks mark the first time that the military alliance has included the us shield , which has deeply angered russia , in its own barely nascent plans to build a missile shield to cover all 26 nato allies . " nato 's approach is based on the principle of the indivisibility of allied security and on transparency with our partners , of course including russia , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said as he opened the meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer gets the meeting underway washington announced in january that it wants to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic linked to an early warning system , probably in the caucasus , all to be operational by 2013 . the shield is aimed at countering attacks from nations that washington regards as " rogue states " such as iran . unprotected areas the problem for nato is that four members - bulgaria , romania , greece and turkey - are only partly covered or left out of the umbrella all together , undermining this very " indivisibility of allied security . " to resolve this , the alliance is likely to " bolt on " to the us shield a smaller missile system - an " in-theater " type usually used to protect troops in battle - which it is developing and hopes to have in use by 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brdy military zone in the czech republic where the us wants to place a radar base " the cost of a complementary system would be a small fraction of the cost of a full and independent missile system for nato , " said senior nato defense planning official john colston ahead of the talks . any progress in the talks is likely to inflame emotions in russia , which has conducted a highly-public ballistic missile test in response to its former cold war foe 's plans , and raised the possibility of turning its arms towards europe . possible cooperation the meeting also takes place as nato and russia review a key soviet-era arms pact - the conventional forces in europe treaty - in vienna , which the allies refuse to endorse , while moscow claims that its restrictions are unfair . amid the heightened rhetoric , exacerbated by elections in russia late this year , president vladimir putin surprised his us counterpart george w. bush by proposing that they set up a joint us-russian radar base in azerbaijan . us and russian officials are studying the proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch members of the nato force in afghanistan " the most interesting part of it was that it was bush and putin both together , " dutch defense minister elmert van middelkoop said as he arrived for the talks .
" so it 's interesting for nato to consider it and i think it can be a part of the pacification of the subject . " the military alliance has not yet said whether the azeri base could work , as it might be too close to iran to be effective against long-range missiles . " we have an expression in britain : ' it 's not rocket science , " ' colston said .
" the trouble with missile defense is that it is rocket science . " the 26 defense chiefs , including us defense secretary robert gates , will also seek clarification from their russian counterpart anatoly serdyukov on moscow 's surprise offer . afghan civilians ministers are also due to review operations in afghanistan as concerns grow about civilian casualties in the country .
the talks come just days after us forces inadvertently killed seven policeman in an air strike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civilian casualties caused by nato troops are hurting the alliance 's standing among the population de hoop scheffer has said he wants to explore ways of improving cooperation between the afghan army , us troops and nato forces in the country .
the nato chief has also called for additional training of soldiers in the afghan national army . nato is worried that the recent wave of civilian deaths and damage to civilian property in afghanistan risks eroding european public support for the mission .
it also damages nato 's drive to win the hearts and minds of the afghan people . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but politicians disagree on a suitable location . the soldier 's memorial will be a narrow structure encased in bronze .
its surface will be embossed to depict its significance , said munich architect andreas meck . " half of an identity disk is portrayed , which represents those who died in service for the bundeswehr , " said meck , who designed the winning concept .
every soldier in service wears these oval-shaped disks .
when he or she dies , half of the disk is broken off and serves as a record of death . the soldier 's memorial , 41 meters -lrb- 45 yards -rrb- long and 10 meters -lrb- 11 yards -rrb- high , will be divided .
there will be a larger , more open space , as well as a smaller , blackened room .
the latter will only be lit by an opening in the ceiling .
a monolith will serve as a place for visitors to lay flowers and wreaths . meck 's concept will allow for both private and state or public mourning .
a sliding wall will make the memorial accessible from the ministry side and for civilians from the street .
the structure will bear the inscription : " our bundeswehr 's dead - for peace , justice and freedom . " the project costs are estimated at three million euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- and will be completed in mid-2008 . a common memorial was overdue bundeswehr inspector general wolfgang schneiderhan said meck 's concept moved and appealed to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense ministry wants to erect the memorial on its premises according to schneiderhan , building this central memorial was " not just appropriate , but overdue . "
up to now , the army , navy and air force each commemorate their fallen soldiers separately . the idea for a central memorial came to defense minister franz josef jung when he visited the afghan capital kabul in 2005 .
germans soldiers there had erected their own memorial for their fallen comrades . since then , jung has been keen on such a structure in germany . all parliamentarians should see the memorial since the bundeswehr was founded in may 1955 , over 2,600 members of the armed forces have died in duty , for example , in aircraft crashes or accidents during maneuvers . to date , 69 soldiers have fallen abroad - the most recent were three soldiers killed in a suicide bombing in afghanistan last month . several politicians would like to see the memorial erected near the bundestag due to its central importance . " it is necessary that everyone in parliament who decides about foreign deployments sees this memorial in order to be aware of how large their personal responsibility is , " said guido westerwelle , head of the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . but jung , a member of the ruling coalition partner christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , wants the structure to stand within the ministry 's premises in berlin . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

jung 's predecessor peter struck from the spd would have never approved such an action , he said . the g8 summit was not the first time tornados have been deployed as official support .
awacs jets patrolled areas during the soccer world cup last year , as well as during pope benedict 's visit to germany .
they are also used , for example , to monitor the repercussions of natural disasters . debate continues on domestic military deployment the issue was on the agenda wednesday at meetings of the parliamentary interior and defense committees in berlin .
merkel 's own cdu said it could not understand the outrage . " the mission was not only justified , but necessary , " said wolfgang bosbach , deputy parliamentary head of the cdu .
it did not violate any personal rights .
" there was no photographic material taken of individual persons . " the military , which also provided awacs airspace monitoring at the g8 summit , said it made no secret of the fact that it filmed the area in may and june . the coalition partners have been arguing for some time whether the military can be deployed within germany 's borders for defense purposes .
this would go beyond simple administrative or technical assistance .

but politicians disagree on a suitable location . the soldier 's memorial will be a narrow structure encased in bronze .
its surface will be embossed to depict its significance , said munich architect andreas meck . " half of an identity disk is portrayed , which represents those who died in service for the bundeswehr , " said meck , who designed the winning concept .
every soldier in service wears these oval-shaped disks .
when he or she dies , half of the disk is broken off and serves as a record of death . the soldier 's memorial , 41 meters -lrb- 45 yards -rrb- long and 10 meters -lrb- 11 yards -rrb- high , will be divided .
there will be a larger , more open space , as well as a smaller , blackened room .
the latter will only be lit by an opening in the ceiling .
a monolith will serve as a place for visitors to lay flowers and wreaths . meck 's concept will allow for both private and state or public mourning .
a sliding wall will make the memorial accessible from the ministry side and for civilians from the street .
the structure will bear the inscription : " our bundeswehr 's dead - for peace , justice and freedom . " the project costs are estimated at three million euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- and will be completed in mid-2008 . a common memorial was overdue bundeswehr inspector general wolfgang schneiderhan said meck 's concept moved and appealed to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense ministry wants to erect the memorial on its premises according to schneiderhan , building this central memorial was " not just appropriate , but overdue . "
up to now , the army , navy and air force each commemorate their fallen soldiers separately . the idea for a central memorial came to defense minister franz josef jung when he visited the afghan capital kabul in 2005 .
germans soldiers there had erected their own memorial for their fallen comrades . since then , jung has been keen on such a structure in germany . all parliamentarians should see the memorial since the bundeswehr was founded in may 1955 , over 2,600 members of the armed forces have died in duty , for example , in aircraft crashes or accidents during maneuvers . to date , 69 soldiers have fallen abroad - the most recent were three soldiers killed in a suicide bombing in afghanistan last month . several politicians would like to see the memorial erected near the bundestag due to its central importance . " it is necessary that everyone in parliament who decides about foreign deployments sees this memorial in order to be aware of how large their personal responsibility is , " said guido westerwelle , head of the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . but jung , a member of the ruling coalition partner christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , wants the structure to stand within the ministry 's premises in berlin . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he could be a killer a squirrel with aggression issues acted out in the southern german town of passau , injuring three people before his last victim finished him off with a crutch . the bavarian town of passau , on the austrian border , is usually a fairly quiet place , with man and nature living in relative harmony .
but this week , the bucolic balance was thrown off when a squirrel went berserk , terrorizing three in a biting rampage that ended only with his death . his first victim was a 70-year-old woman , who was sitting peacefully in her living room when she was surprised by the sensation of small claws on her back .
the squirrel had jumped through a window and onto the woman , soon sinking its teeth into her hand .
acorns were n't on this little guy 's mind , arteries apparently were . terrified , the woman ran out into the street in a panic , managing to shake the squirrel off . but the creature , whipped into a frenzy , immediately found another victim .
he jumped onto a nearby construction worker , injuring him on the hand and arm .
the fellow was finally able to fight the furry demon off with a measuring pole . still on the hunt for blood , the tiny terror then ran into the garden of a 72-year-old retiree . " the squirrel massively attacked him on the arms , hand and thigh , " said a local police spokesperson .
so the senior citizen used the only weapon at his disposal - his crutch . he clubbed the ruthless rodent to death . how the squirrel obtained his bloodlust is still unclear , although experts have said its behavior could be linked to the mating season or the squirrel could have been diseased . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they will also discuss the kremlin 's offer to cooperate with the americans on the program . the talks mark the first time that the military alliance has included the us shield , which has deeply angered russia , in its own barely nascent plans to build a missile shield to cover all 26 nato allies . " nato 's approach is based on the principle of the indivisibility of allied security and on transparency with our partners , of course including russia , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said as he opened the meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer gets the meeting underway washington announced in january that it wants to install 10 missile interceptors in poland and a radar base in the czech republic linked to an early warning system , probably in the caucasus , all to be operational by 2013 . the shield is aimed at countering attacks from nations that washington regards as " rogue states " such as iran . unprotected areas the problem for nato is that four members - bulgaria , romania , greece and turkey - are only partly covered or left out of the umbrella all together , undermining this very " indivisibility of allied security . " to resolve this , the alliance is likely to " bolt on " to the us shield a smaller missile system - an " in-theater " type usually used to protect troops in battle - which it is developing and hopes to have in use by 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brdy military zone in the czech republic where the us wants to place a radar base " the cost of a complementary system would be a small fraction of the cost of a full and independent missile system for nato , " said senior nato defense planning official john colston ahead of the talks . any progress in the talks is likely to inflame emotions in russia , which has conducted a highly-public ballistic missile test in response to its former cold war foe 's plans , and raised the possibility of turning its arms towards europe . possible cooperation the meeting also takes place as nato and russia review a key soviet-era arms pact - the conventional forces in europe treaty - in vienna , which the allies refuse to endorse , while moscow claims that its restrictions are unfair . amid the heightened rhetoric , exacerbated by elections in russia late this year , president vladimir putin surprised his us counterpart george w. bush by proposing that they set up a joint us-russian radar base in azerbaijan . us and russian officials are studying the proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch members of the nato force in afghanistan " the most interesting part of it was that it was bush and putin both together , " dutch defense minister elmert van middelkoop said as he arrived for the talks .
" so it 's interesting for nato to consider it and i think it can be a part of the pacification of the subject . " the military alliance has not yet said whether the azeri base could work , as it might be too close to iran to be effective against long-range missiles . " we have an expression in britain : ' it 's not rocket science , " ' colston said .
" the trouble with missile defense is that it is rocket science . " the 26 defense chiefs , including us defense secretary robert gates , will also seek clarification from their russian counterpart anatoly serdyukov on moscow 's surprise offer . afghan civilians ministers are also due to review operations in afghanistan as concerns grow about civilian casualties in the country .
the talks come just days after us forces inadvertently killed seven policeman in an air strike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civilian casualties caused by nato troops are hurting the alliance 's standing among the population de hoop scheffer has said he wants to explore ways of improving cooperation between the afghan army , us troops and nato forces in the country .
the nato chief has also called for additional training of soldiers in the afghan national army . nato is worried that the recent wave of civilian deaths and damage to civilian property in afghanistan risks eroding european public support for the mission .
it also damages nato 's drive to win the hearts and minds of the afghan people . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and she has warned of the repercussions if no agreement is made . " this is not just up to us , but we will do our part .
if that does n't succeed , it will not be the downfall of europe , but it will have extremely serious consequences for the future of europe , " merkel said .
she stressed that there was still a lot to do to move forward the debate on the draft constitution , which was rejected by french and dutch voters in referendums in 2005 .
merkel also cautioned that a solution to the dispute with poland was not yet in sight in her speech to the german parliament on thursday , a week ahead of the eu summit in brussels . but shortly afterwards , polish president lech kaczynski signalled that poland would seek a compromise over its opposition to the proposed voting system . kaczynski said he wanted to avoid the isolation of his country over the issue . glimmer of hope ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and dutch no votes propelled the eu into crisis warsaw had threatened to veto a deal on the future of the charter because of the planned changes , which poland says favor the bloc 's bigger states . germany is currently the holder of the rotating presidency , but its tenure ends at the end of june .
merkel had declared it her goal to break the deadlock over the eu treaty . the chancellor reiterated her position that the draft constitution would not be completely abandoned when any new treaty is drawn up .
" we want to keep the substance of the treaty without over-burdening people , " she told lawmakers .
" any solution we do find must be in a form that helps europe . "
the chancellor said it was essential to find a solution to the treaty issue so that a bloc that has enlarged into eastern and southern europe is " able to function properly . "
the eu has expanded from a 15 to a 27-member bloc over the last three years , making reform necessary . challenging times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was more positive about eu achievements at heiligendamm " europe faces great challenges both within , and more importantly , outside its borders , " she said .
in addition , merkel stressed that it was necessary for a new constitution to better meet the wishes of european citizens .
this would involve making clearer the division of power between the bloc and its member states .
fears about the creation of a european super-state must also be taken into account , merkel told legislators . the chancellor gave a more positive evaluation of what had been achieved at the g8 summit , in particular over climate change , during her bundestag speech .
she said that without the eu 's agreement on binding emission reduction goals the agreements reached at heiligendamm would have been " completely inconceivable .

but politicians disagree on a suitable location . the soldier 's memorial will be a narrow structure encased in bronze .
its surface will be embossed to depict its significance , said munich architect andreas meck . " half of an identity disk is portrayed , which represents those who died in service for the bundeswehr , " said meck , who designed the winning concept .
every soldier in service wears these oval-shaped disks .
when he or she dies , half of the disk is broken off and serves as a record of death . the soldier 's memorial , 41 meters -lrb- 45 yards -rrb- long and 10 meters -lrb- 11 yards -rrb- high , will be divided .
there will be a larger , more open space , as well as a smaller , blackened room .
the latter will only be lit by an opening in the ceiling .
a monolith will serve as a place for visitors to lay flowers and wreaths . meck 's concept will allow for both private and state or public mourning .
a sliding wall will make the memorial accessible from the ministry side and for civilians from the street .
the structure will bear the inscription : " our bundeswehr 's dead - for peace , justice and freedom . " the project costs are estimated at three million euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- and will be completed in mid-2008 . a common memorial was overdue bundeswehr inspector general wolfgang schneiderhan said meck 's concept moved and appealed to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense ministry wants to erect the memorial on its premises according to schneiderhan , building this central memorial was " not just appropriate , but overdue . "
up to now , the army , navy and air force each commemorate their fallen soldiers separately . the idea for a central memorial came to defense minister franz josef jung when he visited the afghan capital kabul in 2005 .
germans soldiers there had erected their own memorial for their fallen comrades . since then , jung has been keen on such a structure in germany . all parliamentarians should see the memorial since the bundeswehr was founded in may 1955 , over 2,600 members of the armed forces have died in duty , for example , in aircraft crashes or accidents during maneuvers . to date , 69 soldiers have fallen abroad - the most recent were three soldiers killed in a suicide bombing in afghanistan last month . several politicians would like to see the memorial erected near the bundestag due to its central importance . " it is necessary that everyone in parliament who decides about foreign deployments sees this memorial in order to be aware of how large their personal responsibility is , " said guido westerwelle , head of the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . but jung , a member of the ruling coalition partner christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , wants the structure to stand within the ministry 's premises in berlin . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is developing a space tourist plane to be completed by 2012 . the space arm of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- has announced plans to develop a spacecraft for tourists .
the vessel would offer travelers a 90-minute suborbital flight , including three minutes of weightlessness , at an altitude of more than 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- . according to francois auque , the president of eads astrium , the fare in space could total some 150,000 to 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 200,000 - $ 267,000 -rrb- .
this compared to $ 25 million for the few space tourists flying in the narrow capsule of the russian rocket " soyuz , " auque said . the russian space authority currently holds the monopoly in space tourism .
it offers flights to the international space station iss . " we are offering a profitable system and have given ourselves until early 2008 to find industrial partners to share the risk , private investment of around one billion euros and an operator for the journey , " auque told 2,500 vip guests in the french capital paris on wednesday evening .
" we will not do it without that . " a deep desire to enter space the aircraft , which eads plans to start developing next year , will be in operation from 2012 .
auque said eads expected the space tourist market to total 20,000 passengers a year by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spaceshipone successfully completed its first flight in 2004 " we want to serve a third of this , " auque said .
" we believe in this market . " according to auque , people had a deep desire to enter space . " we want to rouse european ambitions in the process , " he said . eads is competing with the us company spaceship , which is working on a successor for the legendary spaceshipone .
this spacecraft , which uses a hybrid rocket motor , completed the first privately funded human space flight in 2004 .
spaceship is aiming to offer suborbital flights for less than 100,000 euros in the near future . no threat from virgin galactic the eads space jet will take off and land conventionally from a standard airport using jet engines .
once it is airborne at an attitude of some 12 kilometers , though , the rocket engines will be ignited to give sufficient acceleration to reach the altitude of 100 kilometers .
then , the engines will be shut down so that passengers can experience zero gravity in space . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the craft 's seats balance themselves during the flight " we have ruled out the idea of a simple rocket , which can not be used again , " said robert laine , eads astrium 's technical director . the company was also not in favor of a small vessel attached to a large plane , the idea chosen by richard branson 's virgin galactic , he said . " this seems to us less safe , " laine said . virgin plans to offer space flights from 2009 .
but eads astrium said it was not concerned about entering the space race later , given " the qualities of the solution proposed by astrium which can take off and land on any runway , and the possibilities of the market . " the guests at the paris event were shown a full-sized model of the craft 's forward section .
the cabin , created by australian born designer marc newson , will be able to hold four passengers .

the change implements 11 eu guidelines and affects areas such as spousal immigration , integration and residency regulations . the 500 pages of the new rules were approved by 398 of the parliament 's 614 members , with the no votes coming from opposition parties , but also from some members of the social democratic party , a partner in germany 's current ruling coalition . besides incorporating eu guidelines on immigration into national law , the reform adds further amendments to an immigration law passed in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reform package did not pass the bundestag without opposition the government 's plan is aimed at cracking down on forced marriages , requiring that a spouse be 18 before entering the country .
in line with the moves in other nations , berlin has also introduced a requirement for those seeking to move to the country to have basic german language skills .
some foreigners entering the country will be asked to provide a digital photograph and fingerprints . under the law about 100,000 foreigners whose applications for asylum have been rejected will be able to stay in the country indefinitely provided they find a job by the end of 2009 . following are some of the key areas of the reform : new rules for spouses spouses who are citizens of non-eu countries can only join their partners if they are over the age of 18 and can demonstrate a basic knowledge of german before coming , although citizens who do not normally need visas to come to germany , such as americans or japanese , do not have to demonstrate ability in german .
there are also exceptions for highly skilled workers and entrepreneurs .
the age requirement is meant to discourage forced marriages . integration courses obligatory integration course have been introduced .
if foreigners refuse to take the courses , they can be fined .
those on social welfare can have their benefits cut by up to 30 percent . labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : highly skilled workers or those founding companies in germany will have it easier it will be easier for foreigners to immigrate who wish to invest or create jobs in germany .
the reform lowers the minimum investment amount from one million to 500,000 euros -lrb- from roughly $ 1.3 million to $ 665,000 -rrb- and the number of jobs created from 10 to five . domestic security as a reaction to the suitcases bomb plot of july 2006 , applicants for visas exceeding three months will be fingerprinted and " reference persons " for applicants in germany can be investigated by security services . citizenship in order to gain citizenship , foreigners will in future attest that they " understand the legal and societal systems and way of life in germany . " right of residence a right of residence section of the reform provides a grandfather clause for foreigners who have been in the country for years with " tolerated " status .
they will have the right to stay if , as of july 1 , they have lived in germany for at least eight years .
for families with children , the requirement is six years .
they must also be self-supporting , able to speak german and have no criminal record .
those without jobs will be given probationary period and have until the end of 2009 to find work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one critic slammed the reform as " racial classification " according to economic usefulness critics argue the reform goes beyond what the eu requires and makes life worse for many immigrants already living in germany , while making immigration in general more difficult .
hartfrid wolff , a parliamentarian with the free-market liberal fdp party , called the reform " piecemeal , " and lacking an overall concept on controlling and guiding immigration .
green party politician josef winkler went further , calling the draft " harmful , cheap and disgraceful . " but german interior minister wolfgang schäuble defended the compromise and praised in particular the parts of the reform which encourage integration . " integration has to work , " he said , adding that the federal , state and local governments all must work together toward that goal . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
" we see such a decision as a step aimed at destroying the existing security system , creating new dividing lines on the european continent , " he was quoted as saying .
but a senior us official said serdyukov did not repeat recent russian threats to target europe and did not place conditions on a counter-proposal from russian president vladimir putin for a joint us-russian radar in gabala , azerbaijan .
us defense secretary robert gates made clear that " we intend to continue our talks with poland and the czech republic , " the official said , speaking on condition of anonymity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates and putin , in april " what he has said today is that we want to work with russia on what role gabala might play .
we also simultaneously need to continue the work at nato and we need to continue the negotiations with poland and the czech republic . "
outside the umbrella nato defense ministers agreed to assess the political and military implications of the us missile defense plan with an eye to what nato would have to do to defend areas in southern europe not under its umbrella .
the assessment is to be completed by february 2008 ahead of a nato summit in bucharest to inform allied deliberations on fielding a theater missile defense system that could be " bolted on " to the us system , nato officials said .
the study was " a recognition that the us discussion and proposals with poland and the czech republic are a : a fact , b : that they are moving forward , and c : that nato work ... on missile defense needs to take that into account , " said nato spokesman james appathurai .
appathurai said none of the 26 member countries had opposed the us plans .
" nato will now move forward to assess the political and military implications of the us missile system proposals , " he said .
nato ministers then met in a separate session with serdyukov in what one nato diplomat described as " calm and cold . "
" each side simply restated its own arguments .
there were no harsh words , but then there was no progress either , " the diplomat said .

the shield is aimed at countering attacks from nations that washington regards as " rogue states " such as iran .

it is developing a space tourist plane to be completed by 2012 . the space arm of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- has announced plans to develop a spacecraft for tourists .
the vessel would offer travelers a 90-minute suborbital flight , including three minutes of weightlessness , at an altitude of more than 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- . according to francois auque , the president of eads astrium , the fare in space could total some 150,000 to 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 200,000 - $ 267,000 -rrb- .
this compared to $ 25 million for the few space tourists flying in the narrow capsule of the russian rocket " soyuz , " auque said . the russian space authority currently holds the monopoly in space tourism .
it offers flights to the international space station iss . " we are offering a profitable system and have given ourselves until early 2008 to find industrial partners to share the risk , private investment of around one billion euros and an operator for the journey , " auque told 2,500 vip guests in the french capital paris on wednesday evening .
" we will not do it without that . " a deep desire to enter space the aircraft , which eads plans to start developing next year , will be in operation from 2012 .
auque said eads expected the space tourist market to total 20,000 passengers a year by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spaceshipone successfully completed its first flight in 2004 " we want to serve a third of this , " auque said .
" we believe in this market . " according to auque , people had a deep desire to enter space . " we want to rouse european ambitions in the process , " he said . eads is competing with the us company spaceship , which is working on a successor for the legendary spaceshipone .
this spacecraft , which uses a hybrid rocket motor , completed the first privately funded human space flight in 2004 .
spaceship is aiming to offer suborbital flights for less than 100,000 euros in the near future . no threat from virgin galactic the eads space jet will take off and land conventionally from a standard airport using jet engines .
once it is airborne at an attitude of some 12 kilometers , though , the rocket engines will be ignited to give sufficient acceleration to reach the altitude of 100 kilometers .
then , the engines will be shut down so that passengers can experience zero gravity in space . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the craft 's seats balance themselves during the flight " we have ruled out the idea of a simple rocket , which can not be used again , " said robert laine , eads astrium 's technical director . the company was also not in favor of a small vessel attached to a large plane , the idea chosen by richard branson 's virgin galactic , he said . " this seems to us less safe , " laine said . virgin plans to offer space flights from 2009 .
but eads astrium said it was not concerned about entering the space race later , given " the qualities of the solution proposed by astrium which can take off and land on any runway , and the possibilities of the market . " the guests at the paris event were shown a full-sized model of the craft 's forward section .
the cabin , created by australian born designer marc newson , will be able to hold four passengers .

he could be a killer a squirrel with aggression issues acted out in the southern german town of passau , injuring three people before his last victim finished him off with a crutch . the bavarian town of passau , on the austrian border , is usually a fairly quiet place , with man and nature living in relative harmony .
but this week , the bucolic balance was thrown off when a squirrel went berserk , terrorizing three in a biting rampage that ended only with his death . his first victim was a 70-year-old woman , who was sitting peacefully in her living room when she was surprised by the sensation of small claws on her back .
the squirrel had jumped through a window and onto the woman , soon sinking its teeth into her hand .
acorns were n't on this little guy 's mind , arteries apparently were . terrified , the woman ran out into the street in a panic , managing to shake the squirrel off . but the creature , whipped into a frenzy , immediately found another victim .
he jumped onto a nearby construction worker , injuring him on the hand and arm .
the fellow was finally able to fight the furry demon off with a measuring pole . still on the hunt for blood , the tiny terror then ran into the garden of a 72-year-old retiree . " the squirrel massively attacked him on the arms , hand and thigh , " said a local police spokesperson .
so the senior citizen used the only weapon at his disposal - his crutch . he clubbed the ruthless rodent to death . how the squirrel obtained his bloodlust is still unclear , although experts have said its behavior could be linked to the mating season or the squirrel could have been diseased . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the change implements 11 eu guidelines and affects areas such as spousal immigration , integration and residency regulations . the 500 pages of the new rules were approved by 398 of the parliament 's 614 members , with the no votes coming from opposition parties , but also from some members of the social democratic party , a partner in germany 's current ruling coalition . besides incorporating eu guidelines on immigration into national law , the reform adds further amendments to an immigration law passed in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reform package did not pass the bundestag without opposition the government 's plan is aimed at cracking down on forced marriages , requiring that a spouse be 18 before entering the country .
in line with the moves in other nations , berlin has also introduced a requirement for those seeking to move to the country to have basic german language skills .
some foreigners entering the country will be asked to provide a digital photograph and fingerprints . under the law about 100,000 foreigners whose applications for asylum have been rejected will be able to stay in the country indefinitely provided they find a job by the end of 2009 . following are some of the key areas of the reform : new rules for spouses spouses who are citizens of non-eu countries can only join their partners if they are over the age of 18 and can demonstrate a basic knowledge of german before coming , although citizens who do not normally need visas to come to germany , such as americans or japanese , do not have to demonstrate ability in german .
there are also exceptions for highly skilled workers and entrepreneurs .
the age requirement is meant to discourage forced marriages . integration courses obligatory integration course have been introduced .
if foreigners refuse to take the courses , they can be fined .
those on social welfare can have their benefits cut by up to 30 percent . labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : highly skilled workers or those founding companies in germany will have it easier it will be easier for foreigners to immigrate who wish to invest or create jobs in germany .
the reform lowers the minimum investment amount from one million to 500,000 euros -lrb- from roughly $ 1.3 million to $ 665,000 -rrb- and the number of jobs created from 10 to five . domestic security as a reaction to the suitcases bomb plot of july 2006 , applicants for visas exceeding three months will be fingerprinted and " reference persons " for applicants in germany can be investigated by security services . citizenship in order to gain citizenship , foreigners will in future attest that they " understand the legal and societal systems and way of life in germany . " right of residence a right of residence section of the reform provides a grandfather clause for foreigners who have been in the country for years with " tolerated " status .
they will have the right to stay if , as of july 1 , they have lived in germany for at least eight years .
for families with children , the requirement is six years .
they must also be self-supporting , able to speak german and have no criminal record .
those without jobs will be given probationary period and have until the end of 2009 to find work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one critic slammed the reform as " racial classification " according to economic usefulness critics argue the reform goes beyond what the eu requires and makes life worse for many immigrants already living in germany , while making immigration in general more difficult .
hartfrid wolff , a parliamentarian with the free-market liberal fdp party , called the reform " piecemeal , " and lacking an overall concept on controlling and guiding immigration .
green party politician josef winkler went further , calling the draft " harmful , cheap and disgraceful . " but german interior minister wolfgang schäuble defended the compromise and praised in particular the parts of the reform which encourage integration . " integration has to work , " he said , adding that the federal , state and local governments all must work together toward that goal . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

small market traders are getting motivated by , some would say excited about , paying taxes .
it is a trend which if it were to continue across the country could drastically boost the development of one of africa 's poorest countries .
in mtwara 's covered central market , 40 kilogramme bags are stacked almost to the ceiling .
potential buyers inspect open bags of a kaleidoscope of beans , picking them up and letting them drain through their fingers as though to test their quality .
tax enthusiast shaibu ng 'ombo breaks all the stereotypes with his enthusiasm for paying taxes .
he runs a successful small wholesale business , transporting beans , cereals and rice from across tanzania to sell to shops and individuals in mtwara and the surrounding region .
each day he pays just less than half a us dollar -lrb- 24 pence -rrb- in tax to the municipal authorities for his plot , for the market to be cleaned and for security services .
he thinks it is a good deal .
" i am happy to pay this money as it makes it easier to carry out my business , but it has also made me think about tax , " he says .
" ' paying taxes is an important thing because it helps in the development of our country .
every citizen is responsible for this as it has a direct link with our development .
" the people who do n't pay need to be educated .
they need to understand that roads , education , and health services all depend on the taxes we pay .
if they understand , they will pay . "
working system it is a textbook answer which sees the big picture , an answer likely to bring a smile to even the most hard-bitten tax collector . "
we need to increase the tax base and this we must do by bringing small traders , farmers and light industry into the formal economy " tony muganyizi , tanzania revenue authority the difference in mtwara is that it is not the local tax officials who are collecting the money , but an association of traders , called wabisoco , that shaibu ng 'ombo belongs to .
some 400 traders pay the tax directly to wabisoco .
they include fruit and vegetable sellers , clothes retailers and bicycle repair shops , which , depending on the size of the business , pay as little as 20 us cents a day .
in an average month about $ 1,200 -lrb- £ 600 -rrb- is collected .
wabisoco pays for the market services and its own running costs and then hands about two-thirds of that to the local council .
" it 's a system that works well , " says wabisoco 's novartus kaijage .
" normally , you find that businessmen and tax collectors have an antagonistic relationship .
having an organisation between the council , which needs the taxes , and the business , which needs a service , makes it easier to collect the tax . "
spreading the net local and national tax collection in tanzania are carried out separately , by the local district council and the government respectively , but local successes like the mtwara traders are being reflected in national collections .
the tanzania revenue authority -lrb- tra -rrb- has increased tax collection by four times over the last decade thanks to the reform of the tax system and a more user-friendly approach .
tax reform is seen as a key element of the development of this poor country , one which the government that was elected in 2005 has been prioritising .
more money means more investment in health , education and infrastructure .
the rate of tax collection is about 14.5 % of gross domestic product , or gdp - below both the african average of 17 % and the psychologically important level of 20 % , the point at which tanzania can begin to be able to sustain its own budget spending without the help of foreign donors .
tax revenues have increased because big business is now paying up .
attention is turning increasingly to the burgeoning informal sector , people who are operating outside the formal economy and laws of the country , mainly petty traders , farmers and small businesses .
taxing or beneficial ?
tony muganyizi , the tra 's director of research and policy planning , believes it is a massive undertaking .
" we need to increase the tax base and this we must do by bringing small traders , farmers and light industry into the formal economy , " he says .
" this is a big challenge because they operate mainly in cash . "
it is estimated that 70-80 % of businesses in tanzania are technically partly outside the law .
while the market traders in mtwara are happy to pay a local tax , few are legally registered as businesses and as a result do not pay an array of other taxes , including business licences , income tax and vat .
the government has launched a programme called mkurabita to encourage more people to engage legally with the formal economy and enjoy the benefits , for example access to loans and the securing of land ownership , that working in the formal economy can bring .
formalisation mark waite , an advisor on formalisation employed by a norwegian ngo , says there are many reasons why people might want to stay informal .
" it 's difficult to pay taxes and in the past there have been too many of them , " he says .
" it takes a lot of time and money to register and license a business .
" and after going through all the hassle of becoming formal , there seem to be few tangible benefits . "
in mtwara and across tanzania , the informal sector continues to thrive , while the government looks on and no doubt tries to calculate the tax revenues it is losing .
the government is hoping that formalisation will catch on , that revenues will increase and that it can then spend more money on developing the country by boosting growth and reducing poverty .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- are global market bubbles set to blow ?
home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business market data economy companies health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : thursday , 14 june 2007 , 04:53 gmt 05:53 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version are global market bubbles set to blow ?
analysis by ben richardson business reporter , bbc news how can you tell the difference between a boom and a bubble ?
there is a strange fascination in blowing a bubble , when despite your better judgement , you keep willing it to get bigger regardless of the dangers .
then , suddenly , the violent pop that leaves you picking bubblegum off your eyebrows , or crying soapy tears .
for many observers , global markets are getting dangerously close to such a bursting point .
until recently , we have been living in a period of low global interest rates that have let consumers and companies borrow money cheaply .
that has driven demand for mortgages , let companies pay increasingly large sums for takeovers , and allowed consumers to spend freely .
and the results of this credit splurge are hard to ignore : uk house prices have doubled in the past 10 years .
china 's main stock index has quadrupled in value since the start of 2006 .
the uk 's ftse 100 and us s & p 500 stock indexes are at levels not seen in almost seven years .
commodity prices have been buoyed by strong global demand , pushing some such as copper to records .
merger and acquisition activity has taken off , and private equity firms are now in control of some of the world 's biggest brands .
but as the records have continued to tumble , concerns have kept on mounting .
credit crunch one of the main reasons for the current uncertainty has been the significant changes and volatility in the us bond market .
the price of 10-year us government-backed bonds has fallen , pushing their yields above 5.25 % for the first time in five years .
simply put , this means that investors are not expecting interest rates to fall anytime soon , especially as the bank of england , the us federal reserve and european central bank have all been lifting borrowing costs in recent months .
what has many observers worried is the sudden speed with which the change occurred and the fact that it seems to confirm the view that the era of low interest rates has ended .
first and foremost this will make it more expensive for companies and consumers to get their hands on cash .
that in turn could lead to fewer private equity deals , and a cooling of the housing and stock markets .
home improvements in recent years consumers have benefited from the largesse of lenders , taking on larger mortgages and increasing personal borrowing to levels many now see as unsustainable .
the bond-market turmoil may turn out to be the beginning of the end robert peston , bbc business editor read robert 's analysis in full on tuesday , figures from the council of mortgage lenders showed that first time buyers borrow an average of 3.33 times their incomes to buy a home .
other measures show they are using 18.7 % of their incomes to meet mortgage repayments .
pessimists also point to a wobble in the us housing market , where prices have started to soften and high levels of sub-prime lending to people with poor credit histories has fanned fears of a surge in mortgage defaults should interest rates rise .
at the same time , some very canny real estate operators have been selling up , signalling that , for them at least , the market could not get any richer .
london estate agency foxtons was sold to private equity firm bc partners for a reported £ 400m in may , and us property magnate sam zell has offloaded his main investment vehicle .
topping off there have also been signs that the private equity boom , which has fuelled merger and acquisition activity in europe and the us , could be hitting a peak .
so far this year , the total value of deals done is almost double than at the same point in 2006 .
at this stage of bull markets larger corrections become more frequent morgan stanley and companies today are having to pay a premium of as much as 30 % to secure takeovers , compared with premiums of about 20 % a few years ago , analysts said .
at the same time , the low interest rates and an ever increasing hunt for profits have seen banks relax their restrictions on lending , producing a new breed of loans called " covenant-lite " .
borrowers have fewer restrictions on what they have to do with the money or business , something that has led to a decline in standards of due diligence , according to jon moulton , chairman and founder of alchemy partners .
while that may not matter when there is a lot of cash sloshing about , risky deals are often the first to collapse when interest rates climb , analysts said .
market timing critics say that the huge amounts of cash companies had at their disposal meant that they could buy back stocks to boost share prices and inflate equities by over-the-top acquisitions .
certainly stock markets are exhibiting some classic warning signals as well .
wall street giant morgan stanley told investors that its indicators were showing a " full-house " in terms of sell triggers , and that this had only happened five times since 1980 .
each time , global equities have lost an average of 15 % over the following six months , it said .
" at this stage of bull markets larger corrections become more frequent , " morgan stanley said .
and yet , despite the pessimism there are plenty of reasons to believe that a meltdown is not on the cards .
true markets have surged and corporate profits in many industries hit record levels , but indicators are a long way from the scary heights that preceded previous crashes .
in the us , the average price earnings ratio - a measure of the share price when compared to future profits - is about 18 times at present ; in the lead up to the dotcom collapse it was at least double that level .
volatility normally increases ahead of a slump , with corrections of as much as 10 % happening regularly , though this has not been the case with the s & p over the past four years .
world view elsewhere there have been wobbles , such as in china where a 9 % one-day drop in the stock market shook global indexes .
however , many analysts argue that even though the shanghai stock exchange may seem overvalued and there may be concerns about the veracity of corporate reporting , the long-term prospects for china outweigh many of the risks .
people worry a lot .
there can be a boom , but it does n't mean it is a bubble jim o 'neil , goldman sachs instead of a collapse , analysts say there will be corrections in a bull market that will see equity prices continue rising and profits keep growing .
the key to this approach is taking a long-term outlook and buying into the view that the so-called bric nations of brazil , russia , india and china are reshaping the world economy .
already the changes are being felt and in the first three months of this year china accounted for a greater proportion of the global economy than the us .
jim o 'neil is chief economist at goldman sachs and is the man who coined the term brics .
" people worry a lot , " he explained .
" there can be a boom , but it does n't mean it is a bubble . "
flattening out the view of the optimists on the housing and private equity markets is not so different .
it may become more expensive to get mortgages and do deals , but that is likely to slow rather than reverse the current trend .
rather than the bursting of a bubble , expect a plateau of demand .
uk house price growth probably will slow , though a lack of new homes will help underpin the market especially in prime areas such as london .
though real interest rates have risen , they are still low by historical standards .
real estate bubbles may appear but they will be localised and dictated by special circumstances .
mergers and acquisitions are unlikely to stop as there are compelling arguments for consolidation in many industries , such as banking .
the problem for investors and consumers watching events unfold over the next few months will be determining whether the commentators have got it right or wrong , and if it really is time to head for safety before things blow up in their faces .

analysis by ben richardson business reporter , bbc news how can you tell the difference between a boom and a bubble ?
there is a strange fascination in blowing a bubble , when despite your better judgement , you keep willing it to get bigger regardless of the dangers .
then , suddenly , the violent pop that leaves you picking bubblegum off your eyebrows , or crying soapy tears .
for many observers , global markets are getting dangerously close to such a bursting point .
until recently , we have been living in a period of low global interest rates that have let consumers and companies borrow money cheaply .
that has driven demand for mortgages , let companies pay increasingly large sums for takeovers , and allowed consumers to spend freely .
and the results of this credit splurge are hard to ignore : uk house prices have doubled in the past 10 years .
china 's main stock index has quadrupled in value since the start of 2006 .
the uk 's ftse 100 and us s & p 500 stock indexes are at levels not seen in almost seven years .
commodity prices have been buoyed by strong global demand , pushing some such as copper to records .
merger and acquisition activity has taken off , and private equity firms are now in control of some of the world 's biggest brands .
but as the records have continued to tumble , concerns have kept on mounting .
credit crunch one of the main reasons for the current uncertainty has been the significant changes and volatility in the us bond market .
the price of 10-year us government-backed bonds has fallen , pushing their yields above 5.25 % for the first time in five years .
simply put , this means that investors are not expecting interest rates to fall anytime soon , especially as the bank of england , the us federal reserve and european central bank have all been lifting borrowing costs in recent months .
what has many observers worried is the sudden speed with which the change occurred and the fact that it seems to confirm the view that the era of low interest rates has ended .
first and foremost this will make it more expensive for companies and consumers to get their hands on cash .
that in turn could lead to fewer private equity deals , and a cooling of the housing and stock markets .
home improvements in recent years consumers have benefited from the largesse of lenders , taking on larger mortgages and increasing personal borrowing to levels many now see as unsustainable .
the bond-market turmoil may turn out to be the beginning of the end robert peston , bbc business editor read robert 's analysis in full on tuesday , figures from the council of mortgage lenders showed that first time buyers borrow an average of 3.33 times their incomes to buy a home .
other measures show they are using 18.7 % of their incomes to meet mortgage repayments .
pessimists also point to a wobble in the us housing market , where prices have started to soften and high levels of sub-prime lending to people with poor credit histories has fanned fears of a surge in mortgage defaults should interest rates rise .
at the same time , some very canny real estate operators have been selling up , signalling that , for them at least , the market could not get any richer .
london estate agency foxtons was sold to private equity firm bc partners for a reported £ 400m in may , and us property magnate sam zell has offloaded his main investment vehicle .
topping off there have also been signs that the private equity boom , which has fuelled merger and acquisition activity in europe and the us , could be hitting a peak .
so far this year , the total value of deals done is almost double than at the same point in 2006 .
at this stage of bull markets larger corrections become more frequent morgan stanley and companies today are having to pay a premium of as much as 30 % to secure takeovers , compared with premiums of about 20 % a few years ago , analysts said .
at the same time , the low interest rates and an ever increasing hunt for profits have seen banks relax their restrictions on lending , producing a new breed of loans called " covenant-lite " .
borrowers have fewer restrictions on what they have to do with the money or business , something that has led to a decline in standards of due diligence , according to jon moulton , chairman and founder of alchemy partners .
while that may not matter when there is a lot of cash sloshing about , risky deals are often the first to collapse when interest rates climb , analysts said .
market timing critics say that the huge amounts of cash companies had at their disposal meant that they could buy back stocks to boost share prices and inflate equities by over-the-top acquisitions .
certainly stock markets are exhibiting some classic warning signals as well .
wall street giant morgan stanley told investors that its indicators were showing a " full-house " in terms of sell triggers , and that this had only happened five times since 1980 .
each time , global equities have lost an average of 15 % over the following six months , it said .
" at this stage of bull markets larger corrections become more frequent , " morgan stanley said .
and yet , despite the pessimism there are plenty of reasons to believe that a meltdown is not on the cards .
true markets have surged and corporate profits in many industries hit record levels , but indicators are a long way from the scary heights that preceded previous crashes .
in the us , the average price earnings ratio - a measure of the share price when compared to future profits - is about 18 times at present ; in the lead up to the dotcom collapse it was at least double that level .
volatility normally increases ahead of a slump , with corrections of as much as 10 % happening regularly , though this has not been the case with the s & p over the past four years .
world view elsewhere there have been wobbles , such as in china where a 9 % one-day drop in the stock market shook global indexes .
however , many analysts argue that even though the shanghai stock exchange may seem overvalued and there may be concerns about the veracity of corporate reporting , the long-term prospects for china outweigh many of the risks .
people worry a lot .
there can be a boom , but it does n't mean it is a bubble jim o 'neil , goldman sachs instead of a collapse , analysts say there will be corrections in a bull market that will see equity prices continue rising and profits keep growing .
the key to this approach is taking a long-term outlook and buying into the view that the so-called bric nations of brazil , russia , india and china are reshaping the world economy .
already the changes are being felt and in the first three months of this year china accounted for a greater proportion of the global economy than the us .
jim o 'neil is chief economist at goldman sachs and is the man who coined the term brics .

merger and acquisition activity has taken off , and private equity firms are now in control of some of the world 's biggest brands .
but as the records have continued to tumble , concerns have kept on mounting .
credit crunch one of the main reasons for the current uncertainty has been the significant changes and volatility in the us bond market .
the price of 10-year us government-backed bonds has fallen , pushing their yields above 5.25 % for the first time in five years .
simply put , this means that investors are not expecting interest rates to fall anytime soon , especially as the bank of england , the us federal reserve and european central bank have all been lifting borrowing costs in recent months .
what has many observers worried is the sudden speed with which the change occurred and the fact that it seems to confirm the view that the era of low interest rates has ended .
first and foremost this will make it more expensive for companies and consumers to get their hands on cash .
that in turn could lead to fewer private equity deals , and a cooling of the housing and stock markets .
home improvements in recent years consumers have benefited from the largesse of lenders , taking on larger mortgages and increasing personal borrowing to levels many now see as unsustainable .
the bond-market turmoil may turn out to be the beginning of the end robert peston , bbc business editor read robert 's analysis in full on tuesday , figures from the council of mortgage lenders showed that first time buyers borrow an average of 3.33 times their incomes to buy a home .
other measures show they are using 18.7 % of their incomes to meet mortgage repayments .
pessimists also point to a wobble in the us housing market , where prices have started to soften and high levels of sub-prime lending to people with poor credit histories has fanned fears of a surge in mortgage defaults should interest rates rise .
at the same time , some very canny real estate operators have been selling up , signalling that , for them at least , the market could not get any richer .
london estate agency foxtons was sold to private equity firm bc partners for a reported £ 400m in may , and us property magnate sam zell has offloaded his main investment vehicle .
topping off there have also been signs that the private equity boom , which has fuelled merger and acquisition activity in europe and the us , could be hitting a peak .
so far this year , the total value of deals done is almost double than at the same point in 2006 .
at this stage of bull markets larger corrections become more frequent morgan stanley and companies today are having to pay a premium of as much as 30 % to secure takeovers , compared with premiums of about 20 % a few years ago , analysts said .
at the same time , the low interest rates and an ever increasing hunt for profits have seen banks relax their restrictions on lending , producing a new breed of loans called " covenant-lite " .
borrowers have fewer restrictions on what they have to do with the money or business , something that has led to a decline in standards of due diligence , according to jon moulton , chairman and founder of alchemy partners .
while that may not matter when there is a lot of cash sloshing about , risky deals are often the first to collapse when interest rates climb , analysts said .
market timing critics say that the huge amounts of cash companies had at their disposal meant that they could buy back stocks to boost share prices and inflate equities by over-the-top acquisitions .
certainly stock markets are exhibiting some classic warning signals as well .
wall street giant morgan stanley told investors that its indicators were showing a " full-house " in terms of sell triggers , and that this had only happened five times since 1980 .
each time , global equities have lost an average of 15 % over the following six months , it said .
" at this stage of bull markets larger corrections become more frequent , " morgan stanley said .
and yet , despite the pessimism there are plenty of reasons to believe that a meltdown is not on the cards .
true markets have surged and corporate profits in many industries hit record levels , but indicators are a long way from the scary heights that preceded previous crashes .
in the us , the average price earnings ratio - a measure of the share price when compared to future profits - is about 18 times at present ; in the lead up to the dotcom collapse it was at least double that level .
volatility normally increases ahead of a slump , with corrections of as much as 10 % happening regularly , though this has not been the case with the s & p over the past four years .
world view elsewhere there have been wobbles , such as in china where a 9 % one-day drop in the stock market shook global indexes .
however , many analysts argue that even though the shanghai stock exchange may seem overvalued and there may be concerns about the veracity of corporate reporting , the long-term prospects for china outweigh many of the risks .
people worry a lot .
there can be a boom , but it does n't mean it is a bubble jim o 'neil , goldman sachs instead of a collapse , analysts say there will be corrections in a bull market that will see equity prices continue rising and profits keep growing .
the key to this approach is taking a long-term outlook and buying into the view that the so-called bric nations of brazil , russia , india and china are reshaping the world economy .
already the changes are being felt and in the first three months of this year china accounted for a greater proportion of the global economy than the us .
jim o 'neil is chief economist at goldman sachs and is the man who coined the term brics .
" people worry a lot , " he explained .
" there can be a boom , but it does n't mean it is a bubble . "
flattening out the view of the optimists on the housing and private equity markets is not so different .
it may become more expensive to get mortgages and do deals , but that is likely to slow rather than reverse the current trend .
rather than the bursting of a bubble , expect a plateau of demand .
uk house price growth probably will slow , though a lack of new homes will help underpin the market especially in prime areas such as london .
though real interest rates have risen , they are still low by historical standards .
real estate bubbles may appear but they will be localised and dictated by special circumstances .
mergers and acquisitions are unlikely to stop as there are compelling arguments for consolidation in many industries , such as banking .
the problem for investors and consumers watching events unfold over the next few months will be determining whether the commentators have got it right or wrong , and if it really is time to head for safety before things blow up in their faces .

analysis by ben richardson business reporter , bbc news there is a strange fascination in blowing a bubble , when despite your better judgement , you keep willing it to get bigger regardless of the dangers .
then , suddenly , the violent pop that leaves you picking bubblegum off your eyebrows , or crying soapy tears .
for many observers , global markets are getting dangerously close to such a bursting point .
until recently , we have been living in a period of low global interest rates that have let consumers and companies borrow money cheaply .
that has driven demand for mortgages , let companies pay increasingly large sums for takeovers , and allowed consumers to spend freely .
and the results of this credit splurge are hard to ignore : uk house prices have doubled in the past 10 years .
china 's main stock index has quadrupled in value since the start of 2006 .
the uk 's ftse 100 and us s & p 500 stock indexes are at levels not seen in almost seven years .
commodity prices have been buoyed by strong global demand , pushing some such as copper to records .
merger and acquisition activity has taken off , and private equity firms are now in control of some of the world 's biggest brands .
but as the records have continued to tumble , concerns have kept on mounting .

sidra afzal , from fleur-de-lys , near caerphilly , had successful surgery to regrow skin and hair after an accident .
sidra has missed more than a year of lessons , but is expected to return to fleur-de-lys primary in september .
deputy head john farmer said pupils had made cards and personal messages to send to her during her recovery .
sidra was two when she suffered 25 % burns from cooking oil in an accident at her home , leaving her bald on one side of her head .
the pupils are asking questions about her - asking how she is and when she 's coming back to school john farmer , fleur-de-lys primary surgeons at the welsh centre for burns and plastic surgery in morriston hospital , swansea , implanted a gel-filled balloon under her scalp 10 months ago , which has steadily grown with new skin and hair .
in an operation on wednesday , the balloon was removed and new skin and hair follicles pulled over sidra 's head .
surgeons said the 90-minute operation had gone " very well indeed " and it is now hoped sidra will be able to return to school after the summer holidays .
she had been taught at home since her treatment started .
deputy head , mr farmer , said sidra was a popular pupil whose friends had kept up to date with her progress .
he said : " she 's been off for over a year and obviously her friends at the school have missed her a lot .
" she has been coming in to visit to keep in with her friends when she 's been well enough to see everyone .
sidra 's parents said their daughter had been " so brave " " she has lots of friends and they all look forward to her visits when she 's able to make it in , which has been about once a month .
" the pupils are asking questions about her - asking how she is and when she 's coming back .
" we believe she is due to return in september and everyone is looking forward to seeing her . "
mr farmer said sidra 's class had worked on a project making personal cards and messages for her .
sidra 's parents saba and mohammed afzal said they were relieved and delighted with the outcome of their daughter 's surgery .
mrs afzal said : " it 's beyond words , we 've waited for this since she had the accident , when they told us one day sidra would have the operation .
" we 've just been waiting for this moment .
she has been so brave all this time . "

the districts say the vote is " an attempt to let local people have their say " .

but the new glasshouse at the royal horticultural society -lrb- rhs -rrb- garden in surrey is a giant flat-pack .
" it is n't custom made but a conventional off-the-peg greenhouse - just manufactured to our requirements , " said the garden 's curator jim gardiner .
" the cost of an architect-designed glasshouse would have been phenomenal . "
the wisley glasshouse will be officially opened by the queen and the duke of edinburgh on 26 june , but opens to the public on friday .
the project to build it , to replace the existing dilapidated collection of glasshouses , was launched to mark the gardening charity 's bicentenary in 2002 .
where it differs from most large glasshouses , it is similar in size to the princess of wales conservatory at kew , is that it focuses on cultivated garden plants . "
to see it come true is the peak of my lifetime 's achievement , " " curator jim gardiner glasshouse picture gallery " our whole emphasis is on displaying plants that are attractive and have the potential of being grown by our visitors - not on conservation , " said mr gardiner .
" we want to put out a message about plants but at the garden end .
" it is about telling people about plants , about practical advice and showing their potential . "
hundreds of thousands of gardening enthusiasts visit the rhs 's major flower shows every year at chelsea , hampton court and tatton park .

" the inspiration was the gorilla enclosure at new york zoo , which has an area which shows what is going on underground in the congo , where the gorillas come from , " said mr gardiner .
elsewhere , the glasshouse is divided into three computer-controlled climates - dry and moist temperate and tropical .
the large palms were grown in holland and shipped to britain but 85 % of the plants were grown at wisley .
plants will be moved around constantly so there will always be something in flower and displays in a " horticultural theatre " area will change monthly .
outside , a new lake acts as a reservoir for the garden , holding more than 1.3 million gallons -lrb- 6 million litres -rrb- of water .
there is also a teaching garden , designed by chelsea gold medal-winner cleve west , where children can study the natural world .
it links to a classroom area where visiting schoolchildren can prepare and cook food grown outside and " get messy " learning about compost and the soil .
mr gardiner , who began working at wisley just after the 1987 hurricane , has been involved in the project from the early planning stage in 1996 .
" to have been in at the beginning and to see it come true is the peak of my lifetime 's achievement , " he said .

the project to build it , to replace the existing dilapidated collection of glasshouses , was launched to mark the gardening charity 's bicentenary in 2002 .
where it differs from most large glasshouses , it is similar in size to the princess of wales conservatory at kew , is that it focuses on cultivated garden plants .
to see it come true is the peak of my lifetime 's achievement , " curator jim gardiner glasshouse picture gallery " our whole emphasis is on displaying plants that are attractive and have the potential of being grown by our visitors - not on conservation , " said mr gardiner .
" we want to put out a message about plants but at the garden end .
" it is about telling people about plants , about practical advice and showing their potential . "
hundreds of thousands of gardening enthusiasts visit the rhs 's major flower shows every year at chelsea , hampton court and tatton park .
the new glasshouse has the capacity to hold 750 people .
a huge reddish-brown rock at the centre from which a 5m -lrb- 16ft -rrb- waterfall cascades is actually glass-reinforced concrete , which also accommodates a lift to give access to disabled visitors .
it also houses the root zone , a walk-through cavern which shows how plants ' roots interact with soil .
" the inspiration was the gorilla enclosure at new york zoo , which has an area which shows what is going on underground in the congo , where the gorillas come from , " said mr gardiner .
the 5m waterfall is built into the central rock structure elsewhere , the glasshouse is divided into three computer-controlled climates - dry and moist temperate and tropical .
the large palms were grown in holland and shipped to britain but 85 % of the plants were grown at wisley .
plants will be moved around constantly so there will always be something in flower and displays in a " horticultural theatre " area will change monthly .
outside , a new lake acts as a reservoir for the garden , holding more than 1.3 million gallons -lrb- 6 million litres -rrb- of water .
there is also a teaching garden , designed by chelsea gold medal-winner cleve west , where children can study the natural world .
it links to a classroom area where visiting schoolchildren can prepare and cook food grown outside and " get messy " learning about compost and the soil .
mr gardiner , who began working at wisley just after the 1987 hurricane , has been involved in the project from the early planning stage in 1996 .
" to have been in at the beginning and to see it come true is the peak of my lifetime 's achievement , " he said .
