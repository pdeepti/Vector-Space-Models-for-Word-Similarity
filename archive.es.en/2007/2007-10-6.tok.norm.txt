program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders crime -pipe- 06.10.2007 in germany , focus on preventing not punishing youth crime großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juvenile courts can do more than sentence offenders to time behind bars german courts largely sentence defendants under the age of 21 according to juvenile law in a bid to help them reintegrate into society and mete out punishments that fit the crime as well as the offender . in a case that caused shockwaves in germany , a court on thursday , oct .
4 , convicted three young men of the sexual assault , torture and murder of a fellow inmate last year at a juvenile detention center . a 17-year-old received a sentence of 10 years in prison , the highest possible as he was tried as a minor .
the others , a 20-year-old and a 21-year-old , received 15 years and 14 years respectively . the sentences are harsh considering that german courts can apply laws intended for minors to anyone under the age of 21 .
it 's estimated that some 60 percent of cases involving offenders between 18 and 21 are settled in juvenile courts , even when the crimes are of a violent nature . " the more serious an offense , the more likely it is to be tried in a juvenile court , " said bernd-rüdeger sonnen of the german association for juvenile court and juvenile offenders , which advocates the rights of young offenders .
more options for juvenile court judges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : community service is often part of juvenile 's sentences allowing defendants under 21 to be tried and sentenced according to juvenile law lowers the chances of repeat offenders by providing judges with more leeway in issuing appropriate sentences , he said .
" in general law you have fines , probation and jail sentences , " sonnen said .
" in juvenile law there is a much wider palette of options . "
while juvenile court judges can sentence offenders to a maximum of 10 years in jail , they can also order social training and aggression management courses and meetings with victims where offenders are forced to see the effects of their crimes and take responsibility for their actions .
these types of alternative treatments have proven to be more effective in keeping young offenders from relapsing , sonnen said .
more than 50 percent of offenders dealt with in this manner stay away from crime contrasted with over 70 percent of young people placed in correctional facilities being arrested again .
critics want tougher sentences but not everyone is convinced that treating all offenders below the age of 21 as minors is the right tack . some conservative politicians in germany are in favor of raising the maximum sentence from 10 to 15 years for offenders between 18 and 20 years of age .
the southern german state of bavaria has been pressing for a change in laws since 1998 but has failed to get the backing of the federal parliament .
this week , beate merk , bavaria 's justice minister and a member of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- renewed criticism that cases such as the juvenile prison torture and murder showed that young offenders were also guilty of serious crimes which were n't sufficiently punished with a ten-year prison sentence .
offenders between 18 and 20 who are convicted according to juvenile law should thus get a tougher maximum sentence , merk said .
harsh punishments ineffective but demanding that youth offenders receive punishments on par with those of adults misses the point of having a youth court , according to sonnen . the german juvenile court system focuses more on preventing new crimes , rather then punishing ones already committed , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping juveniles ' doors locked longer is seldom beneficial , research showed " it 's not about harsher or milder punishments , " he said .
" it 's about effectiveness , which leads to fewer victims . "
research published earlier this year by klaus boers and jost reinecke of münster and bielefeld universities , respectively , reached a similar conclusion .
" deterrents , intimidation or simply harsh punishments seldom work and are usually counterproductive , " their study concluded . it was based on interviews with 1,900 students from 2000 to 2003 . though difficult to measure since most crimes committed by juveniles are of a bagatelle nature and go unreported , youth crime rates have been dropping since the end of the 1990s , the study said .
no rise in juvenile delinquency ?
the results run contrary to official statistics released by german police , which show an increase in assault and other violent crime .
experts say that a heightened sensibility in the media is partly responsible for the perceived increase in youth crime .
at the same time , growing awareness has led the public and schools to report more crimes to the authorities .
" there is no empirical data showing there are actually more youths committing violent crimes or that the crimes have become qualitatively worse , " michael walter , director of the cologne university institute for criminology , told public broadcaster wdr .
" the information available contradicts police data . " sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders crime -pipe- 06.10.2007 in germany , focus on preventing not punishing youth crime großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juvenile courts can do more than sentence offenders to time behind bars german courts largely sentence defendants under the age of 21 according to juvenile law in a bid to help them reintegrate into society and mete out punishments that fit the crime as well as the offender . in a case that caused shockwaves in germany , a court on thursday , oct .
4 , convicted three young men of the sexual assault , torture and murder of a fellow inmate last year at a juvenile detention center . a 17-year-old received a sentence of 10 years in prison , the highest possible as he was tried as a minor .
the others , a 20-year-old and a 21-year-old , received 15 years and 14 years respectively . the sentences are harsh considering that german courts can apply laws intended for minors to anyone under the age of 21 .
it 's estimated that some 60 percent of cases involving offenders between 18 and 21 are settled in juvenile courts , even when the crimes are of a violent nature . " the more serious an offense , the more likely it is to be tried in a juvenile court , " said bernd-rüdeger sonnen of the german association for juvenile court and juvenile offenders , which advocates the rights of young offenders .
more options for juvenile court judges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : community service is often part of juvenile 's sentences allowing defendants under 21 to be tried and sentenced according to juvenile law lowers the chances of repeat offenders by providing judges with more leeway in issuing appropriate sentences , he said .
" in general law you have fines , probation and jail sentences , " sonnen said .
" in juvenile law there is a much wider palette of options . "
while juvenile court judges can sentence offenders to a maximum of 10 years in jail , they can also order social training and aggression management courses and meetings with victims where offenders are forced to see the effects of their crimes and take responsibility for their actions .
these types of alternative treatments have proven to be more effective in keeping young offenders from relapsing , sonnen said .
more than 50 percent of offenders dealt with in this manner stay away from crime contrasted with over 70 percent of young people placed in correctional facilities being arrested again .
critics want tougher sentences but not everyone is convinced that treating all offenders below the age of 21 as minors is the right tack . some conservative politicians in germany are in favor of raising the maximum sentence from 10 to 15 years for offenders between 18 and 20 years of age .
the southern german state of bavaria has been pressing for a change in laws since 1998 but has failed to get the backing of the federal parliament .
this week , beate merk , bavaria 's justice minister and a member of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- renewed criticism that cases such as the juvenile prison torture and murder showed that young offenders were also guilty of serious crimes which were n't sufficiently punished with a ten-year prison sentence .
offenders between 18 and 20 who are convicted according to juvenile law should thus get a tougher maximum sentence , merk said .
harsh punishments ineffective but demanding that youth offenders receive punishments on par with those of adults misses the point of having a youth court , according to sonnen . the german juvenile court system focuses more on preventing new crimes , rather then punishing ones already committed , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping juveniles ' doors locked longer is seldom beneficial , research showed " it 's not about harsher or milder punishments , " he said .
" it 's about effectiveness , which leads to fewer victims . "
research published earlier this year by klaus boers and jost reinecke of münster and bielefeld universities , respectively , reached a similar conclusion .
" deterrents , intimidation or simply harsh punishments seldom work and are usually counterproductive , " their study concluded . it was based on interviews with 1,900 students from 2000 to 2003 . though difficult to measure since most crimes committed by juveniles are of a bagatelle nature and go unreported , youth crime rates have been dropping since the end of the 1990s , the study said .
no rise in juvenile delinquency ?
the results run contrary to official statistics released by german police , which show an increase in assault and other violent crime .
experts say that a heightened sensibility in the media is partly responsible for the perceived increase in youth crime .
at the same time , growing awareness has led the public and schools to report more crimes to the authorities .
" there is no empirical data showing there are actually more youths committing violent crimes or that the crimes have become qualitatively worse , " michael walter , director of the cologne university institute for criminology , told public broadcaster wdr .

4 , convicted three young men of the sexual assault , torture and murder of a fellow inmate last year at a juvenile detention center . a 17-year-old received a sentence of 10 years in prison , the highest possible as he was tried as a minor .
the others , a 20-year-old and a 21-year-old , received 15 years and 14 years respectively . the sentences are harsh considering that german courts can apply laws intended for minors to anyone under the age of 21 .
it 's estimated that some 60 percent of cases involving offenders between 18 and 21 are settled in juvenile courts , even when the crimes are of a violent nature . " the more serious an offense , the more likely it is to be tried in a juvenile court , " said bernd-rüdeger sonnen of the german association for juvenile court and juvenile offenders , which advocates the rights of young offenders .
more options for juvenile court judges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : community service is often part of juvenile 's sentences allowing defendants under 21 to be tried and sentenced according to juvenile law lowers the chances of repeat offenders by providing judges with more leeway in issuing appropriate sentences , he said .
" in general law you have fines , probation and jail sentences , " sonnen said .
" in juvenile law there is a much wider palette of options . "
while juvenile court judges can sentence offenders to a maximum of 10 years in jail , they can also order social training and aggression management courses and meetings with victims where offenders are forced to see the effects of their crimes and take responsibility for their actions .
these types of alternative treatments have proven to be more effective in keeping young offenders from relapsing , sonnen said .
more than 50 percent of offenders dealt with in this manner stay away from crime contrasted with over 70 percent of young people placed in correctional facilities being arrested again .
critics want tougher sentences but not everyone is convinced that treating all offenders below the age of 21 as minors is the right tack . some conservative politicians in germany are in favor of raising the maximum sentence from 10 to 15 years for offenders between 18 and 20 years of age .
the southern german state of bavaria has been pressing for a change in laws since 1998 but has failed to get the backing of the federal parliament .
this week , beate merk , bavaria 's justice minister and a member of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- renewed criticism that cases such as the juvenile prison torture and murder showed that young offenders were also guilty of serious crimes which were n't sufficiently punished with a ten-year prison sentence .
offenders between 18 and 20 who are convicted according to juvenile law should thus get a tougher maximum sentence , merk said .
harsh punishments ineffective but demanding that youth offenders receive punishments on par with those of adults misses the point of having a youth court , according to sonnen . the german juvenile court system focuses more on preventing new crimes , rather then punishing ones already committed , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping juveniles ' doors locked longer is seldom beneficial , research showed " it 's not about harsher or milder punishments , " he said .
" it 's about effectiveness , which leads to fewer victims . "
research published earlier this year by klaus boers and jost reinecke of münster and bielefeld universities , respectively , reached a similar conclusion .
" deterrents , intimidation or simply harsh punishments seldom work and are usually counterproductive , " their study concluded . it was based on interviews with 1,900 students from 2000 to 2003 . though difficult to measure since most crimes committed by juveniles are of a bagatelle nature and go unreported , youth crime rates have been dropping since the end of the 1990s , the study said .
no rise in juvenile delinquency ?
the results run contrary to official statistics released by german police , which show an increase in assault and other violent crime .
experts say that a heightened sensibility in the media is partly responsible for the perceived increase in youth crime .
at the same time , growing awareness has led the public and schools to report more crimes to the authorities .

the move is strongly opposed by european soccer officials and top clubs . in an interview with the bbc on friday , oct .
5 , blatter said soccer clubs should have no more than five non-nationals on the pitch at any time even if it contravenes eu labor rules . blatter said he wanted to cap the number of non-nationals in a team 's starting 11 at just five per match from 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa boss blatter says too many foreign players is not good for the development of soccer " this is a matter of principle and we need to protect the national identity of the football clubs , " blatter said , adding it would increase opportunities for homegrown players . " footballers more artists than workers " soccer clubs in the eu currently have a limit of three players from outside the 27-member bloc , but have had no restrictions on players from within the eu since 1995 . " when you have 11 foreigners in a team , this is not good for the development of football .
football has never had the courage to go against this practice , but it must now , " blatter said . blatter wants sport to be given an exemption from eu rules under the bloc 's new reform treaty due to agreed upon by eu governments this month . " you can not consider a footballer like any normal worker because you need 11 to play a match - and they are more artists than workers , " blatter said . " it does not matter where you are born " blatter 's plans have met with stiff resistance from european officials and top clubs . blatter 's uefa or european counterpart , michel platini said fifa needed to accept the plan could not work in the european union due to laws which allow free movement of labor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders crime -pipe- 06.10.2007 in germany , focus on preventing not punishing youth crime großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juvenile courts can do more than sentence offenders to time behind bars german courts largely sentence defendants under the age of 21 according to juvenile law in a bid to help them reintegrate into society and mete out punishments that fit the crime as well as the offender . in a case that caused shockwaves in germany , a court on thursday , oct .
4 , convicted three young men of the sexual assault , torture and murder of a fellow inmate last year at a juvenile detention center . a 17-year-old received a sentence of 10 years in prison , the highest possible as he was tried as a minor .
the others , a 20-year-old and a 21-year-old , received 15 years and 14 years respectively . the sentences are harsh considering that german courts can apply laws intended for minors to anyone under the age of 21 .
it 's estimated that some 60 percent of cases involving offenders between 18 and 21 are settled in juvenile courts , even when the crimes are of a violent nature . " the more serious an offense , the more likely it is to be tried in a juvenile court , " said bernd-rüdeger sonnen of the german association for juvenile court and juvenile offenders , which advocates the rights of young offenders .
more options for juvenile court judges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : community service is often part of juvenile 's sentences allowing defendants under 21 to be tried and sentenced according to juvenile law lowers the chances of repeat offenders by providing judges with more leeway in issuing appropriate sentences , he said .
" in general law you have fines , probation and jail sentences , " sonnen said .
" in juvenile law there is a much wider palette of options . "
while juvenile court judges can sentence offenders to a maximum of 10 years in jail , they can also order social training and aggression management courses and meetings with victims where offenders are forced to see the effects of their crimes and take responsibility for their actions .
these types of alternative treatments have proven to be more effective in keeping young offenders from relapsing , sonnen said .
more than 50 percent of offenders dealt with in this manner stay away from crime contrasted with over 70 percent of young people placed in correctional facilities being arrested again .
critics want tougher sentences but not everyone is convinced that treating all offenders below the age of 21 as minors is the right tack . some conservative politicians in germany are in favor of raising the maximum sentence from 10 to 15 years for offenders between 18 and 20 years of age .
the southern german state of bavaria has been pressing for a change in laws since 1998 but has failed to get the backing of the federal parliament .
this week , beate merk , bavaria 's justice minister and a member of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- renewed criticism that cases such as the juvenile prison torture and murder showed that young offenders were also guilty of serious crimes which were n't sufficiently punished with a ten-year prison sentence .
offenders between 18 and 20 who are convicted according to juvenile law should thus get a tougher maximum sentence , merk said .
harsh punishments ineffective but demanding that youth offenders receive punishments on par with those of adults misses the point of having a youth court , according to sonnen . the german juvenile court system focuses more on preventing new crimes , rather then punishing ones already committed , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping juveniles ' doors locked longer is seldom beneficial , research showed " it 's not about harsher or milder punishments , " he said .
" it 's about effectiveness , which leads to fewer victims . "
research published earlier this year by klaus boers and jost reinecke of münster and bielefeld universities , respectively , reached a similar conclusion .
" deterrents , intimidation or simply harsh punishments seldom work and are usually counterproductive , " their study concluded . it was based on interviews with 1,900 students from 2000 to 2003 . though difficult to measure since most crimes committed by juveniles are of a bagatelle nature and go unreported , youth crime rates have been dropping since the end of the 1990s , the study said .
no rise in juvenile delinquency ?
the results run contrary to official statistics released by german police , which show an increase in assault and other violent crime .
experts say that a heightened sensibility in the media is partly responsible for the perceived increase in youth crime .
at the same time , growing awareness has led the public and schools to report more crimes to the authorities .
" there is no empirical data showing there are actually more youths committing violent crimes or that the crimes have become qualitatively worse , " michael walter , director of the cologne university institute for criminology , told public broadcaster wdr .
" the information available contradicts police data . " sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german researchers have developed a prototype for a driverless railcab .
the mini-trains could revolutionize how we travel , if they can get funding . every mode of transportation has its disadvantages .
cars crowd the streets , pollute the air and are hard to park .
trains fill up during rush hour and often have inconvenient schedules .
and airplanes are n't practical for short trips around town . some researchers are promoting railcabs as the vehicle of the future .
these driverless , computer-controlled cars take passengers and cargo directly to their destinations without stops or transfers .
they can travel in convoys to save energy and then peel off from each other as each car heads to a separate destination . small version already been developed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on-the-track tinkering under development for a decade , researchers at the university of paderborn have a prototype of the railcab .
a test track has been built near paderborn , a city in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia .
since 2003 , slightly smaller-than-life railcabs have run on a 600-meter test track near the university . researchers have declared the prototype a success and say they 're ready to test their revolutionary trains under real-life conditions .
the engines , chassis and rail technology are ready for production . " these are not toys , " professor joachim lückel , who started the project , told the associated press . more money needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lückel wants some government support however , a full-sized prototype has not been tested as yet .
that is expensive , lückel said , adding that 11 million euros have already been invested in this project and an additional 20 million euros are needed to build a full-sized prototype . the cars would travel on normal rails , but would use a so-called linear motor , which needs little maintenance .
they would use magnetic fields to accelerate , similar to the transrapid train , but would otherwise run on tracks . adapting tracks to fit the railcab would cost 800,000 euros per kilometer .
new tracks would cost 3.5 million euros per kilometer .
that 's a lot of money , but much less than it costs to build new high-speed train tracks , lückel said . additionally , turnouts would need to be added so that railcabs could leave convoys .
but the entire system would still need to be compatible with trains . the railcab would revolutionize transportation of both people and cargo , lückel believes , making it much more efficient .
the enormous flexibility of a railcab system would make the costs worth it , lückel said . not everyone is a fan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not exactly a simple system but not all experts share lückel 's enthusiasm . " converting tracks is more expensive than building a second regular track , " said edmund mühlhans , an emeritus professor and rail expert at the technical university in darmstadt . also , stretches of track exist which run at capacity and do n't have additional space to accommodate railcabs .
if railcabs had to detour around these tracks , they would not be as efficient , mühlhans said . mühlhans also envisions technical problems .
linear motors are noticeably less efficient than conventional locomotives .
the large number or railcabs that would be needed would mean more inspections , maintenance and repair , he said . " despite all the advantages that the inventors have always predicted , cab trains have never made it past the pilot project stage , " said mühlhans . lückel said the time has come for the project to move forward .
if it does n't happen soon , lückel worries that his specialized researchers could get disillusioned with the project and go to work in private industry . " we need government support , " lückel said . a few wealthy customers from the middle east have apparently made discreet inquiries .

german researchers have developed a prototype for a driverless railcab .
the mini-trains could revolutionize how we travel , if they can get funding . every mode of transportation has its disadvantages .
cars crowd the streets , pollute the air and are hard to park .
trains fill up during rush hour and often have inconvenient schedules .
and airplanes are n't practical for short trips around town . some researchers are promoting railcabs as the vehicle of the future .
these driverless , computer-controlled cars take passengers and cargo directly to their destinations without stops or transfers .
they can travel in convoys to save energy and then peel off from each other as each car heads to a separate destination . small version already been developed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on-the-track tinkering under development for a decade , researchers at the university of paderborn have a prototype of the railcab .
a test track has been built near paderborn , a city in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia .
since 2003 , slightly smaller-than-life railcabs have run on a 600-meter test track near the university . researchers have declared the prototype a success and say they 're ready to test their revolutionary trains under real-life conditions .
the engines , chassis and rail technology are ready for production . " these are not toys , " professor joachim lückel , who started the project , told the associated press . more money needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lückel wants some government support however , a full-sized prototype has not been tested as yet .
that is expensive , lückel said , adding that 11 million euros have already been invested in this project and an additional 20 million euros are needed to build a full-sized prototype . the cars would travel on normal rails , but would use a so-called linear motor , which needs little maintenance .
they would use magnetic fields to accelerate , similar to the transrapid train , but would otherwise run on tracks . adapting tracks to fit the railcab would cost 800,000 euros per kilometer .
new tracks would cost 3.5 million euros per kilometer .
that 's a lot of money , but much less than it costs to build new high-speed train tracks , lückel said . additionally , turnouts would need to be added so that railcabs could leave convoys .
but the entire system would still need to be compatible with trains . the railcab would revolutionize transportation of both people and cargo , lückel believes , making it much more efficient .
the enormous flexibility of a railcab system would make the costs worth it , lückel said . not everyone is a fan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not exactly a simple system but not all experts share lückel 's enthusiasm . " converting tracks is more expensive than building a second regular track , " said edmund mühlhans , an emeritus professor and rail expert at the technical university in darmstadt . also , stretches of track exist which run at capacity and do n't have additional space to accommodate railcabs .
if railcabs had to detour around these tracks , they would not be as efficient , mühlhans said . mühlhans also envisions technical problems .
linear motors are noticeably less efficient than conventional locomotives .
the large number or railcabs that would be needed would mean more inspections , maintenance and repair , he said . " despite all the advantages that the inventors have always predicted , cab trains have never made it past the pilot project stage , " said mühlhans . lückel said the time has come for the project to move forward .
if it does n't happen soon , lückel worries that his specialized researchers could get disillusioned with the project and go to work in private industry . " we need government support , " lückel said . a few wealthy customers from the middle east have apparently made discreet inquiries .

the move is strongly opposed by european soccer officials and top clubs . in an interview with the bbc on friday , oct .
5 , blatter said soccer clubs should have no more than five non-nationals on the pitch at any time even if it contravenes eu labor rules . blatter said he wanted to cap the number of non-nationals in a team 's starting 11 at just five per match from 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa boss blatter says too many foreign players is not good for the development of soccer " this is a matter of principle and we need to protect the national identity of the football clubs , " blatter said , adding it would increase opportunities for homegrown players . " footballers more artists than workers " soccer clubs in the eu currently have a limit of three players from outside the 27-member bloc , but have had no restrictions on players from within the eu since 1995 . " when you have 11 foreigners in a team , this is not good for the development of football .
football has never had the courage to go against this practice , but it must now , " blatter said . blatter wants sport to be given an exemption from eu rules under the bloc 's new reform treaty due to agreed upon by eu governments this month . " you can not consider a footballer like any normal worker because you need 11 to play a match - and they are more artists than workers , " blatter said . " it does not matter where you are born " blatter 's plans have met with stiff resistance from european officials and top clubs . blatter 's uefa or european counterpart , michel platini said fifa needed to accept the plan could not work in the european union due to laws which allow free movement of labor .

the move is strongly opposed by european soccer officials and top clubs . in an interview with the bbc on friday , oct .
5 , blatter said soccer clubs should have no more than five non-nationals on the pitch at any time even if it contravenes eu labor rules . blatter said he wanted to cap the number of non-nationals in a team 's starting 11 at just five per match from 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa boss blatter says too many foreign players is not good for the development of soccer " this is a matter of principle and we need to protect the national identity of the football clubs , " blatter said , adding it would increase opportunities for homegrown players . " footballers more artists than workers " soccer clubs in the eu currently have a limit of three players from outside the 27-member bloc , but have had no restrictions on players from within the eu since 1995 . " when you have 11 foreigners in a team , this is not good for the development of football .
football has never had the courage to go against this practice , but it must now , " blatter said . blatter wants sport to be given an exemption from eu rules under the bloc 's new reform treaty due to agreed upon by eu governments this month . " you can not consider a footballer like any normal worker because you need 11 to play a match - and they are more artists than workers , " blatter said . " it does not matter where you are born " blatter 's plans have met with stiff resistance from european officials and top clubs . blatter 's uefa or european counterpart , michel platini said fifa needed to accept the plan could not work in the european union due to laws which allow free movement of labor . " the philosophy is fantastic but legally it is difficult , " platini told reuters . " i can understand fifa because they have 208 national associations and then there are 29 -lrb- eu members -rrb- who are all in our confederation . " the g14 which represents 18 of europe 's top clubs such as real madrid , manchester united and ac milan have also voiced their resistance to blatter 's plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arsenal manager wenger has rubbished plans to cap the number of foreign players arsenal manager arsene wenger said blatter 's proposals were not in the interests of clubs competing in the english premier league .
speaking at a news conference , wenger said : " i am against it .
sport is competitive and competition is based on merit .
it does not matter where you are born .
it matters who you are . "
fifa could face another " bosman " blatter 's plan could also run into trouble with eu authorities as was the case in 1995 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack currently plays for english premier league club chelsea then , the european court of justice -lrb- ecj -rrb- , europe 's highest court , gave all sports professionals within the eu more freedom to change clubs in a decision known as the " bosman ruling " - named after belgian player jean-marc bosman .
the court concluded that such restrictions discriminated against nationals of eu states .
the eu is also examining uefa 's " homegrown rule , " which began in 2006 , and according to which each team involved in european club competition must have a minimum of eight locally-trained players . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

4 , convicted three young men of the sexual assault , torture and murder of a fellow inmate last year at a juvenile detention center . a 17-year-old received a sentence of 10 years in prison , the highest possible as he was tried as a minor .
the others , a 20-year-old and a 21-year-old , received 15 years and 14 years respectively . the sentences are harsh considering that german courts can apply laws intended for minors to anyone under the age of 21 .
it 's estimated that some 60 percent of cases involving offenders between 18 and 21 are settled in juvenile courts , even when the crimes are of a violent nature . " the more serious an offense , the more likely it is to be tried in a juvenile court , " said bernd-rüdeger sonnen of the german association for juvenile court and juvenile offenders , which advocates the rights of young offenders .
more options for juvenile court judges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : community service is often part of juvenile 's sentences allowing defendants under 21 to be tried and sentenced according to juvenile law lowers the chances of repeat offenders by providing judges with more leeway in issuing appropriate sentences , he said .
" in general law you have fines , probation and jail sentences , " sonnen said .
" in juvenile law there is a much wider palette of options . "
while juvenile court judges can sentence offenders to a maximum of 10 years in jail , they can also order social training and aggression management courses and meetings with victims where offenders are forced to see the effects of their crimes and take responsibility for their actions .
these types of alternative treatments have proven to be more effective in keeping young offenders from relapsing , sonnen said .
more than 50 percent of offenders dealt with in this manner stay away from crime contrasted with over 70 percent of young people placed in correctional facilities being arrested again .
critics want tougher sentences but not everyone is convinced that treating all offenders below the age of 21 as minors is the right tack . some conservative politicians in germany are in favor of raising the maximum sentence from 10 to 15 years for offenders between 18 and 20 years of age .
the southern german state of bavaria has been pressing for a change in laws since 1998 but has failed to get the backing of the federal parliament .
this week , beate merk , bavaria 's justice minister and a member of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- renewed criticism that cases such as the juvenile prison torture and murder showed that young offenders were also guilty of serious crimes which were n't sufficiently punished with a ten-year prison sentence .
offenders between 18 and 20 who are convicted according to juvenile law should thus get a tougher maximum sentence , merk said .
harsh punishments ineffective but demanding that youth offenders receive punishments on par with those of adults misses the point of having a youth court , according to sonnen . the german juvenile court system focuses more on preventing new crimes , rather then punishing ones already committed , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping juveniles ' doors locked longer is seldom beneficial , research showed " it 's not about harsher or milder punishments , " he said .
" it 's about effectiveness , which leads to fewer victims . "
research published earlier this year by klaus boers and jost reinecke of münster and bielefeld universities , respectively , reached a similar conclusion .
" deterrents , intimidation or simply harsh punishments seldom work and are usually counterproductive , " their study concluded . it was based on interviews with 1,900 students from 2000 to 2003 . though difficult to measure since most crimes committed by juveniles are of a bagatelle nature and go unreported , youth crime rates have been dropping since the end of the 1990s , the study said .
no rise in juvenile delinquency ?
the results run contrary to official statistics released by german police , which show an increase in assault and other violent crime .
experts say that a heightened sensibility in the media is partly responsible for the perceived increase in youth crime .
at the same time , growing awareness has led the public and schools to report more crimes to the authorities .
" there is no empirical data showing there are actually more youths committing violent crimes or that the crimes have become qualitatively worse , " michael walter , director of the cologne university institute for criminology , told public broadcaster wdr .

4 , convicted three young men of the sexual assault , torture and murder of a fellow inmate last year at a juvenile detention center . a 17-year-old received a sentence of 10 years in prison , the highest possible as he was tried as a minor .
the others , a 20-year-old and a 21-year-old , received 15 years and 14 years respectively . the sentences are harsh considering that german courts can apply laws intended for minors to anyone under the age of 21 .
it 's estimated that some 60 percent of cases involving offenders between 18 and 21 are settled in juvenile courts , even when the crimes are of a violent nature . " the more serious an offense , the more likely it is to be tried in a juvenile court , " said bernd-rüdeger sonnen of the german association for juvenile court and juvenile offenders , which advocates the rights of young offenders .
more options for juvenile court judges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : community service is often part of juvenile 's sentences allowing defendants under 21 to be tried and sentenced according to juvenile law lowers the chances of repeat offenders by providing judges with more leeway in issuing appropriate sentences , he said .
" in general law you have fines , probation and jail sentences , " sonnen said .
" in juvenile law there is a much wider palette of options . "
while juvenile court judges can sentence offenders to a maximum of 10 years in jail , they can also order social training and aggression management courses and meetings with victims where offenders are forced to see the effects of their crimes and take responsibility for their actions .
these types of alternative treatments have proven to be more effective in keeping young offenders from relapsing , sonnen said .
more than 50 percent of offenders dealt with in this manner stay away from crime contrasted with over 70 percent of young people placed in correctional facilities being arrested again .
critics want tougher sentences but not everyone is convinced that treating all offenders below the age of 21 as minors is the right tack . some conservative politicians in germany are in favor of raising the maximum sentence from 10 to 15 years for offenders between 18 and 20 years of age .
the southern german state of bavaria has been pressing for a change in laws since 1998 but has failed to get the backing of the federal parliament .
this week , beate merk , bavaria 's justice minister and a member of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- renewed criticism that cases such as the juvenile prison torture and murder showed that young offenders were also guilty of serious crimes which were n't sufficiently punished with a ten-year prison sentence .
offenders between 18 and 20 who are convicted according to juvenile law should thus get a tougher maximum sentence , merk said .
harsh punishments ineffective but demanding that youth offenders receive punishments on par with those of adults misses the point of having a youth court , according to sonnen . the german juvenile court system focuses more on preventing new crimes , rather then punishing ones already committed , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping juveniles ' doors locked longer is seldom beneficial , research showed " it 's not about harsher or milder punishments , " he said .
" it 's about effectiveness , which leads to fewer victims . "
research published earlier this year by klaus boers and jost reinecke of münster and bielefeld universities , respectively , reached a similar conclusion .
" deterrents , intimidation or simply harsh punishments seldom work and are usually counterproductive , " their study concluded . it was based on interviews with 1,900 students from 2000 to 2003 . though difficult to measure since most crimes committed by juveniles are of a bagatelle nature and go unreported , youth crime rates have been dropping since the end of the 1990s , the study said .
no rise in juvenile delinquency ?
the results run contrary to official statistics released by german police , which show an increase in assault and other violent crime .
experts say that a heightened sensibility in the media is partly responsible for the perceived increase in youth crime .
at the same time , growing awareness has led the public and schools to report more crimes to the authorities .
" there is no empirical data showing there are actually more youths committing violent crimes or that the crimes have become qualitatively worse , " michael walter , director of the cologne university institute for criminology , told public broadcaster wdr .

4 , convicted three young men of the sexual assault , torture and murder of a fellow inmate last year at a juvenile detention center . a 17-year-old received a sentence of 10 years in prison , the highest possible as he was tried as a minor .
the others , a 20-year-old and a 21-year-old , received 15 years and 14 years respectively . the sentences are harsh considering that german courts can apply laws intended for minors to anyone under the age of 21 .
it 's estimated that some 60 percent of cases involving offenders between 18 and 21 are settled in juvenile courts , even when the crimes are of a violent nature . " the more serious an offense , the more likely it is to be tried in a juvenile court , " said bernd-rüdeger sonnen of the german association for juvenile court and juvenile offenders , which advocates the rights of young offenders .
more options for juvenile court judges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : community service is often part of juvenile 's sentences allowing defendants under 21 to be tried and sentenced according to juvenile law lowers the chances of repeat offenders by providing judges with more leeway in issuing appropriate sentences , he said .
" in general law you have fines , probation and jail sentences , " sonnen said .
" in juvenile law there is a much wider palette of options . "
while juvenile court judges can sentence offenders to a maximum of 10 years in jail , they can also order social training and aggression management courses and meetings with victims where offenders are forced to see the effects of their crimes and take responsibility for their actions .
these types of alternative treatments have proven to be more effective in keeping young offenders from relapsing , sonnen said .
more than 50 percent of offenders dealt with in this manner stay away from crime contrasted with over 70 percent of young people placed in correctional facilities being arrested again .
critics want tougher sentences but not everyone is convinced that treating all offenders below the age of 21 as minors is the right tack . some conservative politicians in germany are in favor of raising the maximum sentence from 10 to 15 years for offenders between 18 and 20 years of age .
the southern german state of bavaria has been pressing for a change in laws since 1998 but has failed to get the backing of the federal parliament .
this week , beate merk , bavaria 's justice minister and a member of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- renewed criticism that cases such as the juvenile prison torture and murder showed that young offenders were also guilty of serious crimes which were n't sufficiently punished with a ten-year prison sentence .
offenders between 18 and 20 who are convicted according to juvenile law should thus get a tougher maximum sentence , merk said .
harsh punishments ineffective but demanding that youth offenders receive punishments on par with those of adults misses the point of having a youth court , according to sonnen . the german juvenile court system focuses more on preventing new crimes , rather then punishing ones already committed , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping juveniles ' doors locked longer is seldom beneficial , research showed " it 's not about harsher or milder punishments , " he said .
" it 's about effectiveness , which leads to fewer victims . "
research published earlier this year by klaus boers and jost reinecke of münster and bielefeld universities , respectively , reached a similar conclusion .
" deterrents , intimidation or simply harsh punishments seldom work and are usually counterproductive , " their study concluded . it was based on interviews with 1,900 students from 2000 to 2003 . though difficult to measure since most crimes committed by juveniles are of a bagatelle nature and go unreported , youth crime rates have been dropping since the end of the 1990s , the study said .
no rise in juvenile delinquency ?
the results run contrary to official statistics released by german police , which show an increase in assault and other violent crime .
experts say that a heightened sensibility in the media is partly responsible for the perceived increase in youth crime .
at the same time , growing awareness has led the public and schools to report more crimes to the authorities .
" there is no empirical data showing there are actually more youths committing violent crimes or that the crimes have become qualitatively worse , " michael walter , director of the cologne university institute for criminology , told public broadcaster wdr .

the move is strongly opposed by european soccer officials and top clubs . in an interview with the bbc on friday , oct .
5 , blatter said soccer clubs should have no more than five non-nationals on the pitch at any time even if it contravenes eu labor rules . blatter said he wanted to cap the number of non-nationals in a team 's starting 11 at just five per match from 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa boss blatter says too many foreign players is not good for the development of soccer " this is a matter of principle and we need to protect the national identity of the football clubs , " blatter said , adding it would increase opportunities for homegrown players . " footballers more artists than workers " soccer clubs in the eu currently have a limit of three players from outside the 27-member bloc , but have had no restrictions on players from within the eu since 1995 . " when you have 11 foreigners in a team , this is not good for the development of football .
football has never had the courage to go against this practice , but it must now , " blatter said . blatter wants sport to be given an exemption from eu rules under the bloc 's new reform treaty due to agreed upon by eu governments this month . " you can not consider a footballer like any normal worker because you need 11 to play a match - and they are more artists than workers , " blatter said . " it does not matter where you are born " blatter 's plans have met with stiff resistance from european officials and top clubs . blatter 's uefa or european counterpart , michel platini said fifa needed to accept the plan could not work in the european union due to laws which allow free movement of labor . " the philosophy is fantastic but legally it is difficult , " platini told reuters . " i can understand fifa because they have 208 national associations and then there are 29 -lrb- eu members -rrb- who are all in our confederation . " the g14 which represents 18 of europe 's top clubs such as real madrid , manchester united and ac milan have also voiced their resistance to blatter 's plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arsenal manager wenger has rubbished plans to cap the number of foreign players arsenal manager arsene wenger said blatter 's proposals were not in the interests of clubs competing in the english premier league .
speaking at a news conference , wenger said : " i am against it .
sport is competitive and competition is based on merit .
it does not matter where you are born .
it matters who you are . "
fifa could face another " bosman " blatter 's plan could also run into trouble with eu authorities as was the case in 1995 .

4 , convicted three young men of the sexual assault , torture and murder of a fellow inmate last year at a juvenile detention center . a 17-year-old received a sentence of 10 years in prison , the highest possible as he was tried as a minor .
the others , a 20-year-old and a 21-year-old , received 15 years and 14 years respectively . the sentences are harsh considering that german courts can apply laws intended for minors to anyone under the age of 21 .
it 's estimated that some 60 percent of cases involving offenders between 18 and 21 are settled in juvenile courts , even when the crimes are of a violent nature . " the more serious an offense , the more likely it is to be tried in a juvenile court , " said bernd-rüdeger sonnen of the german association for juvenile court and juvenile offenders , which advocates the rights of young offenders .
more options for juvenile court judges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : community service is often part of juvenile 's sentences allowing defendants under 21 to be tried and sentenced according to juvenile law lowers the chances of repeat offenders by providing judges with more leeway in issuing appropriate sentences , he said .
" in general law you have fines , probation and jail sentences , " sonnen said .
" in juvenile law there is a much wider palette of options . "
while juvenile court judges can sentence offenders to a maximum of 10 years in jail , they can also order social training and aggression management courses and meetings with victims where offenders are forced to see the effects of their crimes and take responsibility for their actions .
these types of alternative treatments have proven to be more effective in keeping young offenders from relapsing , sonnen said .
more than 50 percent of offenders dealt with in this manner stay away from crime contrasted with over 70 percent of young people placed in correctional facilities being arrested again .
critics want tougher sentences but not everyone is convinced that treating all offenders below the age of 21 as minors is the right tack . some conservative politicians in germany are in favor of raising the maximum sentence from 10 to 15 years for offenders between 18 and 20 years of age .
the southern german state of bavaria has been pressing for a change in laws since 1998 but has failed to get the backing of the federal parliament .
this week , beate merk , bavaria 's justice minister and a member of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- renewed criticism that cases such as the juvenile prison torture and murder showed that young offenders were also guilty of serious crimes which were n't sufficiently punished with a ten-year prison sentence .
offenders between 18 and 20 who are convicted according to juvenile law should thus get a tougher maximum sentence , merk said .
harsh punishments ineffective but demanding that youth offenders receive punishments on par with those of adults misses the point of having a youth court , according to sonnen . the german juvenile court system focuses more on preventing new crimes , rather then punishing ones already committed , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping juveniles ' doors locked longer is seldom beneficial , research showed " it 's not about harsher or milder punishments , " he said .
" it 's about effectiveness , which leads to fewer victims . "
research published earlier this year by klaus boers and jost reinecke of münster and bielefeld universities , respectively , reached a similar conclusion .
" deterrents , intimidation or simply harsh punishments seldom work and are usually counterproductive , " their study concluded . it was based on interviews with 1,900 students from 2000 to 2003 . though difficult to measure since most crimes committed by juveniles are of a bagatelle nature and go unreported , youth crime rates have been dropping since the end of the 1990s , the study said .
no rise in juvenile delinquency ?
the results run contrary to official statistics released by german police , which show an increase in assault and other violent crime .
experts say that a heightened sensibility in the media is partly responsible for the perceived increase in youth crime .
at the same time , growing awareness has led the public and schools to report more crimes to the authorities .
" there is no empirical data showing there are actually more youths committing violent crimes or that the crimes have become qualitatively worse , " michael walter , director of the cologne university institute for criminology , told public broadcaster wdr .

the move is strongly opposed by european soccer officials and top clubs . in an interview with the bbc on friday , oct .
5 , blatter said soccer clubs should have no more than five non-nationals on the pitch at any time even if it contravenes eu labor rules . blatter said he wanted to cap the number of non-nationals in a team 's starting 11 at just five per match from 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa boss blatter says too many foreign players is not good for the development of soccer " this is a matter of principle and we need to protect the national identity of the football clubs , " blatter said , adding it would increase opportunities for homegrown players . " footballers more artists than workers " soccer clubs in the eu currently have a limit of three players from outside the 27-member bloc , but have had no restrictions on players from within the eu since 1995 . " when you have 11 foreigners in a team , this is not good for the development of football .
football has never had the courage to go against this practice , but it must now , " blatter said . blatter wants sport to be given an exemption from eu rules under the bloc 's new reform treaty due to agreed upon by eu governments this month . " you can not consider a footballer like any normal worker because you need 11 to play a match - and they are more artists than workers , " blatter said . " it does not matter where you are born " blatter 's plans have met with stiff resistance from european officials and top clubs . blatter 's uefa or european counterpart , michel platini said fifa needed to accept the plan could not work in the european union due to laws which allow free movement of labor . " the philosophy is fantastic but legally it is difficult , " platini told reuters . " i can understand fifa because they have 208 national associations and then there are 29 -lrb- eu members -rrb- who are all in our confederation . " the g14 which represents 18 of europe 's top clubs such as real madrid , manchester united and ac milan have also voiced their resistance to blatter 's plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arsenal manager wenger has rubbished plans to cap the number of foreign players arsenal manager arsene wenger said blatter 's proposals were not in the interests of clubs competing in the english premier league .
speaking at a news conference , wenger said : " i am against it .
sport is competitive and competition is based on merit .
it does not matter where you are born .
it matters who you are . "
fifa could face another " bosman " blatter 's plan could also run into trouble with eu authorities as was the case in 1995 .

4 , convicted three young men of the sexual assault , torture and murder of a fellow inmate last year at a juvenile detention center . a 17-year-old received a sentence of 10 years in prison , the highest possible as he was tried as a minor .
the others , a 20-year-old and a 21-year-old , received 15 years and 14 years respectively . the sentences are harsh considering that german courts can apply laws intended for minors to anyone under the age of 21 .
it 's estimated that some 60 percent of cases involving offenders between 18 and 21 are settled in juvenile courts , even when the crimes are of a violent nature . " the more serious an offense , the more likely it is to be tried in a juvenile court , " said bernd-rüdeger sonnen of the german association for juvenile court and juvenile offenders , which advocates the rights of young offenders .
more options for juvenile court judges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : community service is often part of juvenile 's sentences allowing defendants under 21 to be tried and sentenced according to juvenile law lowers the chances of repeat offenders by providing judges with more leeway in issuing appropriate sentences , he said .
" in general law you have fines , probation and jail sentences , " sonnen said .
" in juvenile law there is a much wider palette of options . "
while juvenile court judges can sentence offenders to a maximum of 10 years in jail , they can also order social training and aggression management courses and meetings with victims where offenders are forced to see the effects of their crimes and take responsibility for their actions .
these types of alternative treatments have proven to be more effective in keeping young offenders from relapsing , sonnen said .
more than 50 percent of offenders dealt with in this manner stay away from crime contrasted with over 70 percent of young people placed in correctional facilities being arrested again .
critics want tougher sentences but not everyone is convinced that treating all offenders below the age of 21 as minors is the right tack . some conservative politicians in germany are in favor of raising the maximum sentence from 10 to 15 years for offenders between 18 and 20 years of age .
the southern german state of bavaria has been pressing for a change in laws since 1998 but has failed to get the backing of the federal parliament .
this week , beate merk , bavaria 's justice minister and a member of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- renewed criticism that cases such as the juvenile prison torture and murder showed that young offenders were also guilty of serious crimes which were n't sufficiently punished with a ten-year prison sentence .
offenders between 18 and 20 who are convicted according to juvenile law should thus get a tougher maximum sentence , merk said .
harsh punishments ineffective but demanding that youth offenders receive punishments on par with those of adults misses the point of having a youth court , according to sonnen . the german juvenile court system focuses more on preventing new crimes , rather then punishing ones already committed , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping juveniles ' doors locked longer is seldom beneficial , research showed " it 's not about harsher or milder punishments , " he said .
" it 's about effectiveness , which leads to fewer victims . "
research published earlier this year by klaus boers and jost reinecke of münster and bielefeld universities , respectively , reached a similar conclusion .
" deterrents , intimidation or simply harsh punishments seldom work and are usually counterproductive , " their study concluded . it was based on interviews with 1,900 students from 2000 to 2003 . though difficult to measure since most crimes committed by juveniles are of a bagatelle nature and go unreported , youth crime rates have been dropping since the end of the 1990s , the study said .
no rise in juvenile delinquency ?
the results run contrary to official statistics released by german police , which show an increase in assault and other violent crime .
experts say that a heightened sensibility in the media is partly responsible for the perceived increase in youth crime .
at the same time , growing awareness has led the public and schools to report more crimes to the authorities .
" there is no empirical data showing there are actually more youths committing violent crimes or that the crimes have become qualitatively worse , " michael walter , director of the cologne university institute for criminology , told public broadcaster wdr .

german researchers have developed a prototype for a driverless railcab .
the mini-trains could revolutionize how we travel , if they can get funding . every mode of transportation has its disadvantages .
cars crowd the streets , pollute the air and are hard to park .
trains fill up during rush hour and often have inconvenient schedules .
and airplanes are n't practical for short trips around town . some researchers are promoting railcabs as the vehicle of the future .
these driverless , computer-controlled cars take passengers and cargo directly to their destinations without stops or transfers .
they can travel in convoys to save energy and then peel off from each other as each car heads to a separate destination . small version already been developed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on-the-track tinkering under development for a decade , researchers at the university of paderborn have a prototype of the railcab .
a test track has been built near paderborn , a city in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia .
since 2003 , slightly smaller-than-life railcabs have run on a 600-meter test track near the university . researchers have declared the prototype a success and say they 're ready to test their revolutionary trains under real-life conditions .
the engines , chassis and rail technology are ready for production . " these are not toys , " professor joachim lückel , who started the project , told the associated press . more money needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lückel wants some government support however , a full-sized prototype has not been tested as yet .
that is expensive , lückel said , adding that 11 million euros have already been invested in this project and an additional 20 million euros are needed to build a full-sized prototype . the cars would travel on normal rails , but would use a so-called linear motor , which needs little maintenance .
they would use magnetic fields to accelerate , similar to the transrapid train , but would otherwise run on tracks . adapting tracks to fit the railcab would cost 800,000 euros per kilometer .
new tracks would cost 3.5 million euros per kilometer .
that 's a lot of money , but much less than it costs to build new high-speed train tracks , lückel said . additionally , turnouts would need to be added so that railcabs could leave convoys .
but the entire system would still need to be compatible with trains . the railcab would revolutionize transportation of both people and cargo , lückel believes , making it much more efficient .
the enormous flexibility of a railcab system would make the costs worth it , lückel said . not everyone is a fan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not exactly a simple system but not all experts share lückel 's enthusiasm . " converting tracks is more expensive than building a second regular track , " said edmund mühlhans , an emeritus professor and rail expert at the technical university in darmstadt . also , stretches of track exist which run at capacity and do n't have additional space to accommodate railcabs .
if railcabs had to detour around these tracks , they would not be as efficient , mühlhans said . mühlhans also envisions technical problems .
linear motors are noticeably less efficient than conventional locomotives .
the large number or railcabs that would be needed would mean more inspections , maintenance and repair , he said . " despite all the advantages that the inventors have always predicted , cab trains have never made it past the pilot project stage , " said mühlhans . lückel said the time has come for the project to move forward .
if it does n't happen soon , lückel worries that his specialized researchers could get disillusioned with the project and go to work in private industry . " we need government support , " lückel said . a few wealthy customers from the middle east have apparently made discreet inquiries .

german researchers have developed a prototype for a driverless railcab .
the mini-trains could revolutionize how we travel , if they can get funding . every mode of transportation has its disadvantages .
cars crowd the streets , pollute the air and are hard to park .
trains fill up during rush hour and often have inconvenient schedules .
and airplanes are n't practical for short trips around town . some researchers are promoting railcabs as the vehicle of the future .
these driverless , computer-controlled cars take passengers and cargo directly to their destinations without stops or transfers .
they can travel in convoys to save energy and then peel off from each other as each car heads to a separate destination . small version already been developed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on-the-track tinkering under development for a decade , researchers at the university of paderborn have a prototype of the railcab .
a test track has been built near paderborn , a city in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia .
since 2003 , slightly smaller-than-life railcabs have run on a 600-meter test track near the university . researchers have declared the prototype a success and say they 're ready to test their revolutionary trains under real-life conditions .
the engines , chassis and rail technology are ready for production . " these are not toys , " professor joachim lückel , who started the project , told the associated press . more money needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lückel wants some government support however , a full-sized prototype has not been tested as yet .
that is expensive , lückel said , adding that 11 million euros have already been invested in this project and an additional 20 million euros are needed to build a full-sized prototype . the cars would travel on normal rails , but would use a so-called linear motor , which needs little maintenance .
they would use magnetic fields to accelerate , similar to the transrapid train , but would otherwise run on tracks . adapting tracks to fit the railcab would cost 800,000 euros per kilometer .
new tracks would cost 3.5 million euros per kilometer .
that 's a lot of money , but much less than it costs to build new high-speed train tracks , lückel said . additionally , turnouts would need to be added so that railcabs could leave convoys .
but the entire system would still need to be compatible with trains . the railcab would revolutionize transportation of both people and cargo , lückel believes , making it much more efficient .
the enormous flexibility of a railcab system would make the costs worth it , lückel said . not everyone is a fan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not exactly a simple system but not all experts share lückel 's enthusiasm . " converting tracks is more expensive than building a second regular track , " said edmund mühlhans , an emeritus professor and rail expert at the technical university in darmstadt . also , stretches of track exist which run at capacity and do n't have additional space to accommodate railcabs .
if railcabs had to detour around these tracks , they would not be as efficient , mühlhans said . mühlhans also envisions technical problems .
linear motors are noticeably less efficient than conventional locomotives .
the large number or railcabs that would be needed would mean more inspections , maintenance and repair , he said . " despite all the advantages that the inventors have always predicted , cab trains have never made it past the pilot project stage , " said mühlhans . lückel said the time has come for the project to move forward .
if it does n't happen soon , lückel worries that his specialized researchers could get disillusioned with the project and go to work in private industry . " we need government support , " lückel said . a few wealthy customers from the middle east have apparently made discreet inquiries .

4 , convicted three young men of the sexual assault , torture and murder of a fellow inmate last year at a juvenile detention center . a 17-year-old received a sentence of 10 years in prison , the highest possible as he was tried as a minor .
the others , a 20-year-old and a 21-year-old , received 15 years and 14 years respectively . the sentences are harsh considering that german courts can apply laws intended for minors to anyone under the age of 21 .
it 's estimated that some 60 percent of cases involving offenders between 18 and 21 are settled in juvenile courts , even when the crimes are of a violent nature . " the more serious an offense , the more likely it is to be tried in a juvenile court , " said bernd-rüdeger sonnen of the german association for juvenile court and juvenile offenders , which advocates the rights of young offenders .
more options for juvenile court judges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : community service is often part of juvenile 's sentences allowing defendants under 21 to be tried and sentenced according to juvenile law lowers the chances of repeat offenders by providing judges with more leeway in issuing appropriate sentences , he said .
" in general law you have fines , probation and jail sentences , " sonnen said .
" in juvenile law there is a much wider palette of options . "
while juvenile court judges can sentence offenders to a maximum of 10 years in jail , they can also order social training and aggression management courses and meetings with victims where offenders are forced to see the effects of their crimes and take responsibility for their actions .
these types of alternative treatments have proven to be more effective in keeping young offenders from relapsing , sonnen said .
more than 50 percent of offenders dealt with in this manner stay away from crime contrasted with over 70 percent of young people placed in correctional facilities being arrested again .
critics want tougher sentences but not everyone is convinced that treating all offenders below the age of 21 as minors is the right tack . some conservative politicians in germany are in favor of raising the maximum sentence from 10 to 15 years for offenders between 18 and 20 years of age .
the southern german state of bavaria has been pressing for a change in laws since 1998 but has failed to get the backing of the federal parliament .
this week , beate merk , bavaria 's justice minister and a member of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- renewed criticism that cases such as the juvenile prison torture and murder showed that young offenders were also guilty of serious crimes which were n't sufficiently punished with a ten-year prison sentence .
offenders between 18 and 20 who are convicted according to juvenile law should thus get a tougher maximum sentence , merk said .
harsh punishments ineffective but demanding that youth offenders receive punishments on par with those of adults misses the point of having a youth court , according to sonnen . the german juvenile court system focuses more on preventing new crimes , rather then punishing ones already committed , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping juveniles ' doors locked longer is seldom beneficial , research showed " it 's not about harsher or milder punishments , " he said .
" it 's about effectiveness , which leads to fewer victims . "
research published earlier this year by klaus boers and jost reinecke of münster and bielefeld universities , respectively , reached a similar conclusion .
" deterrents , intimidation or simply harsh punishments seldom work and are usually counterproductive , " their study concluded . it was based on interviews with 1,900 students from 2000 to 2003 . though difficult to measure since most crimes committed by juveniles are of a bagatelle nature and go unreported , youth crime rates have been dropping since the end of the 1990s , the study said .
no rise in juvenile delinquency ?
the results run contrary to official statistics released by german police , which show an increase in assault and other violent crime .
experts say that a heightened sensibility in the media is partly responsible for the perceived increase in youth crime .
at the same time , growing awareness has led the public and schools to report more crimes to the authorities .
" there is no empirical data showing there are actually more youths committing violent crimes or that the crimes have become qualitatively worse , " michael walter , director of the cologne university institute for criminology , told public broadcaster wdr .

german researchers have developed a prototype for a driverless railcab .

cars crowd the streets , pollute the air and are hard to park .
trains fill up during rush hour and often have inconvenient schedules .

a test track has been built near paderborn , a city in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia .
since 2003 , slightly smaller-than-life railcabs have run on a 600-meter test track near the university . researchers have declared the prototype a success and say they 're ready to test their revolutionary trains under real-life conditions .

that is expensive , lückel said , adding that 11 million euros have already been invested in this project and an additional 20 million euros are needed to build a full-sized prototype . the cars would travel on normal rails , but would use a so-called linear motor , which needs little maintenance .

4 , convicted three young men of the sexual assault , torture and murder of a fellow inmate last year at a juvenile detention center . a 17-year-old received a sentence of 10 years in prison , the highest possible as he was tried as a minor .
the others , a 20-year-old and a 21-year-old , received 15 years and 14 years respectively . the sentences are harsh considering that german courts can apply laws intended for minors to anyone under the age of 21 .
it 's estimated that some 60 percent of cases involving offenders between 18 and 21 are settled in juvenile courts , even when the crimes are of a violent nature . " the more serious an offense , the more likely it is to be tried in a juvenile court , " said bernd-rüdeger sonnen of the german association for juvenile court and juvenile offenders , which advocates the rights of young offenders .
more options for juvenile court judges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : community service is often part of juvenile 's sentences allowing defendants under 21 to be tried and sentenced according to juvenile law lowers the chances of repeat offenders by providing judges with more leeway in issuing appropriate sentences , he said .
" in general law you have fines , probation and jail sentences , " sonnen said .
" in juvenile law there is a much wider palette of options . "
while juvenile court judges can sentence offenders to a maximum of 10 years in jail , they can also order social training and aggression management courses and meetings with victims where offenders are forced to see the effects of their crimes and take responsibility for their actions .
these types of alternative treatments have proven to be more effective in keeping young offenders from relapsing , sonnen said .
more than 50 percent of offenders dealt with in this manner stay away from crime contrasted with over 70 percent of young people placed in correctional facilities being arrested again .
critics want tougher sentences but not everyone is convinced that treating all offenders below the age of 21 as minors is the right tack . some conservative politicians in germany are in favor of raising the maximum sentence from 10 to 15 years for offenders between 18 and 20 years of age .
the southern german state of bavaria has been pressing for a change in laws since 1998 but has failed to get the backing of the federal parliament .
this week , beate merk , bavaria 's justice minister and a member of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- renewed criticism that cases such as the juvenile prison torture and murder showed that young offenders were also guilty of serious crimes which were n't sufficiently punished with a ten-year prison sentence .
offenders between 18 and 20 who are convicted according to juvenile law should thus get a tougher maximum sentence , merk said .
harsh punishments ineffective but demanding that youth offenders receive punishments on par with those of adults misses the point of having a youth court , according to sonnen . the german juvenile court system focuses more on preventing new crimes , rather then punishing ones already committed , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping juveniles ' doors locked longer is seldom beneficial , research showed " it 's not about harsher or milder punishments , " he said .
" it 's about effectiveness , which leads to fewer victims . "
research published earlier this year by klaus boers and jost reinecke of münster and bielefeld universities , respectively , reached a similar conclusion .
" deterrents , intimidation or simply harsh punishments seldom work and are usually counterproductive , " their study concluded . it was based on interviews with 1,900 students from 2000 to 2003 . though difficult to measure since most crimes committed by juveniles are of a bagatelle nature and go unreported , youth crime rates have been dropping since the end of the 1990s , the study said .
no rise in juvenile delinquency ?
the results run contrary to official statistics released by german police , which show an increase in assault and other violent crime .
experts say that a heightened sensibility in the media is partly responsible for the perceived increase in youth crime .
at the same time , growing awareness has led the public and schools to report more crimes to the authorities .
" there is no empirical data showing there are actually more youths committing violent crimes or that the crimes have become qualitatively worse , " michael walter , director of the cologne university institute for criminology , told public broadcaster wdr .

german researchers have developed a prototype for a driverless railcab .
the mini-trains could revolutionize how we travel , if they can get funding . every mode of transportation has its disadvantages .
cars crowd the streets , pollute the air and are hard to park .
trains fill up during rush hour and often have inconvenient schedules .
and airplanes are n't practical for short trips around town . some researchers are promoting railcabs as the vehicle of the future .
these driverless , computer-controlled cars take passengers and cargo directly to their destinations without stops or transfers .
they can travel in convoys to save energy and then peel off from each other as each car heads to a separate destination . small version already been developed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on-the-track tinkering under development for a decade , researchers at the university of paderborn have a prototype of the railcab .
a test track has been built near paderborn , a city in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia .
since 2003 , slightly smaller-than-life railcabs have run on a 600-meter test track near the university . researchers have declared the prototype a success and say they 're ready to test their revolutionary trains under real-life conditions .
the engines , chassis and rail technology are ready for production . " these are not toys , " professor joachim lückel , who started the project , told the associated press . more money needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lückel wants some government support however , a full-sized prototype has not been tested as yet .
that is expensive , lückel said , adding that 11 million euros have already been invested in this project and an additional 20 million euros are needed to build a full-sized prototype . the cars would travel on normal rails , but would use a so-called linear motor , which needs little maintenance .
they would use magnetic fields to accelerate , similar to the transrapid train , but would otherwise run on tracks . adapting tracks to fit the railcab would cost 800,000 euros per kilometer .
new tracks would cost 3.5 million euros per kilometer .
that 's a lot of money , but much less than it costs to build new high-speed train tracks , lückel said . additionally , turnouts would need to be added so that railcabs could leave convoys .
but the entire system would still need to be compatible with trains . the railcab would revolutionize transportation of both people and cargo , lückel believes , making it much more efficient .
the enormous flexibility of a railcab system would make the costs worth it , lückel said . not everyone is a fan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not exactly a simple system but not all experts share lückel 's enthusiasm . " converting tracks is more expensive than building a second regular track , " said edmund mühlhans , an emeritus professor and rail expert at the technical university in darmstadt . also , stretches of track exist which run at capacity and do n't have additional space to accommodate railcabs .
if railcabs had to detour around these tracks , they would not be as efficient , mühlhans said . mühlhans also envisions technical problems .
linear motors are noticeably less efficient than conventional locomotives .
the large number or railcabs that would be needed would mean more inspections , maintenance and repair , he said . " despite all the advantages that the inventors have always predicted , cab trains have never made it past the pilot project stage , " said mühlhans . lückel said the time has come for the project to move forward .
if it does n't happen soon , lückel worries that his specialized researchers could get disillusioned with the project and go to work in private industry . " we need government support , " lückel said . a few wealthy customers from the middle east have apparently made discreet inquiries .

a test track has been built near paderborn , a city in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia .
since 2003 , slightly smaller-than-life railcabs have run on a 600-meter test track near the university . researchers have declared the prototype a success and say they 're ready to test their revolutionary trains under real-life conditions .
the engines , chassis and rail technology are ready for production . " these are not toys , " professor joachim lückel , who started the project , told the associated press . more money needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lückel wants some government support however , a full-sized prototype has not been tested as yet .
that is expensive , lückel said , adding that 11 million euros have already been invested in this project and an additional 20 million euros are needed to build a full-sized prototype . the cars would travel on normal rails , but would use a so-called linear motor , which needs little maintenance .
they would use magnetic fields to accelerate , similar to the transrapid train , but would otherwise run on tracks . adapting tracks to fit the railcab would cost 800,000 euros per kilometer .
new tracks would cost 3.5 million euros per kilometer .
that 's a lot of money , but much less than it costs to build new high-speed train tracks , lückel said . additionally , turnouts would need to be added so that railcabs could leave convoys .
but the entire system would still need to be compatible with trains . the railcab would revolutionize transportation of both people and cargo , lückel believes , making it much more efficient .

" converting tracks is more expensive than building a second regular track , " said edmund mühlhans , an emeritus professor and rail expert at the technical university in darmstadt . also , stretches of track exist which run at capacity and do n't have additional space to accommodate railcabs .
if railcabs had to detour around these tracks , they would not be as efficient , mühlhans said . mühlhans also envisions technical problems .
linear motors are noticeably less efficient than conventional locomotives .
the large number or railcabs that would be needed would mean more inspections , maintenance and repair , he said . " despite all the advantages that the inventors have always predicted , cab trains have never made it past the pilot project stage , " said mühlhans . lückel said the time has come for the project to move forward .
if it does n't happen soon , lückel worries that his specialized researchers could get disillusioned with the project and go to work in private industry . " we need government support , " lückel said . a few wealthy customers from the middle east have apparently made discreet inquiries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders crime -pipe- 06.10.2007 in germany , focus on preventing not punishing youth crime großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juvenile courts can do more than sentence offenders to time behind bars german courts largely sentence defendants under the age of 21 according to juvenile law in a bid to help them reintegrate into society and mete out punishments that fit the crime as well as the offender . in a case that caused shockwaves in germany , a court on thursday , oct .
4 , convicted three young men of the sexual assault , torture and murder of a fellow inmate last year at a juvenile detention center . a 17-year-old received a sentence of 10 years in prison , the highest possible as he was tried as a minor .
the others , a 20-year-old and a 21-year-old , received 15 years and 14 years respectively . the sentences are harsh considering that german courts can apply laws intended for minors to anyone under the age of 21 .
it 's estimated that some 60 percent of cases involving offenders between 18 and 21 are settled in juvenile courts , even when the crimes are of a violent nature . " the more serious an offense , the more likely it is to be tried in a juvenile court , " said bernd-rüdeger sonnen of the german association for juvenile court and juvenile offenders , which advocates the rights of young offenders .
more options for juvenile court judges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : community service is often part of juvenile 's sentences allowing defendants under 21 to be tried and sentenced according to juvenile law lowers the chances of repeat offenders by providing judges with more leeway in issuing appropriate sentences , he said .
" in general law you have fines , probation and jail sentences , " sonnen said .
" in juvenile law there is a much wider palette of options . "
while juvenile court judges can sentence offenders to a maximum of 10 years in jail , they can also order social training and aggression management courses and meetings with victims where offenders are forced to see the effects of their crimes and take responsibility for their actions .
these types of alternative treatments have proven to be more effective in keeping young offenders from relapsing , sonnen said .
more than 50 percent of offenders dealt with in this manner stay away from crime contrasted with over 70 percent of young people placed in correctional facilities being arrested again .
critics want tougher sentences but not everyone is convinced that treating all offenders below the age of 21 as minors is the right tack . some conservative politicians in germany are in favor of raising the maximum sentence from 10 to 15 years for offenders between 18 and 20 years of age .
the southern german state of bavaria has been pressing for a change in laws since 1998 but has failed to get the backing of the federal parliament .
this week , beate merk , bavaria 's justice minister and a member of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- renewed criticism that cases such as the juvenile prison torture and murder showed that young offenders were also guilty of serious crimes which were n't sufficiently punished with a ten-year prison sentence .
offenders between 18 and 20 who are convicted according to juvenile law should thus get a tougher maximum sentence , merk said .
harsh punishments ineffective but demanding that youth offenders receive punishments on par with those of adults misses the point of having a youth court , according to sonnen . the german juvenile court system focuses more on preventing new crimes , rather then punishing ones already committed , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping juveniles ' doors locked longer is seldom beneficial , research showed " it 's not about harsher or milder punishments , " he said .
" it 's about effectiveness , which leads to fewer victims . "
research published earlier this year by klaus boers and jost reinecke of münster and bielefeld universities , respectively , reached a similar conclusion .
" deterrents , intimidation or simply harsh punishments seldom work and are usually counterproductive , " their study concluded . it was based on interviews with 1,900 students from 2000 to 2003 . though difficult to measure since most crimes committed by juveniles are of a bagatelle nature and go unreported , youth crime rates have been dropping since the end of the 1990s , the study said .
no rise in juvenile delinquency ?
the results run contrary to official statistics released by german police , which show an increase in assault and other violent crime .
experts say that a heightened sensibility in the media is partly responsible for the perceived increase in youth crime .
at the same time , growing awareness has led the public and schools to report more crimes to the authorities .
" there is no empirical data showing there are actually more youths committing violent crimes or that the crimes have become qualitatively worse , " michael walter , director of the cologne university institute for criminology , told public broadcaster wdr .
" the information available contradicts police data . " sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" these are not toys , " professor joachim lückel , who started the project , told the associated press . more money needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lückel wants some government support however , a full-sized prototype has not been tested as yet .
that is expensive , lückel said , adding that 11 million euros have already been invested in this project and an additional 20 million euros are needed to build a full-sized prototype . the cars would travel on normal rails , but would use a so-called linear motor , which needs little maintenance .
they would use magnetic fields to accelerate , similar to the transrapid train , but would otherwise run on tracks . adapting tracks to fit the railcab would cost 800,000 euros per kilometer .
new tracks would cost 3.5 million euros per kilometer .
that 's a lot of money , but much less than it costs to build new high-speed train tracks , lückel said . additionally , turnouts would need to be added so that railcabs could leave convoys .
but the entire system would still need to be compatible with trains . the railcab would revolutionize transportation of both people and cargo , lückel believes , making it much more efficient .
the enormous flexibility of a railcab system would make the costs worth it , lückel said . not everyone is a fan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not exactly a simple system but not all experts share lückel 's enthusiasm . " converting tracks is more expensive than building a second regular track , " said edmund mühlhans , an emeritus professor and rail expert at the technical university in darmstadt . also , stretches of track exist which run at capacity and do n't have additional space to accommodate railcabs .
if railcabs had to detour around these tracks , they would not be as efficient , mühlhans said . mühlhans also envisions technical problems .
linear motors are noticeably less efficient than conventional locomotives .
the large number or railcabs that would be needed would mean more inspections , maintenance and repair , he said . " despite all the advantages that the inventors have always predicted , cab trains have never made it past the pilot project stage , " said mühlhans . lückel said the time has come for the project to move forward .
if it does n't happen soon , lückel worries that his specialized researchers could get disillusioned with the project and go to work in private industry . " we need government support , " lückel said . a few wealthy customers from the middle east have apparently made discreet inquiries .

4 , convicted three young men of the sexual assault , torture and murder of a fellow inmate last year at a juvenile detention center . a 17-year-old received a sentence of 10 years in prison , the highest possible as he was tried as a minor .
the others , a 20-year-old and a 21-year-old , received 15 years and 14 years respectively . the sentences are harsh considering that german courts can apply laws intended for minors to anyone under the age of 21 .
it 's estimated that some 60 percent of cases involving offenders between 18 and 21 are settled in juvenile courts , even when the crimes are of a violent nature . " the more serious an offense , the more likely it is to be tried in a juvenile court , " said bernd-rüdeger sonnen of the german association for juvenile court and juvenile offenders , which advocates the rights of young offenders .
more options for juvenile court judges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : community service is often part of juvenile 's sentences allowing defendants under 21 to be tried and sentenced according to juvenile law lowers the chances of repeat offenders by providing judges with more leeway in issuing appropriate sentences , he said .
" in general law you have fines , probation and jail sentences , " sonnen said .
" in juvenile law there is a much wider palette of options . "
while juvenile court judges can sentence offenders to a maximum of 10 years in jail , they can also order social training and aggression management courses and meetings with victims where offenders are forced to see the effects of their crimes and take responsibility for their actions .
these types of alternative treatments have proven to be more effective in keeping young offenders from relapsing , sonnen said .
more than 50 percent of offenders dealt with in this manner stay away from crime contrasted with over 70 percent of young people placed in correctional facilities being arrested again .
critics want tougher sentences but not everyone is convinced that treating all offenders below the age of 21 as minors is the right tack . some conservative politicians in germany are in favor of raising the maximum sentence from 10 to 15 years for offenders between 18 and 20 years of age .
the southern german state of bavaria has been pressing for a change in laws since 1998 but has failed to get the backing of the federal parliament .
this week , beate merk , bavaria 's justice minister and a member of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- renewed criticism that cases such as the juvenile prison torture and murder showed that young offenders were also guilty of serious crimes which were n't sufficiently punished with a ten-year prison sentence .
offenders between 18 and 20 who are convicted according to juvenile law should thus get a tougher maximum sentence , merk said .
harsh punishments ineffective but demanding that youth offenders receive punishments on par with those of adults misses the point of having a youth court , according to sonnen . the german juvenile court system focuses more on preventing new crimes , rather then punishing ones already committed , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping juveniles ' doors locked longer is seldom beneficial , research showed " it 's not about harsher or milder punishments , " he said .
" it 's about effectiveness , which leads to fewer victims . "
research published earlier this year by klaus boers and jost reinecke of münster and bielefeld universities , respectively , reached a similar conclusion .
" deterrents , intimidation or simply harsh punishments seldom work and are usually counterproductive , " their study concluded . it was based on interviews with 1,900 students from 2000 to 2003 . though difficult to measure since most crimes committed by juveniles are of a bagatelle nature and go unreported , youth crime rates have been dropping since the end of the 1990s , the study said .
no rise in juvenile delinquency ?
the results run contrary to official statistics released by german police , which show an increase in assault and other violent crime .
experts say that a heightened sensibility in the media is partly responsible for the perceived increase in youth crime .
at the same time , growing awareness has led the public and schools to report more crimes to the authorities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 06.10.2007 driverless mini-trains could be the next big thing on tracks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " these are n't toys " - professor lückel with prototypes of railcabs taking a train can mean long waits , crowded cars and multiple transfers .
german researchers have developed a prototype for a driverless railcab .
the mini-trains could revolutionize how we travel , if they can get funding . every mode of transportation has its disadvantages .
cars crowd the streets , pollute the air and are hard to park .
trains fill up during rush hour and often have inconvenient schedules .
and airplanes are n't practical for short trips around town . some researchers are promoting railcabs as the vehicle of the future .
these driverless , computer-controlled cars take passengers and cargo directly to their destinations without stops or transfers .
they can travel in convoys to save energy and then peel off from each other as each car heads to a separate destination . small version already been developed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on-the-track tinkering under development for a decade , researchers at the university of paderborn have a prototype of the railcab .
a test track has been built near paderborn , a city in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia .
since 2003 , slightly smaller-than-life railcabs have run on a 600-meter test track near the university . researchers have declared the prototype a success and say they 're ready to test their revolutionary trains under real-life conditions .
the engines , chassis and rail technology are ready for production . " these are not toys , " professor joachim lückel , who started the project , told the associated press . more money needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lückel wants some government support however , a full-sized prototype has not been tested as yet .
that is expensive , lückel said , adding that 11 million euros have already been invested in this project and an additional 20 million euros are needed to build a full-sized prototype . the cars would travel on normal rails , but would use a so-called linear motor , which needs little maintenance .
they would use magnetic fields to accelerate , similar to the transrapid train , but would otherwise run on tracks . adapting tracks to fit the railcab would cost 800,000 euros per kilometer .
new tracks would cost 3.5 million euros per kilometer .
that 's a lot of money , but much less than it costs to build new high-speed train tracks , lückel said . additionally , turnouts would need to be added so that railcabs could leave convoys .
but the entire system would still need to be compatible with trains . the railcab would revolutionize transportation of both people and cargo , lückel believes , making it much more efficient .
the enormous flexibility of a railcab system would make the costs worth it , lückel said . not everyone is a fan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not exactly a simple system but not all experts share lückel 's enthusiasm . " converting tracks is more expensive than building a second regular track , " said edmund mühlhans , an emeritus professor and rail expert at the technical university in darmstadt . also , stretches of track exist which run at capacity and do n't have additional space to accommodate railcabs .
if railcabs had to detour around these tracks , they would not be as efficient , mühlhans said . mühlhans also envisions technical problems .
linear motors are noticeably less efficient than conventional locomotives .
the large number or railcabs that would be needed would mean more inspections , maintenance and repair , he said . " despite all the advantages that the inventors have always predicted , cab trains have never made it past the pilot project stage , " said mühlhans . lückel said the time has come for the project to move forward .
if it does n't happen soon , lückel worries that his specialized researchers could get disillusioned with the project and go to work in private industry . " we need government support , " lückel said . a few wealthy customers from the middle east have apparently made discreet inquiries .
but for now , the project is spinning its wheels . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german researchers have developed a prototype for a driverless railcab .
the mini-trains could revolutionize how we travel , if they can get funding . every mode of transportation has its disadvantages .
cars crowd the streets , pollute the air and are hard to park .
trains fill up during rush hour and often have inconvenient schedules .
and airplanes are n't practical for short trips around town . some researchers are promoting railcabs as the vehicle of the future .
these driverless , computer-controlled cars take passengers and cargo directly to their destinations without stops or transfers .
they can travel in convoys to save energy and then peel off from each other as each car heads to a separate destination . small version already been developed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on-the-track tinkering under development for a decade , researchers at the university of paderborn have a prototype of the railcab .
a test track has been built near paderborn , a city in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia .
since 2003 , slightly smaller-than-life railcabs have run on a 600-meter test track near the university . researchers have declared the prototype a success and say they 're ready to test their revolutionary trains under real-life conditions .
the engines , chassis and rail technology are ready for production . " these are not toys , " professor joachim lückel , who started the project , told the associated press . more money needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lückel wants some government support however , a full-sized prototype has not been tested as yet .
that is expensive , lückel said , adding that 11 million euros have already been invested in this project and an additional 20 million euros are needed to build a full-sized prototype . the cars would travel on normal rails , but would use a so-called linear motor , which needs little maintenance .
they would use magnetic fields to accelerate , similar to the transrapid train , but would otherwise run on tracks . adapting tracks to fit the railcab would cost 800,000 euros per kilometer .
new tracks would cost 3.5 million euros per kilometer .
that 's a lot of money , but much less than it costs to build new high-speed train tracks , lückel said . additionally , turnouts would need to be added so that railcabs could leave convoys .
but the entire system would still need to be compatible with trains . the railcab would revolutionize transportation of both people and cargo , lückel believes , making it much more efficient .
the enormous flexibility of a railcab system would make the costs worth it , lückel said . not everyone is a fan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not exactly a simple system but not all experts share lückel 's enthusiasm . " converting tracks is more expensive than building a second regular track , " said edmund mühlhans , an emeritus professor and rail expert at the technical university in darmstadt . also , stretches of track exist which run at capacity and do n't have additional space to accommodate railcabs .
if railcabs had to detour around these tracks , they would not be as efficient , mühlhans said . mühlhans also envisions technical problems .
linear motors are noticeably less efficient than conventional locomotives .
the large number or railcabs that would be needed would mean more inspections , maintenance and repair , he said . " despite all the advantages that the inventors have always predicted , cab trains have never made it past the pilot project stage , " said mühlhans . lückel said the time has come for the project to move forward .
if it does n't happen soon , lückel worries that his specialized researchers could get disillusioned with the project and go to work in private industry . " we need government support , " lückel said . a few wealthy customers from the middle east have apparently made discreet inquiries .

" labels for some products imported into the eu and urged the united states to work with europe to avoid further safety recalls and restore consumer confidence . kuneva , supported by italy 's international trade minister emma bonino , said this week that a " made in ... " label system was " essential for the traceability " of imported goods , and added that " the ball is in the member states ' court . " the european union at present has no joint position on marks of origin , which exist in some member states . in 2005 the european commission presented a proposal to introduce such a system for some imports , as is done in japan , china and the united states .
that plan , targeted especially at clothes , shoes and jewelry , has remained paralyzed due to opposition from countries including britain and germany . bonino recognized that sufficient support was not there yet , with opponents apparently concerned at " the bureaucratic obstacles and the costs , " involved .
" but it seems to work well in the united states and japan , " she said , adding that a " made in … " label would bring the eu up to the level of its main trading partners . parliamentarians call for stronger ce mark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva leads the calls for stronger quality marks european parliamentarians are expected to urge the european commission to give more credibility to the european " ce " standard mark and to reinforce market surveillance with sanctions available for those who break the rules .
parliamentarians are also calling call for the consideration of a new security label for the consumer .
at present many consumers believe the ce logo assures that the product has been rigorously tested by european authorities , whereas in fact it is just a self-declaration of market worthiness by the manufacturer , or a type of publicity , said laura degallaix from beuc , the european consumers ' organization .
according to beuc , experts have been examining possible revisions to the rules on toy safety for over two years , including beefing up controls on those toys deemed to pose special risks .
two weeks ago , european industry commissioner günter verheugen said that the proposals for boosting toy safety will be presented in december .
" i would like to see the mandatory certification of certain types of toys , " he said .
verheugen remained vague on exactly which items would be subject to tests , though he did say toys containing cancer-causing agents would be targeted .
toxic paint and magnets cause most concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polly pockets were said to have been coated in lead paint of particular interest in these examinations have been the chemicals contained in such things as hand paints and makeup , and small magnets that children could detach and possibly swallow .
these were the main concerns in the scandal that broke in august over standards in toys from china .
kuneva summed up the concerns , as the key christmas period approaches .
" there is no room for complacency , not on safety , " she said .
" not where children particularly are concerned . " she also called on the us to join with the eu in sharing more information about china 's monitoring of toy manufacturing in an attempt to avoid the sort of scandal and product recalls that affected us toy manufacturer mattel over the summer . " i would like to encourage our american partners to open the information flow , " kuneva said , adding that she would press for greater us-european cooperation on toy safety during her visit to washington at the end of this week . mattel recall leads to discussions on international standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattel eventually apologised for its own design flaws mattel recalled more than 18 million chinese-made toys worldwide in july and august because they contained the potentially deadly small magnets and were colored with paints containing dangerously high amounts of lead . mattel later apologized to beijing , acknowledging that most of the recalls of chinese-made toys were due to design flaws made by the company itself .

" labels for some products imported into the eu and urged the united states to work with europe to avoid further safety recalls and restore consumer confidence . kuneva , supported by italy 's international trade minister emma bonino , said this week that a " made in ... " label system was " essential for the traceability " of imported goods , and added that " the ball is in the member states ' court . " the european union at present has no joint position on marks of origin , which exist in some member states . in 2005 the european commission presented a proposal to introduce such a system for some imports , as is done in japan , china and the united states .
that plan , targeted especially at clothes , shoes and jewelry , has remained paralyzed due to opposition from countries including britain and germany . bonino recognized that sufficient support was not there yet , with opponents apparently concerned at " the bureaucratic obstacles and the costs , " involved .
" but it seems to work well in the united states and japan , " she said , adding that a " made in … " label would bring the eu up to the level of its main trading partners . parliamentarians call for stronger ce mark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva leads the calls for stronger quality marks european parliamentarians are expected to urge the european commission to give more credibility to the european " ce " standard mark and to reinforce market surveillance with sanctions available for those who break the rules .
parliamentarians are also calling call for the consideration of a new security label for the consumer .
at present many consumers believe the ce logo assures that the product has been rigorously tested by european authorities , whereas in fact it is just a self-declaration of market worthiness by the manufacturer , or a type of publicity , said laura degallaix from beuc , the european consumers ' organization .
according to beuc , experts have been examining possible revisions to the rules on toy safety for over two years , including beefing up controls on those toys deemed to pose special risks .
two weeks ago , european industry commissioner günter verheugen said that the proposals for boosting toy safety will be presented in december .
" i would like to see the mandatory certification of certain types of toys , " he said .
verheugen remained vague on exactly which items would be subject to tests , though he did say toys containing cancer-causing agents would be targeted .
toxic paint and magnets cause most concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polly pockets were said to have been coated in lead paint of particular interest in these examinations have been the chemicals contained in such things as hand paints and makeup , and small magnets that children could detach and possibly swallow .
these were the main concerns in the scandal that broke in august over standards in toys from china .
kuneva summed up the concerns , as the key christmas period approaches .
" there is no room for complacency , not on safety , " she said .
" not where children particularly are concerned . " she also called on the us to join with the eu in sharing more information about china 's monitoring of toy manufacturing in an attempt to avoid the sort of scandal and product recalls that affected us toy manufacturer mattel over the summer . " i would like to encourage our american partners to open the information flow , " kuneva said , adding that she would press for greater us-european cooperation on toy safety during her visit to washington at the end of this week . mattel recall leads to discussions on international standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattel eventually apologised for its own design flaws mattel recalled more than 18 million chinese-made toys worldwide in july and august because they contained the potentially deadly small magnets and were colored with paints containing dangerously high amounts of lead . mattel later apologized to beijing , acknowledging that most of the recalls of chinese-made toys were due to design flaws made by the company itself . " the apology , though delayed , should help dispel the suspicion american customers harbor against chinese-made products and clean up the stain the recalls left on the innocent chinese workers who make a living doing honest labor , " the official english-language china daily newspaper reported last week . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" labels for some products imported into the eu and urged the united states to work with europe to avoid further safety recalls and restore consumer confidence . kuneva , supported by italy 's international trade minister emma bonino , said this week that a " made in ... " label system was " essential for the traceability " of imported goods , and added that " the ball is in the member states ' court . " the european union at present has no joint position on marks of origin , which exist in some member states . in 2005 the european commission presented a proposal to introduce such a system for some imports , as is done in japan , china and the united states .
that plan , targeted especially at clothes , shoes and jewelry , has remained paralyzed due to opposition from countries including britain and germany . bonino recognized that sufficient support was not there yet , with opponents apparently concerned at " the bureaucratic obstacles and the costs , " involved .
" but it seems to work well in the united states and japan , " she said , adding that a " made in … " label would bring the eu up to the level of its main trading partners . parliamentarians call for stronger ce mark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva leads the calls for stronger quality marks european parliamentarians are expected to urge the european commission to give more credibility to the european " ce " standard mark and to reinforce market surveillance with sanctions available for those who break the rules .
parliamentarians are also calling call for the consideration of a new security label for the consumer .
at present many consumers believe the ce logo assures that the product has been rigorously tested by european authorities , whereas in fact it is just a self-declaration of market worthiness by the manufacturer , or a type of publicity , said laura degallaix from beuc , the european consumers ' organization .
according to beuc , experts have been examining possible revisions to the rules on toy safety for over two years , including beefing up controls on those toys deemed to pose special risks .
two weeks ago , european industry commissioner günter verheugen said that the proposals for boosting toy safety will be presented in december .
" i would like to see the mandatory certification of certain types of toys , " he said .
verheugen remained vague on exactly which items would be subject to tests , though he did say toys containing cancer-causing agents would be targeted .
toxic paint and magnets cause most concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polly pockets were said to have been coated in lead paint of particular interest in these examinations have been the chemicals contained in such things as hand paints and makeup , and small magnets that children could detach and possibly swallow .
these were the main concerns in the scandal that broke in august over standards in toys from china .
kuneva summed up the concerns , as the key christmas period approaches .
" there is no room for complacency , not on safety , " she said .
" not where children particularly are concerned .

" labels for some products imported into the eu and urged the united states to work with europe to avoid further safety recalls and restore consumer confidence . kuneva , supported by italy 's international trade minister emma bonino , said this week that a " made in ... " label system was " essential for the traceability " of imported goods , and added that " the ball is in the member states ' court . " the european union at present has no joint position on marks of origin , which exist in some member states . in 2005 the european commission presented a proposal to introduce such a system for some imports , as is done in japan , china and the united states .
that plan , targeted especially at clothes , shoes and jewelry , has remained paralyzed due to opposition from countries including britain and germany . bonino recognized that sufficient support was not there yet , with opponents apparently concerned at " the bureaucratic obstacles and the costs , " involved .
" but it seems to work well in the united states and japan , " she said , adding that a " made in … " label would bring the eu up to the level of its main trading partners . parliamentarians call for stronger ce mark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva leads the calls for stronger quality marks european parliamentarians are expected to urge the european commission to give more credibility to the european " ce " standard mark and to reinforce market surveillance with sanctions available for those who break the rules .
parliamentarians are also calling call for the consideration of a new security label for the consumer .
at present many consumers believe the ce logo assures that the product has been rigorously tested by european authorities , whereas in fact it is just a self-declaration of market worthiness by the manufacturer , or a type of publicity , said laura degallaix from beuc , the european consumers ' organization .
according to beuc , experts have been examining possible revisions to the rules on toy safety for over two years , including beefing up controls on those toys deemed to pose special risks .
two weeks ago , european industry commissioner günter verheugen said that the proposals for boosting toy safety will be presented in december .
" i would like to see the mandatory certification of certain types of toys , " he said .
verheugen remained vague on exactly which items would be subject to tests , though he did say toys containing cancer-causing agents would be targeted .
toxic paint and magnets cause most concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polly pockets were said to have been coated in lead paint of particular interest in these examinations have been the chemicals contained in such things as hand paints and makeup , and small magnets that children could detach and possibly swallow .
these were the main concerns in the scandal that broke in august over standards in toys from china .
kuneva summed up the concerns , as the key christmas period approaches .
" there is no room for complacency , not on safety , " she said .
" not where children particularly are concerned . " she also called on the us to join with the eu in sharing more information about china 's monitoring of toy manufacturing in an attempt to avoid the sort of scandal and product recalls that affected us toy manufacturer mattel over the summer . " i would like to encourage our american partners to open the information flow , " kuneva said , adding that she would press for greater us-european cooperation on toy safety during her visit to washington at the end of this week . mattel recall leads to discussions on international standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattel eventually apologised for its own design flaws mattel recalled more than 18 million chinese-made toys worldwide in july and august because they contained the potentially deadly small magnets and were colored with paints containing dangerously high amounts of lead . mattel later apologized to beijing , acknowledging that most of the recalls of chinese-made toys were due to design flaws made by the company itself . " the apology , though delayed , should help dispel the suspicion american customers harbor against chinese-made products and clean up the stain the recalls left on the innocent chinese workers who make a living doing honest labor , " the official english-language china daily newspaper reported last week . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" labels for some products imported into the eu and urged the united states to work with europe to avoid further safety recalls and restore consumer confidence . kuneva , supported by italy 's international trade minister emma bonino , said this week that a " made in ... " label system was " essential for the traceability " of imported goods , and added that " the ball is in the member states ' court . " the european union at present has no joint position on marks of origin , which exist in some member states . in 2005 the european commission presented a proposal to introduce such a system for some imports , as is done in japan , china and the united states .
that plan , targeted especially at clothes , shoes and jewelry , has remained paralyzed due to opposition from countries including britain and germany . bonino recognized that sufficient support was not there yet , with opponents apparently concerned at " the bureaucratic obstacles and the costs , " involved .
" but it seems to work well in the united states and japan , " she said , adding that a " made in … " label would bring the eu up to the level of its main trading partners . parliamentarians call for stronger ce mark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva leads the calls for stronger quality marks european parliamentarians are expected to urge the european commission to give more credibility to the european " ce " standard mark and to reinforce market surveillance with sanctions available for those who break the rules .
parliamentarians are also calling call for the consideration of a new security label for the consumer .
at present many consumers believe the ce logo assures that the product has been rigorously tested by european authorities , whereas in fact it is just a self-declaration of market worthiness by the manufacturer , or a type of publicity , said laura degallaix from beuc , the european consumers ' organization .
according to beuc , experts have been examining possible revisions to the rules on toy safety for over two years , including beefing up controls on those toys deemed to pose special risks .
two weeks ago , european industry commissioner günter verheugen said that the proposals for boosting toy safety will be presented in december .
" i would like to see the mandatory certification of certain types of toys , " he said .
verheugen remained vague on exactly which items would be subject to tests , though he did say toys containing cancer-causing agents would be targeted .
toxic paint and magnets cause most concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polly pockets were said to have been coated in lead paint of particular interest in these examinations have been the chemicals contained in such things as hand paints and makeup , and small magnets that children could detach and possibly swallow .
these were the main concerns in the scandal that broke in august over standards in toys from china .
kuneva summed up the concerns , as the key christmas period approaches .
" there is no room for complacency , not on safety , " she said .
" not where children particularly are concerned . " she also called on the us to join with the eu in sharing more information about china 's monitoring of toy manufacturing in an attempt to avoid the sort of scandal and product recalls that affected us toy manufacturer mattel over the summer . " i would like to encourage our american partners to open the information flow , " kuneva said , adding that she would press for greater us-european cooperation on toy safety during her visit to washington at the end of this week . mattel recall leads to discussions on international standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattel eventually apologised for its own design flaws mattel recalled more than 18 million chinese-made toys worldwide in july and august because they contained the potentially deadly small magnets and were colored with paints containing dangerously high amounts of lead . mattel later apologized to beijing , acknowledging that most of the recalls of chinese-made toys were due to design flaws made by the company itself .

" labels for some products imported into the eu and urged the united states to work with europe to avoid further safety recalls and restore consumer confidence . kuneva , supported by italy 's international trade minister emma bonino , said this week that a " made in ... " label system was " essential for the traceability " of imported goods , and added that " the ball is in the member states ' court . " the european union at present has no joint position on marks of origin , which exist in some member states . in 2005 the european commission presented a proposal to introduce such a system for some imports , as is done in japan , china and the united states .
that plan , targeted especially at clothes , shoes and jewelry , has remained paralyzed due to opposition from countries including britain and germany . bonino recognized that sufficient support was not there yet , with opponents apparently concerned at " the bureaucratic obstacles and the costs , " involved .
" but it seems to work well in the united states and japan , " she said , adding that a " made in … " label would bring the eu up to the level of its main trading partners . parliamentarians call for stronger ce mark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva leads the calls for stronger quality marks european parliamentarians are expected to urge the european commission to give more credibility to the european " ce " standard mark and to reinforce market surveillance with sanctions available for those who break the rules .
parliamentarians are also calling call for the consideration of a new security label for the consumer .
at present many consumers believe the ce logo assures that the product has been rigorously tested by european authorities , whereas in fact it is just a self-declaration of market worthiness by the manufacturer , or a type of publicity , said laura degallaix from beuc , the european consumers ' organization .
according to beuc , experts have been examining possible revisions to the rules on toy safety for over two years , including beefing up controls on those toys deemed to pose special risks .
two weeks ago , european industry commissioner günter verheugen said that the proposals for boosting toy safety will be presented in december .
" i would like to see the mandatory certification of certain types of toys , " he said .
verheugen remained vague on exactly which items would be subject to tests , though he did say toys containing cancer-causing agents would be targeted .
toxic paint and magnets cause most concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polly pockets were said to have been coated in lead paint of particular interest in these examinations have been the chemicals contained in such things as hand paints and makeup , and small magnets that children could detach and possibly swallow .
these were the main concerns in the scandal that broke in august over standards in toys from china .
kuneva summed up the concerns , as the key christmas period approaches .
" there is no room for complacency , not on safety , " she said .
" not where children particularly are concerned . " she also called on the us to join with the eu in sharing more information about china 's monitoring of toy manufacturing in an attempt to avoid the sort of scandal and product recalls that affected us toy manufacturer mattel over the summer . " i would like to encourage our american partners to open the information flow , " kuneva said , adding that she would press for greater us-european cooperation on toy safety during her visit to washington at the end of this week . mattel recall leads to discussions on international standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattel eventually apologised for its own design flaws mattel recalled more than 18 million chinese-made toys worldwide in july and august because they contained the potentially deadly small magnets and were colored with paints containing dangerously high amounts of lead . mattel later apologized to beijing , acknowledging that most of the recalls of chinese-made toys were due to design flaws made by the company itself . " the apology , though delayed , should help dispel the suspicion american customers harbor against chinese-made products and clean up the stain the recalls left on the innocent chinese workers who make a living doing honest labor , " the official english-language china daily newspaper reported last week . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at present many consumers believe the ce logo assures that the product has been rigorously tested by european authorities , whereas in fact it is just a self-declaration of market worthiness by the manufacturer , or a type of publicity , said laura degallaix from beuc , the european consumers ' organization .
according to beuc , experts have been examining possible revisions to the rules on toy safety for over two years , including beefing up controls on those toys deemed to pose special risks .
two weeks ago , european industry commissioner günter verheugen said that the proposals for boosting toy safety will be presented in december .
" i would like to see the mandatory certification of certain types of toys , " he said .
verheugen remained vague on exactly which items would be subject to tests , though he did say toys containing cancer-causing agents would be targeted .
toxic paint and magnets cause most concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polly pockets were said to have been coated in lead paint of particular interest in these examinations have been the chemicals contained in such things as hand paints and makeup , and small magnets that children could detach and possibly swallow .
these were the main concerns in the scandal that broke in august over standards in toys from china .
kuneva summed up the concerns , as the key christmas period approaches .
" there is no room for complacency , not on safety , " she said .
" not where children particularly are concerned . " she also called on the us to join with the eu in sharing more information about china 's monitoring of toy manufacturing in an attempt to avoid the sort of scandal and product recalls that affected us toy manufacturer mattel over the summer . " i would like to encourage our american partners to open the information flow , " kuneva said , adding that she would press for greater us-european cooperation on toy safety during her visit to washington at the end of this week . mattel recall leads to discussions on international standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattel eventually apologised for its own design flaws mattel recalled more than 18 million chinese-made toys worldwide in july and august because they contained the potentially deadly small magnets and were colored with paints containing dangerously high amounts of lead . mattel later apologized to beijing , acknowledging that most of the recalls of chinese-made toys were due to design flaws made by the company itself . " the apology , though delayed , should help dispel the suspicion american customers harbor against chinese-made products and clean up the stain the recalls left on the innocent chinese workers who make a living doing honest labor , " the official english-language china daily newspaper reported last week . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move is strongly opposed by european soccer officials and top clubs . in an interview with the bbc on friday , oct .
5 , blatter said soccer clubs should have no more than five non-nationals on the pitch at any time even if it contravenes eu labor rules . blatter said he wanted to cap the number of non-nationals in a team 's starting 11 at just five per match from 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa boss blatter says too many foreign players is not good for the development of soccer " this is a matter of principle and we need to protect the national identity of the football clubs , " blatter said , adding it would increase opportunities for homegrown players . " footballers more artists than workers " soccer clubs in the eu currently have a limit of three players from outside the 27-member bloc , but have had no restrictions on players from within the eu since 1995 . " when you have 11 foreigners in a team , this is not good for the development of football .
football has never had the courage to go against this practice , but it must now , " blatter said . blatter wants sport to be given an exemption from eu rules under the bloc 's new reform treaty due to agreed upon by eu governments this month . " you can not consider a footballer like any normal worker because you need 11 to play a match - and they are more artists than workers , " blatter said . " it does not matter where you are born " blatter 's plans have met with stiff resistance from european officials and top clubs . blatter 's uefa or european counterpart , michel platini said fifa needed to accept the plan could not work in the european union due to laws which allow free movement of labor . " the philosophy is fantastic but legally it is difficult , " platini told reuters . " i can understand fifa because they have 208 national associations and then there are 29 -lrb- eu members -rrb- who are all in our confederation . " the g14 which represents 18 of europe 's top clubs such as real madrid , manchester united and ac milan have also voiced their resistance to blatter 's plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arsenal manager wenger has rubbished plans to cap the number of foreign players arsenal manager arsene wenger said blatter 's proposals were not in the interests of clubs competing in the english premier league .
speaking at a news conference , wenger said : " i am against it .
sport is competitive and competition is based on merit .
it does not matter where you are born .
it matters who you are . "
fifa could face another " bosman " blatter 's plan could also run into trouble with eu authorities as was the case in 1995 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack currently plays for english premier league club chelsea then , the european court of justice -lrb- ecj -rrb- , europe 's highest court , gave all sports professionals within the eu more freedom to change clubs in a decision known as the " bosman ruling " - named after belgian player jean-marc bosman .
the court concluded that such restrictions discriminated against nationals of eu states .
the eu is also examining uefa 's " homegrown rule , " which began in 2006 , and according to which each team involved in european club competition must have a minimum of eight locally-trained players . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

4 , convicted three young men of the sexual assault , torture and murder of a fellow inmate last year at a juvenile detention center . a 17-year-old received a sentence of 10 years in prison , the highest possible as he was tried as a minor .
the others , a 20-year-old and a 21-year-old , received 15 years and 14 years respectively . the sentences are harsh considering that german courts can apply laws intended for minors to anyone under the age of 21 .
it 's estimated that some 60 percent of cases involving offenders between 18 and 21 are settled in juvenile courts , even when the crimes are of a violent nature . " the more serious an offense , the more likely it is to be tried in a juvenile court , " said bernd-rüdeger sonnen of the german association for juvenile court and juvenile offenders , which advocates the rights of young offenders .
more options for juvenile court judges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : community service is often part of juvenile 's sentences allowing defendants under 21 to be tried and sentenced according to juvenile law lowers the chances of repeat offenders by providing judges with more leeway in issuing appropriate sentences , he said .
" in general law you have fines , probation and jail sentences , " sonnen said .
" in juvenile law there is a much wider palette of options . "
while juvenile court judges can sentence offenders to a maximum of 10 years in jail , they can also order social training and aggression management courses and meetings with victims where offenders are forced to see the effects of their crimes and take responsibility for their actions .
these types of alternative treatments have proven to be more effective in keeping young offenders from relapsing , sonnen said .
more than 50 percent of offenders dealt with in this manner stay away from crime contrasted with over 70 percent of young people placed in correctional facilities being arrested again .
critics want tougher sentences but not everyone is convinced that treating all offenders below the age of 21 as minors is the right tack . some conservative politicians in germany are in favor of raising the maximum sentence from 10 to 15 years for offenders between 18 and 20 years of age .
the southern german state of bavaria has been pressing for a change in laws since 1998 but has failed to get the backing of the federal parliament .
this week , beate merk , bavaria 's justice minister and a member of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- renewed criticism that cases such as the juvenile prison torture and murder showed that young offenders were also guilty of serious crimes which were n't sufficiently punished with a ten-year prison sentence .
offenders between 18 and 20 who are convicted according to juvenile law should thus get a tougher maximum sentence , merk said .
harsh punishments ineffective but demanding that youth offenders receive punishments on par with those of adults misses the point of having a youth court , according to sonnen . the german juvenile court system focuses more on preventing new crimes , rather then punishing ones already committed , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping juveniles ' doors locked longer is seldom beneficial , research showed " it 's not about harsher or milder punishments , " he said .
" it 's about effectiveness , which leads to fewer victims . "
research published earlier this year by klaus boers and jost reinecke of münster and bielefeld universities , respectively , reached a similar conclusion .
" deterrents , intimidation or simply harsh punishments seldom work and are usually counterproductive , " their study concluded . it was based on interviews with 1,900 students from 2000 to 2003 . though difficult to measure since most crimes committed by juveniles are of a bagatelle nature and go unreported , youth crime rates have been dropping since the end of the 1990s , the study said .
no rise in juvenile delinquency ?
the results run contrary to official statistics released by german police , which show an increase in assault and other violent crime .
experts say that a heightened sensibility in the media is partly responsible for the perceived increase in youth crime .
at the same time , growing awareness has led the public and schools to report more crimes to the authorities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 06.10.2007 driverless mini-trains could be the next big thing on tracks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " these are n't toys " - professor lückel with prototypes of railcabs taking a train can mean long waits , crowded cars and multiple transfers .
german researchers have developed a prototype for a driverless railcab .
the mini-trains could revolutionize how we travel , if they can get funding . every mode of transportation has its disadvantages .
cars crowd the streets , pollute the air and are hard to park .
trains fill up during rush hour and often have inconvenient schedules .
and airplanes are n't practical for short trips around town . some researchers are promoting railcabs as the vehicle of the future .
these driverless , computer-controlled cars take passengers and cargo directly to their destinations without stops or transfers .
they can travel in convoys to save energy and then peel off from each other as each car heads to a separate destination . small version already been developed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on-the-track tinkering under development for a decade , researchers at the university of paderborn have a prototype of the railcab .
a test track has been built near paderborn , a city in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia .
since 2003 , slightly smaller-than-life railcabs have run on a 600-meter test track near the university . researchers have declared the prototype a success and say they 're ready to test their revolutionary trains under real-life conditions .
the engines , chassis and rail technology are ready for production . " these are not toys , " professor joachim lückel , who started the project , told the associated press . more money needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lückel wants some government support however , a full-sized prototype has not been tested as yet .
that is expensive , lückel said , adding that 11 million euros have already been invested in this project and an additional 20 million euros are needed to build a full-sized prototype . the cars would travel on normal rails , but would use a so-called linear motor , which needs little maintenance .
they would use magnetic fields to accelerate , similar to the transrapid train , but would otherwise run on tracks . adapting tracks to fit the railcab would cost 800,000 euros per kilometer .
new tracks would cost 3.5 million euros per kilometer .
that 's a lot of money , but much less than it costs to build new high-speed train tracks , lückel said . additionally , turnouts would need to be added so that railcabs could leave convoys .
but the entire system would still need to be compatible with trains . the railcab would revolutionize transportation of both people and cargo , lückel believes , making it much more efficient .
the enormous flexibility of a railcab system would make the costs worth it , lückel said . not everyone is a fan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not exactly a simple system but not all experts share lückel 's enthusiasm . " converting tracks is more expensive than building a second regular track , " said edmund mühlhans , an emeritus professor and rail expert at the technical university in darmstadt . also , stretches of track exist which run at capacity and do n't have additional space to accommodate railcabs .
if railcabs had to detour around these tracks , they would not be as efficient , mühlhans said . mühlhans also envisions technical problems .

german researchers have developed a prototype for a driverless railcab .
the mini-trains could revolutionize how we travel , if they can get funding . every mode of transportation has its disadvantages .
cars crowd the streets , pollute the air and are hard to park .
trains fill up during rush hour and often have inconvenient schedules .
and airplanes are n't practical for short trips around town . some researchers are promoting railcabs as the vehicle of the future .
these driverless , computer-controlled cars take passengers and cargo directly to their destinations without stops or transfers .
they can travel in convoys to save energy and then peel off from each other as each car heads to a separate destination . small version already been developed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on-the-track tinkering under development for a decade , researchers at the university of paderborn have a prototype of the railcab .
a test track has been built near paderborn , a city in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia .
since 2003 , slightly smaller-than-life railcabs have run on a 600-meter test track near the university . researchers have declared the prototype a success and say they 're ready to test their revolutionary trains under real-life conditions .
the engines , chassis and rail technology are ready for production . " these are not toys , " professor joachim lückel , who started the project , told the associated press . more money needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lückel wants some government support however , a full-sized prototype has not been tested as yet .
that is expensive , lückel said , adding that 11 million euros have already been invested in this project and an additional 20 million euros are needed to build a full-sized prototype . the cars would travel on normal rails , but would use a so-called linear motor , which needs little maintenance .
they would use magnetic fields to accelerate , similar to the transrapid train , but would otherwise run on tracks . adapting tracks to fit the railcab would cost 800,000 euros per kilometer .
new tracks would cost 3.5 million euros per kilometer .
that 's a lot of money , but much less than it costs to build new high-speed train tracks , lückel said . additionally , turnouts would need to be added so that railcabs could leave convoys .
but the entire system would still need to be compatible with trains . the railcab would revolutionize transportation of both people and cargo , lückel believes , making it much more efficient .
the enormous flexibility of a railcab system would make the costs worth it , lückel said . not everyone is a fan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not exactly a simple system but not all experts share lückel 's enthusiasm . " converting tracks is more expensive than building a second regular track , " said edmund mühlhans , an emeritus professor and rail expert at the technical university in darmstadt . also , stretches of track exist which run at capacity and do n't have additional space to accommodate railcabs .
if railcabs had to detour around these tracks , they would not be as efficient , mühlhans said . mühlhans also envisions technical problems .
linear motors are noticeably less efficient than conventional locomotives .
the large number or railcabs that would be needed would mean more inspections , maintenance and repair , he said . " despite all the advantages that the inventors have always predicted , cab trains have never made it past the pilot project stage , " said mühlhans . lückel said the time has come for the project to move forward .

4 , convicted three young men of the sexual assault , torture and murder of a fellow inmate last year at a juvenile detention center . a 17-year-old received a sentence of 10 years in prison , the highest possible as he was tried as a minor .
the others , a 20-year-old and a 21-year-old , received 15 years and 14 years respectively . the sentences are harsh considering that german courts can apply laws intended for minors to anyone under the age of 21 .
it 's estimated that some 60 percent of cases involving offenders between 18 and 21 are settled in juvenile courts , even when the crimes are of a violent nature . " the more serious an offense , the more likely it is to be tried in a juvenile court , " said bernd-rüdeger sonnen of the german association for juvenile court and juvenile offenders , which advocates the rights of young offenders .
more options for juvenile court judges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : community service is often part of juvenile 's sentences allowing defendants under 21 to be tried and sentenced according to juvenile law lowers the chances of repeat offenders by providing judges with more leeway in issuing appropriate sentences , he said .
" in general law you have fines , probation and jail sentences , " sonnen said .
" in juvenile law there is a much wider palette of options . "
while juvenile court judges can sentence offenders to a maximum of 10 years in jail , they can also order social training and aggression management courses and meetings with victims where offenders are forced to see the effects of their crimes and take responsibility for their actions .
these types of alternative treatments have proven to be more effective in keeping young offenders from relapsing , sonnen said .
more than 50 percent of offenders dealt with in this manner stay away from crime contrasted with over 70 percent of young people placed in correctional facilities being arrested again .
critics want tougher sentences but not everyone is convinced that treating all offenders below the age of 21 as minors is the right tack . some conservative politicians in germany are in favor of raising the maximum sentence from 10 to 15 years for offenders between 18 and 20 years of age .
the southern german state of bavaria has been pressing for a change in laws since 1998 but has failed to get the backing of the federal parliament .
this week , beate merk , bavaria 's justice minister and a member of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- renewed criticism that cases such as the juvenile prison torture and murder showed that young offenders were also guilty of serious crimes which were n't sufficiently punished with a ten-year prison sentence .
offenders between 18 and 20 who are convicted according to juvenile law should thus get a tougher maximum sentence , merk said .
harsh punishments ineffective but demanding that youth offenders receive punishments on par with those of adults misses the point of having a youth court , according to sonnen . the german juvenile court system focuses more on preventing new crimes , rather then punishing ones already committed , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping juveniles ' doors locked longer is seldom beneficial , research showed " it 's not about harsher or milder punishments , " he said .
" it 's about effectiveness , which leads to fewer victims . "
research published earlier this year by klaus boers and jost reinecke of münster and bielefeld universities , respectively , reached a similar conclusion .
" deterrents , intimidation or simply harsh punishments seldom work and are usually counterproductive , " their study concluded . it was based on interviews with 1,900 students from 2000 to 2003 . though difficult to measure since most crimes committed by juveniles are of a bagatelle nature and go unreported , youth crime rates have been dropping since the end of the 1990s , the study said .
no rise in juvenile delinquency ?
the results run contrary to official statistics released by german police , which show an increase in assault and other violent crime .
experts say that a heightened sensibility in the media is partly responsible for the perceived increase in youth crime .
at the same time , growing awareness has led the public and schools to report more crimes to the authorities .
" there is no empirical data showing there are actually more youths committing violent crimes or that the crimes have become qualitatively worse , " michael walter , director of the cologne university institute for criminology , told public broadcaster wdr .

the move is strongly opposed by european soccer officials and top clubs . in an interview with the bbc on friday , oct .
5 , blatter said soccer clubs should have no more than five non-nationals on the pitch at any time even if it contravenes eu labor rules . blatter said he wanted to cap the number of non-nationals in a team 's starting 11 at just five per match from 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa boss blatter says too many foreign players is not good for the development of soccer " this is a matter of principle and we need to protect the national identity of the football clubs , " blatter said , adding it would increase opportunities for homegrown players . " footballers more artists than workers " soccer clubs in the eu currently have a limit of three players from outside the 27-member bloc , but have had no restrictions on players from within the eu since 1995 . " when you have 11 foreigners in a team , this is not good for the development of football .
football has never had the courage to go against this practice , but it must now , " blatter said . blatter wants sport to be given an exemption from eu rules under the bloc 's new reform treaty due to agreed upon by eu governments this month . " you can not consider a footballer like any normal worker because you need 11 to play a match - and they are more artists than workers , " blatter said . " it does not matter where you are born " blatter 's plans have met with stiff resistance from european officials and top clubs . blatter 's uefa or european counterpart , michel platini said fifa needed to accept the plan could not work in the european union due to laws which allow free movement of labor . " the philosophy is fantastic but legally it is difficult , " platini told reuters . " i can understand fifa because they have 208 national associations and then there are 29 -lrb- eu members -rrb- who are all in our confederation . " the g14 which represents 18 of europe 's top clubs such as real madrid , manchester united and ac milan have also voiced their resistance to blatter 's plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arsenal manager wenger has rubbished plans to cap the number of foreign players arsenal manager arsene wenger said blatter 's proposals were not in the interests of clubs competing in the english premier league .
speaking at a news conference , wenger said : " i am against it .
sport is competitive and competition is based on merit .
it does not matter where you are born .
it matters who you are . "
fifa could face another " bosman " blatter 's plan could also run into trouble with eu authorities as was the case in 1995 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack currently plays for english premier league club chelsea then , the european court of justice -lrb- ecj -rrb- , europe 's highest court , gave all sports professionals within the eu more freedom to change clubs in a decision known as the " bosman ruling " - named after belgian player jean-marc bosman .
the court concluded that such restrictions discriminated against nationals of eu states .
the eu is also examining uefa 's " homegrown rule , " which began in 2006 , and according to which each team involved in european club competition must have a minimum of eight locally-trained players . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german researchers have developed a prototype for a driverless railcab .
the mini-trains could revolutionize how we travel , if they can get funding . every mode of transportation has its disadvantages .
cars crowd the streets , pollute the air and are hard to park .
trains fill up during rush hour and often have inconvenient schedules .
and airplanes are n't practical for short trips around town . some researchers are promoting railcabs as the vehicle of the future .
these driverless , computer-controlled cars take passengers and cargo directly to their destinations without stops or transfers .
they can travel in convoys to save energy and then peel off from each other as each car heads to a separate destination . small version already been developed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on-the-track tinkering under development for a decade , researchers at the university of paderborn have a prototype of the railcab .
a test track has been built near paderborn , a city in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia .
since 2003 , slightly smaller-than-life railcabs have run on a 600-meter test track near the university . researchers have declared the prototype a success and say they 're ready to test their revolutionary trains under real-life conditions .
the engines , chassis and rail technology are ready for production . " these are not toys , " professor joachim lückel , who started the project , told the associated press . more money needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lückel wants some government support however , a full-sized prototype has not been tested as yet .
that is expensive , lückel said , adding that 11 million euros have already been invested in this project and an additional 20 million euros are needed to build a full-sized prototype . the cars would travel on normal rails , but would use a so-called linear motor , which needs little maintenance .
they would use magnetic fields to accelerate , similar to the transrapid train , but would otherwise run on tracks . adapting tracks to fit the railcab would cost 800,000 euros per kilometer .
new tracks would cost 3.5 million euros per kilometer .
that 's a lot of money , but much less than it costs to build new high-speed train tracks , lückel said . additionally , turnouts would need to be added so that railcabs could leave convoys .
but the entire system would still need to be compatible with trains . the railcab would revolutionize transportation of both people and cargo , lückel believes , making it much more efficient .
the enormous flexibility of a railcab system would make the costs worth it , lückel said . not everyone is a fan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not exactly a simple system but not all experts share lückel 's enthusiasm . " converting tracks is more expensive than building a second regular track , " said edmund mühlhans , an emeritus professor and rail expert at the technical university in darmstadt . also , stretches of track exist which run at capacity and do n't have additional space to accommodate railcabs .
if railcabs had to detour around these tracks , they would not be as efficient , mühlhans said . mühlhans also envisions technical problems .
linear motors are noticeably less efficient than conventional locomotives .
the large number or railcabs that would be needed would mean more inspections , maintenance and repair , he said . " despite all the advantages that the inventors have always predicted , cab trains have never made it past the pilot project stage , " said mühlhans . lückel said the time has come for the project to move forward .
if it does n't happen soon , lückel worries that his specialized researchers could get disillusioned with the project and go to work in private industry . " we need government support , " lückel said . a few wealthy customers from the middle east have apparently made discreet inquiries .

" labels for some products imported into the eu and urged the united states to work with europe to avoid further safety recalls and restore consumer confidence . kuneva , supported by italy 's international trade minister emma bonino , said this week that a " made in ... " label system was " essential for the traceability " of imported goods , and added that " the ball is in the member states ' court . " the european union at present has no joint position on marks of origin , which exist in some member states . in 2005 the european commission presented a proposal to introduce such a system for some imports , as is done in japan , china and the united states .
that plan , targeted especially at clothes , shoes and jewelry , has remained paralyzed due to opposition from countries including britain and germany . bonino recognized that sufficient support was not there yet , with opponents apparently concerned at " the bureaucratic obstacles and the costs , " involved .
" but it seems to work well in the united states and japan , " she said , adding that a " made in … " label would bring the eu up to the level of its main trading partners . parliamentarians call for stronger ce mark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuneva leads the calls for stronger quality marks european parliamentarians are expected to urge the european commission to give more credibility to the european " ce " standard mark and to reinforce market surveillance with sanctions available for those who break the rules .
parliamentarians are also calling call for the consideration of a new security label for the consumer .
at present many consumers believe the ce logo assures that the product has been rigorously tested by european authorities , whereas in fact it is just a self-declaration of market worthiness by the manufacturer , or a type of publicity , said laura degallaix from beuc , the european consumers ' organization .
according to beuc , experts have been examining possible revisions to the rules on toy safety for over two years , including beefing up controls on those toys deemed to pose special risks .
two weeks ago , european industry commissioner günter verheugen said that the proposals for boosting toy safety will be presented in december .
" i would like to see the mandatory certification of certain types of toys , " he said .
verheugen remained vague on exactly which items would be subject to tests , though he did say toys containing cancer-causing agents would be targeted .
toxic paint and magnets cause most concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polly pockets were said to have been coated in lead paint of particular interest in these examinations have been the chemicals contained in such things as hand paints and makeup , and small magnets that children could detach and possibly swallow .
these were the main concerns in the scandal that broke in august over standards in toys from china .
kuneva summed up the concerns , as the key christmas period approaches .
" there is no room for complacency , not on safety , " she said .
" not where children particularly are concerned . " she also called on the us to join with the eu in sharing more information about china 's monitoring of toy manufacturing in an attempt to avoid the sort of scandal and product recalls that affected us toy manufacturer mattel over the summer . " i would like to encourage our american partners to open the information flow , " kuneva said , adding that she would press for greater us-european cooperation on toy safety during her visit to washington at the end of this week . mattel recall leads to discussions on international standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattel eventually apologised for its own design flaws mattel recalled more than 18 million chinese-made toys worldwide in july and august because they contained the potentially deadly small magnets and were colored with paints containing dangerously high amounts of lead . mattel later apologized to beijing , acknowledging that most of the recalls of chinese-made toys were due to design flaws made by the company itself . " the apology , though delayed , should help dispel the suspicion american customers harbor against chinese-made products and clean up the stain the recalls left on the innocent chinese workers who make a living doing honest labor , " the official english-language china daily newspaper reported last week . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 31-year-old had previously denied using performance-enhancing drugs ahead of the 2000 sydney olympics , where she won five medals - three of them gold .
in court she admitted using a steroid between september 2000 and july 2001 , and lying to a federal inquiry in 2003 .
after leaving court a tearful ms jones said she was retiring from athletics .
" it is with a great amount of shame that i stand before you and tell you that i have betrayed your trust , " ms jones said after friday 's court hearing . "
by november 2003 , i realised he was giving me performance-enhancing drugs " marion jones " because of my actions i am retiring from the sport of track and field , a sport which i deeply love , " she said , admitting she had broken the trust of her fans .
ms jones said she was told by her former coach trevor graham that she was taking flaxseed oil , a nutritional supplement , when it was actually a steroid known as " the clear " .
" by november 2003 , i realised he was giving me performance-enhancing drugs , " she told the judge at court in new york .
she was ordered to return to court on 11 january for sentencing .
ms jones also pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators about a separate cheque fraud case involving her former boyfriend , sprinter tim montgomery .
' i am sorry ' " the clear " is a banned drug linked to the bay area laboratory co-operative -lrb- balco -rrb- , a san francisco-based laboratory at the centre of a steroids scandal in professional sports .
the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- launched an investigation in december 2004 into doping allegations involving ms jones in connection with balco .
606 : debate " its another nail in the coffin of track & field athletics .
i bet for every convicted athlete there are five getting away with it . "
intelligentanalysis the ioc said on friday that it would step up its inquiry and move quickly to strip ms jones of her medals .
the chairman of the us olympic committee , peter ueberroth , urged ms jones to voluntarily return her medals from the sydney olympics , in order to " properly acknowledge the efforts of the vast majority of athletes who choose to compete clean " .
her court appearance comes a day after the washington post reported she had sent letters to family and friends apologising for drug use .
" i want to apologise for all of this , " the post quoted her letter as saying .
" i am sorry for disappointing you all in so many ways . "
the sprinter failed one blood test last year but was cleared of doping when a second test for the blood-booster erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- proved negative .
