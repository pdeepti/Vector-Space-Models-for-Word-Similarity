built in 1904 in the neo-romanesque style , the ryke street synagogue was attacked during the infamous night of violence during which adolf hitler ’ s followers torched jewish homes , businesses and places of worship .
while the synagogue was desecrated , it was not burned down , apparently because the nazis feared causing damage to the surrounding buildings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jewish community see great hope in the reopening now , after a colorful history which also saw it fall under communist rule , the synagogue has been reborn as symbol of the rebirth of the jewish community in the german capital .
ninety-four year-old rabbi leo trepp , who had preached at the synagogue in the 1930s and was one of the rabbis who was seized and deported to the sachsenhausen concentration camp along with many of congregation members , called the reopening a " miracle " .
synagogue 's rebirth " a miracle " trepp was among the guests at the inauguration ceremony in the restored building with political leaders and holocaust survivors from around the world .
" it is a miracle that there are jews in germany again , " trepp told reporters .
" and the synagogue on rykestrasse , which survived two different regimes , is the symbol of that miracle , " he said .
the synagogue 's architects ruth golan and kay zareh used three surviving black-and-white photographs of the original building to recreate its remarkable elegance .
" it is now the most beautiful synagogue in germany , " the cultural affairs director of the berlin 's jewish community , peter sauerbaum , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the synagogue survived some of germany 's most testing times german interior minister wolfgang schäuble and the president of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , also took part in the opening ceremony in central berlin .
the opening coincides with the start of the capital 's annual jewish cultural days , which includes a series of concerts at the newly restored synagogue .
israeli pop star david broza and violinist daniel hope will be among the performers taking part in the 10-day festival , which runs to september 9 .
on sunday , a new cultural center is being formally opened in the western part of berlin for the chabad-lubavitch branch of orthodox jews .
a feature of the center , which cost 5 million euros , is a 30-metre replica of part of the wailing wall in jerusalem , built with stone from around the city .
colorful history under two regimes the reopening of the synagogue marks a remarkable return to grandeur since its last prayer service at the berlin synagogue took place in april 1940 .
after world war ii , it was first used to house jewish survivors of the holocaust in eastern europe before reopening in 1953 and becoming home to the east berlin 's jewish community after the capital was divided .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the synagogue out-lived the nazis and communism over the years after 1967 , the synagogue was gradually renovated , and the most recent works have seen the restoration of the colored-glass interior .
with german unification in 1990 , the synagogue served an influx of jewish immigrants from russia which continues to make germany 's 120,000-strong jewish community one of the fastest-growing in the world .
the synagogue can accommodate some 1,200 worshippers . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

built in 1904 in the neo-romanesque style , the ryke street synagogue was attacked during the infamous night of violence during which adolf hitler ’ s followers torched jewish homes , businesses and places of worship .
while the synagogue was desecrated , it was not burned down , apparently because the nazis feared causing damage to the surrounding buildings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jewish community see great hope in the reopening now , after a colorful history which also saw it fall under communist rule , the synagogue has been reborn as symbol of the rebirth of the jewish community in the german capital .
ninety-four year-old rabbi leo trepp , who had preached at the synagogue in the 1930s and was one of the rabbis who was seized and deported to the sachsenhausen concentration camp along with many of congregation members , called the reopening a " miracle " .
synagogue 's rebirth " a miracle " trepp was among the guests at the inauguration ceremony in the restored building with political leaders and holocaust survivors from around the world .
" it is a miracle that there are jews in germany again , " trepp told reporters .
" and the synagogue on rykestrasse , which survived two different regimes , is the symbol of that miracle , " he said .
the synagogue 's architects ruth golan and kay zareh used three surviving black-and-white photographs of the original building to recreate its remarkable elegance .

built in 1904 in the neo-romanesque style , the ryke street synagogue was attacked during the infamous night of violence during which adolf hitler ’ s followers torched jewish homes , businesses and places of worship .
while the synagogue was desecrated , it was not burned down , apparently because the nazis feared causing damage to the surrounding buildings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jewish community see great hope in the reopening now , after a colorful history which also saw it fall under communist rule , the synagogue has been reborn as symbol of the rebirth of the jewish community in the german capital .
ninety-four year-old rabbi leo trepp , who had preached at the synagogue in the 1930s and was one of the rabbis who was seized and deported to the sachsenhausen concentration camp along with many of congregation members , called the reopening a " miracle " .
synagogue 's rebirth " a miracle " trepp was among the guests at the inauguration ceremony in the restored building with political leaders and holocaust survivors from around the world .
" it is a miracle that there are jews in germany again , " trepp told reporters .
" and the synagogue on rykestrasse , which survived two different regimes , is the symbol of that miracle , " he said .
the synagogue 's architects ruth golan and kay zareh used three surviving black-and-white photographs of the original building to recreate its remarkable elegance .
" it is now the most beautiful synagogue in germany , " the cultural affairs director of the berlin 's jewish community , peter sauerbaum , said .

the law chiefly allows citizens from eu member states to keep their old passport if they take on german nationality . people applying for german citizenship will no longer have to give up their old passports if they come from an eu member state or from switzerland , according to a spokeswoman from the german interior ministry .
even germans who take on citizenship of other eu states or switzerland will no longer lose their nationality .
the changes come about as a result of reforms to the country 's immigration law .
until now , germans who applied for citizenship in other eu nations or in switzerland had to give up their german passport .
they , however , had the chance to apply , for a fee and prior to their citizenship application , to keep their passport .
the new changes to the law mean german citizens no longer need to do that .
according to swiss newspaper , tagesanzeiger , the new rules could be of significance for swiss-german relations .
the paper said switzerland remains the most popular destination for germans to immigrate too .
most new germans unlikely to be affected by law the changes to the immigration law allowing for increased numbers of dual citizenship holders largely went unnoticed in the media when they were made earlier this year .
rather , new regulations making it tougher for spouses of turkish citizens to move to germany prompted much heated debate .
in july this year , the german government said the number of people taking on german citizenship had risen with 124,832 getting german passports in 2006 - an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year .
most new germans , however , are unlikely to be affected by the changes in the country 's immigration law since they are n't from eu states .

organizers are predicting that this year 's event will be more successful than ever . the 6-day trade fair first launched in 1924 , this year reflects the growth of the entire consumer electronic sector and boasts over 1,200 exhibitors from 32 countries .
showcasing the latest products from the entertainment and communications industry , it is expected to attract over 200,000 visitors .
with unique trade visitor services , special events and a comprehensive program for consumers , the trade show has become an annual appointment for both industry experts and the general public .
" in comparison to 2006 , we have managed to set an all-time record -lrb- of members of the press in attendance -rrb- , " said ifa 's ceo christian göke ahead of the opening . " we are especially pleased that this increase in figures is also a national one . "
flat panels a favorite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers love their flat screens within the electronic industry , current sales are dominated by the number one growth motor , television .
experts predict that some 40 million tube televisions will be replaced by flat screens in the new few years , although the boom observed in the wake of the world cup in 2006 did not continue in the first half of 2007 .
meanwhile , the growth in the classic entertainment electronics industry was less notable than in the private communications and information technology sector .
the overall market for consumer electronics grew by 4.9 percent , whereby the largest growth was in the area of private telecommunications and it .
entertainment electronics grew by just 2.6 percent .
" in this instance , we need to bear in mind last year 's world cup effect , " said rainer hecker from the association for entertainment electronics .
" nonetheless , further growth has also been realized here in germany . "
experts hope that ifa will also help reinvigorate the market for the second half of the year .
retailers usually place billions of euros of orders with importers and manufacturers during the event .
this year , electronics industry is expecting a boost in turnover of 2 percent up to 23 billion euros with the new televisions , digital cameras , mp-3 players , navigation systems as well as video games , mobile ' phones and notebooks .
for the time being , it seems that the hike in vat earlier this year has failed to dampen consumer enthusiasm in germany .
economic optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are spending again ifa director jens heithecker points to other factors influencing the market .
" as far as consumers are concerned , " he said , " consumer electronics have never been such good value .
televisions are up to 30 percent cheaper because new models are arriving all the time and competition is very tough . "
in this respect , the increased vat plays an unexpectedly minor role in consumer decisions , while the general upswing in the german economy has triggered a renewed interest in quality products .
while visitor interest is growing at ifa , the actual event is too .
this year , it encompasses some 104,00 square meters of site in berlin - a 10 percent larger surface area than last year 's trade fair .
" these days , we 're more international than ever , " said a spokesman from the association for entertainment electronics .
" it ranges from the international keynotes -lrb- lectures on product developments and industry trends by international top managers of the ce industry -rrb- to the international visitors and of course the global players exhibiting in berlin .

organizers are predicting that this year 's event will be more successful than ever . the 6-day trade fair first launched in 1924 , this year reflects the growth of the entire consumer electronic sector and boasts over 1,200 exhibitors from 32 countries .
showcasing the latest products from the entertainment and communications industry , it is expected to attract over 200,000 visitors .
with unique trade visitor services , special events and a comprehensive program for consumers , the trade show has become an annual appointment for both industry experts and the general public .
" in comparison to 2006 , we have managed to set an all-time record -lrb- of members of the press in attendance -rrb- , " said ifa 's ceo christian göke ahead of the opening . " we are especially pleased that this increase in figures is also a national one . "
flat panels a favorite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers love their flat screens within the electronic industry , current sales are dominated by the number one growth motor , television .
experts predict that some 40 million tube televisions will be replaced by flat screens in the new few years , although the boom observed in the wake of the world cup in 2006 did not continue in the first half of 2007 .
meanwhile , the growth in the classic entertainment electronics industry was less notable than in the private communications and information technology sector .
the overall market for consumer electronics grew by 4.9 percent , whereby the largest growth was in the area of private telecommunications and it .
entertainment electronics grew by just 2.6 percent .
" in this instance , we need to bear in mind last year 's world cup effect , " said rainer hecker from the association for entertainment electronics .
" nonetheless , further growth has also been realized here in germany . "
experts hope that ifa will also help reinvigorate the market for the second half of the year .
retailers usually place billions of euros of orders with importers and manufacturers during the event .
this year , electronics industry is expecting a boost in turnover of 2 percent up to 23 billion euros with the new televisions , digital cameras , mp-3 players , navigation systems as well as video games , mobile ' phones and notebooks .
for the time being , it seems that the hike in vat earlier this year has failed to dampen consumer enthusiasm in germany .
economic optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are spending again ifa director jens heithecker points to other factors influencing the market .
" as far as consumers are concerned , " he said , " consumer electronics have never been such good value .
televisions are up to 30 percent cheaper because new models are arriving all the time and competition is very tough . "
in this respect , the increased vat plays an unexpectedly minor role in consumer decisions , while the general upswing in the german economy has triggered a renewed interest in quality products .
while visitor interest is growing at ifa , the actual event is too .
this year , it encompasses some 104,00 square meters of site in berlin - a 10 percent larger surface area than last year 's trade fair .
" these days , we 're more international than ever , " said a spokesman from the association for entertainment electronics .

youtube has taken videos that promote nazi propaganda off its web site after jewish leaders in germany considered taking legal action . after coming under intense pressure from politicians and jewish groups for featuring far-right propaganda on its file-sharing web site youtube , google germany has agreed to remove the offending videos .
earlier this week , germany 's central council of jews contacted youtube administrators and the german authority for youth protection on the internet to demand that material glorifying nazi ideology be deleted .
a number of politicians called for a legal investigation into the matter .

" this content is illegal and in breach of youtube guidelines . "
" clearly , youtube has a vested interest in removing illegal , inflammatory videos from the platform , " he added .

his aim : to usher in a new era of trans-atlantic cooperation on climate protection . " we can and must steer the trend toward energy policy and ecology , and we hold the key in our hand , " steinmeier said .
stressing that the us and europe are among the most innovative economies in the world , he warned that the entire world faced catastrophic consequences if it fails to act .
" we will experience more flooding , more hurricanes , more heat-related deaths , more drought and ruined crops , more deserts , more refugees , more displacement and destitution , " he said .
during talks with californian governor arnold schwarzenegger in sacramento , the two leaders agreed that germany and california should team up in the fight against global warming .
" contact between german and us companies is an obvious option , " said steinmeier , pointing to the state 's pioneering record on use of renewable energies .

schwarzenegger also agreed to visit germany , explaining that his state was keen to work with germany because of its track record and " gigantic goals " in building alternative energy sources to protect the climate .
steinmeier 's visit is expected to provide an extra boost to schwarzenegger 's environmental agenda , as california prepares to introduce the european system of carbon unit trading - a system so far rejected by president bush .
experts feel that europe 's experience with the system can provide california with a blueprint for possible pitfalls to avoid .
two years ago , schwarzenegger championed legislation to reduce the state 's carbon emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020 .
according to afp news service , his climate action team has identified 40 strategies to reduce global warming , including the carbon-trading program , a million-home solar energy initiative , and plans for a hydrogen highway stretching from british columbia to mexico .
he has ordered the state 's electricity suppliers to produce 20 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2010 and signed environmental agreements with britain , states in australia , canada and mexico and with the us states of arizona , oregon , new mexico , new york , utah and washington .

" a long apparent mistrust within europe towards the us is increasingly replaced by indifference and even skepticism , " he said .
mending this relationship was crucial , steinmeier said in a speech thursday night to the commonwealth club in san francisco , the oldest and largest public affairs forum in the united states .
" in coming decades , in this era of globalization , europe and the us will become more dependent on one another than ever , " he said .
" for this reason i hope we can revive old sympathies , define common issues for the future and rediscover one another . "
calling for " new way of thinking , " he pointed to cooperation on environmental issues but also in business .
" a political regulation of capital and finance markets should also occur , so that stock market crises do not escalate into global economic disasters and speculators are not in a position to push people around the globe into poverty and desperation , " he said .

the meat , which was deemed " unfit " for human consumption , came from a bavarian company and ended up at fast-food stands across eight states after being processed in berlin .
the scandal came to light after a tip-off by a lorry driver to the police .

investigators said that between 140 to 160 tons of tainted meat from bavaria had been supplied since june , 2006 to various food companies in berlin .
until now , authorities were talking of a meat scandal involving around 31 tons of the decayed stuff .
the meat , which was deemed " unfit " for human consumption , came from a bavarian company and ended up at fast-food stands across eight states after being processed in berlin .
the scandal came to light after a tip-off by a lorry driver to the police .
" criminal energy " federal food , agriculture and consumer protection minister horst seehofer said in the bavarian capital of munich that the eu authorities had been informed , as there appeared to be a european dimension to the fraud .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smell okay ?
a researcher sniffs a piece of beef at a laboratory in offenburg the minister called for a rigorous crackdown and stiff punishments for all concerned .
the scandal in bavaria , seehofer 's political base , demonstrated the " criminal energy " being deployed to circumvent consumer protection laws , he said .
there have been calls for meat labeled " unfit " to be sprayed with dye in future to prevent it being relabeled and sold on .
german politicians are demanding action at european union level .
not the first time there have been repeated meat scandals in germany over the years .
in february , tons of spoilt meat was found in a refrigerating plant in the southwestern town of illertissen .
it had come from italy and was destined for france and russia .
last year , a company in the city of passau , near bavaria 's border with austria , was reported to have sold 140 tons of spoilt meat under false labels .
in some cases , sell-by dates had been exceeded by four years .
the country was hit by another major meat scandal in 2005 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

built in 1904 in the neo-romanesque style , the ryke street synagogue was attacked during the infamous night of violence during which adolf hitler ’ s followers torched jewish homes , businesses and places of worship .
while the synagogue was desecrated , it was not burned down , apparently because the nazis feared causing damage to the surrounding buildings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jewish community see great hope in the reopening now , after a colorful history which also saw it fall under communist rule , the synagogue has been reborn as symbol of the rebirth of the jewish community in the german capital .
ninety-four year-old rabbi leo trepp , who had preached at the synagogue in the 1930s and was one of the rabbis who was seized and deported to the sachsenhausen concentration camp along with many of congregation members , called the reopening a " miracle " .
synagogue 's rebirth " a miracle " trepp was among the guests at the inauguration ceremony in the restored building with political leaders and holocaust survivors from around the world .
" it is a miracle that there are jews in germany again , " trepp told reporters .
" and the synagogue on rykestrasse , which survived two different regimes , is the symbol of that miracle , " he said .
the synagogue 's architects ruth golan and kay zareh used three surviving black-and-white photographs of the original building to recreate its remarkable elegance .
" it is now the most beautiful synagogue in germany , " the cultural affairs director of the berlin 's jewish community , peter sauerbaum , said .

the opening coincides with the start of the capital 's annual jewish cultural days , which includes a series of concerts at the newly restored synagogue .
israeli pop star david broza and violinist daniel hope will be among the performers taking part in the 10-day festival , which runs to september 9 .
on sunday , a new cultural center is being formally opened in the western part of berlin for the chabad-lubavitch branch of orthodox jews .
a feature of the center , which cost 5 million euros , is a 30-metre replica of part of the wailing wall in jerusalem , built with stone from around the city .
colorful history under two regimes the reopening of the synagogue marks a remarkable return to grandeur since its last prayer service at the berlin synagogue took place in april 1940 .

colorful history under two regimes the reopening of the synagogue marks a remarkable return to grandeur since its last prayer service at the berlin synagogue took place in april 1940 .
after world war ii , it was first used to house jewish survivors of the holocaust in eastern europe before reopening in 1953 and becoming home to the east berlin 's jewish community after the capital was divided .

deuse told the newspaper that the recent attack in mügeln , in the eastern german state of saxony , was not racially motivated , adding that he was " proud to be german " .

deuse told the newspaper that the recent attack in mügeln , in the eastern german state of saxony , was not racially motivated , adding that he was " proud to be german " .
the free democrat afterwards told the dpa news agency that he had been unaware of the newspaper 's political orientation and that his mention of national pride was in connection with the world cup hosted by germany last year .
" i detest right-wing violence , " he added .
not the first controversial remark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing scene in eastern germany is said to be stronger than in western germany deuse had already come under fire for earlier comments to the press about the incident in which the indians were chased and attacked by a mob .
witnesses said a number had also shouted racist slogans , such as " foreigners out " .
" anyone can come out with such slogans from time to time , " deuse told financial times germany .
initially , he had also denied the perpetrators were from mügeln where he said there was no right-wing scene .
the general secretary of central council of the jews in germany , stephan kramer , said in a television interview for germany 's n24 : " the mayor is the mirror of the society that elected him . "

i 'm not tired of living . "
sebastian edathy -lrb- spd -rrb- , the chairman of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee , also said deuse should consider resigning .
he said that the situation in mügeln was completely different than that portrayed by the mayor of the town .
in mügeln " there had been a pogrom-like atmosphere aimed at fellow citizens of foreign origin , " he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung .
german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- spd -rrb- warned against any attempt to downplay what had gone on .
" looking away and playing things down are precisely the wrong approach , " he told the rheinische post .
the minister , who is responsible for the reconstruction of eastern germany , added ; " citizens and associations have to act courageously against right-wing extremist tendencies . "
minister says problem bigger in eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there has also been a protest in mügeln against the attack tiefensee also said there was a greater problem with right-wing extremism in eastern germany because there was not the same history of dealing with immigration and cultural diversity , but he also said the difficult labor market played a role in radicalizing society .
the free democrats have also distanced themselves from deuse 's comments .
fdp general secretary dirk niebel said acts of violence and xenophobic attitudes should not be relativized .
legal proceedings have been launched against 12 suspects aged between 17 and 35 , who are suspected of fomenting racial hatred and committing grievous bodily harm .

the law chiefly allows citizens from eu member states to keep their old passport if they take on german nationality . people applying for german citizenship will no longer have to give up their old passports if they come from an eu member state or from switzerland , according to a spokeswoman from the german interior ministry .
even germans who take on citizenship of other eu states or switzerland will no longer lose their nationality .
the changes come about as a result of reforms to the country 's immigration law .
until now , germans who applied for citizenship in other eu nations or in switzerland had to give up their german passport .
they , however , had the chance to apply , for a fee and prior to their citizenship application , to keep their passport .
the new changes to the law mean german citizens no longer need to do that .
according to swiss newspaper , tagesanzeiger , the new rules could be of significance for swiss-german relations .
the paper said switzerland remains the most popular destination for germans to immigrate too .
most new germans unlikely to be affected by law the changes to the immigration law allowing for increased numbers of dual citizenship holders largely went unnoticed in the media when they were made earlier this year .
rather , new regulations making it tougher for spouses of turkish citizens to move to germany prompted much heated debate .
in july this year , the german government said the number of people taking on german citizenship had risen with 124,832 getting german passports in 2006 - an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year .
most new germans , however , are unlikely to be affected by the changes in the country 's immigration law since they are n't from eu states .

the law chiefly allows citizens from eu member states to keep their old passport if they take on german nationality . people applying for german citizenship will no longer have to give up their old passports if they come from an eu member state or from switzerland , according to a spokeswoman from the german interior ministry .
even germans who take on citizenship of other eu states or switzerland will no longer lose their nationality .
the changes come about as a result of reforms to the country 's immigration law .
until now , germans who applied for citizenship in other eu nations or in switzerland had to give up their german passport .
they , however , had the chance to apply , for a fee and prior to their citizenship application , to keep their passport .
the new changes to the law mean german citizens no longer need to do that .
according to swiss newspaper , tagesanzeiger , the new rules could be of significance for swiss-german relations .
the paper said switzerland remains the most popular destination for germans to immigrate too .

organizers are predicting that this year 's event will be more successful than ever . the 6-day trade fair first launched in 1924 , this year reflects the growth of the entire consumer electronic sector and boasts over 1,200 exhibitors from 32 countries .
showcasing the latest products from the entertainment and communications industry , it is expected to attract over 200,000 visitors .
with unique trade visitor services , special events and a comprehensive program for consumers , the trade show has become an annual appointment for both industry experts and the general public .
" in comparison to 2006 , we have managed to set an all-time record -lrb- of members of the press in attendance -rrb- , " said ifa 's ceo christian göke ahead of the opening . " we are especially pleased that this increase in figures is also a national one . "

experts predict that some 40 million tube televisions will be replaced by flat screens in the new few years , although the boom observed in the wake of the world cup in 2006 did not continue in the first half of 2007 .
meanwhile , the growth in the classic entertainment electronics industry was less notable than in the private communications and information technology sector .
the overall market for consumer electronics grew by 4.9 percent , whereby the largest growth was in the area of private telecommunications and it .
entertainment electronics grew by just 2.6 percent .
" in this instance , we need to bear in mind last year 's world cup effect , " said rainer hecker from the association for entertainment electronics .
" nonetheless , further growth has also been realized here in germany . "
experts hope that ifa will also help reinvigorate the market for the second half of the year .
retailers usually place billions of euros of orders with importers and manufacturers during the event .
this year , electronics industry is expecting a boost in turnover of 2 percent up to 23 billion euros with the new televisions , digital cameras , mp-3 players , navigation systems as well as video games , mobile ' phones and notebooks .
for the time being , it seems that the hike in vat earlier this year has failed to dampen consumer enthusiasm in germany .
economic optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are spending again ifa director jens heithecker points to other factors influencing the market .
" as far as consumers are concerned , " he said , " consumer electronics have never been such good value .
televisions are up to 30 percent cheaper because new models are arriving all the time and competition is very tough . "
in this respect , the increased vat plays an unexpectedly minor role in consumer decisions , while the general upswing in the german economy has triggered a renewed interest in quality products .
while visitor interest is growing at ifa , the actual event is too .
this year , it encompasses some 104,00 square meters of site in berlin - a 10 percent larger surface area than last year 's trade fair .
" these days , we 're more international than ever , " said a spokesman from the association for entertainment electronics .

youtube has taken videos that promote nazi propaganda off its web site after jewish leaders in germany considered taking legal action . after coming under intense pressure from politicians and jewish groups for featuring far-right propaganda on its file-sharing web site youtube , google germany has agreed to remove the offending videos .
earlier this week , germany 's central council of jews contacted youtube administrators and the german authority for youth protection on the internet to demand that material glorifying nazi ideology be deleted .

his aim : to usher in a new era of trans-atlantic cooperation on climate protection . " we can and must steer the trend toward energy policy and ecology , and we hold the key in our hand , " steinmeier said .
stressing that the us and europe are among the most innovative economies in the world , he warned that the entire world faced catastrophic consequences if it fails to act .
" we will experience more flooding , more hurricanes , more heat-related deaths , more drought and ruined crops , more deserts , more refugees , more displacement and destitution , " he said .
during talks with californian governor arnold schwarzenegger in sacramento , the two leaders agreed that germany and california should team up in the fight against global warming .
" contact between german and us companies is an obvious option , " said steinmeier , pointing to the state 's pioneering record on use of renewable energies .
california is the world 's sixth largest economy and a trailblazer in the area of climate policy despite washington 's foot-dragging .

29 , steinmeier said after the meeting .
schwarzenegger also agreed to visit germany , explaining that his state was keen to work with germany because of its track record and " gigantic goals " in building alternative energy sources to protect the climate .
steinmeier 's visit is expected to provide an extra boost to schwarzenegger 's environmental agenda , as california prepares to introduce the european system of carbon unit trading - a system so far rejected by president bush .
experts feel that europe 's experience with the system can provide california with a blueprint for possible pitfalls to avoid .
two years ago , schwarzenegger championed legislation to reduce the state 's carbon emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020 .
according to afp news service , his climate action team has identified 40 strategies to reduce global warming , including the carbon-trading program , a million-home solar energy initiative , and plans for a hydrogen highway stretching from british columbia to mexico .
he has ordered the state 's electricity suppliers to produce 20 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2010 and signed environmental agreements with britain , states in australia , canada and mexico and with the us states of arizona , oregon , new mexico , new york , utah and washington .

" a long apparent mistrust within europe towards the us is increasingly replaced by indifference and even skepticism , " he said .
mending this relationship was crucial , steinmeier said in a speech thursday night to the commonwealth club in san francisco , the oldest and largest public affairs forum in the united states .
" in coming decades , in this era of globalization , europe and the us will become more dependent on one another than ever , " he said .
" for this reason i hope we can revive old sympathies , define common issues for the future and rediscover one another . "
calling for " new way of thinking , " he pointed to cooperation on environmental issues but also in business .
" a political regulation of capital and finance markets should also occur , so that stock market crises do not escalate into global economic disasters and speculators are not in a position to push people around the globe into poverty and desperation , " he said .
he also called for a greater involvement of russia in solving international issues .

his aim : to usher in a new era of trans-atlantic cooperation on climate protection . " we can and must steer the trend toward energy policy and ecology , and we hold the key in our hand , " steinmeier said .
stressing that the us and europe are among the most innovative economies in the world , he warned that the entire world faced catastrophic consequences if it fails to act .
" we will experience more flooding , more hurricanes , more heat-related deaths , more drought and ruined crops , more deserts , more refugees , more displacement and destitution , " he said .
during talks with californian governor arnold schwarzenegger in sacramento , the two leaders agreed that germany and california should team up in the fight against global warming .
" contact between german and us companies is an obvious option , " said steinmeier , pointing to the state 's pioneering record on use of renewable energies .
california is the world 's sixth largest economy and a trailblazer in the area of climate policy despite washington 's foot-dragging .
he 'll be back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california was the first state to impose a cap on all greenhouse gas emissions schwarzenegger accepted an invitation to attend a climate conference sponsored by the portuguese eu presidency in lisbon on oct .
29 , steinmeier said after the meeting .
schwarzenegger also agreed to visit germany , explaining that his state was keen to work with germany because of its track record and " gigantic goals " in building alternative energy sources to protect the climate .
steinmeier 's visit is expected to provide an extra boost to schwarzenegger 's environmental agenda , as california prepares to introduce the european system of carbon unit trading - a system so far rejected by president bush .
experts feel that europe 's experience with the system can provide california with a blueprint for possible pitfalls to avoid .
two years ago , schwarzenegger championed legislation to reduce the state 's carbon emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020 .
according to afp news service , his climate action team has identified 40 strategies to reduce global warming , including the carbon-trading program , a million-home solar energy initiative , and plans for a hydrogen highway stretching from british columbia to mexico .
he has ordered the state 's electricity suppliers to produce 20 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2010 and signed environmental agreements with britain , states in australia , canada and mexico and with the us states of arizona , oregon , new mexico , new york , utah and washington .
thawing climate , thawing tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq caused a rift between europe and the us steinmeier also took the opportunity to warn of the " creeping political alienation " between the us and europe , and called for a profound renewal of their alliance .
" a long apparent mistrust within europe towards the us is increasingly replaced by indifference and even skepticism , " he said .
mending this relationship was crucial , steinmeier said in a speech thursday night to the commonwealth club in san francisco , the oldest and largest public affairs forum in the united states .
" in coming decades , in this era of globalization , europe and the us will become more dependent on one another than ever , " he said .
" for this reason i hope we can revive old sympathies , define common issues for the future and rediscover one another . "
calling for " new way of thinking , " he pointed to cooperation on environmental issues but also in business .
" a political regulation of capital and finance markets should also occur , so that stock market crises do not escalate into global economic disasters and speculators are not in a position to push people around the globe into poverty and desperation , " he said .
he also called for a greater involvement of russia in solving international issues .
" we need russia if we are to secure global stability , " he said .

his aim : to usher in a new era of trans-atlantic cooperation on climate protection . " we can and must steer the trend toward energy policy and ecology , and we hold the key in our hand , " steinmeier said .
stressing that the us and europe are among the most innovative economies in the world , he warned that the entire world faced catastrophic consequences if it fails to act .
" we will experience more flooding , more hurricanes , more heat-related deaths , more drought and ruined crops , more deserts , more refugees , more displacement and destitution , " he said .
during talks with californian governor arnold schwarzenegger in sacramento , the two leaders agreed that germany and california should team up in the fight against global warming .
" contact between german and us companies is an obvious option , " said steinmeier , pointing to the state 's pioneering record on use of renewable energies .
california is the world 's sixth largest economy and a trailblazer in the area of climate policy despite washington 's foot-dragging .
he 'll be back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california was the first state to impose a cap on all greenhouse gas emissions schwarzenegger accepted an invitation to attend a climate conference sponsored by the portuguese eu presidency in lisbon on oct .
29 , steinmeier said after the meeting .
schwarzenegger also agreed to visit germany , explaining that his state was keen to work with germany because of its track record and " gigantic goals " in building alternative energy sources to protect the climate .
steinmeier 's visit is expected to provide an extra boost to schwarzenegger 's environmental agenda , as california prepares to introduce the european system of carbon unit trading - a system so far rejected by president bush .
experts feel that europe 's experience with the system can provide california with a blueprint for possible pitfalls to avoid .
two years ago , schwarzenegger championed legislation to reduce the state 's carbon emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020 .
according to afp news service , his climate action team has identified 40 strategies to reduce global warming , including the carbon-trading program , a million-home solar energy initiative , and plans for a hydrogen highway stretching from british columbia to mexico .
he has ordered the state 's electricity suppliers to produce 20 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2010 and signed environmental agreements with britain , states in australia , canada and mexico and with the us states of arizona , oregon , new mexico , new york , utah and washington .
thawing climate , thawing tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq caused a rift between europe and the us steinmeier also took the opportunity to warn of the " creeping political alienation " between the us and europe , and called for a profound renewal of their alliance .
" a long apparent mistrust within europe towards the us is increasingly replaced by indifference and even skepticism , " he said .
mending this relationship was crucial , steinmeier said in a speech thursday night to the commonwealth club in san francisco , the oldest and largest public affairs forum in the united states .
" in coming decades , in this era of globalization , europe and the us will become more dependent on one another than ever , " he said .
" for this reason i hope we can revive old sympathies , define common issues for the future and rediscover one another . "
calling for " new way of thinking , " he pointed to cooperation on environmental issues but also in business .
" a political regulation of capital and finance markets should also occur , so that stock market crises do not escalate into global economic disasters and speculators are not in a position to push people around the globe into poverty and desperation , " he said .
he also called for a greater involvement of russia in solving international issues .
" we need russia if we are to secure global stability , " he said .
" we have failed to agree on security policies with russia , and this has led to lasting frustration and hostility in moscow . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his aim : to usher in a new era of trans-atlantic cooperation on climate protection . " we can and must steer the trend toward energy policy and ecology , and we hold the key in our hand , " steinmeier said .
stressing that the us and europe are among the most innovative economies in the world , he warned that the entire world faced catastrophic consequences if it fails to act .
" we will experience more flooding , more hurricanes , more heat-related deaths , more drought and ruined crops , more deserts , more refugees , more displacement and destitution , " he said .
during talks with californian governor arnold schwarzenegger in sacramento , the two leaders agreed that germany and california should team up in the fight against global warming .
" contact between german and us companies is an obvious option , " said steinmeier , pointing to the state 's pioneering record on use of renewable energies .
california is the world 's sixth largest economy and a trailblazer in the area of climate policy despite washington 's foot-dragging .

29 , steinmeier said after the meeting .
schwarzenegger also agreed to visit germany , explaining that his state was keen to work with germany because of its track record and " gigantic goals " in building alternative energy sources to protect the climate .
steinmeier 's visit is expected to provide an extra boost to schwarzenegger 's environmental agenda , as california prepares to introduce the european system of carbon unit trading - a system so far rejected by president bush .
experts feel that europe 's experience with the system can provide california with a blueprint for possible pitfalls to avoid .
two years ago , schwarzenegger championed legislation to reduce the state 's carbon emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020 .
according to afp news service , his climate action team has identified 40 strategies to reduce global warming , including the carbon-trading program , a million-home solar energy initiative , and plans for a hydrogen highway stretching from british columbia to mexico .
he has ordered the state 's electricity suppliers to produce 20 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2010 and signed environmental agreements with britain , states in australia , canada and mexico and with the us states of arizona , oregon , new mexico , new york , utah and washington .
thawing climate , thawing tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq caused a rift between europe and the us steinmeier also took the opportunity to warn of the " creeping political alienation " between the us and europe , and called for a profound renewal of their alliance .
" a long apparent mistrust within europe towards the us is increasingly replaced by indifference and even skepticism , " he said .
mending this relationship was crucial , steinmeier said in a speech thursday night to the commonwealth club in san francisco , the oldest and largest public affairs forum in the united states .
" in coming decades , in this era of globalization , europe and the us will become more dependent on one another than ever , " he said .
" for this reason i hope we can revive old sympathies , define common issues for the future and rediscover one another . "
calling for " new way of thinking , " he pointed to cooperation on environmental issues but also in business .
" a political regulation of capital and finance markets should also occur , so that stock market crises do not escalate into global economic disasters and speculators are not in a position to push people around the globe into poverty and desperation , " he said .
he also called for a greater involvement of russia in solving international issues .

his aim : to usher in a new era of trans-atlantic cooperation on climate protection . " we can and must steer the trend toward energy policy and ecology , and we hold the key in our hand , " steinmeier said .
stressing that the us and europe are among the most innovative economies in the world , he warned that the entire world faced catastrophic consequences if it fails to act .
" we will experience more flooding , more hurricanes , more heat-related deaths , more drought and ruined crops , more deserts , more refugees , more displacement and destitution , " he said .
during talks with californian governor arnold schwarzenegger in sacramento , the two leaders agreed that germany and california should team up in the fight against global warming .
" contact between german and us companies is an obvious option , " said steinmeier , pointing to the state 's pioneering record on use of renewable energies .
california is the world 's sixth largest economy and a trailblazer in the area of climate policy despite washington 's foot-dragging .

29 , steinmeier said after the meeting .
schwarzenegger also agreed to visit germany , explaining that his state was keen to work with germany because of its track record and " gigantic goals " in building alternative energy sources to protect the climate .
steinmeier 's visit is expected to provide an extra boost to schwarzenegger 's environmental agenda , as california prepares to introduce the european system of carbon unit trading - a system so far rejected by president bush .
experts feel that europe 's experience with the system can provide california with a blueprint for possible pitfalls to avoid .
two years ago , schwarzenegger championed legislation to reduce the state 's carbon emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020 .
according to afp news service , his climate action team has identified 40 strategies to reduce global warming , including the carbon-trading program , a million-home solar energy initiative , and plans for a hydrogen highway stretching from british columbia to mexico .
he has ordered the state 's electricity suppliers to produce 20 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2010 and signed environmental agreements with britain , states in australia , canada and mexico and with the us states of arizona , oregon , new mexico , new york , utah and washington .

" a long apparent mistrust within europe towards the us is increasingly replaced by indifference and even skepticism , " he said .
mending this relationship was crucial , steinmeier said in a speech thursday night to the commonwealth club in san francisco , the oldest and largest public affairs forum in the united states .
" in coming decades , in this era of globalization , europe and the us will become more dependent on one another than ever , " he said .
" for this reason i hope we can revive old sympathies , define common issues for the future and rediscover one another . "
calling for " new way of thinking , " he pointed to cooperation on environmental issues but also in business .
" a political regulation of capital and finance markets should also occur , so that stock market crises do not escalate into global economic disasters and speculators are not in a position to push people around the globe into poverty and desperation , " he said .
he also called for a greater involvement of russia in solving international issues .

at the time , tehran proclaimed " industrial " enrichment capacity , a level starting with 3,000 centrifuges running at supersonic speed .
saying it was reacting to the eu 's political decision to raise the stakes in the nuclear row with iran , the german government on thursday said it was imposing a general ban on all arms deals with iran .
allegations of spying that includes the sale , export as well as transfer of all military goods to teheran .
in addition , german firms will no longer be able to import military equipment from the country irrespective of their origin .

the move comes amid warnings by germany 's domestic intelligence services of a new spying offensive in the country by foreign secret services , including from iran .
in an interview with german weekly die zeit , hartwig möller , head of the regional intelligence agency in the western state of north-rhine westphalia , said the iranian secret service was intensively trying to get access to high-tech construction plans in the state in order to get information about military technology .
" it 's all about getting know-how for the nuclear program , " möller said .
" significant step forward " on thursday , however a report by the iaea , the un nuclear watchdog agency , obtained by some news agencies , said iran 's nuclear work was far below the industrial level vaunted by tehran in april .
iran struck a deal with the international atomic energy agency on aug .

" the work plan is a significant step forward , " said the iaea report , but it added resolving current issues was not enough to give iran 's nuclear work a clean bill of health . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

youtube has taken videos that promote nazi propaganda off its web site after jewish leaders in germany considered taking legal action . after coming under intense pressure from politicians and jewish groups for featuring far-right propaganda on its file-sharing web site youtube , google germany has agreed to remove the offending videos .
earlier this week , germany 's central council of jews contacted youtube administrators and the german authority for youth protection on the internet to demand that material glorifying nazi ideology be deleted .

" this content is illegal and in breach of youtube guidelines . "

his aim : to usher in a new era of trans-atlantic cooperation on climate protection . " we can and must steer the trend toward energy policy and ecology , and we hold the key in our hand , " steinmeier said .
stressing that the us and europe are among the most innovative economies in the world , he warned that the entire world faced catastrophic consequences if it fails to act .
" we will experience more flooding , more hurricanes , more heat-related deaths , more drought and ruined crops , more deserts , more refugees , more displacement and destitution , " he said .
during talks with californian governor arnold schwarzenegger in sacramento , the two leaders agreed that germany and california should team up in the fight against global warming .
" contact between german and us companies is an obvious option , " said steinmeier , pointing to the state 's pioneering record on use of renewable energies .
california is the world 's sixth largest economy and a trailblazer in the area of climate policy despite washington 's foot-dragging .

29 , steinmeier said after the meeting .
schwarzenegger also agreed to visit germany , explaining that his state was keen to work with germany because of its track record and " gigantic goals " in building alternative energy sources to protect the climate .
steinmeier 's visit is expected to provide an extra boost to schwarzenegger 's environmental agenda , as california prepares to introduce the european system of carbon unit trading - a system so far rejected by president bush .
experts feel that europe 's experience with the system can provide california with a blueprint for possible pitfalls to avoid .
two years ago , schwarzenegger championed legislation to reduce the state 's carbon emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020 .
according to afp news service , his climate action team has identified 40 strategies to reduce global warming , including the carbon-trading program , a million-home solar energy initiative , and plans for a hydrogen highway stretching from british columbia to mexico .
he has ordered the state 's electricity suppliers to produce 20 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2010 and signed environmental agreements with britain , states in australia , canada and mexico and with the us states of arizona , oregon , new mexico , new york , utah and washington .

" a long apparent mistrust within europe towards the us is increasingly replaced by indifference and even skepticism , " he said .
mending this relationship was crucial , steinmeier said in a speech thursday night to the commonwealth club in san francisco , the oldest and largest public affairs forum in the united states .
" in coming decades , in this era of globalization , europe and the us will become more dependent on one another than ever , " he said .
" for this reason i hope we can revive old sympathies , define common issues for the future and rediscover one another . "
calling for " new way of thinking , " he pointed to cooperation on environmental issues but also in business .
" a political regulation of capital and finance markets should also occur , so that stock market crises do not escalate into global economic disasters and speculators are not in a position to push people around the globe into poverty and desperation , " he said .
he also called for a greater involvement of russia in solving international issues .
" we need russia if we are to secure global stability , " he said .

his aim : to usher in a new era of trans-atlantic cooperation on climate protection . " we can and must steer the trend toward energy policy and ecology , and we hold the key in our hand , " steinmeier said .
stressing that the us and europe are among the most innovative economies in the world , he warned that the entire world faced catastrophic consequences if it fails to act .
" we will experience more flooding , more hurricanes , more heat-related deaths , more drought and ruined crops , more deserts , more refugees , more displacement and destitution , " he said .
during talks with californian governor arnold schwarzenegger in sacramento , the two leaders agreed that germany and california should team up in the fight against global warming .
" contact between german and us companies is an obvious option , " said steinmeier , pointing to the state 's pioneering record on use of renewable energies .
california is the world 's sixth largest economy and a trailblazer in the area of climate policy despite washington 's foot-dragging .
he 'll be back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california was the first state to impose a cap on all greenhouse gas emissions schwarzenegger accepted an invitation to attend a climate conference sponsored by the portuguese eu presidency in lisbon on oct .
29 , steinmeier said after the meeting .
schwarzenegger also agreed to visit germany , explaining that his state was keen to work with germany because of its track record and " gigantic goals " in building alternative energy sources to protect the climate .
steinmeier 's visit is expected to provide an extra boost to schwarzenegger 's environmental agenda , as california prepares to introduce the european system of carbon unit trading - a system so far rejected by president bush .
experts feel that europe 's experience with the system can provide california with a blueprint for possible pitfalls to avoid .
two years ago , schwarzenegger championed legislation to reduce the state 's carbon emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020 .
according to afp news service , his climate action team has identified 40 strategies to reduce global warming , including the carbon-trading program , a million-home solar energy initiative , and plans for a hydrogen highway stretching from british columbia to mexico .
he has ordered the state 's electricity suppliers to produce 20 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2010 and signed environmental agreements with britain , states in australia , canada and mexico and with the us states of arizona , oregon , new mexico , new york , utah and washington .
thawing climate , thawing tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq caused a rift between europe and the us steinmeier also took the opportunity to warn of the " creeping political alienation " between the us and europe , and called for a profound renewal of their alliance .
" a long apparent mistrust within europe towards the us is increasingly replaced by indifference and even skepticism , " he said .
mending this relationship was crucial , steinmeier said in a speech thursday night to the commonwealth club in san francisco , the oldest and largest public affairs forum in the united states .
" in coming decades , in this era of globalization , europe and the us will become more dependent on one another than ever , " he said .
" for this reason i hope we can revive old sympathies , define common issues for the future and rediscover one another . "
calling for " new way of thinking , " he pointed to cooperation on environmental issues but also in business .
" a political regulation of capital and finance markets should also occur , so that stock market crises do not escalate into global economic disasters and speculators are not in a position to push people around the globe into poverty and desperation , " he said .

organizers are predicting that this year 's event will be more successful than ever . the 6-day trade fair first launched in 1924 , this year reflects the growth of the entire consumer electronic sector and boasts over 1,200 exhibitors from 32 countries .
showcasing the latest products from the entertainment and communications industry , it is expected to attract over 200,000 visitors .
with unique trade visitor services , special events and a comprehensive program for consumers , the trade show has become an annual appointment for both industry experts and the general public .
" in comparison to 2006 , we have managed to set an all-time record -lrb- of members of the press in attendance -rrb- , " said ifa 's ceo christian göke ahead of the opening . " we are especially pleased that this increase in figures is also a national one . "
flat panels a favorite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers love their flat screens within the electronic industry , current sales are dominated by the number one growth motor , television .
experts predict that some 40 million tube televisions will be replaced by flat screens in the new few years , although the boom observed in the wake of the world cup in 2006 did not continue in the first half of 2007 .
meanwhile , the growth in the classic entertainment electronics industry was less notable than in the private communications and information technology sector .
the overall market for consumer electronics grew by 4.9 percent , whereby the largest growth was in the area of private telecommunications and it .
entertainment electronics grew by just 2.6 percent .
" in this instance , we need to bear in mind last year 's world cup effect , " said rainer hecker from the association for entertainment electronics .
" nonetheless , further growth has also been realized here in germany . "
experts hope that ifa will also help reinvigorate the market for the second half of the year .
retailers usually place billions of euros of orders with importers and manufacturers during the event .
this year , electronics industry is expecting a boost in turnover of 2 percent up to 23 billion euros with the new televisions , digital cameras , mp-3 players , navigation systems as well as video games , mobile ' phones and notebooks .
for the time being , it seems that the hike in vat earlier this year has failed to dampen consumer enthusiasm in germany .
economic optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are spending again ifa director jens heithecker points to other factors influencing the market .
" as far as consumers are concerned , " he said , " consumer electronics have never been such good value .
televisions are up to 30 percent cheaper because new models are arriving all the time and competition is very tough . "
in this respect , the increased vat plays an unexpectedly minor role in consumer decisions , while the general upswing in the german economy has triggered a renewed interest in quality products .
while visitor interest is growing at ifa , the actual event is too .
this year , it encompasses some 104,00 square meters of site in berlin - a 10 percent larger surface area than last year 's trade fair .
" these days , we 're more international than ever , " said a spokesman from the association for entertainment electronics .

meanwhile , the growth in the classic entertainment electronics industry was less notable than in the private communications and information technology sector .
the overall market for consumer electronics grew by 4.9 percent , whereby the largest growth was in the area of private telecommunications and it .
entertainment electronics grew by just 2.6 percent .
" in this instance , we need to bear in mind last year 's world cup effect , " said rainer hecker from the association for entertainment electronics .

" as far as consumers are concerned , " he said , " consumer electronics have never been such good value .
televisions are up to 30 percent cheaper because new models are arriving all the time and competition is very tough . "

the law chiefly allows citizens from eu member states to keep their old passport if they take on german nationality . people applying for german citizenship will no longer have to give up their old passports if they come from an eu member state or from switzerland , according to a spokeswoman from the german interior ministry .
even germans who take on citizenship of other eu states or switzerland will no longer lose their nationality .
the changes come about as a result of reforms to the country 's immigration law .
until now , germans who applied for citizenship in other eu nations or in switzerland had to give up their german passport .
they , however , had the chance to apply , for a fee and prior to their citizenship application , to keep their passport .
the new changes to the law mean german citizens no longer need to do that .
according to swiss newspaper , tagesanzeiger , the new rules could be of significance for swiss-german relations .
the paper said switzerland remains the most popular destination for germans to immigrate too .
most new germans unlikely to be affected by law the changes to the immigration law allowing for increased numbers of dual citizenship holders largely went unnoticed in the media when they were made earlier this year .
rather , new regulations making it tougher for spouses of turkish citizens to move to germany prompted much heated debate .
in july this year , the german government said the number of people taking on german citizenship had risen with 124,832 getting german passports in 2006 - an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year .
most new germans , however , are unlikely to be affected by the changes in the country 's immigration law since they are n't from eu states .

the law chiefly allows citizens from eu member states to keep their old passport if they take on german nationality . people applying for german citizenship will no longer have to give up their old passports if they come from an eu member state or from switzerland , according to a spokeswoman from the german interior ministry .
even germans who take on citizenship of other eu states or switzerland will no longer lose their nationality .
the changes come about as a result of reforms to the country 's immigration law .
until now , germans who applied for citizenship in other eu nations or in switzerland had to give up their german passport .
they , however , had the chance to apply , for a fee and prior to their citizenship application , to keep their passport .
the new changes to the law mean german citizens no longer need to do that .
according to swiss newspaper , tagesanzeiger , the new rules could be of significance for swiss-german relations .
the paper said switzerland remains the most popular destination for germans to immigrate too .
most new germans unlikely to be affected by law the changes to the immigration law allowing for increased numbers of dual citizenship holders largely went unnoticed in the media when they were made earlier this year .
rather , new regulations making it tougher for spouses of turkish citizens to move to germany prompted much heated debate .
in july this year , the german government said the number of people taking on german citizenship had risen with 124,832 getting german passports in 2006 - an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year .
most new germans , however , are unlikely to be affected by the changes in the country 's immigration law since they are n't from eu states .
in 2006 , turks made up the greatest number of new germans , as in previous years , with around 33,500 changing their nationality .

built in 1904 in the neo-romanesque style , the ryke street synagogue was attacked during the infamous night of violence during which adolf hitler ’ s followers torched jewish homes , businesses and places of worship .
while the synagogue was desecrated , it was not burned down , apparently because the nazis feared causing damage to the surrounding buildings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jewish community see great hope in the reopening now , after a colorful history which also saw it fall under communist rule , the synagogue has been reborn as symbol of the rebirth of the jewish community in the german capital .
ninety-four year-old rabbi leo trepp , who had preached at the synagogue in the 1930s and was one of the rabbis who was seized and deported to the sachsenhausen concentration camp along with many of congregation members , called the reopening a " miracle " .
synagogue 's rebirth " a miracle " trepp was among the guests at the inauguration ceremony in the restored building with political leaders and holocaust survivors from around the world .
" it is a miracle that there are jews in germany again , " trepp told reporters .
" and the synagogue on rykestrasse , which survived two different regimes , is the symbol of that miracle , " he said .
the synagogue 's architects ruth golan and kay zareh used three surviving black-and-white photographs of the original building to recreate its remarkable elegance .
" it is now the most beautiful synagogue in germany , " the cultural affairs director of the berlin 's jewish community , peter sauerbaum , said .

the opening coincides with the start of the capital 's annual jewish cultural days , which includes a series of concerts at the newly restored synagogue .
israeli pop star david broza and violinist daniel hope will be among the performers taking part in the 10-day festival , which runs to september 9 .
on sunday , a new cultural center is being formally opened in the western part of berlin for the chabad-lubavitch branch of orthodox jews .
a feature of the center , which cost 5 million euros , is a 30-metre replica of part of the wailing wall in jerusalem , built with stone from around the city .
colorful history under two regimes the reopening of the synagogue marks a remarkable return to grandeur since its last prayer service at the berlin synagogue took place in april 1940 .
after world war ii , it was first used to house jewish survivors of the holocaust in eastern europe before reopening in 1953 and becoming home to the east berlin 's jewish community after the capital was divided .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the synagogue out-lived the nazis and communism over the years after 1967 , the synagogue was gradually renovated , and the most recent works have seen the restoration of the colored-glass interior .
with german unification in 1990 , the synagogue served an influx of jewish immigrants from russia which continues to make germany 's 120,000-strong jewish community one of the fastest-growing in the world .

deuse told the newspaper that the recent attack in mügeln , in the eastern german state of saxony , was not racially motivated , adding that he was " proud to be german " .
the free democrat afterwards told the dpa news agency that he had been unaware of the newspaper 's political orientation and that his mention of national pride was in connection with the world cup hosted by germany last year .
" i detest right-wing violence , " he added .
not the first controversial remark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing scene in eastern germany is said to be stronger than in western germany deuse had already come under fire for earlier comments to the press about the incident in which the indians were chased and attacked by a mob .
witnesses said a number had also shouted racist slogans , such as " foreigners out " .
" anyone can come out with such slogans from time to time , " deuse told financial times germany .
initially , he had also denied the perpetrators were from mügeln where he said there was no right-wing scene .

i 'm not tired of living . "
sebastian edathy -lrb- spd -rrb- , the chairman of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee , also said deuse should consider resigning .
he said that the situation in mügeln was completely different than that portrayed by the mayor of the town .
in mügeln " there had been a pogrom-like atmosphere aimed at fellow citizens of foreign origin , " he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung .
german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- spd -rrb- warned against any attempt to downplay what had gone on .
" looking away and playing things down are precisely the wrong approach , " he told the rheinische post .
the minister , who is responsible for the reconstruction of eastern germany , added ; " citizens and associations have to act courageously against right-wing extremist tendencies . "
minister says problem bigger in eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there has also been a protest in mügeln against the attack tiefensee also said there was a greater problem with right-wing extremism in eastern germany because there was not the same history of dealing with immigration and cultural diversity , but he also said the difficult labor market played a role in radicalizing society .
the free democrats have also distanced themselves from deuse 's comments .
fdp general secretary dirk niebel said acts of violence and xenophobic attitudes should not be relativized .
legal proceedings have been launched against 12 suspects aged between 17 and 35 , who are suspected of fomenting racial hatred and committing grievous bodily harm .

organizers are predicting that this year 's event will be more successful than ever . the 6-day trade fair first launched in 1924 , this year reflects the growth of the entire consumer electronic sector and boasts over 1,200 exhibitors from 32 countries .
showcasing the latest products from the entertainment and communications industry , it is expected to attract over 200,000 visitors .
with unique trade visitor services , special events and a comprehensive program for consumers , the trade show has become an annual appointment for both industry experts and the general public .
" in comparison to 2006 , we have managed to set an all-time record -lrb- of members of the press in attendance -rrb- , " said ifa 's ceo christian göke ahead of the opening . " we are especially pleased that this increase in figures is also a national one . "

experts predict that some 40 million tube televisions will be replaced by flat screens in the new few years , although the boom observed in the wake of the world cup in 2006 did not continue in the first half of 2007 .
meanwhile , the growth in the classic entertainment electronics industry was less notable than in the private communications and information technology sector .
the overall market for consumer electronics grew by 4.9 percent , whereby the largest growth was in the area of private telecommunications and it .
entertainment electronics grew by just 2.6 percent .
" in this instance , we need to bear in mind last year 's world cup effect , " said rainer hecker from the association for entertainment electronics .
" nonetheless , further growth has also been realized here in germany . "
experts hope that ifa will also help reinvigorate the market for the second half of the year .
retailers usually place billions of euros of orders with importers and manufacturers during the event .
this year , electronics industry is expecting a boost in turnover of 2 percent up to 23 billion euros with the new televisions , digital cameras , mp-3 players , navigation systems as well as video games , mobile ' phones and notebooks .
for the time being , it seems that the hike in vat earlier this year has failed to dampen consumer enthusiasm in germany .
economic optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are spending again ifa director jens heithecker points to other factors influencing the market .
" as far as consumers are concerned , " he said , " consumer electronics have never been such good value .
televisions are up to 30 percent cheaper because new models are arriving all the time and competition is very tough . "
in this respect , the increased vat plays an unexpectedly minor role in consumer decisions , while the general upswing in the german economy has triggered a renewed interest in quality products .
while visitor interest is growing at ifa , the actual event is too .
this year , it encompasses some 104,00 square meters of site in berlin - a 10 percent larger surface area than last year 's trade fair .
" these days , we 're more international than ever , " said a spokesman from the association for entertainment electronics .

the law chiefly allows citizens from eu member states to keep their old passport if they take on german nationality . people applying for german citizenship will no longer have to give up their old passports if they come from an eu member state or from switzerland , according to a spokeswoman from the german interior ministry .
even germans who take on citizenship of other eu states or switzerland will no longer lose their nationality .
the changes come about as a result of reforms to the country 's immigration law .
until now , germans who applied for citizenship in other eu nations or in switzerland had to give up their german passport .
they , however , had the chance to apply , for a fee and prior to their citizenship application , to keep their passport .
the new changes to the law mean german citizens no longer need to do that .
according to swiss newspaper , tagesanzeiger , the new rules could be of significance for swiss-german relations .
the paper said switzerland remains the most popular destination for germans to immigrate too .
most new germans unlikely to be affected by law the changes to the immigration law allowing for increased numbers of dual citizenship holders largely went unnoticed in the media when they were made earlier this year .
rather , new regulations making it tougher for spouses of turkish citizens to move to germany prompted much heated debate .
in july this year , the german government said the number of people taking on german citizenship had risen with 124,832 getting german passports in 2006 - an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year .
most new germans , however , are unlikely to be affected by the changes in the country 's immigration law since they are n't from eu states .

the law chiefly allows citizens from eu member states to keep their old passport if they take on german nationality . people applying for german citizenship will no longer have to give up their old passports if they come from an eu member state or from switzerland , according to a spokeswoman from the german interior ministry .
even germans who take on citizenship of other eu states or switzerland will no longer lose their nationality .
the changes come about as a result of reforms to the country 's immigration law .
until now , germans who applied for citizenship in other eu nations or in switzerland had to give up their german passport .

built in 1904 in the neo-romanesque style , the ryke street synagogue was attacked during the infamous night of violence during which adolf hitler ’ s followers torched jewish homes , businesses and places of worship .
while the synagogue was desecrated , it was not burned down , apparently because the nazis feared causing damage to the surrounding buildings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jewish community see great hope in the reopening now , after a colorful history which also saw it fall under communist rule , the synagogue has been reborn as symbol of the rebirth of the jewish community in the german capital .
ninety-four year-old rabbi leo trepp , who had preached at the synagogue in the 1930s and was one of the rabbis who was seized and deported to the sachsenhausen concentration camp along with many of congregation members , called the reopening a " miracle " .
synagogue 's rebirth " a miracle " trepp was among the guests at the inauguration ceremony in the restored building with political leaders and holocaust survivors from around the world .
" it is a miracle that there are jews in germany again , " trepp told reporters .
" and the synagogue on rykestrasse , which survived two different regimes , is the symbol of that miracle , " he said .
the synagogue 's architects ruth golan and kay zareh used three surviving black-and-white photographs of the original building to recreate its remarkable elegance .

the opening coincides with the start of the capital 's annual jewish cultural days , which includes a series of concerts at the newly restored synagogue .
israeli pop star david broza and violinist daniel hope will be among the performers taking part in the 10-day festival , which runs to september 9 .
on sunday , a new cultural center is being formally opened in the western part of berlin for the chabad-lubavitch branch of orthodox jews .
a feature of the center , which cost 5 million euros , is a 30-metre replica of part of the wailing wall in jerusalem , built with stone from around the city .
colorful history under two regimes the reopening of the synagogue marks a remarkable return to grandeur since its last prayer service at the berlin synagogue took place in april 1940 .
after world war ii , it was first used to house jewish survivors of the holocaust in eastern europe before reopening in 1953 and becoming home to the east berlin 's jewish community after the capital was divided .

synagogue 's rebirth " a miracle " trepp was among the guests at the inauguration ceremony in the restored building with political leaders and holocaust survivors from around the world .
" it is a miracle that there are jews in germany again , " trepp told reporters .
" and the synagogue on rykestrasse , which survived two different regimes , is the symbol of that miracle , " he said .
the synagogue 's architects ruth golan and kay zareh used three surviving black-and-white photographs of the original building to recreate its remarkable elegance .
" it is now the most beautiful synagogue in germany , " the cultural affairs director of the berlin 's jewish community , peter sauerbaum , said .

a feature of the center , which cost 5 million euros , is a 30-metre replica of part of the wailing wall in jerusalem , built with stone from around the city .
colorful history under two regimes the reopening of the synagogue marks a remarkable return to grandeur since its last prayer service at the berlin synagogue took place in april 1940 .
after world war ii , it was first used to house jewish survivors of the holocaust in eastern europe before reopening in 1953 and becoming home to the east berlin 's jewish community after the capital was divided .

deuse told the newspaper that the recent attack in mügeln , in the eastern german state of saxony , was not racially motivated , adding that he was " proud to be german " .
the free democrat afterwards told the dpa news agency that he had been unaware of the newspaper 's political orientation and that his mention of national pride was in connection with the world cup hosted by germany last year .
" i detest right-wing violence , " he added .
not the first controversial remark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing scene in eastern germany is said to be stronger than in western germany deuse had already come under fire for earlier comments to the press about the incident in which the indians were chased and attacked by a mob .
witnesses said a number had also shouted racist slogans , such as " foreigners out " .
" anyone can come out with such slogans from time to time , " deuse told financial times germany .
initially , he had also denied the perpetrators were from mügeln where he said there was no right-wing scene .
the general secretary of central council of the jews in germany , stephan kramer , said in a television interview for germany 's n24 : " the mayor is the mirror of the society that elected him . "
no-go zones in eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the faces of the battered indians caused shame in germany he also referred to " democracy-free zones " in eastern germany where the rule of law does not apply .
asked whether he would go for a walk at night in an eastern german town , he said : " i would n't do it .
i 'm not tired of living . "
sebastian edathy -lrb- spd -rrb- , the chairman of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee , also said deuse should consider resigning .
he said that the situation in mügeln was completely different than that portrayed by the mayor of the town .
in mügeln " there had been a pogrom-like atmosphere aimed at fellow citizens of foreign origin , " he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung .
german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- spd -rrb- warned against any attempt to downplay what had gone on .
" looking away and playing things down are precisely the wrong approach , " he told the rheinische post .
the minister , who is responsible for the reconstruction of eastern germany , added ; " citizens and associations have to act courageously against right-wing extremist tendencies . "
minister says problem bigger in eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there has also been a protest in mügeln against the attack tiefensee also said there was a greater problem with right-wing extremism in eastern germany because there was not the same history of dealing with immigration and cultural diversity , but he also said the difficult labor market played a role in radicalizing society .
the free democrats have also distanced themselves from deuse 's comments .
fdp general secretary dirk niebel said acts of violence and xenophobic attitudes should not be relativized .
legal proceedings have been launched against 12 suspects aged between 17 and 35 , who are suspected of fomenting racial hatred and committing grievous bodily harm .
the state prosecutor 's office said , however , that there was no evidence that the attacks had been planned by right-wing extremists .
a recent spate of racially motivated incidents has led to some spd members calling for proceedings to ban the far-right npd party to be restarted . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deuse told the newspaper that the recent attack in mügeln , in the eastern german state of saxony , was not racially motivated , adding that he was " proud to be german " .
the free democrat afterwards told the dpa news agency that he had been unaware of the newspaper 's political orientation and that his mention of national pride was in connection with the world cup hosted by germany last year .
" i detest right-wing violence , " he added .
not the first controversial remark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing scene in eastern germany is said to be stronger than in western germany deuse had already come under fire for earlier comments to the press about the incident in which the indians were chased and attacked by a mob .
witnesses said a number had also shouted racist slogans , such as " foreigners out " .
" anyone can come out with such slogans from time to time , " deuse told financial times germany .
initially , he had also denied the perpetrators were from mügeln where he said there was no right-wing scene .

i 'm not tired of living . "
sebastian edathy -lrb- spd -rrb- , the chairman of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee , also said deuse should consider resigning .
he said that the situation in mügeln was completely different than that portrayed by the mayor of the town .
in mügeln " there had been a pogrom-like atmosphere aimed at fellow citizens of foreign origin , " he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung .
german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- spd -rrb- warned against any attempt to downplay what had gone on .
" looking away and playing things down are precisely the wrong approach , " he told the rheinische post .
the minister , who is responsible for the reconstruction of eastern germany , added ; " citizens and associations have to act courageously against right-wing extremist tendencies . "
minister says problem bigger in eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there has also been a protest in mügeln against the attack tiefensee also said there was a greater problem with right-wing extremism in eastern germany because there was not the same history of dealing with immigration and cultural diversity , but he also said the difficult labor market played a role in radicalizing society .
the free democrats have also distanced themselves from deuse 's comments .
fdp general secretary dirk niebel said acts of violence and xenophobic attitudes should not be relativized .
legal proceedings have been launched against 12 suspects aged between 17 and 35 , who are suspected of fomenting racial hatred and committing grievous bodily harm .

deuse told the newspaper that the recent attack in mügeln , in the eastern german state of saxony , was not racially motivated , adding that he was " proud to be german " .
the free democrat afterwards told the dpa news agency that he had been unaware of the newspaper 's political orientation and that his mention of national pride was in connection with the world cup hosted by germany last year .
" i detest right-wing violence , " he added .
not the first controversial remark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing scene in eastern germany is said to be stronger than in western germany deuse had already come under fire for earlier comments to the press about the incident in which the indians were chased and attacked by a mob .
witnesses said a number had also shouted racist slogans , such as " foreigners out " .
" anyone can come out with such slogans from time to time , " deuse told financial times germany .
initially , he had also denied the perpetrators were from mügeln where he said there was no right-wing scene .
the general secretary of central council of the jews in germany , stephan kramer , said in a television interview for germany 's n24 : " the mayor is the mirror of the society that elected him . "
no-go zones in eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the faces of the battered indians caused shame in germany he also referred to " democracy-free zones " in eastern germany where the rule of law does not apply .
asked whether he would go for a walk at night in an eastern german town , he said : " i would n't do it .
i 'm not tired of living . "
sebastian edathy -lrb- spd -rrb- , the chairman of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee , also said deuse should consider resigning .
he said that the situation in mügeln was completely different than that portrayed by the mayor of the town .
in mügeln " there had been a pogrom-like atmosphere aimed at fellow citizens of foreign origin , " he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung .
german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- spd -rrb- warned against any attempt to downplay what had gone on .
" looking away and playing things down are precisely the wrong approach , " he told the rheinische post .
the minister , who is responsible for the reconstruction of eastern germany , added ; " citizens and associations have to act courageously against right-wing extremist tendencies . "
minister says problem bigger in eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there has also been a protest in mügeln against the attack tiefensee also said there was a greater problem with right-wing extremism in eastern germany because there was not the same history of dealing with immigration and cultural diversity , but he also said the difficult labor market played a role in radicalizing society .
the free democrats have also distanced themselves from deuse 's comments .
fdp general secretary dirk niebel said acts of violence and xenophobic attitudes should not be relativized .

organizers are predicting that this year 's event will be more successful than ever . the 6-day trade fair first launched in 1924 , this year reflects the growth of the entire consumer electronic sector and boasts over 1,200 exhibitors from 32 countries .
showcasing the latest products from the entertainment and communications industry , it is expected to attract over 200,000 visitors .
with unique trade visitor services , special events and a comprehensive program for consumers , the trade show has become an annual appointment for both industry experts and the general public .
" in comparison to 2006 , we have managed to set an all-time record -lrb- of members of the press in attendance -rrb- , " said ifa 's ceo christian göke ahead of the opening . " we are especially pleased that this increase in figures is also a national one . "
flat panels a favorite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers love their flat screens within the electronic industry , current sales are dominated by the number one growth motor , television .
experts predict that some 40 million tube televisions will be replaced by flat screens in the new few years , although the boom observed in the wake of the world cup in 2006 did not continue in the first half of 2007 .
meanwhile , the growth in the classic entertainment electronics industry was less notable than in the private communications and information technology sector .
the overall market for consumer electronics grew by 4.9 percent , whereby the largest growth was in the area of private telecommunications and it .
entertainment electronics grew by just 2.6 percent .
" in this instance , we need to bear in mind last year 's world cup effect , " said rainer hecker from the association for entertainment electronics .
" nonetheless , further growth has also been realized here in germany . "
experts hope that ifa will also help reinvigorate the market for the second half of the year .
retailers usually place billions of euros of orders with importers and manufacturers during the event .
this year , electronics industry is expecting a boost in turnover of 2 percent up to 23 billion euros with the new televisions , digital cameras , mp-3 players , navigation systems as well as video games , mobile ' phones and notebooks .
for the time being , it seems that the hike in vat earlier this year has failed to dampen consumer enthusiasm in germany .
economic optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are spending again ifa director jens heithecker points to other factors influencing the market .
" as far as consumers are concerned , " he said , " consumer electronics have never been such good value .
televisions are up to 30 percent cheaper because new models are arriving all the time and competition is very tough . "
in this respect , the increased vat plays an unexpectedly minor role in consumer decisions , while the general upswing in the german economy has triggered a renewed interest in quality products .
while visitor interest is growing at ifa , the actual event is too .
this year , it encompasses some 104,00 square meters of site in berlin - a 10 percent larger surface area than last year 's trade fair .
" these days , we 're more international than ever , " said a spokesman from the association for entertainment electronics .

his aim : to usher in a new era of trans-atlantic cooperation on climate protection . " we can and must steer the trend toward energy policy and ecology , and we hold the key in our hand , " steinmeier said .
stressing that the us and europe are among the most innovative economies in the world , he warned that the entire world faced catastrophic consequences if it fails to act .
" we will experience more flooding , more hurricanes , more heat-related deaths , more drought and ruined crops , more deserts , more refugees , more displacement and destitution , " he said .
during talks with californian governor arnold schwarzenegger in sacramento , the two leaders agreed that germany and california should team up in the fight against global warming .
" contact between german and us companies is an obvious option , " said steinmeier , pointing to the state 's pioneering record on use of renewable energies .
california is the world 's sixth largest economy and a trailblazer in the area of climate policy despite washington 's foot-dragging .

steinmeier 's visit is expected to provide an extra boost to schwarzenegger 's environmental agenda , as california prepares to introduce the european system of carbon unit trading - a system so far rejected by president bush .
experts feel that europe 's experience with the system can provide california with a blueprint for possible pitfalls to avoid .
two years ago , schwarzenegger championed legislation to reduce the state 's carbon emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020 .
according to afp news service , his climate action team has identified 40 strategies to reduce global warming , including the carbon-trading program , a million-home solar energy initiative , and plans for a hydrogen highway stretching from british columbia to mexico .
he has ordered the state 's electricity suppliers to produce 20 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2010 and signed environmental agreements with britain , states in australia , canada and mexico and with the us states of arizona , oregon , new mexico , new york , utah and washington .

" a long apparent mistrust within europe towards the us is increasingly replaced by indifference and even skepticism , " he said .
mending this relationship was crucial , steinmeier said in a speech thursday night to the commonwealth club in san francisco , the oldest and largest public affairs forum in the united states .
" in coming decades , in this era of globalization , europe and the us will become more dependent on one another than ever , " he said .

deuse told the newspaper that the recent attack in mügeln , in the eastern german state of saxony , was not racially motivated , adding that he was " proud to be german " .
the free democrat afterwards told the dpa news agency that he had been unaware of the newspaper 's political orientation and that his mention of national pride was in connection with the world cup hosted by germany last year .
" i detest right-wing violence , " he added .
not the first controversial remark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing scene in eastern germany is said to be stronger than in western germany deuse had already come under fire for earlier comments to the press about the incident in which the indians were chased and attacked by a mob .
witnesses said a number had also shouted racist slogans , such as " foreigners out " .
" anyone can come out with such slogans from time to time , " deuse told financial times germany .
initially , he had also denied the perpetrators were from mügeln where he said there was no right-wing scene .
the general secretary of central council of the jews in germany , stephan kramer , said in a television interview for germany 's n24 : " the mayor is the mirror of the society that elected him . "
no-go zones in eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the faces of the battered indians caused shame in germany he also referred to " democracy-free zones " in eastern germany where the rule of law does not apply .
asked whether he would go for a walk at night in an eastern german town , he said : " i would n't do it .
i 'm not tired of living . "
sebastian edathy -lrb- spd -rrb- , the chairman of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee , also said deuse should consider resigning .
he said that the situation in mügeln was completely different than that portrayed by the mayor of the town .
in mügeln " there had been a pogrom-like atmosphere aimed at fellow citizens of foreign origin , " he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung .
german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- spd -rrb- warned against any attempt to downplay what had gone on .
" looking away and playing things down are precisely the wrong approach , " he told the rheinische post .
the minister , who is responsible for the reconstruction of eastern germany , added ; " citizens and associations have to act courageously against right-wing extremist tendencies . "
minister says problem bigger in eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there has also been a protest in mügeln against the attack tiefensee also said there was a greater problem with right-wing extremism in eastern germany because there was not the same history of dealing with immigration and cultural diversity , but he also said the difficult labor market played a role in radicalizing society .
the free democrats have also distanced themselves from deuse 's comments .
fdp general secretary dirk niebel said acts of violence and xenophobic attitudes should not be relativized .
legal proceedings have been launched against 12 suspects aged between 17 and 35 , who are suspected of fomenting racial hatred and committing grievous bodily harm .
the state prosecutor 's office said , however , that there was no evidence that the attacks had been planned by right-wing extremists .

organizers are predicting that this year 's event will be more successful than ever . the 6-day trade fair first launched in 1924 , this year reflects the growth of the entire consumer electronic sector and boasts over 1,200 exhibitors from 32 countries .
showcasing the latest products from the entertainment and communications industry , it is expected to attract over 200,000 visitors .
with unique trade visitor services , special events and a comprehensive program for consumers , the trade show has become an annual appointment for both industry experts and the general public .
" in comparison to 2006 , we have managed to set an all-time record -lrb- of members of the press in attendance -rrb- , " said ifa 's ceo christian göke ahead of the opening . " we are especially pleased that this increase in figures is also a national one . "
flat panels a favorite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers love their flat screens within the electronic industry , current sales are dominated by the number one growth motor , television .
experts predict that some 40 million tube televisions will be replaced by flat screens in the new few years , although the boom observed in the wake of the world cup in 2006 did not continue in the first half of 2007 .
meanwhile , the growth in the classic entertainment electronics industry was less notable than in the private communications and information technology sector .
the overall market for consumer electronics grew by 4.9 percent , whereby the largest growth was in the area of private telecommunications and it .
entertainment electronics grew by just 2.6 percent .
" in this instance , we need to bear in mind last year 's world cup effect , " said rainer hecker from the association for entertainment electronics .
" nonetheless , further growth has also been realized here in germany . "
experts hope that ifa will also help reinvigorate the market for the second half of the year .
retailers usually place billions of euros of orders with importers and manufacturers during the event .
this year , electronics industry is expecting a boost in turnover of 2 percent up to 23 billion euros with the new televisions , digital cameras , mp-3 players , navigation systems as well as video games , mobile ' phones and notebooks .
for the time being , it seems that the hike in vat earlier this year has failed to dampen consumer enthusiasm in germany .
economic optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are spending again ifa director jens heithecker points to other factors influencing the market .
" as far as consumers are concerned , " he said , " consumer electronics have never been such good value .
televisions are up to 30 percent cheaper because new models are arriving all the time and competition is very tough . "
in this respect , the increased vat plays an unexpectedly minor role in consumer decisions , while the general upswing in the german economy has triggered a renewed interest in quality products .
while visitor interest is growing at ifa , the actual event is too .
this year , it encompasses some 104,00 square meters of site in berlin - a 10 percent larger surface area than last year 's trade fair .
" these days , we 're more international than ever , " said a spokesman from the association for entertainment electronics .
" it ranges from the international keynotes -lrb- lectures on product developments and industry trends by international top managers of the ce industry -rrb- to the international visitors and of course the global players exhibiting in berlin .

the law chiefly allows citizens from eu member states to keep their old passport if they take on german nationality . people applying for german citizenship will no longer have to give up their old passports if they come from an eu member state or from switzerland , according to a spokeswoman from the german interior ministry .
even germans who take on citizenship of other eu states or switzerland will no longer lose their nationality .
the changes come about as a result of reforms to the country 's immigration law .
until now , germans who applied for citizenship in other eu nations or in switzerland had to give up their german passport .
they , however , had the chance to apply , for a fee and prior to their citizenship application , to keep their passport .
the new changes to the law mean german citizens no longer need to do that .
according to swiss newspaper , tagesanzeiger , the new rules could be of significance for swiss-german relations .
the paper said switzerland remains the most popular destination for germans to immigrate too .
most new germans unlikely to be affected by law the changes to the immigration law allowing for increased numbers of dual citizenship holders largely went unnoticed in the media when they were made earlier this year .
rather , new regulations making it tougher for spouses of turkish citizens to move to germany prompted much heated debate .
in july this year , the german government said the number of people taking on german citizenship had risen with 124,832 getting german passports in 2006 - an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year .
most new germans , however , are unlikely to be affected by the changes in the country 's immigration law since they are n't from eu states .
in 2006 , turks made up the greatest number of new germans , as in previous years , with around 33,500 changing their nationality .
they were followed by serbian and montenegrin nationals . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 31.08.2007 ifa opens on note of optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bigger and better than ever friday saw the doors open on ifa , one of the world 's largest consumer electronics trade show .
organizers are predicting that this year 's event will be more successful than ever . the 6-day trade fair first launched in 1924 , this year reflects the growth of the entire consumer electronic sector and boasts over 1,200 exhibitors from 32 countries .
showcasing the latest products from the entertainment and communications industry , it is expected to attract over 200,000 visitors .
with unique trade visitor services , special events and a comprehensive program for consumers , the trade show has become an annual appointment for both industry experts and the general public .
" in comparison to 2006 , we have managed to set an all-time record -lrb- of members of the press in attendance -rrb- , " said ifa 's ceo christian göke ahead of the opening . " we are especially pleased that this increase in figures is also a national one . "
flat panels a favorite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers love their flat screens within the electronic industry , current sales are dominated by the number one growth motor , television .
experts predict that some 40 million tube televisions will be replaced by flat screens in the new few years , although the boom observed in the wake of the world cup in 2006 did not continue in the first half of 2007 .
meanwhile , the growth in the classic entertainment electronics industry was less notable than in the private communications and information technology sector .
the overall market for consumer electronics grew by 4.9 percent , whereby the largest growth was in the area of private telecommunications and it .
entertainment electronics grew by just 2.6 percent .
" in this instance , we need to bear in mind last year 's world cup effect , " said rainer hecker from the association for entertainment electronics .
" nonetheless , further growth has also been realized here in germany . "
experts hope that ifa will also help reinvigorate the market for the second half of the year .
retailers usually place billions of euros of orders with importers and manufacturers during the event .
this year , electronics industry is expecting a boost in turnover of 2 percent up to 23 billion euros with the new televisions , digital cameras , mp-3 players , navigation systems as well as video games , mobile ' phones and notebooks .
for the time being , it seems that the hike in vat earlier this year has failed to dampen consumer enthusiasm in germany .
economic optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are spending again ifa director jens heithecker points to other factors influencing the market .
" as far as consumers are concerned , " he said , " consumer electronics have never been such good value .
televisions are up to 30 percent cheaper because new models are arriving all the time and competition is very tough . "
in this respect , the increased vat plays an unexpectedly minor role in consumer decisions , while the general upswing in the german economy has triggered a renewed interest in quality products .
while visitor interest is growing at ifa , the actual event is too .
this year , it encompasses some 104,00 square meters of site in berlin - a 10 percent larger surface area than last year 's trade fair .
" these days , we 're more international than ever , " said a spokesman from the association for entertainment electronics .
" it ranges from the international keynotes -lrb- lectures on product developments and industry trends by international top managers of the ce industry -rrb- to the international visitors and of course the global players exhibiting in berlin .

organizers are predicting that this year 's event will be more successful than ever . the 6-day trade fair first launched in 1924 , this year reflects the growth of the entire consumer electronic sector and boasts over 1,200 exhibitors from 32 countries .
showcasing the latest products from the entertainment and communications industry , it is expected to attract over 200,000 visitors .
with unique trade visitor services , special events and a comprehensive program for consumers , the trade show has become an annual appointment for both industry experts and the general public .
" in comparison to 2006 , we have managed to set an all-time record -lrb- of members of the press in attendance -rrb- , " said ifa 's ceo christian göke ahead of the opening . " we are especially pleased that this increase in figures is also a national one . "
flat panels a favorite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers love their flat screens within the electronic industry , current sales are dominated by the number one growth motor , television .
experts predict that some 40 million tube televisions will be replaced by flat screens in the new few years , although the boom observed in the wake of the world cup in 2006 did not continue in the first half of 2007 .
meanwhile , the growth in the classic entertainment electronics industry was less notable than in the private communications and information technology sector .
the overall market for consumer electronics grew by 4.9 percent , whereby the largest growth was in the area of private telecommunications and it .
entertainment electronics grew by just 2.6 percent .
" in this instance , we need to bear in mind last year 's world cup effect , " said rainer hecker from the association for entertainment electronics .

economic optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are spending again ifa director jens heithecker points to other factors influencing the market .
" as far as consumers are concerned , " he said , " consumer electronics have never been such good value .
televisions are up to 30 percent cheaper because new models are arriving all the time and competition is very tough . "
in this respect , the increased vat plays an unexpectedly minor role in consumer decisions , while the general upswing in the german economy has triggered a renewed interest in quality products .
while visitor interest is growing at ifa , the actual event is too .
this year , it encompasses some 104,00 square meters of site in berlin - a 10 percent larger surface area than last year 's trade fair .
" these days , we 're more international than ever , " said a spokesman from the association for entertainment electronics .

youtube has taken videos that promote nazi propaganda off its web site after jewish leaders in germany considered taking legal action . after coming under intense pressure from politicians and jewish groups for featuring far-right propaganda on its file-sharing web site youtube , google germany has agreed to remove the offending videos .
earlier this week , germany 's central council of jews contacted youtube administrators and the german authority for youth protection on the internet to demand that material glorifying nazi ideology be deleted .

" this content is illegal and in breach of youtube guidelines . "

built in 1904 in the neo-romanesque style , the ryke street synagogue was attacked during the infamous night of violence during which adolf hitler ’ s followers torched jewish homes , businesses and places of worship .
while the synagogue was desecrated , it was not burned down , apparently because the nazis feared causing damage to the surrounding buildings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jewish community see great hope in the reopening now , after a colorful history which also saw it fall under communist rule , the synagogue has been reborn as symbol of the rebirth of the jewish community in the german capital .
ninety-four year-old rabbi leo trepp , who had preached at the synagogue in the 1930s and was one of the rabbis who was seized and deported to the sachsenhausen concentration camp along with many of congregation members , called the reopening a " miracle " .
synagogue 's rebirth " a miracle " trepp was among the guests at the inauguration ceremony in the restored building with political leaders and holocaust survivors from around the world .
" it is a miracle that there are jews in germany again , " trepp told reporters .
" and the synagogue on rykestrasse , which survived two different regimes , is the symbol of that miracle , " he said .
the synagogue 's architects ruth golan and kay zareh used three surviving black-and-white photographs of the original building to recreate its remarkable elegance .
" it is now the most beautiful synagogue in germany , " the cultural affairs director of the berlin 's jewish community , peter sauerbaum , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the synagogue survived some of germany 's most testing times german interior minister wolfgang schäuble and the president of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , also took part in the opening ceremony in central berlin .
the opening coincides with the start of the capital 's annual jewish cultural days , which includes a series of concerts at the newly restored synagogue .
israeli pop star david broza and violinist daniel hope will be among the performers taking part in the 10-day festival , which runs to september 9 .
on sunday , a new cultural center is being formally opened in the western part of berlin for the chabad-lubavitch branch of orthodox jews .
a feature of the center , which cost 5 million euros , is a 30-metre replica of part of the wailing wall in jerusalem , built with stone from around the city .
colorful history under two regimes the reopening of the synagogue marks a remarkable return to grandeur since its last prayer service at the berlin synagogue took place in april 1940 .
after world war ii , it was first used to house jewish survivors of the holocaust in eastern europe before reopening in 1953 and becoming home to the east berlin 's jewish community after the capital was divided .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the synagogue out-lived the nazis and communism over the years after 1967 , the synagogue was gradually renovated , and the most recent works have seen the restoration of the colored-glass interior .
with german unification in 1990 , the synagogue served an influx of jewish immigrants from russia which continues to make germany 's 120,000-strong jewish community one of the fastest-growing in the world .
the synagogue can accommodate some 1,200 worshippers . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

built in 1904 in the neo-romanesque style , the ryke street synagogue was attacked during the infamous night of violence during which adolf hitler ’ s followers torched jewish homes , businesses and places of worship .
while the synagogue was desecrated , it was not burned down , apparently because the nazis feared causing damage to the surrounding buildings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jewish community see great hope in the reopening now , after a colorful history which also saw it fall under communist rule , the synagogue has been reborn as symbol of the rebirth of the jewish community in the german capital .
ninety-four year-old rabbi leo trepp , who had preached at the synagogue in the 1930s and was one of the rabbis who was seized and deported to the sachsenhausen concentration camp along with many of congregation members , called the reopening a " miracle " .
synagogue 's rebirth " a miracle " trepp was among the guests at the inauguration ceremony in the restored building with political leaders and holocaust survivors from around the world .
" it is a miracle that there are jews in germany again , " trepp told reporters .
" and the synagogue on rykestrasse , which survived two different regimes , is the symbol of that miracle , " he said .
the synagogue 's architects ruth golan and kay zareh used three surviving black-and-white photographs of the original building to recreate its remarkable elegance .
" it is now the most beautiful synagogue in germany , " the cultural affairs director of the berlin 's jewish community , peter sauerbaum , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the synagogue survived some of germany 's most testing times german interior minister wolfgang schäuble and the president of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , also took part in the opening ceremony in central berlin .
the opening coincides with the start of the capital 's annual jewish cultural days , which includes a series of concerts at the newly restored synagogue .
israeli pop star david broza and violinist daniel hope will be among the performers taking part in the 10-day festival , which runs to september 9 .
on sunday , a new cultural center is being formally opened in the western part of berlin for the chabad-lubavitch branch of orthodox jews .
a feature of the center , which cost 5 million euros , is a 30-metre replica of part of the wailing wall in jerusalem , built with stone from around the city .
colorful history under two regimes the reopening of the synagogue marks a remarkable return to grandeur since its last prayer service at the berlin synagogue took place in april 1940 .
after world war ii , it was first used to house jewish survivors of the holocaust in eastern europe before reopening in 1953 and becoming home to the east berlin 's jewish community after the capital was divided .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the synagogue out-lived the nazis and communism over the years after 1967 , the synagogue was gradually renovated , and the most recent works have seen the restoration of the colored-glass interior .
with german unification in 1990 , the synagogue served an influx of jewish immigrants from russia which continues to make germany 's 120,000-strong jewish community one of the fastest-growing in the world .
the synagogue can accommodate some 1,200 worshippers . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

most new germans unlikely to be affected by law the changes to the immigration law allowing for increased numbers of dual citizenship holders largely went unnoticed in the media when they were made earlier this year .
rather , new regulations making it tougher for spouses of turkish citizens to move to germany prompted much heated debate .
in july this year , the german government said the number of people taking on german citizenship had risen with 124,832 getting german passports in 2006 - an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year .
most new germans , however , are unlikely to be affected by the changes in the country 's immigration law since they are n't from eu states .
in 2006 , turks made up the greatest number of new germans , as in previous years , with around 33,500 changing their nationality .
they were followed by serbian and montenegrin nationals . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

organizers are predicting that this year 's event will be more successful than ever . the 6-day trade fair first launched in 1924 , this year reflects the growth of the entire consumer electronic sector and boasts over 1,200 exhibitors from 32 countries .
showcasing the latest products from the entertainment and communications industry , it is expected to attract over 200,000 visitors .
with unique trade visitor services , special events and a comprehensive program for consumers , the trade show has become an annual appointment for both industry experts and the general public .
" in comparison to 2006 , we have managed to set an all-time record -lrb- of members of the press in attendance -rrb- , " said ifa 's ceo christian göke ahead of the opening . " we are especially pleased that this increase in figures is also a national one . "

experts predict that some 40 million tube televisions will be replaced by flat screens in the new few years , although the boom observed in the wake of the world cup in 2006 did not continue in the first half of 2007 .
meanwhile , the growth in the classic entertainment electronics industry was less notable than in the private communications and information technology sector .
the overall market for consumer electronics grew by 4.9 percent , whereby the largest growth was in the area of private telecommunications and it .
entertainment electronics grew by just 2.6 percent .
" in this instance , we need to bear in mind last year 's world cup effect , " said rainer hecker from the association for entertainment electronics .
" nonetheless , further growth has also been realized here in germany . "
experts hope that ifa will also help reinvigorate the market for the second half of the year .
retailers usually place billions of euros of orders with importers and manufacturers during the event .
this year , electronics industry is expecting a boost in turnover of 2 percent up to 23 billion euros with the new televisions , digital cameras , mp-3 players , navigation systems as well as video games , mobile ' phones and notebooks .
for the time being , it seems that the hike in vat earlier this year has failed to dampen consumer enthusiasm in germany .
economic optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are spending again ifa director jens heithecker points to other factors influencing the market .
" as far as consumers are concerned , " he said , " consumer electronics have never been such good value .
televisions are up to 30 percent cheaper because new models are arriving all the time and competition is very tough . "
in this respect , the increased vat plays an unexpectedly minor role in consumer decisions , while the general upswing in the german economy has triggered a renewed interest in quality products .
while visitor interest is growing at ifa , the actual event is too .
this year , it encompasses some 104,00 square meters of site in berlin - a 10 percent larger surface area than last year 's trade fair .
" these days , we 're more international than ever , " said a spokesman from the association for entertainment electronics .

deuse told the newspaper that the recent attack in mügeln , in the eastern german state of saxony , was not racially motivated , adding that he was " proud to be german " .
the free democrat afterwards told the dpa news agency that he had been unaware of the newspaper 's political orientation and that his mention of national pride was in connection with the world cup hosted by germany last year .
" i detest right-wing violence , " he added .

at the time , tehran proclaimed " industrial " enrichment capacity , a level starting with 3,000 centrifuges running at supersonic speed .
saying it was reacting to the eu 's political decision to raise the stakes in the nuclear row with iran , the german government on thursday said it was imposing a general ban on all arms deals with iran .
allegations of spying that includes the sale , export as well as transfer of all military goods to teheran .
in addition , german firms will no longer be able to import military equipment from the country irrespective of their origin .
berlin also underlined it was prohibiting the export of all so-called dual-use goods , that can be used both for military and civilian purposes , to another eu member state if the goods were meant to be supplied to iran from there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reactor building of the bushehr nuclear power plant , south of the capital tehran some german firms have been under suspicion for illegally supplying parts for iran 's nuclear program .
in july this year , the prosecutor 's office in potsdam , near berlin , said it had been looking into illegal exports to iran since september 2004 .
in defiance of a ban on nuclear trade , some german companies exported equipment to iran 's bushehr atomic reactor on the persian gulf .
the move comes amid warnings by germany 's domestic intelligence services of a new spying offensive in the country by foreign secret services , including from iran .
in an interview with german weekly die zeit , hartwig möller , head of the regional intelligence agency in the western state of north-rhine westphalia , said the iranian secret service was intensively trying to get access to high-tech construction plans in the state in order to get information about military technology .
" it 's all about getting know-how for the nuclear program , " möller said .
" significant step forward " on thursday , however a report by the iaea , the un nuclear watchdog agency , obtained by some news agencies , said iran 's nuclear work was far below the industrial level vaunted by tehran in april .
iran struck a deal with the international atomic energy agency on aug .
21 to answer questions about the nature of its program which iran says is aimed purely at electricity production .
" the work plan is a significant step forward , " said the iaea report , but it added resolving current issues was not enough to give iran 's nuclear work a clean bill of health . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

showcasing the latest products from the entertainment and communications industry , it is expected to attract over 200,000 visitors .
with unique trade visitor services , special events and a comprehensive program for consumers , the trade show has become an annual appointment for both industry experts and the general public .
" in comparison to 2006 , we have managed to set an all-time record -lrb- of members of the press in attendance -rrb- , " said ifa 's ceo christian göke ahead of the opening . " we are especially pleased that this increase in figures is also a national one . "

experts predict that some 40 million tube televisions will be replaced by flat screens in the new few years , although the boom observed in the wake of the world cup in 2006 did not continue in the first half of 2007 .
meanwhile , the growth in the classic entertainment electronics industry was less notable than in the private communications and information technology sector .
the overall market for consumer electronics grew by 4.9 percent , whereby the largest growth was in the area of private telecommunications and it .
entertainment electronics grew by just 2.6 percent .

" as far as consumers are concerned , " he said , " consumer electronics have never been such good value .
televisions are up to 30 percent cheaper because new models are arriving all the time and competition is very tough . "
in this respect , the increased vat plays an unexpectedly minor role in consumer decisions , while the general upswing in the german economy has triggered a renewed interest in quality products .
while visitor interest is growing at ifa , the actual event is too .
this year , it encompasses some 104,00 square meters of site in berlin - a 10 percent larger surface area than last year 's trade fair .
" these days , we 're more international than ever , " said a spokesman from the association for entertainment electronics .

the law chiefly allows citizens from eu member states to keep their old passport if they take on german nationality . people applying for german citizenship will no longer have to give up their old passports if they come from an eu member state or from switzerland , according to a spokeswoman from the german interior ministry .
even germans who take on citizenship of other eu states or switzerland will no longer lose their nationality .
the changes come about as a result of reforms to the country 's immigration law .
until now , germans who applied for citizenship in other eu nations or in switzerland had to give up their german passport .

in july this year , the german government said the number of people taking on german citizenship had risen with 124,832 getting german passports in 2006 - an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year .

the law chiefly allows citizens from eu member states to keep their old passport if they take on german nationality . people applying for german citizenship will no longer have to give up their old passports if they come from an eu member state or from switzerland , according to a spokeswoman from the german interior ministry .
even germans who take on citizenship of other eu states or switzerland will no longer lose their nationality .
the changes come about as a result of reforms to the country 's immigration law .
until now , germans who applied for citizenship in other eu nations or in switzerland had to give up their german passport .
they , however , had the chance to apply , for a fee and prior to their citizenship application , to keep their passport .
the new changes to the law mean german citizens no longer need to do that .
according to swiss newspaper , tagesanzeiger , the new rules could be of significance for swiss-german relations .
the paper said switzerland remains the most popular destination for germans to immigrate too .
most new germans unlikely to be affected by law the changes to the immigration law allowing for increased numbers of dual citizenship holders largely went unnoticed in the media when they were made earlier this year .
rather , new regulations making it tougher for spouses of turkish citizens to move to germany prompted much heated debate .
in july this year , the german government said the number of people taking on german citizenship had risen with 124,832 getting german passports in 2006 - an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year .
most new germans , however , are unlikely to be affected by the changes in the country 's immigration law since they are n't from eu states .

built in 1904 in the neo-romanesque style , the ryke street synagogue was attacked during the infamous night of violence during which adolf hitler ’ s followers torched jewish homes , businesses and places of worship .
while the synagogue was desecrated , it was not burned down , apparently because the nazis feared causing damage to the surrounding buildings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jewish community see great hope in the reopening now , after a colorful history which also saw it fall under communist rule , the synagogue has been reborn as symbol of the rebirth of the jewish community in the german capital .
ninety-four year-old rabbi leo trepp , who had preached at the synagogue in the 1930s and was one of the rabbis who was seized and deported to the sachsenhausen concentration camp along with many of congregation members , called the reopening a " miracle " .
synagogue 's rebirth " a miracle " trepp was among the guests at the inauguration ceremony in the restored building with political leaders and holocaust survivors from around the world .
" it is a miracle that there are jews in germany again , " trepp told reporters .
" and the synagogue on rykestrasse , which survived two different regimes , is the symbol of that miracle , " he said .

israeli pop star david broza and violinist daniel hope will be among the performers taking part in the 10-day festival , which runs to september 9 .
on sunday , a new cultural center is being formally opened in the western part of berlin for the chabad-lubavitch branch of orthodox jews .
a feature of the center , which cost 5 million euros , is a 30-metre replica of part of the wailing wall in jerusalem , built with stone from around the city .
colorful history under two regimes the reopening of the synagogue marks a remarkable return to grandeur since its last prayer service at the berlin synagogue took place in april 1940 .
after world war ii , it was first used to house jewish survivors of the holocaust in eastern europe before reopening in 1953 and becoming home to the east berlin 's jewish community after the capital was divided .

his aim : to usher in a new era of trans-atlantic cooperation on climate protection . " we can and must steer the trend toward energy policy and ecology , and we hold the key in our hand , " steinmeier said .
stressing that the us and europe are among the most innovative economies in the world , he warned that the entire world faced catastrophic consequences if it fails to act .
" we will experience more flooding , more hurricanes , more heat-related deaths , more drought and ruined crops , more deserts , more refugees , more displacement and destitution , " he said .
during talks with californian governor arnold schwarzenegger in sacramento , the two leaders agreed that germany and california should team up in the fight against global warming .
" contact between german and us companies is an obvious option , " said steinmeier , pointing to the state 's pioneering record on use of renewable energies .
california is the world 's sixth largest economy and a trailblazer in the area of climate policy despite washington 's foot-dragging .
he 'll be back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california was the first state to impose a cap on all greenhouse gas emissions schwarzenegger accepted an invitation to attend a climate conference sponsored by the portuguese eu presidency in lisbon on oct .
29 , steinmeier said after the meeting .
schwarzenegger also agreed to visit germany , explaining that his state was keen to work with germany because of its track record and " gigantic goals " in building alternative energy sources to protect the climate .
steinmeier 's visit is expected to provide an extra boost to schwarzenegger 's environmental agenda , as california prepares to introduce the european system of carbon unit trading - a system so far rejected by president bush .
experts feel that europe 's experience with the system can provide california with a blueprint for possible pitfalls to avoid .
two years ago , schwarzenegger championed legislation to reduce the state 's carbon emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020 .
according to afp news service , his climate action team has identified 40 strategies to reduce global warming , including the carbon-trading program , a million-home solar energy initiative , and plans for a hydrogen highway stretching from british columbia to mexico .
he has ordered the state 's electricity suppliers to produce 20 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2010 and signed environmental agreements with britain , states in australia , canada and mexico and with the us states of arizona , oregon , new mexico , new york , utah and washington .
thawing climate , thawing tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq caused a rift between europe and the us steinmeier also took the opportunity to warn of the " creeping political alienation " between the us and europe , and called for a profound renewal of their alliance .
" a long apparent mistrust within europe towards the us is increasingly replaced by indifference and even skepticism , " he said .
mending this relationship was crucial , steinmeier said in a speech thursday night to the commonwealth club in san francisco , the oldest and largest public affairs forum in the united states .
" in coming decades , in this era of globalization , europe and the us will become more dependent on one another than ever , " he said .
" for this reason i hope we can revive old sympathies , define common issues for the future and rediscover one another . "
calling for " new way of thinking , " he pointed to cooperation on environmental issues but also in business .
" a political regulation of capital and finance markets should also occur , so that stock market crises do not escalate into global economic disasters and speculators are not in a position to push people around the globe into poverty and desperation , " he said .
he also called for a greater involvement of russia in solving international issues .
" we need russia if we are to secure global stability , " he said .

his aim : to usher in a new era of trans-atlantic cooperation on climate protection . " we can and must steer the trend toward energy policy and ecology , and we hold the key in our hand , " steinmeier said .
stressing that the us and europe are among the most innovative economies in the world , he warned that the entire world faced catastrophic consequences if it fails to act .
" we will experience more flooding , more hurricanes , more heat-related deaths , more drought and ruined crops , more deserts , more refugees , more displacement and destitution , " he said .
during talks with californian governor arnold schwarzenegger in sacramento , the two leaders agreed that germany and california should team up in the fight against global warming .
" contact between german and us companies is an obvious option , " said steinmeier , pointing to the state 's pioneering record on use of renewable energies .
california is the world 's sixth largest economy and a trailblazer in the area of climate policy despite washington 's foot-dragging .

29 , steinmeier said after the meeting .
schwarzenegger also agreed to visit germany , explaining that his state was keen to work with germany because of its track record and " gigantic goals " in building alternative energy sources to protect the climate .
steinmeier 's visit is expected to provide an extra boost to schwarzenegger 's environmental agenda , as california prepares to introduce the european system of carbon unit trading - a system so far rejected by president bush .
experts feel that europe 's experience with the system can provide california with a blueprint for possible pitfalls to avoid .
two years ago , schwarzenegger championed legislation to reduce the state 's carbon emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020 .
according to afp news service , his climate action team has identified 40 strategies to reduce global warming , including the carbon-trading program , a million-home solar energy initiative , and plans for a hydrogen highway stretching from british columbia to mexico .
he has ordered the state 's electricity suppliers to produce 20 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2010 and signed environmental agreements with britain , states in australia , canada and mexico and with the us states of arizona , oregon , new mexico , new york , utah and washington .

" a long apparent mistrust within europe towards the us is increasingly replaced by indifference and even skepticism , " he said .
mending this relationship was crucial , steinmeier said in a speech thursday night to the commonwealth club in san francisco , the oldest and largest public affairs forum in the united states .
" in coming decades , in this era of globalization , europe and the us will become more dependent on one another than ever , " he said .
" for this reason i hope we can revive old sympathies , define common issues for the future and rediscover one another . "
calling for " new way of thinking , " he pointed to cooperation on environmental issues but also in business .
" a political regulation of capital and finance markets should also occur , so that stock market crises do not escalate into global economic disasters and speculators are not in a position to push people around the globe into poverty and desperation , " he said .
he also called for a greater involvement of russia in solving international issues .

investigators said that between 140 to 160 tons of tainted meat from bavaria had been supplied since june , 2006 to various food companies in berlin .
until now , authorities were talking of a meat scandal involving around 31 tons of the decayed stuff .
the meat , which was deemed " unfit " for human consumption , came from a bavarian company and ended up at fast-food stands across eight states after being processed in berlin .
the scandal came to light after a tip-off by a lorry driver to the police .

deuse told the newspaper that the recent attack in mügeln , in the eastern german state of saxony , was not racially motivated , adding that he was " proud to be german " .
the free democrat afterwards told the dpa news agency that he had been unaware of the newspaper 's political orientation and that his mention of national pride was in connection with the world cup hosted by germany last year .
" i detest right-wing violence , " he added .
not the first controversial remark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing scene in eastern germany is said to be stronger than in western germany deuse had already come under fire for earlier comments to the press about the incident in which the indians were chased and attacked by a mob .
witnesses said a number had also shouted racist slogans , such as " foreigners out " .
" anyone can come out with such slogans from time to time , " deuse told financial times germany .
initially , he had also denied the perpetrators were from mügeln where he said there was no right-wing scene .
the general secretary of central council of the jews in germany , stephan kramer , said in a television interview for germany 's n24 : " the mayor is the mirror of the society that elected him . "

asked whether he would go for a walk at night in an eastern german town , he said : " i would n't do it .
i 'm not tired of living . "
sebastian edathy -lrb- spd -rrb- , the chairman of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee , also said deuse should consider resigning .
he said that the situation in mügeln was completely different than that portrayed by the mayor of the town .
in mügeln " there had been a pogrom-like atmosphere aimed at fellow citizens of foreign origin , " he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung .
german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- spd -rrb- warned against any attempt to downplay what had gone on .
" looking away and playing things down are precisely the wrong approach , " he told the rheinische post .
the minister , who is responsible for the reconstruction of eastern germany , added ; " citizens and associations have to act courageously against right-wing extremist tendencies . "
minister says problem bigger in eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there has also been a protest in mügeln against the attack tiefensee also said there was a greater problem with right-wing extremism in eastern germany because there was not the same history of dealing with immigration and cultural diversity , but he also said the difficult labor market played a role in radicalizing society .
the free democrats have also distanced themselves from deuse 's comments .
fdp general secretary dirk niebel said acts of violence and xenophobic attitudes should not be relativized .
legal proceedings have been launched against 12 suspects aged between 17 and 35 , who are suspected of fomenting racial hatred and committing grievous bodily harm .
the state prosecutor 's office said , however , that there was no evidence that the attacks had been planned by right-wing extremists .

deuse told the newspaper that the recent attack in mügeln , in the eastern german state of saxony , was not racially motivated , adding that he was " proud to be german " .
the free democrat afterwards told the dpa news agency that he had been unaware of the newspaper 's political orientation and that his mention of national pride was in connection with the world cup hosted by germany last year .
" i detest right-wing violence , " he added .
not the first controversial remark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing scene in eastern germany is said to be stronger than in western germany deuse had already come under fire for earlier comments to the press about the incident in which the indians were chased and attacked by a mob .
witnesses said a number had also shouted racist slogans , such as " foreigners out " .
" anyone can come out with such slogans from time to time , " deuse told financial times germany .
initially , he had also denied the perpetrators were from mügeln where he said there was no right-wing scene .
the general secretary of central council of the jews in germany , stephan kramer , said in a television interview for germany 's n24 : " the mayor is the mirror of the society that elected him . "

asked whether he would go for a walk at night in an eastern german town , he said : " i would n't do it .
i 'm not tired of living . "
sebastian edathy -lrb- spd -rrb- , the chairman of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee , also said deuse should consider resigning .
he said that the situation in mügeln was completely different than that portrayed by the mayor of the town .
in mügeln " there had been a pogrom-like atmosphere aimed at fellow citizens of foreign origin , " he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung .
german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- spd -rrb- warned against any attempt to downplay what had gone on .
" looking away and playing things down are precisely the wrong approach , " he told the rheinische post .
the minister , who is responsible for the reconstruction of eastern germany , added ; " citizens and associations have to act courageously against right-wing extremist tendencies . "
minister says problem bigger in eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there has also been a protest in mügeln against the attack tiefensee also said there was a greater problem with right-wing extremism in eastern germany because there was not the same history of dealing with immigration and cultural diversity , but he also said the difficult labor market played a role in radicalizing society .
the free democrats have also distanced themselves from deuse 's comments .
fdp general secretary dirk niebel said acts of violence and xenophobic attitudes should not be relativized .
legal proceedings have been launched against 12 suspects aged between 17 and 35 , who are suspected of fomenting racial hatred and committing grievous bodily harm .

youtube has taken videos that promote nazi propaganda off its web site after jewish leaders in germany considered taking legal action . after coming under intense pressure from politicians and jewish groups for featuring far-right propaganda on its file-sharing web site youtube , google germany has agreed to remove the offending videos .
earlier this week , germany 's central council of jews contacted youtube administrators and the german authority for youth protection on the internet to demand that material glorifying nazi ideology be deleted .
a number of politicians called for a legal investigation into the matter .
after youtube failed to react , a number of jewish leaders announced they were considering legal action .
clamping down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : users will also help monitor content but in an interview with the online version of stern magazine thursday , google spokesman kay oberbeck said the video community platform would be removing the material , which numbers hundreds of videos .
" we very definitely want to distance ourselves from any videos that incite hatred , " he said .
" this content is illegal and in breach of youtube guidelines . "
" clearly , youtube has a vested interest in removing illegal , inflammatory videos from the platform , " he added .
in future , he said , youtube will operate more stringent controls of the material posted on the site , with users encouraged to help monitor material .
" our complaints system designed to pinpoint such breaches of the law will have to be improved with the help of our users , " oberbeck said .
" no system is perfect , and we intend to work very hard to operate tighter controls . "

deuse told the newspaper that the recent attack in mügeln , in the eastern german state of saxony , was not racially motivated , adding that he was " proud to be german " .
the free democrat afterwards told the dpa news agency that he had been unaware of the newspaper 's political orientation and that his mention of national pride was in connection with the world cup hosted by germany last year .
" i detest right-wing violence , " he added .
not the first controversial remark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing scene in eastern germany is said to be stronger than in western germany deuse had already come under fire for earlier comments to the press about the incident in which the indians were chased and attacked by a mob .
witnesses said a number had also shouted racist slogans , such as " foreigners out " .
" anyone can come out with such slogans from time to time , " deuse told financial times germany .
initially , he had also denied the perpetrators were from mügeln where he said there was no right-wing scene .
the general secretary of central council of the jews in germany , stephan kramer , said in a television interview for germany 's n24 : " the mayor is the mirror of the society that elected him . "
no-go zones in eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the faces of the battered indians caused shame in germany he also referred to " democracy-free zones " in eastern germany where the rule of law does not apply .
asked whether he would go for a walk at night in an eastern german town , he said : " i would n't do it .
i 'm not tired of living . "
sebastian edathy -lrb- spd -rrb- , the chairman of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee , also said deuse should consider resigning .
he said that the situation in mügeln was completely different than that portrayed by the mayor of the town .
in mügeln " there had been a pogrom-like atmosphere aimed at fellow citizens of foreign origin , " he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung .
german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- spd -rrb- warned against any attempt to downplay what had gone on .
" looking away and playing things down are precisely the wrong approach , " he told the rheinische post .
the minister , who is responsible for the reconstruction of eastern germany , added ; " citizens and associations have to act courageously against right-wing extremist tendencies . "
minister says problem bigger in eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there has also been a protest in mügeln against the attack tiefensee also said there was a greater problem with right-wing extremism in eastern germany because there was not the same history of dealing with immigration and cultural diversity , but he also said the difficult labor market played a role in radicalizing society .
the free democrats have also distanced themselves from deuse 's comments .
fdp general secretary dirk niebel said acts of violence and xenophobic attitudes should not be relativized .
legal proceedings have been launched against 12 suspects aged between 17 and 35 , who are suspected of fomenting racial hatred and committing grievous bodily harm .
the state prosecutor 's office said , however , that there was no evidence that the attacks had been planned by right-wing extremists .

the law chiefly allows citizens from eu member states to keep their old passport if they take on german nationality . people applying for german citizenship will no longer have to give up their old passports if they come from an eu member state or from switzerland , according to a spokeswoman from the german interior ministry .
even germans who take on citizenship of other eu states or switzerland will no longer lose their nationality .
the changes come about as a result of reforms to the country 's immigration law .
until now , germans who applied for citizenship in other eu nations or in switzerland had to give up their german passport .
they , however , had the chance to apply , for a fee and prior to their citizenship application , to keep their passport .
the new changes to the law mean german citizens no longer need to do that .
according to swiss newspaper , tagesanzeiger , the new rules could be of significance for swiss-german relations .
the paper said switzerland remains the most popular destination for germans to immigrate too .
most new germans unlikely to be affected by law the changes to the immigration law allowing for increased numbers of dual citizenship holders largely went unnoticed in the media when they were made earlier this year .
rather , new regulations making it tougher for spouses of turkish citizens to move to germany prompted much heated debate .
in july this year , the german government said the number of people taking on german citizenship had risen with 124,832 getting german passports in 2006 - an increase of 6.5 percent over the previous year .
most new germans , however , are unlikely to be affected by the changes in the country 's immigration law since they are n't from eu states .
in 2006 , turks made up the greatest number of new germans , as in previous years , with around 33,500 changing their nationality .
they were followed by serbian and montenegrin nationals . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

organizers are predicting that this year 's event will be more successful than ever . the 6-day trade fair first launched in 1924 , this year reflects the growth of the entire consumer electronic sector and boasts over 1,200 exhibitors from 32 countries .
showcasing the latest products from the entertainment and communications industry , it is expected to attract over 200,000 visitors .
with unique trade visitor services , special events and a comprehensive program for consumers , the trade show has become an annual appointment for both industry experts and the general public .
" in comparison to 2006 , we have managed to set an all-time record -lrb- of members of the press in attendance -rrb- , " said ifa 's ceo christian göke ahead of the opening . " we are especially pleased that this increase in figures is also a national one . "
flat panels a favorite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers love their flat screens within the electronic industry , current sales are dominated by the number one growth motor , television .
experts predict that some 40 million tube televisions will be replaced by flat screens in the new few years , although the boom observed in the wake of the world cup in 2006 did not continue in the first half of 2007 .
meanwhile , the growth in the classic entertainment electronics industry was less notable than in the private communications and information technology sector .
the overall market for consumer electronics grew by 4.9 percent , whereby the largest growth was in the area of private telecommunications and it .
entertainment electronics grew by just 2.6 percent .
" in this instance , we need to bear in mind last year 's world cup effect , " said rainer hecker from the association for entertainment electronics .
" nonetheless , further growth has also been realized here in germany . "
experts hope that ifa will also help reinvigorate the market for the second half of the year .
retailers usually place billions of euros of orders with importers and manufacturers during the event .
this year , electronics industry is expecting a boost in turnover of 2 percent up to 23 billion euros with the new televisions , digital cameras , mp-3 players , navigation systems as well as video games , mobile ' phones and notebooks .
for the time being , it seems that the hike in vat earlier this year has failed to dampen consumer enthusiasm in germany .
economic optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are spending again ifa director jens heithecker points to other factors influencing the market .
" as far as consumers are concerned , " he said , " consumer electronics have never been such good value .
televisions are up to 30 percent cheaper because new models are arriving all the time and competition is very tough . "
in this respect , the increased vat plays an unexpectedly minor role in consumer decisions , while the general upswing in the german economy has triggered a renewed interest in quality products .
while visitor interest is growing at ifa , the actual event is too .
this year , it encompasses some 104,00 square meters of site in berlin - a 10 percent larger surface area than last year 's trade fair .
" these days , we 're more international than ever , " said a spokesman from the association for entertainment electronics .
" it ranges from the international keynotes -lrb- lectures on product developments and industry trends by international top managers of the ce industry -rrb- to the international visitors and of course the global players exhibiting in berlin .

youtube has taken videos that promote nazi propaganda off its web site after jewish leaders in germany considered taking legal action . after coming under intense pressure from politicians and jewish groups for featuring far-right propaganda on its file-sharing web site youtube , google germany has agreed to remove the offending videos .
earlier this week , germany 's central council of jews contacted youtube administrators and the german authority for youth protection on the internet to demand that material glorifying nazi ideology be deleted .
a number of politicians called for a legal investigation into the matter .
after youtube failed to react , a number of jewish leaders announced they were considering legal action .
clamping down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : users will also help monitor content but in an interview with the online version of stern magazine thursday , google spokesman kay oberbeck said the video community platform would be removing the material , which numbers hundreds of videos .
" we very definitely want to distance ourselves from any videos that incite hatred , " he said .
" this content is illegal and in breach of youtube guidelines . "
" clearly , youtube has a vested interest in removing illegal , inflammatory videos from the platform , " he added .
in future , he said , youtube will operate more stringent controls of the material posted on the site , with users encouraged to help monitor material .
" our complaints system designed to pinpoint such breaches of the law will have to be improved with the help of our users , " oberbeck said .
" no system is perfect , and we intend to work very hard to operate tighter controls . "
however , legal observers argue that youtube is based in the us , which enforces laws protecting free speech .

deuse told the newspaper that the recent attack in mügeln , in the eastern german state of saxony , was not racially motivated , adding that he was " proud to be german " .
the free democrat afterwards told the dpa news agency that he had been unaware of the newspaper 's political orientation and that his mention of national pride was in connection with the world cup hosted by germany last year .
" i detest right-wing violence , " he added .
not the first controversial remark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing scene in eastern germany is said to be stronger than in western germany deuse had already come under fire for earlier comments to the press about the incident in which the indians were chased and attacked by a mob .
witnesses said a number had also shouted racist slogans , such as " foreigners out " .
" anyone can come out with such slogans from time to time , " deuse told financial times germany .
initially , he had also denied the perpetrators were from mügeln where he said there was no right-wing scene .

sebastian edathy -lrb- spd -rrb- , the chairman of the bundestag 's interior affairs committee , also said deuse should consider resigning .
he said that the situation in mügeln was completely different than that portrayed by the mayor of the town .
in mügeln " there had been a pogrom-like atmosphere aimed at fellow citizens of foreign origin , " he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung .
german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- spd -rrb- warned against any attempt to downplay what had gone on .
" looking away and playing things down are precisely the wrong approach , " he told the rheinische post .
the minister , who is responsible for the reconstruction of eastern germany , added ; " citizens and associations have to act courageously against right-wing extremist tendencies . "
minister says problem bigger in eastern germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there has also been a protest in mügeln against the attack tiefensee also said there was a greater problem with right-wing extremism in eastern germany because there was not the same history of dealing with immigration and cultural diversity , but he also said the difficult labor market played a role in radicalizing society .
the free democrats have also distanced themselves from deuse 's comments .
fdp general secretary dirk niebel said acts of violence and xenophobic attitudes should not be relativized .
