if you want people to take notice of what you 're doing , show lots of couples having rampant sex in your promotional video . when it comes to institutions with a sexy image , the european commission is hardly the playboy mansion .
and apart from commission vice president günther verheugen 's alleged penchant for going au natural , there are also very few candidates in line to be the bloc 's hugh hefner .
both may be reasons why the eu is now using a bunch of beautiful young things engaging in steamy scenes to promote the eu 's media fund which helps distribute successful european movies around the continent .
sex montage promotes eu cinema bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel : not in the video and not enjoying a " sensual " moment in one clip , which has , unsurprisingly , attracted the most attention , eighteen different couples have sex in a montage of love scenes culled from european cinema .
the 44-second mini skin flick , shown on the bloc 's eutube internet video channel , has had over 120,000 people logging on to get an eyeful of the writhing flesh and ecstatic moans and groans .
it is by far the most-watched video on the channel and has double the viewing figures of the next most popular : a short film about eu humanitarian aid which contains no sex whatsoever and only partial nudity .
however , the sexing-up of the eu has not gone down well and has been hard for some in the bloc to swallow , so to speak .
one of the passionate scenes involving two men has drawn a flood of complaints from poland , a country where recent anti-gay rhetoric has caused uncomfortable ripples around europe .
no puritans in the eu apparently bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlikely to make poles more enthusiastic for the eu but commission media spokesperson martin selmayr is unapologetic . " the european union is not the bible belt , " he said .
" these clips come from award-winning films and they show the eu 's rich cinematic heritage , which we can all be proud of . "
" what can i say ? "
eu communication spokesperson mikolaj dowglielewicz added .
" it does n't always have to be about press releases .
these clips explain better what the eu is doing . "
this might explain why it takes so long for anything to get done in brussels . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu commissioner verheugen in hot water over nudist snaps despite official statements saying that no eu rules have been broken , european commission vice president günter verheugen is at the center of a growing scandal over nude photos of him on holiday with a female assistant .
-lrb- 08.12.2006 -rrb- the eu in search of a second life bureaucracy in brussels , strife in the balkans and a disinterested constituency in most places in between - that 's reality in the eu .
now the bloc thinks a parallel existence in cyberspace might be preferable .
-lrb- 13.03.2007 -rrb- the best of " from the fringe " germans might have a reputation of being a little grim and glum , but they 're not all sourpusses .
they can laugh or be laughable at times , and you can chuckle right along .
read up on the farcical side of germany .

she says children and young people are particularly tempted to take up the habit by smoking scenes in films and on tv . german television should show less people smoking , according to the country 's federal drug commissioner sabine bätzing . " there has been a shift in thinking at the broadcasters , " bätzing said in berlin on tuesday . bätzing was presenting a study entitled " smoking in film and television , " which is now being published in full .
the study , commissioned by the federal health ministry , came to the conclusion that there was more smoking in german series and films than in foreign productions , and significantly influences the smoking habits of children and young people . the study 's initial results were released in november .
as a result , bätzing contacted directors and those responsible for programming at the country 's public and private television stations . " they signaled a willingness to see to it that not smoking would be emphasized in their programming , " bätzing said . smoking stars as role models according to the study , film scenes with cigarettes entice children and young people to begin smoking themselves .
the study said their risk to become a smoker doubled when films they watched often contained scenes with smoking . bätzing said it was therefore necessary for the media to take its task as a role model seriously . stars who smoked were strong examples for children and youth , she said , encouraging more sensitivity and restraint from filmmakers and stations .

she says children and young people are particularly tempted to take up the habit by smoking scenes in films and on tv . german television should show less people smoking , according to the country 's federal drug commissioner sabine bätzing . " there has been a shift in thinking at the broadcasters , " bätzing said in berlin on tuesday . bätzing was presenting a study entitled " smoking in film and television , " which is now being published in full .
the study , commissioned by the federal health ministry , came to the conclusion that there was more smoking in german series and films than in foreign productions , and significantly influences the smoking habits of children and young people . the study 's initial results were released in november .
as a result , bätzing contacted directors and those responsible for programming at the country 's public and private television stations . " they signaled a willingness to see to it that not smoking would be emphasized in their programming , " bätzing said . smoking stars as role models according to the study , film scenes with cigarettes entice children and young people to begin smoking themselves .
the study said their risk to become a smoker doubled when films they watched often contained scenes with smoking . bätzing said it was therefore necessary for the media to take its task as a role model seriously . stars who smoked were strong examples for children and youth , she said , encouraging more sensitivity and restraint from filmmakers and stations . " smoking in films and on television is not a dramaturgical means free of values , " bätzing said . the german upper house of parliament bundesrat will decide on friday on smoking bans in federal offices , public buses and trains . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's highest court dismissed a complaint concerning the bundestag 's decision to deploy six reconnaissance aircraft to southern afghanistan . the left party had filed a complaint with germany 's federal constitutional court .
the pacifist party , made up mainly of disgruntled social democrats and former communist party members , charged that the parliament 's decision to allow the mission violated a 1955 law governing germany 's role in nato .
the six tornado warplanes have been used to fly reconnaissance missions for nato forces since mid-april .
the planes are accompanied by approximately 200 military personnel .

the country 's highest court dismissed a complaint concerning the bundestag 's decision to deploy six reconnaissance aircraft to southern afghanistan . the left party had filed a complaint with germany 's federal constitutional court .
the pacifist party , made up mainly of disgruntled social democrats and former communist party members , charged that the parliament 's decision to allow the mission violated a 1955 law governing germany 's role in nato .
the six tornado warplanes have been used to fly reconnaissance missions for nato forces since mid-april .
the planes are accompanied by approximately 200 military personnel .
under the mandate given to them , bundeswehr troops are prohibited from participating in combat missions .
members of the left party have said they are concerned that the tornado deployment would lead to troops becoming mired in fighting .
politicians welcome ruling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are part of a nato peacekeeping mission german defense minister franz josef jung welcomed the ruling and said he expects the parliament to approve an extension of the mandate this fall .
" i am happy the constitutional court confirmed the position of the government that the deployment of the tornado jets is constitutional and complies with our basic law , " he said at a security conference in berlin .
" i think that is an important message for our soldiers , who are making an important contribution to peace and stability .
the tornados offer protection to our soldiers and the -lrb- civilian -rrb- population . " the court ruled that the mission serves to protect " the security of the euro-atlantic region . " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier echoed jung 's comments , saying the tornado jets were helping with the security and rebuilding of afghanistan .
planes can stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three german soldiers were killed in afghanistan this spring the court ruled the parliament did not exceed its authority and dismissed the case tuesday , saying that the german government should be allowed maneuvering room in questions of foreign policy .
germany currently has about 3,000 soldiers serving with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission in the north of the country .
the tornados are equipped with two high-tech optical cameras along with an infra-red sensor in a pod slung below the fuselage .
their mission is to spy out taliban positions in the southern provinces of helmand , kandahar and uruzgan , where british , canadian and dutch troops are deployed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung has been a supporter of keeping troops in afghanistan under the terms of their six-month mission , they will not fly at low- level and will not be used to bomb taliban positions .
the german government has been adamant that the planes will not be used as fighter jets . " the reconnaissance gathered by our tornadoes will bring more stability and security to afghanistan , " german defense minister franz josef jung said when the planes were first deployed . " their mission is to protect isaf troops , as well as civilian aid workers and the afghan population . " public opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the constitutional court hand down their opinion the tornado mission will last until october under its current mandate .
a lengthy debate is expected this autumn when the bundestag debates an extension of the bundeswehr 's nato mandate . deployment of tornado jets has been controversial with the german public as well .
surveys show that many fear germany will become a target for terrorists if the bundeswehr is seen as aiding nato 's mission in afghanistan .
a poll by the tns institute earlier this spring showed 57 percent of those surveyed wanted a complete withdrawal of german troops from afghanistan , while 36 percent were in favor of continued engagement . only 4 percent backed increasing the german military presence . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a study at cologne university has revealed that turkish attitudes differ significantly from those of eu nationals when it comes to freedom of religion and gender equality .
but this could change if turkey joined the eu . citizens in practically all eu nations support the bloc 's basic principles : freedom of religion , democracy , gender equality and the rule of law .
according to a sociologist 's study at cologne university , however , turkey assumed an exceptional position when it came to freedom of religion and gender equality . " two basic eu principles are not being supported , " said frederike wuermeling , the author of the study .
although eu europeans varied in their attitudes , turkey held a " distinct marginal position " within europe , she said . only one-third of turks backed gender equality .
when it came to freedom of religion , only 16 percent explicitly agreed to this principle , the study revealed . however , turkey was in line with other eu countries when it came to the principles of the rule of law .
in terms of democratic principles , 87.9 percent of those surveyed in turkey supported this notion .
but 66.1 percent also said they considered a strong leader important , who did n't have to attend to the parliament . wealth and religion play a decisive role the study was based on data from the european values survey .
it had questioned some 1,000 respondents in each of the 27 eu member states , as well as in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this turkish artist questions his country 's eu compatibility according to wuermeling , turkey 's economic underdevelopment , as well as the country 's high percentage of muslims played a decisive role in this case . " there is a positive connection between a country 's wealth and the acceptance of eu principles , " wuermeling told dw-world.de. she said this meant that economic improvement could lead to a change in values . " this has been the case in the history of the eu , " wuermeling said .
" one can assume that it becomes more likely that a privileged partnership or eu membership would lead to a shift in values in turkey . "
a stronger orientation towards performance could make religion and traditional family structures less important . at the moment , however , this was not the case . " turkey does not fit into the eu at this time , " wuermeling said . turkey began negotiating for membership in the eu in 2005 .
last week , the eu resumed official accession talks with turkey , even though its membership is not guaranteed .
diplomats estimate that it could take 10 to 15 years to reach a result . religious reservations also exist in eu nations the study 's findings supported the so-called hypothesis of modernization .
it assumes that the higher a country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , level of education and degree of urbanization , the higher the agreement to eu principles .
the analysis also backed the cultural hypothesis , which states that the higher the percentage of muslims in a country and the higher the level of individual religious belief , the lower the agreement to eu principles . wuermeling 's study said that the biggest advocates of all four eu principles were sweden and denmark . in three european countries , the study noted a negative attitude .

eu commission president jose manuel barroso meanwhile said that renegotiation is out of the question . members of the league of polish families , which forms part of poland 's right-wing coalition government , have said they will oppose adoption of the new treaty as it does not comply with polish family values and national interests , according to news reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roman giertych said he wants poland 's interests put first " we will appeal to the public and to law and justice not to ratify the treaty , " said the league 's leader , deputy prime minister roman giertych , referring to the conservative party of president lech kaczynski and prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski .
" we will start a campaign against the treaty because , thanks to germany , it includes amendments which are putting eu interests ahead of poland 's interests . "
it is still not clear whether poland will ratify the treaty via referendum or through parliamentary approval .
the treaty will create an eu president and a foreign policy chief and make it easier to reach decisions in the long term by changing the current unanimous voting structure .
the agreement , however , falls short of an eu constitution , the draft of which was rejected by french and dutch voters and faced strong resistance from poland 's twin leaders .
according to reuters news service , the league has been blamed for the rise of xenophobia and racism in poland by the european parliament .
the party opposed the country 's eu membership in 2004 and has long held anti-german views .
no more negotiations eu commission president jose manuel barroso meanwhile said that there was no way to restart negotiations on the treaty , which leaders from the 27-member eu agreed to in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said the time for negotiation is over " none of the issues which were agreed upon can be reopened again , " barroso told journalists during a visit to portugal to mark the beginning of the country 's eu presidency .
portugal is now in charge of drafting the new treaty , which portuguese prime minister jose socrates aims to have ready by october .
" the portuguese presidency has received a mandate to produce a new treaty , and in the mandate it does n't say : ' oh , by the way , you can revise the mandate , " ' said socrates at the same news conference with barroso .

eu commission president jose manuel barroso meanwhile said that renegotiation is out of the question . members of the league of polish families , which forms part of poland 's right-wing coalition government , have said they will oppose adoption of the new treaty as it does not comply with polish family values and national interests , according to news reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roman giertych said he wants poland 's interests put first " we will appeal to the public and to law and justice not to ratify the treaty , " said the league 's leader , deputy prime minister roman giertych , referring to the conservative party of president lech kaczynski and prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski .
" we will start a campaign against the treaty because , thanks to germany , it includes amendments which are putting eu interests ahead of poland 's interests . "
it is still not clear whether poland will ratify the treaty via referendum or through parliamentary approval .
the treaty will create an eu president and a foreign policy chief and make it easier to reach decisions in the long term by changing the current unanimous voting structure .
the agreement , however , falls short of an eu constitution , the draft of which was rejected by french and dutch voters and faced strong resistance from poland 's twin leaders .
according to reuters news service , the league has been blamed for the rise of xenophobia and racism in poland by the european parliament .
the party opposed the country 's eu membership in 2004 and has long held anti-german views .
no more negotiations eu commission president jose manuel barroso meanwhile said that there was no way to restart negotiations on the treaty , which leaders from the 27-member eu agreed to in june .

portugal is now in charge of drafting the new treaty , which portuguese prime minister jose socrates aims to have ready by october .
" the portuguese presidency has received a mandate to produce a new treaty , and in the mandate it does n't say : ' oh , by the way , you can revise the mandate , " ' said socrates at the same news conference with barroso .

george w. bush and vladimir putin struck a relaxed tone after their recent meeting in the united states , where both presidents searched for middle ground on the contentious issue of a us missile defense system in europe . us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin met at bush family 's oceanfront compound in kennebunkport , maine .
the two leaders hoped mend relations that have frayed in recent months over a number of issues concerning europe , including independence for kosovo and sanctions against iran .
but the us ' plans to station part of a missile defense shield in europe were at the top of the agenda .
while neither side backed down from their positions , bush and putin seemed ready to widen the dialogue within europe and to include nato in discussions .
" such cooperation , i believe , would result in raising to an entirely new level the quality of cooperation between russia and the united states , " putin said .
" for all practical purposes , this would lead to a great deal of development of strategic partnership in the area of security . "
" i 'm in strong agreement with that concept , " bush said of the proposal to widen the dialogue .
eastern europe still contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin had hoped a personal meeting would clear the clouds hanging over relations russia has expressed its opposition to the us proposal of setting up defensive missiles in poland and a radar tracking station in the czech republic .
while the us insisted the system would protect against rogue states such as iran , russia sees itself as a target .
at last month 's group of eight summit in germany , putin had suggested an alternative : a joint us-russia defense system located in azerbaijan .
on monday , putin surprised bush by proposing that the defense system be extended to other parts of europe , with nato participation .
bush welcomed the idea as " very constructive and bold " but insisted that the czech republic and poland remain " integral " to the system .
changing tones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin want to send a shared message the meeting was seen as fostering us-russian dialog in what the media called the presidents ' " lobster summit " after bush and putin went fishing together , with putin reeling in a striped bass .
the two seemed more relaxed than they had at the g8 meeting last month .
" the kennebunkport meeting seems to have succeeded in rekindling a sense of camaraderie between the two leaders , " charles kupchan , professor of international affairs at washington 's georgetown university told the afp news agency .
" but there does n't seem to have been substantial progress on reaching concrete agreements on any of the major areas of dispute . "
putin 's offer could be a serious alternative to the current plan , said kupchan , who was the head of european affairs on the national security council under former us president bill clinton .
but the offer could also be putin trying to divert us attention and stall the deployment of the defense system in eastern europe , kupchan added .
bush 's national security advisor stephen hadley said he believes putin wants to cooperate with the us , but acknowledged discussions remain in the preliminary stages .
" what you saw was a very interesting shift and some real progress on this issue , " hadley said .
iranian question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear plans remain a point of dispute between russia and the usa how to handle iran 's nuclear ambitions has also been a contentious issue between the us and russia .
" when russia and america speak along the same lines , it tends to have an effect , " bush said , adding that he and putin had agreed to send a common message .
but finding common ground could prove difficult as the us and its european allies accuse iran of using its nuclear program as a cover to build atomic weapons and are pushing for tougher un sanctions against tehran .
moscow , however , has maintained that iran has cooperated with un nuclear inspectors and sees progress in bringing iran into further compliance .
" so far , we have managed to work within the framework of the security council , and i think we will continue to be successful in this track , " putin said .
the future of the serbian province of kosovo was also a contentious issue with russia and the us having different views on the country 's future .

these are foreign policy decisions that are on the edge of what is constitutionally revisable . still , the court 's ruling will have an influence on german foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german parliament gave its approval to the tornados ' mission that the administration will not get away everything it wants is clear and obvious .
at the beginning of the year it still said it could decide everything on its own and did not need parliamentary approval .
that it did not need a new mandate for the tornados and that everything was covered by the existing mandate .
the court would probably have said : that 's not the way things work .
but the administration understood it and got a new mandate , but the government gave it a try and that 's a grey area . how willing is the federal constitutional court to get involved in highly political questions ? there is no general answer for that .
the general line is that it is not like the us supreme court , which can and does say " that 's a purely political issue , we 're not getting involved . "
the federal constitutional court does not have that right under the german constitution .
it has to decide on all the points of law brought before it - no matter how political they may be . does that make it possible for the court to be abused to serve political goals ?
how can the court defend itself from being over politicized ? a very old saying from a previous president of the reich 's court said to attempt to separate purely political issues from purely legal issues would be like trying to separate flowers into those that are poisonous and those that smell good .
it 's something the federal constitutional court can not do , even if it sometimes manages to on the sly .
when it considers highly political question the court has at times said an issue needs to be respected as being within the margin of political decision making or the prerogative of political debate . ulrich battis was interviewed by sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu commission president jose manuel barroso meanwhile said that renegotiation is out of the question . members of the league of polish families , which forms part of poland 's right-wing coalition government , have said they will oppose adoption of the new treaty as it does not comply with polish family values and national interests , according to news reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roman giertych said he wants poland 's interests put first " we will appeal to the public and to law and justice not to ratify the treaty , " said the league 's leader , deputy prime minister roman giertych , referring to the conservative party of president lech kaczynski and prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski .
" we will start a campaign against the treaty because , thanks to germany , it includes amendments which are putting eu interests ahead of poland 's interests . "
it is still not clear whether poland will ratify the treaty via referendum or through parliamentary approval .
the treaty will create an eu president and a foreign policy chief and make it easier to reach decisions in the long term by changing the current unanimous voting structure .
the agreement , however , falls short of an eu constitution , the draft of which was rejected by french and dutch voters and faced strong resistance from poland 's twin leaders .
according to reuters news service , the league has been blamed for the rise of xenophobia and racism in poland by the european parliament .
the party opposed the country 's eu membership in 2004 and has long held anti-german views .

a study at cologne university has revealed that turkish attitudes differ significantly from those of eu nationals when it comes to freedom of religion and gender equality .
but this could change if turkey joined the eu . citizens in practically all eu nations support the bloc 's basic principles : freedom of religion , democracy , gender equality and the rule of law .
according to a sociologist 's study at cologne university , however , turkey assumed an exceptional position when it came to freedom of religion and gender equality . " two basic eu principles are not being supported , " said frederike wuermeling , the author of the study .
although eu europeans varied in their attitudes , turkey held a " distinct marginal position " within europe , she said . only one-third of turks backed gender equality .
when it came to freedom of religion , only 16 percent explicitly agreed to this principle , the study revealed . however , turkey was in line with other eu countries when it came to the principles of the rule of law .
in terms of democratic principles , 87.9 percent of those surveyed in turkey supported this notion .
but 66.1 percent also said they considered a strong leader important , who did n't have to attend to the parliament . wealth and religion play a decisive role the study was based on data from the european values survey .
it had questioned some 1,000 respondents in each of the 27 eu member states , as well as in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this turkish artist questions his country 's eu compatibility according to wuermeling , turkey 's economic underdevelopment , as well as the country 's high percentage of muslims played a decisive role in this case . " there is a positive connection between a country 's wealth and the acceptance of eu principles , " wuermeling told dw-world.de. she said this meant that economic improvement could lead to a change in values . " this has been the case in the history of the eu , " wuermeling said .
" one can assume that it becomes more likely that a privileged partnership or eu membership would lead to a shift in values in turkey . "
a stronger orientation towards performance could make religion and traditional family structures less important . at the moment , however , this was not the case . " turkey does not fit into the eu at this time , " wuermeling said . turkey began negotiating for membership in the eu in 2005 .
last week , the eu resumed official accession talks with turkey , even though its membership is not guaranteed .
diplomats estimate that it could take 10 to 15 years to reach a result . religious reservations also exist in eu nations the study 's findings supported the so-called hypothesis of modernization .
it assumes that the higher a country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , level of education and degree of urbanization , the higher the agreement to eu principles .
the analysis also backed the cultural hypothesis , which states that the higher the percentage of muslims in a country and the higher the level of individual religious belief , the lower the agreement to eu principles . wuermeling 's study said that the biggest advocates of all four eu principles were sweden and denmark . in three european countries , the study noted a negative attitude .

a study at cologne university has revealed that turkish attitudes differ significantly from those of eu nationals when it comes to freedom of religion and gender equality .
but this could change if turkey joined the eu . citizens in practically all eu nations support the bloc 's basic principles : freedom of religion , democracy , gender equality and the rule of law .
according to a sociologist 's study at cologne university , however , turkey assumed an exceptional position when it came to freedom of religion and gender equality . " two basic eu principles are not being supported , " said frederike wuermeling , the author of the study .
although eu europeans varied in their attitudes , turkey held a " distinct marginal position " within europe , she said . only one-third of turks backed gender equality .
when it came to freedom of religion , only 16 percent explicitly agreed to this principle , the study revealed . however , turkey was in line with other eu countries when it came to the principles of the rule of law .
in terms of democratic principles , 87.9 percent of those surveyed in turkey supported this notion .

the country 's highest court dismissed a complaint concerning the bundestag 's decision to deploy six reconnaissance aircraft to southern afghanistan . the left party had filed a complaint with germany 's federal constitutional court .
the pacifist party , made up mainly of disgruntled social democrats and former communist party members , charged that the parliament 's decision to allow the mission violated a 1955 law governing germany 's role in nato .
the six tornado warplanes have been used to fly reconnaissance missions for nato forces since mid-april .

she says children and young people are particularly tempted to take up the habit by smoking scenes in films and on tv . german television should show less people smoking , according to the country 's federal drug commissioner sabine bätzing . " there has been a shift in thinking at the broadcasters , " bätzing said in berlin on tuesday . bätzing was presenting a study entitled " smoking in film and television , " which is now being published in full .
the study , commissioned by the federal health ministry , came to the conclusion that there was more smoking in german series and films than in foreign productions , and significantly influences the smoking habits of children and young people . the study 's initial results were released in november .
as a result , bätzing contacted directors and those responsible for programming at the country 's public and private television stations . " they signaled a willingness to see to it that not smoking would be emphasized in their programming , " bätzing said . smoking stars as role models according to the study , film scenes with cigarettes entice children and young people to begin smoking themselves .
the study said their risk to become a smoker doubled when films they watched often contained scenes with smoking . bätzing said it was therefore necessary for the media to take its task as a role model seriously . stars who smoked were strong examples for children and youth , she said , encouraging more sensitivity and restraint from filmmakers and stations . " smoking in films and on television is not a dramaturgical means free of values , " bätzing said . the german upper house of parliament bundesrat will decide on friday on smoking bans in federal offices , public buses and trains . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" obviously germany will make its contribution to achieving the targets , " she said , adding that the basic target was to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
only if other nations joined in would germany expand the cut to 30 or 40 percent .
merkel said she could not promise that before negotiations were finished .
incentives to save energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel , merkel and glos after an earlier energy summit last year the chancellor also told reporters that economics minister michael glos and environment minister sigmar gabriel , who attended the meetings , would jointly work on a concept for a new energy and climate change policy to reach germany 's target to cut co2 emissions . gabriel said that the government 's proposals would be finalized by the fall and decided on before the un climate conference in december . he added that incentives to improve insulation and heating systems in buildings were under consideration .
germans would also be encouraged to use waste heat from power stations and buy power-saving home appliances , he said .
industry representatives , meanwhile , expressed their concerns about the government 's plans , saying that the goal to lower co2 emissions by 40 percent was unrealistic .

" obviously germany will make its contribution to achieving the targets , " she said , adding that the basic target was to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
only if other nations joined in would germany expand the cut to 30 or 40 percent .
merkel said she could not promise that before negotiations were finished .
incentives to save energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel , merkel and glos after an earlier energy summit last year the chancellor also told reporters that economics minister michael glos and environment minister sigmar gabriel , who attended the meetings , would jointly work on a concept for a new energy and climate change policy to reach germany 's target to cut co2 emissions . gabriel said that the government 's proposals would be finalized by the fall and decided on before the un climate conference in december . he added that incentives to improve insulation and heating systems in buildings were under consideration .
germans would also be encouraged to use waste heat from power stations and buy power-saving home appliances , he said .
industry representatives , meanwhile , expressed their concerns about the government 's plans , saying that the goal to lower co2 emissions by 40 percent was unrealistic .

she also criticized energy providers for rising prices at the earliest opportunity after price caps expired on july 1 .

economics minister glos , a member of the christian social union , the sister party of merkel 's christian democratic union , favors keeping nuclear power longer so as to hold down co2 emissions .

the overall interest in all things gdr is also on the rise . the number of germans wanting to see the files the former east german secret service kept on them has increased , a report released in berlin on tuesday found .
according to the annual report , around 97,000 germans applied for access to their stasi files in 2006 , an increase of 20 percent from the previous year .
marianne birthler , the government official in charge of the stasi files archive , said that the number of people wanting to see their files was just one aspect of the overall increase in interest in the history of east germany .
the trend , she said , was continuing into 2007 with more than 7,000 people per month applying for access to files .
birthler said that the increase in interest was also on the rise in schools . " we have a new generation of people who have questions , " she said at the report 's launch . a big draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an installation at the stasi museum in berlin interest in the gdr and the stasi in the west is also on the increase thanks to a wave of historical and fictional publications on the east and successful german films such as 1999 's " sonnenallee " and 2007 's oscar-winning " das leben der anderen " -lrb- the lives of others -rrb- .
birthler believes that there is not as much stigma attached to the stasi files as before , prompting more people to come forward to read their own .
there is also a desire to learn how the east german regime operated and the gdr 's role in the wider history of germany .
older generation still harbors suspicions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birthler 's colleagues were investigated while time and shifts in perception and culture continue to slowly change the way the stasi and its activities are seen by younger germans , many who lived under the communist regime still hold deep-rooted suspicions of those once involved with the secret service .
birthler 's own department was the subject of an investigation last year after it was revealed that former stasi operatives had been employed there . birthler rejected the accusations that the employment of former stasi members in " sensitive areas " of the archives was a security risk , calling them " absurd . "
the investigation eventually led to a number of employees being moved to other jobs . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the existence of a real european high-speed network , which remains little known , needs to be made known to customers , " said sncf chief executive guillaume pepy . along with sncf , the alliance - dubbed railteam - will include germany 's deutsche bahn , oebb of austria , sncb of belgium , ns of the netherlands , cff of switzerland and eurostar uk of britain . taking their cue from airline networks skyteam , star alliance and one world , the companies want to make connections easier by improving scheduling and hooking up reservation systems . however , for the time being , the main innovation will be that if someone misses a connection because of a delay on the first leg of a trip , the passenger will be able to take the next train without having to get a new ticket . making rail travel easier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one ticket could see you leave frankfurt and arrive in london from january 2009 , passengers will need only one ticket for a cross-border trip with multiple connections , making it possible for example to go from frankfurt to london passing through paris on a single ticket . eventually , the alliance is to introduce customer fidelity programs that would allow passengers to accumulate points that could be used on the network as is already common in the airline industry . in order to avoid problems with antitrust regulators , members of the alliance would not agree on prices and would continue to set their own rates on routes currently covered by more than one of them . railteam aims to transport 25 million passengers per year as of 2010 from 15 million currently with high-speed rail lines expected to be extended by a third by 2020 to 15,000 kilometers -lrb- 9,300 miles -rrb- . while the rail companies themselves will be laughing all the way to the bank , the alliance will also have environmentalists beaming from ear to ear , especially in germany . trains urged to meet environmental challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving budget airlines the red card earlier this year , german environment minister sigmar gabriel encouraged germans to take the train more often as part of the effort .
gabriel told the german tabloid bild in april that he planned to further subsidize germany 's extensive railway system to lure travelers away from inexpensive short-haul flights with airlines such as germanwings or ryanair . " we must ensure that train services are able to compete with air travel , " gabriel said , and suggested that train tickets should qualify for a sales tax break that would allow deutsche bahn ag to reduce ticket prices for consumers . " there is no tax on airline fuel , but the rail operator must pay the full value-added tax on the sale of long-distance tickets , " gabriel complained to the bundestag .
" that is unfair and can not remain that way . " super-fast rail link leads the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tgv-ice link aims to attract those who would normally fly much has been made about the environmental cost of operating so many cheap no-frill flights around europe and the train industry has regularly been told to pull its socks up in terms of offering a competitive alternative . only last month , deutsche bahn and sncf opened a new high-speed train link between paris and frankfurt which would provide fast connections to luxembourg and switzerland and cut the travel time between the french capital and frankfurt by two-and-a-half hours .

gabriel told the german tabloid bild in april that he planned to further subsidize germany 's extensive railway system to lure travelers away from inexpensive short-haul flights with airlines such as germanwings or ryanair . " we must ensure that train services are able to compete with air travel , " gabriel said , and suggested that train tickets should qualify for a sales tax break that would allow deutsche bahn ag to reduce ticket prices for consumers . " there is no tax on airline fuel , but the rail operator must pay the full value-added tax on the sale of long-distance tickets , " gabriel complained to the bundestag .
" that is unfair and can not remain that way . " super-fast rail link leads the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tgv-ice link aims to attract those who would normally fly much has been made about the environmental cost of operating so many cheap no-frill flights around europe and the train industry has regularly been told to pull its socks up in terms of offering a competitive alternative . only last month , deutsche bahn and sncf opened a new high-speed train link between paris and frankfurt which would provide fast connections to luxembourg and switzerland and cut the travel time between the french capital and frankfurt by two-and-a-half hours .
the new link was sold as a viable alternative to flying between the two neighboring countries . the new railteam alliance may also be another reason to stay on the rails . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the beginning of the year it still said it could decide everything on its own and did not need parliamentary approval .
that it did not need a new mandate for the tornados and that everything was covered by the existing mandate .
the court would probably have said : that 's not the way things work .
but the administration understood it and got a new mandate , but the government gave it a try and that 's a grey area . how willing is the federal constitutional court to get involved in highly political questions ? there is no general answer for that .
the general line is that it is not like the us supreme court , which can and does say " that 's a purely political issue , we 're not getting involved . "
the federal constitutional court does not have that right under the german constitution .
it has to decide on all the points of law brought before it - no matter how political they may be . does that make it possible for the court to be abused to serve political goals ?
how can the court defend itself from being over politicized ? a very old saying from a previous president of the reich 's court said to attempt to separate purely political issues from purely legal issues would be like trying to separate flowers into those that are poisonous and those that smell good .
it 's something the federal constitutional court can not do , even if it sometimes manages to on the sly .
when it considers highly political question the court has at times said an issue needs to be respected as being within the margin of political decision making or the prerogative of political debate . ulrich battis was interviewed by sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two leaders hoped mend relations that have frayed in recent months over a number of issues concerning europe , including independence for kosovo and sanctions against iran .
but the us ' plans to station part of a missile defense shield in europe were at the top of the agenda .
while neither side backed down from their positions , bush and putin seemed ready to widen the dialogue within europe and to include nato in discussions .
" such cooperation , i believe , would result in raising to an entirely new level the quality of cooperation between russia and the united states , " putin said .
" for all practical purposes , this would lead to a great deal of development of strategic partnership in the area of security . "
" i 'm in strong agreement with that concept , " bush said of the proposal to widen the dialogue .
eastern europe still contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin had hoped a personal meeting would clear the clouds hanging over relations russia has expressed its opposition to the us proposal of setting up defensive missiles in poland and a radar tracking station in the czech republic .
while the us insisted the system would protect against rogue states such as iran , russia sees itself as a target .
at last month 's group of eight summit in germany , putin had suggested an alternative : a joint us-russia defense system located in azerbaijan .
on monday , putin surprised bush by proposing that the defense system be extended to other parts of europe , with nato participation .
bush welcomed the idea as " very constructive and bold " but insisted that the czech republic and poland remain " integral " to the system .
changing tones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin want to send a shared message the meeting was seen as fostering us-russian dialog in what the media called the presidents ' " lobster summit " after bush and putin went fishing together , with putin reeling in a striped bass .
the two seemed more relaxed than they had at the g8 meeting last month .
" the kennebunkport meeting seems to have succeeded in rekindling a sense of camaraderie between the two leaders , " charles kupchan , professor of international affairs at washington 's georgetown university told the afp news agency .
" but there does n't seem to have been substantial progress on reaching concrete agreements on any of the major areas of dispute . "
putin 's offer could be a serious alternative to the current plan , said kupchan , who was the head of european affairs on the national security council under former us president bill clinton .
but the offer could also be putin trying to divert us attention and stall the deployment of the defense system in eastern europe , kupchan added .
bush 's national security advisor stephen hadley said he believes putin wants to cooperate with the us , but acknowledged discussions remain in the preliminary stages .
" what you saw was a very interesting shift and some real progress on this issue , " hadley said .
iranian question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear plans remain a point of dispute between russia and the usa how to handle iran 's nuclear ambitions has also been a contentious issue between the us and russia .
" when russia and america speak along the same lines , it tends to have an effect , " bush said , adding that he and putin had agreed to send a common message .
but finding common ground could prove difficult as the us and its european allies accuse iran of using its nuclear program as a cover to build atomic weapons and are pushing for tougher un sanctions against tehran .
moscow , however , has maintained that iran has cooperated with un nuclear inspectors and sees progress in bringing iran into further compliance .
" so far , we have managed to work within the framework of the security council , and i think we will continue to be successful in this track , " putin said .
the future of the serbian province of kosovo was also a contentious issue with russia and the us having different views on the country 's future .

putin 's offer could be a serious alternative to the current plan , said kupchan , who was the head of european affairs on the national security council under former us president bill clinton .
but the offer could also be putin trying to divert us attention and stall the deployment of the defense system in eastern europe , kupchan added .
bush 's national security advisor stephen hadley said he believes putin wants to cooperate with the us , but acknowledged discussions remain in the preliminary stages .
" what you saw was a very interesting shift and some real progress on this issue , " hadley said .
iranian question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear plans remain a point of dispute between russia and the usa how to handle iran 's nuclear ambitions has also been a contentious issue between the us and russia .
" when russia and america speak along the same lines , it tends to have an effect , " bush said , adding that he and putin had agreed to send a common message .
but finding common ground could prove difficult as the us and its european allies accuse iran of using its nuclear program as a cover to build atomic weapons and are pushing for tougher un sanctions against tehran .
moscow , however , has maintained that iran has cooperated with un nuclear inspectors and sees progress in bringing iran into further compliance .
" so far , we have managed to work within the framework of the security council , and i think we will continue to be successful in this track , " putin said .
the future of the serbian province of kosovo was also a contentious issue with russia and the us having different views on the country 's future .

a study at cologne university has revealed that turkish attitudes differ significantly from those of eu nationals when it comes to freedom of religion and gender equality .
but this could change if turkey joined the eu . citizens in practically all eu nations support the bloc 's basic principles : freedom of religion , democracy , gender equality and the rule of law .
according to a sociologist 's study at cologne university , however , turkey assumed an exceptional position when it came to freedom of religion and gender equality . " two basic eu principles are not being supported , " said frederike wuermeling , the author of the study .
although eu europeans varied in their attitudes , turkey held a " distinct marginal position " within europe , she said . only one-third of turks backed gender equality .
when it came to freedom of religion , only 16 percent explicitly agreed to this principle , the study revealed . however , turkey was in line with other eu countries when it came to the principles of the rule of law .
in terms of democratic principles , 87.9 percent of those surveyed in turkey supported this notion .
but 66.1 percent also said they considered a strong leader important , who did n't have to attend to the parliament . wealth and religion play a decisive role the study was based on data from the european values survey .

" this has been the case in the history of the eu , " wuermeling said .
" one can assume that it becomes more likely that a privileged partnership or eu membership would lead to a shift in values in turkey . "
a stronger orientation towards performance could make religion and traditional family structures less important . at the moment , however , this was not the case . " turkey does not fit into the eu at this time , " wuermeling said . turkey began negotiating for membership in the eu in 2005 .

a study at cologne university has revealed that turkish attitudes differ significantly from those of eu nationals when it comes to freedom of religion and gender equality .
but this could change if turkey joined the eu . citizens in practically all eu nations support the bloc 's basic principles : freedom of religion , democracy , gender equality and the rule of law .
according to a sociologist 's study at cologne university , however , turkey assumed an exceptional position when it came to freedom of religion and gender equality . " two basic eu principles are not being supported , " said frederike wuermeling , the author of the study .
although eu europeans varied in their attitudes , turkey held a " distinct marginal position " within europe , she said . only one-third of turks backed gender equality .
when it came to freedom of religion , only 16 percent explicitly agreed to this principle , the study revealed . however , turkey was in line with other eu countries when it came to the principles of the rule of law .
in terms of democratic principles , 87.9 percent of those surveyed in turkey supported this notion .
but 66.1 percent also said they considered a strong leader important , who did n't have to attend to the parliament . wealth and religion play a decisive role the study was based on data from the european values survey .
it had questioned some 1,000 respondents in each of the 27 eu member states , as well as in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this turkish artist questions his country 's eu compatibility according to wuermeling , turkey 's economic underdevelopment , as well as the country 's high percentage of muslims played a decisive role in this case . " there is a positive connection between a country 's wealth and the acceptance of eu principles , " wuermeling told dw-world.de. she said this meant that economic improvement could lead to a change in values . " this has been the case in the history of the eu , " wuermeling said .
" one can assume that it becomes more likely that a privileged partnership or eu membership would lead to a shift in values in turkey . "
a stronger orientation towards performance could make religion and traditional family structures less important . at the moment , however , this was not the case . " turkey does not fit into the eu at this time , " wuermeling said . turkey began negotiating for membership in the eu in 2005 .
last week , the eu resumed official accession talks with turkey , even though its membership is not guaranteed .
diplomats estimate that it could take 10 to 15 years to reach a result . religious reservations also exist in eu nations the study 's findings supported the so-called hypothesis of modernization .
it assumes that the higher a country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , level of education and degree of urbanization , the higher the agreement to eu principles .
the analysis also backed the cultural hypothesis , which states that the higher the percentage of muslims in a country and the higher the level of individual religious belief , the lower the agreement to eu principles . wuermeling 's study said that the biggest advocates of all four eu principles were sweden and denmark . in three european countries , the study noted a negative attitude .
in malta , with a catholic population of 97 percent , there were reservations regarding freedom of religion and equal rights .
in the predominantly orthodox greece , as well as in romania , the number of opponents to freedom of religion prevailed . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's highest court dismissed a complaint concerning the bundestag 's decision to deploy six reconnaissance aircraft to southern afghanistan . the left party had filed a complaint with germany 's federal constitutional court .
the pacifist party , made up mainly of disgruntled social democrats and former communist party members , charged that the parliament 's decision to allow the mission violated a 1955 law governing germany 's role in nato .
the six tornado warplanes have been used to fly reconnaissance missions for nato forces since mid-april .
the planes are accompanied by approximately 200 military personnel .
under the mandate given to them , bundeswehr troops are prohibited from participating in combat missions .
members of the left party have said they are concerned that the tornado deployment would lead to troops becoming mired in fighting .
politicians welcome ruling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are part of a nato peacekeeping mission german defense minister franz josef jung welcomed the ruling and said he expects the parliament to approve an extension of the mandate this fall .
" i am happy the constitutional court confirmed the position of the government that the deployment of the tornado jets is constitutional and complies with our basic law , " he said at a security conference in berlin .
" i think that is an important message for our soldiers , who are making an important contribution to peace and stability .
the tornados offer protection to our soldiers and the -lrb- civilian -rrb- population . " the court ruled that the mission serves to protect " the security of the euro-atlantic region . " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier echoed jung 's comments , saying the tornado jets were helping with the security and rebuilding of afghanistan .

germany currently has about 3,000 soldiers serving with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission in the north of the country .
the tornados are equipped with two high-tech optical cameras along with an infra-red sensor in a pod slung below the fuselage .
their mission is to spy out taliban positions in the southern provinces of helmand , kandahar and uruzgan , where british , canadian and dutch troops are deployed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung has been a supporter of keeping troops in afghanistan under the terms of their six-month mission , they will not fly at low- level and will not be used to bomb taliban positions .
the german government has been adamant that the planes will not be used as fighter jets . " the reconnaissance gathered by our tornadoes will bring more stability and security to afghanistan , " german defense minister franz josef jung said when the planes were first deployed .

a lengthy debate is expected this autumn when the bundestag debates an extension of the bundeswehr 's nato mandate . deployment of tornado jets has been controversial with the german public as well .
surveys show that many fear germany will become a target for terrorists if the bundeswehr is seen as aiding nato 's mission in afghanistan .

the country 's highest court dismissed a complaint concerning the bundestag 's decision to deploy six reconnaissance aircraft to southern afghanistan . the left party had filed a complaint with germany 's federal constitutional court .
the pacifist party , made up mainly of disgruntled social democrats and former communist party members , charged that the parliament 's decision to allow the mission violated a 1955 law governing germany 's role in nato .
the six tornado warplanes have been used to fly reconnaissance missions for nato forces since mid-april .
the planes are accompanied by approximately 200 military personnel .
under the mandate given to them , bundeswehr troops are prohibited from participating in combat missions .
members of the left party have said they are concerned that the tornado deployment would lead to troops becoming mired in fighting .

" i am happy the constitutional court confirmed the position of the government that the deployment of the tornado jets is constitutional and complies with our basic law , " he said at a security conference in berlin .
" i think that is an important message for our soldiers , who are making an important contribution to peace and stability .
the tornados offer protection to our soldiers and the -lrb- civilian -rrb- population . " the court ruled that the mission serves to protect " the security of the euro-atlantic region . " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier echoed jung 's comments , saying the tornado jets were helping with the security and rebuilding of afghanistan .

" the existence of a real european high-speed network , which remains little known , needs to be made known to customers , " said sncf chief executive guillaume pepy . along with sncf , the alliance - dubbed railteam - will include germany 's deutsche bahn , oebb of austria , sncb of belgium , ns of the netherlands , cff of switzerland and eurostar uk of britain . taking their cue from airline networks skyteam , star alliance and one world , the companies want to make connections easier by improving scheduling and hooking up reservation systems . however , for the time being , the main innovation will be that if someone misses a connection because of a delay on the first leg of a trip , the passenger will be able to take the next train without having to get a new ticket . making rail travel easier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one ticket could see you leave frankfurt and arrive in london from january 2009 , passengers will need only one ticket for a cross-border trip with multiple connections , making it possible for example to go from frankfurt to london passing through paris on a single ticket . eventually , the alliance is to introduce customer fidelity programs that would allow passengers to accumulate points that could be used on the network as is already common in the airline industry . in order to avoid problems with antitrust regulators , members of the alliance would not agree on prices and would continue to set their own rates on routes currently covered by more than one of them . railteam aims to transport 25 million passengers per year as of 2010 from 15 million currently with high-speed rail lines expected to be extended by a third by 2020 to 15,000 kilometers -lrb- 9,300 miles -rrb- . while the rail companies themselves will be laughing all the way to the bank , the alliance will also have environmentalists beaming from ear to ear , especially in germany . trains urged to meet environmental challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving budget airlines the red card earlier this year , german environment minister sigmar gabriel encouraged germans to take the train more often as part of the effort .
gabriel told the german tabloid bild in april that he planned to further subsidize germany 's extensive railway system to lure travelers away from inexpensive short-haul flights with airlines such as germanwings or ryanair . " we must ensure that train services are able to compete with air travel , " gabriel said , and suggested that train tickets should qualify for a sales tax break that would allow deutsche bahn ag to reduce ticket prices for consumers . " there is no tax on airline fuel , but the rail operator must pay the full value-added tax on the sale of long-distance tickets , " gabriel complained to the bundestag .
" that is unfair and can not remain that way . " super-fast rail link leads the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tgv-ice link aims to attract those who would normally fly much has been made about the environmental cost of operating so many cheap no-frill flights around europe and the train industry has regularly been told to pull its socks up in terms of offering a competitive alternative . only last month , deutsche bahn and sncf opened a new high-speed train link between paris and frankfurt which would provide fast connections to luxembourg and switzerland and cut the travel time between the french capital and frankfurt by two-and-a-half hours .
the new link was sold as a viable alternative to flying between the two neighboring countries . the new railteam alliance may also be another reason to stay on the rails . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

linz was where police said one alleged drug trafficker was killed and that the two suspected paid killers had been picked up at the austrian-italian border .
the drug ring was also involved in bringing in cocaine from peru , chile and the dominican republic for sale in austria and italy .
latin american drug lords target europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is the top cocaine market after the us roughly 80 percent of cocaine from latin america that was destined for markets outside of the united states in 2005 was bound for europe , according to united states drug enforcement administration -lrb- dea -rrb- estimates .
in all , austrian police said the joint operation had led to the arrest of 54 people , mostly from south america , in austria , germany and italy .
police searches also found 16 kilos -lrb- 35 pounds -rrb- of heroin , some 28,000 pills of ecstasy , as well as weapons and false passports .
international drug trafficking rings have been drawn to the european market because of the higher prices paid on the continent . last year wholesale prices for cocaine in the european union ranged between 28,000 and 56,600 euros -lrb- $ 38,000 and $ 77,000 -rrb- per kilogram compared to between $ 9,000 and $ 40,000 in the united states where the supply is larger , according to the dea .

spanish officials seized over 40 tons of cocaine last year , a record amount and more than any other nation in the world except for colombia , the united states and venezuela , camacho said .
the supply of cocaine in europe has increased since the late 1990s leading to lower prices . this , combined with its association to a supposedly glamorous lifestyle , is fueling its growing use , drug experts say . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the locomotive drivers ' union gdl called a four-hour nationwide stoppage , following a series of pinpoint strikes by members of two other unions that disrupted services on monday .
all three unions are demanding that the state-owned national railways company deutsche bahn meet their demands for higher pay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many commuters were waiting in vain for trains on tuesday the gdl union is also seeking a separate contract as well as pay increases of up to 31 percent for deutsche bahn 's 20,000 train drivers and 12,000 related staff .
the transnet and gdba unions launched strike action monday after employers rejected their demands to raise pay for 134,000 unionized workers by 7 percent .
deutsche bahn offered a one-off payment of 300 euros -lrb- $ 402 -rrb- for this year and a 2-percent increase from january 2008 and another 2 percent in 2009 .
more strikes ahead gdl said the train drivers would end their stoppage at 9 a.m. , but warned it would ballot its members for all-out strike action if management failed to meet their demands .
" we 'll wait and see if the railway 's board makes us a new offer , " said gdl chairman manfred schell .
" if that 's not the case then further strike action ca n't be ruled out . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striking railway workers the transnet and gdba unions said their members would continue their industrial action until evening .
the two sides met saturday evening in a last-ditch effort to avert a strike , but the negotiations broke up after eight hours on sunday without an agreement being reached .
the unions plan to hold selective strikes all week long to press their pay claims against europe 's biggest railway company , which has a work force of 229,000 and is due to be privatized by 2009 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu commission president jose manuel barroso meanwhile said that renegotiation is out of the question . members of the league of polish families , which forms part of poland 's right-wing coalition government , have said they will oppose adoption of the new treaty as it does not comply with polish family values and national interests , according to news reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roman giertych said he wants poland 's interests put first " we will appeal to the public and to law and justice not to ratify the treaty , " said the league 's leader , deputy prime minister roman giertych , referring to the conservative party of president lech kaczynski and prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski .
" we will start a campaign against the treaty because , thanks to germany , it includes amendments which are putting eu interests ahead of poland 's interests . "
it is still not clear whether poland will ratify the treaty via referendum or through parliamentary approval .

the agreement , however , falls short of an eu constitution , the draft of which was rejected by french and dutch voters and faced strong resistance from poland 's twin leaders .
according to reuters news service , the league has been blamed for the rise of xenophobia and racism in poland by the european parliament .

eu commission president jose manuel barroso meanwhile said that renegotiation is out of the question . members of the league of polish families , which forms part of poland 's right-wing coalition government , have said they will oppose adoption of the new treaty as it does not comply with polish family values and national interests , according to news reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roman giertych said he wants poland 's interests put first " we will appeal to the public and to law and justice not to ratify the treaty , " said the league 's leader , deputy prime minister roman giertych , referring to the conservative party of president lech kaczynski and prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski .
" we will start a campaign against the treaty because , thanks to germany , it includes amendments which are putting eu interests ahead of poland 's interests . "
it is still not clear whether poland will ratify the treaty via referendum or through parliamentary approval .
the treaty will create an eu president and a foreign policy chief and make it easier to reach decisions in the long term by changing the current unanimous voting structure .
the agreement , however , falls short of an eu constitution , the draft of which was rejected by french and dutch voters and faced strong resistance from poland 's twin leaders .
according to reuters news service , the league has been blamed for the rise of xenophobia and racism in poland by the european parliament .

george w. bush and vladimir putin struck a relaxed tone after their recent meeting in the united states , where both presidents searched for middle ground on the contentious issue of a us missile defense system in europe . us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin met at bush family 's oceanfront compound in kennebunkport , maine .
the two leaders hoped mend relations that have frayed in recent months over a number of issues concerning europe , including independence for kosovo and sanctions against iran .
but the us ' plans to station part of a missile defense shield in europe were at the top of the agenda .
while neither side backed down from their positions , bush and putin seemed ready to widen the dialogue within europe and to include nato in discussions .
" such cooperation , i believe , would result in raising to an entirely new level the quality of cooperation between russia and the united states , " putin said .
" for all practical purposes , this would lead to a great deal of development of strategic partnership in the area of security . "
" i 'm in strong agreement with that concept , " bush said of the proposal to widen the dialogue .
eastern europe still contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin had hoped a personal meeting would clear the clouds hanging over relations russia has expressed its opposition to the us proposal of setting up defensive missiles in poland and a radar tracking station in the czech republic .
while the us insisted the system would protect against rogue states such as iran , russia sees itself as a target .
at last month 's group of eight summit in germany , putin had suggested an alternative : a joint us-russia defense system located in azerbaijan .
on monday , putin surprised bush by proposing that the defense system be extended to other parts of europe , with nato participation .
bush welcomed the idea as " very constructive and bold " but insisted that the czech republic and poland remain " integral " to the system .
changing tones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin want to send a shared message the meeting was seen as fostering us-russian dialog in what the media called the presidents ' " lobster summit " after bush and putin went fishing together , with putin reeling in a striped bass .
the two seemed more relaxed than they had at the g8 meeting last month .
" the kennebunkport meeting seems to have succeeded in rekindling a sense of camaraderie between the two leaders , " charles kupchan , professor of international affairs at washington 's georgetown university told the afp news agency .
" but there does n't seem to have been substantial progress on reaching concrete agreements on any of the major areas of dispute . "
putin 's offer could be a serious alternative to the current plan , said kupchan , who was the head of european affairs on the national security council under former us president bill clinton .
but the offer could also be putin trying to divert us attention and stall the deployment of the defense system in eastern europe , kupchan added .
bush 's national security advisor stephen hadley said he believes putin wants to cooperate with the us , but acknowledged discussions remain in the preliminary stages .
" what you saw was a very interesting shift and some real progress on this issue , " hadley said .
iranian question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear plans remain a point of dispute between russia and the usa how to handle iran 's nuclear ambitions has also been a contentious issue between the us and russia .
" when russia and america speak along the same lines , it tends to have an effect , " bush said , adding that he and putin had agreed to send a common message .
but finding common ground could prove difficult as the us and its european allies accuse iran of using its nuclear program as a cover to build atomic weapons and are pushing for tougher un sanctions against tehran .
moscow , however , has maintained that iran has cooperated with un nuclear inspectors and sees progress in bringing iran into further compliance .
" so far , we have managed to work within the framework of the security council , and i think we will continue to be successful in this track , " putin said .
the future of the serbian province of kosovo was also a contentious issue with russia and the us having different views on the country 's future .
possible independence for kosovo was not mentioned in a press conference held at the end of the presidents ' meeting . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the existence of a real european high-speed network , which remains little known , needs to be made known to customers , " said sncf chief executive guillaume pepy . along with sncf , the alliance - dubbed railteam - will include germany 's deutsche bahn , oebb of austria , sncb of belgium , ns of the netherlands , cff of switzerland and eurostar uk of britain . taking their cue from airline networks skyteam , star alliance and one world , the companies want to make connections easier by improving scheduling and hooking up reservation systems . however , for the time being , the main innovation will be that if someone misses a connection because of a delay on the first leg of a trip , the passenger will be able to take the next train without having to get a new ticket . making rail travel easier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one ticket could see you leave frankfurt and arrive in london from january 2009 , passengers will need only one ticket for a cross-border trip with multiple connections , making it possible for example to go from frankfurt to london passing through paris on a single ticket . eventually , the alliance is to introduce customer fidelity programs that would allow passengers to accumulate points that could be used on the network as is already common in the airline industry . in order to avoid problems with antitrust regulators , members of the alliance would not agree on prices and would continue to set their own rates on routes currently covered by more than one of them . railteam aims to transport 25 million passengers per year as of 2010 from 15 million currently with high-speed rail lines expected to be extended by a third by 2020 to 15,000 kilometers -lrb- 9,300 miles -rrb- . while the rail companies themselves will be laughing all the way to the bank , the alliance will also have environmentalists beaming from ear to ear , especially in germany . trains urged to meet environmental challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving budget airlines the red card earlier this year , german environment minister sigmar gabriel encouraged germans to take the train more often as part of the effort .
gabriel told the german tabloid bild in april that he planned to further subsidize germany 's extensive railway system to lure travelers away from inexpensive short-haul flights with airlines such as germanwings or ryanair . " we must ensure that train services are able to compete with air travel , " gabriel said , and suggested that train tickets should qualify for a sales tax break that would allow deutsche bahn ag to reduce ticket prices for consumers . " there is no tax on airline fuel , but the rail operator must pay the full value-added tax on the sale of long-distance tickets , " gabriel complained to the bundestag .
" that is unfair and can not remain that way . " super-fast rail link leads the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tgv-ice link aims to attract those who would normally fly much has been made about the environmental cost of operating so many cheap no-frill flights around europe and the train industry has regularly been told to pull its socks up in terms of offering a competitive alternative . only last month , deutsche bahn and sncf opened a new high-speed train link between paris and frankfurt which would provide fast connections to luxembourg and switzerland and cut the travel time between the french capital and frankfurt by two-and-a-half hours .
the new link was sold as a viable alternative to flying between the two neighboring countries . the new railteam alliance may also be another reason to stay on the rails . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she says children and young people are particularly tempted to take up the habit by smoking scenes in films and on tv . german television should show less people smoking , according to the country 's federal drug commissioner sabine bätzing .

the study , commissioned by the federal health ministry , came to the conclusion that there was more smoking in german series and films than in foreign productions , and significantly influences the smoking habits of children and young people . the study 's initial results were released in november .
as a result , bätzing contacted directors and those responsible for programming at the country 's public and private television stations . " they signaled a willingness to see to it that not smoking would be emphasized in their programming , " bätzing said . smoking stars as role models according to the study , film scenes with cigarettes entice children and young people to begin smoking themselves .
the study said their risk to become a smoker doubled when films they watched often contained scenes with smoking . bätzing said it was therefore necessary for the media to take its task as a role model seriously . stars who smoked were strong examples for children and youth , she said , encouraging more sensitivity and restraint from filmmakers and stations .

eu commission president jose manuel barroso meanwhile said that renegotiation is out of the question . members of the league of polish families , which forms part of poland 's right-wing coalition government , have said they will oppose adoption of the new treaty as it does not comply with polish family values and national interests , according to news reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roman giertych said he wants poland 's interests put first " we will appeal to the public and to law and justice not to ratify the treaty , " said the league 's leader , deputy prime minister roman giertych , referring to the conservative party of president lech kaczynski and prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski .
" we will start a campaign against the treaty because , thanks to germany , it includes amendments which are putting eu interests ahead of poland 's interests . "
it is still not clear whether poland will ratify the treaty via referendum or through parliamentary approval .
the treaty will create an eu president and a foreign policy chief and make it easier to reach decisions in the long term by changing the current unanimous voting structure .
the agreement , however , falls short of an eu constitution , the draft of which was rejected by french and dutch voters and faced strong resistance from poland 's twin leaders .
according to reuters news service , the league has been blamed for the rise of xenophobia and racism in poland by the european parliament .
the party opposed the country 's eu membership in 2004 and has long held anti-german views .
no more negotiations eu commission president jose manuel barroso meanwhile said that there was no way to restart negotiations on the treaty , which leaders from the 27-member eu agreed to in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said the time for negotiation is over " none of the issues which were agreed upon can be reopened again , " barroso told journalists during a visit to portugal to mark the beginning of the country 's eu presidency .
portugal is now in charge of drafting the new treaty , which portuguese prime minister jose socrates aims to have ready by october .
" the portuguese presidency has received a mandate to produce a new treaty , and in the mandate it does n't say : ' oh , by the way , you can revise the mandate , " ' said socrates at the same news conference with barroso .
" i do n't think it makes any sense nor do i see any country that wants to question " the mandate . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she says children and young people are particularly tempted to take up the habit by smoking scenes in films and on tv . german television should show less people smoking , according to the country 's federal drug commissioner sabine bätzing . " there has been a shift in thinking at the broadcasters , " bätzing said in berlin on tuesday . bätzing was presenting a study entitled " smoking in film and television , " which is now being published in full .
the study , commissioned by the federal health ministry , came to the conclusion that there was more smoking in german series and films than in foreign productions , and significantly influences the smoking habits of children and young people . the study 's initial results were released in november .
as a result , bätzing contacted directors and those responsible for programming at the country 's public and private television stations . " they signaled a willingness to see to it that not smoking would be emphasized in their programming , " bätzing said . smoking stars as role models according to the study , film scenes with cigarettes entice children and young people to begin smoking themselves .
the study said their risk to become a smoker doubled when films they watched often contained scenes with smoking . bätzing said it was therefore necessary for the media to take its task as a role model seriously . stars who smoked were strong examples for children and youth , she said , encouraging more sensitivity and restraint from filmmakers and stations . " smoking in films and on television is not a dramaturgical means free of values , " bätzing said . the german upper house of parliament bundesrat will decide on friday on smoking bans in federal offices , public buses and trains . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 03.07.2007 study shows turkish values do n't coincide with eu ideals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could turkey 's attitudes change if it was part of the european union ?
a study at cologne university has revealed that turkish attitudes differ significantly from those of eu nationals when it comes to freedom of religion and gender equality .
but this could change if turkey joined the eu . citizens in practically all eu nations support the bloc 's basic principles : freedom of religion , democracy , gender equality and the rule of law .
according to a sociologist 's study at cologne university , however , turkey assumed an exceptional position when it came to freedom of religion and gender equality . " two basic eu principles are not being supported , " said frederike wuermeling , the author of the study .
although eu europeans varied in their attitudes , turkey held a " distinct marginal position " within europe , she said . only one-third of turks backed gender equality .
when it came to freedom of religion , only 16 percent explicitly agreed to this principle , the study revealed . however , turkey was in line with other eu countries when it came to the principles of the rule of law .
in terms of democratic principles , 87.9 percent of those surveyed in turkey supported this notion .
but 66.1 percent also said they considered a strong leader important , who did n't have to attend to the parliament . wealth and religion play a decisive role the study was based on data from the european values survey .
it had questioned some 1,000 respondents in each of the 27 eu member states , as well as in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this turkish artist questions his country 's eu compatibility according to wuermeling , turkey 's economic underdevelopment , as well as the country 's high percentage of muslims played a decisive role in this case . " there is a positive connection between a country 's wealth and the acceptance of eu principles , " wuermeling told dw-world.de. she said this meant that economic improvement could lead to a change in values . " this has been the case in the history of the eu , " wuermeling said .
" one can assume that it becomes more likely that a privileged partnership or eu membership would lead to a shift in values in turkey . "
a stronger orientation towards performance could make religion and traditional family structures less important . at the moment , however , this was not the case . " turkey does not fit into the eu at this time , " wuermeling said . turkey began negotiating for membership in the eu in 2005 .
last week , the eu resumed official accession talks with turkey , even though its membership is not guaranteed .
diplomats estimate that it could take 10 to 15 years to reach a result . religious reservations also exist in eu nations the study 's findings supported the so-called hypothesis of modernization .
it assumes that the higher a country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , level of education and degree of urbanization , the higher the agreement to eu principles .
the analysis also backed the cultural hypothesis , which states that the higher the percentage of muslims in a country and the higher the level of individual religious belief , the lower the agreement to eu principles . wuermeling 's study said that the biggest advocates of all four eu principles were sweden and denmark . in three european countries , the study noted a negative attitude .
in malta , with a catholic population of 97 percent , there were reservations regarding freedom of religion and equal rights .
in the predominantly orthodox greece , as well as in romania , the number of opponents to freedom of religion prevailed . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

linz was where police said one alleged drug trafficker was killed and that the two suspected paid killers had been picked up at the austrian-italian border .
the drug ring was also involved in bringing in cocaine from peru , chile and the dominican republic for sale in austria and italy .

in all , austrian police said the joint operation had led to the arrest of 54 people , mostly from south america , in austria , germany and italy .
police searches also found 16 kilos -lrb- 35 pounds -rrb- of heroin , some 28,000 pills of ecstasy , as well as weapons and false passports .
international drug trafficking rings have been drawn to the european market because of the higher prices paid on the continent . last year wholesale prices for cocaine in the european union ranged between 28,000 and 56,600 euros -lrb- $ 38,000 and $ 77,000 -rrb- per kilogram compared to between $ 9,000 and $ 40,000 in the united states where the supply is larger , according to the dea .

spanish officials seized over 40 tons of cocaine last year , a record amount and more than any other nation in the world except for colombia , the united states and venezuela , camacho said .

george w. bush and vladimir putin struck a relaxed tone after their recent meeting in the united states , where both presidents searched for middle ground on the contentious issue of a us missile defense system in europe . us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin met at bush family 's oceanfront compound in kennebunkport , maine .
the two leaders hoped mend relations that have frayed in recent months over a number of issues concerning europe , including independence for kosovo and sanctions against iran .
but the us ' plans to station part of a missile defense shield in europe were at the top of the agenda .
while neither side backed down from their positions , bush and putin seemed ready to widen the dialogue within europe and to include nato in discussions .
" such cooperation , i believe , would result in raising to an entirely new level the quality of cooperation between russia and the united states , " putin said .
" for all practical purposes , this would lead to a great deal of development of strategic partnership in the area of security . "
" i 'm in strong agreement with that concept , " bush said of the proposal to widen the dialogue .
eastern europe still contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin had hoped a personal meeting would clear the clouds hanging over relations russia has expressed its opposition to the us proposal of setting up defensive missiles in poland and a radar tracking station in the czech republic .
while the us insisted the system would protect against rogue states such as iran , russia sees itself as a target .
at last month 's group of eight summit in germany , putin had suggested an alternative : a joint us-russia defense system located in azerbaijan .
on monday , putin surprised bush by proposing that the defense system be extended to other parts of europe , with nato participation .
bush welcomed the idea as " very constructive and bold " but insisted that the czech republic and poland remain " integral " to the system .
changing tones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin want to send a shared message the meeting was seen as fostering us-russian dialog in what the media called the presidents ' " lobster summit " after bush and putin went fishing together , with putin reeling in a striped bass .
the two seemed more relaxed than they had at the g8 meeting last month .
" the kennebunkport meeting seems to have succeeded in rekindling a sense of camaraderie between the two leaders , " charles kupchan , professor of international affairs at washington 's georgetown university told the afp news agency .
" but there does n't seem to have been substantial progress on reaching concrete agreements on any of the major areas of dispute . "
putin 's offer could be a serious alternative to the current plan , said kupchan , who was the head of european affairs on the national security council under former us president bill clinton .
but the offer could also be putin trying to divert us attention and stall the deployment of the defense system in eastern europe , kupchan added .
bush 's national security advisor stephen hadley said he believes putin wants to cooperate with the us , but acknowledged discussions remain in the preliminary stages .
" what you saw was a very interesting shift and some real progress on this issue , " hadley said .
iranian question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear plans remain a point of dispute between russia and the usa how to handle iran 's nuclear ambitions has also been a contentious issue between the us and russia .
" when russia and america speak along the same lines , it tends to have an effect , " bush said , adding that he and putin had agreed to send a common message .
but finding common ground could prove difficult as the us and its european allies accuse iran of using its nuclear program as a cover to build atomic weapons and are pushing for tougher un sanctions against tehran .
moscow , however , has maintained that iran has cooperated with un nuclear inspectors and sees progress in bringing iran into further compliance .
" so far , we have managed to work within the framework of the security council , and i think we will continue to be successful in this track , " putin said .

george w. bush and vladimir putin struck a relaxed tone after their recent meeting in the united states , where both presidents searched for middle ground on the contentious issue of a us missile defense system in europe . us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin met at bush family 's oceanfront compound in kennebunkport , maine .
the two leaders hoped mend relations that have frayed in recent months over a number of issues concerning europe , including independence for kosovo and sanctions against iran .
but the us ' plans to station part of a missile defense shield in europe were at the top of the agenda .
while neither side backed down from their positions , bush and putin seemed ready to widen the dialogue within europe and to include nato in discussions .
" such cooperation , i believe , would result in raising to an entirely new level the quality of cooperation between russia and the united states , " putin said .
" for all practical purposes , this would lead to a great deal of development of strategic partnership in the area of security . "
" i 'm in strong agreement with that concept , " bush said of the proposal to widen the dialogue .
eastern europe still contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin had hoped a personal meeting would clear the clouds hanging over relations russia has expressed its opposition to the us proposal of setting up defensive missiles in poland and a radar tracking station in the czech republic .
while the us insisted the system would protect against rogue states such as iran , russia sees itself as a target .
at last month 's group of eight summit in germany , putin had suggested an alternative : a joint us-russia defense system located in azerbaijan .
on monday , putin surprised bush by proposing that the defense system be extended to other parts of europe , with nato participation .
bush welcomed the idea as " very constructive and bold " but insisted that the czech republic and poland remain " integral " to the system .
changing tones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin want to send a shared message the meeting was seen as fostering us-russian dialog in what the media called the presidents ' " lobster summit " after bush and putin went fishing together , with putin reeling in a striped bass .
the two seemed more relaxed than they had at the g8 meeting last month .
" the kennebunkport meeting seems to have succeeded in rekindling a sense of camaraderie between the two leaders , " charles kupchan , professor of international affairs at washington 's georgetown university told the afp news agency .
" but there does n't seem to have been substantial progress on reaching concrete agreements on any of the major areas of dispute . "
putin 's offer could be a serious alternative to the current plan , said kupchan , who was the head of european affairs on the national security council under former us president bill clinton .
but the offer could also be putin trying to divert us attention and stall the deployment of the defense system in eastern europe , kupchan added .
bush 's national security advisor stephen hadley said he believes putin wants to cooperate with the us , but acknowledged discussions remain in the preliminary stages .
" what you saw was a very interesting shift and some real progress on this issue , " hadley said .
iranian question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear plans remain a point of dispute between russia and the usa how to handle iran 's nuclear ambitions has also been a contentious issue between the us and russia .
" when russia and america speak along the same lines , it tends to have an effect , " bush said , adding that he and putin had agreed to send a common message .
but finding common ground could prove difficult as the us and its european allies accuse iran of using its nuclear program as a cover to build atomic weapons and are pushing for tougher un sanctions against tehran .
moscow , however , has maintained that iran has cooperated with un nuclear inspectors and sees progress in bringing iran into further compliance .
" so far , we have managed to work within the framework of the security council , and i think we will continue to be successful in this track , " putin said .

the locomotive drivers ' union gdl called a four-hour nationwide stoppage , following a series of pinpoint strikes by members of two other unions that disrupted services on monday .
all three unions are demanding that the state-owned national railways company deutsche bahn meet their demands for higher pay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many commuters were waiting in vain for trains on tuesday the gdl union is also seeking a separate contract as well as pay increases of up to 31 percent for deutsche bahn 's 20,000 train drivers and 12,000 related staff .
the transnet and gdba unions launched strike action monday after employers rejected their demands to raise pay for 134,000 unionized workers by 7 percent .
deutsche bahn offered a one-off payment of 300 euros -lrb- $ 402 -rrb- for this year and a 2-percent increase from january 2008 and another 2 percent in 2009 .
more strikes ahead gdl said the train drivers would end their stoppage at 9 a.m. , but warned it would ballot its members for all-out strike action if management failed to meet their demands .
" we 'll wait and see if the railway 's board makes us a new offer , " said gdl chairman manfred schell .
" if that 's not the case then further strike action ca n't be ruled out . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striking railway workers the transnet and gdba unions said their members would continue their industrial action until evening .
the two sides met saturday evening in a last-ditch effort to avert a strike , but the negotiations broke up after eight hours on sunday without an agreement being reached .

linz was where police said one alleged drug trafficker was killed and that the two suspected paid killers had been picked up at the austrian-italian border .
the drug ring was also involved in bringing in cocaine from peru , chile and the dominican republic for sale in austria and italy .
latin american drug lords target europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is the top cocaine market after the us roughly 80 percent of cocaine from latin america that was destined for markets outside of the united states in 2005 was bound for europe , according to united states drug enforcement administration -lrb- dea -rrb- estimates .
in all , austrian police said the joint operation had led to the arrest of 54 people , mostly from south america , in austria , germany and italy .
police searches also found 16 kilos -lrb- 35 pounds -rrb- of heroin , some 28,000 pills of ecstasy , as well as weapons and false passports .
international drug trafficking rings have been drawn to the european market because of the higher prices paid on the continent . last year wholesale prices for cocaine in the european union ranged between 28,000 and 56,600 euros -lrb- $ 38,000 and $ 77,000 -rrb- per kilogram compared to between $ 9,000 and $ 40,000 in the united states where the supply is larger , according to the dea .

spanish officials seized over 40 tons of cocaine last year , a record amount and more than any other nation in the world except for colombia , the united states and venezuela , camacho said .
the supply of cocaine in europe has increased since the late 1990s leading to lower prices . this , combined with its association to a supposedly glamorous lifestyle , is fueling its growing use , drug experts say . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the existence of a real european high-speed network , which remains little known , needs to be made known to customers , " said sncf chief executive guillaume pepy . along with sncf , the alliance - dubbed railteam - will include germany 's deutsche bahn , oebb of austria , sncb of belgium , ns of the netherlands , cff of switzerland and eurostar uk of britain . taking their cue from airline networks skyteam , star alliance and one world , the companies want to make connections easier by improving scheduling and hooking up reservation systems . however , for the time being , the main innovation will be that if someone misses a connection because of a delay on the first leg of a trip , the passenger will be able to take the next train without having to get a new ticket . making rail travel easier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one ticket could see you leave frankfurt and arrive in london from january 2009 , passengers will need only one ticket for a cross-border trip with multiple connections , making it possible for example to go from frankfurt to london passing through paris on a single ticket . eventually , the alliance is to introduce customer fidelity programs that would allow passengers to accumulate points that could be used on the network as is already common in the airline industry . in order to avoid problems with antitrust regulators , members of the alliance would not agree on prices and would continue to set their own rates on routes currently covered by more than one of them . railteam aims to transport 25 million passengers per year as of 2010 from 15 million currently with high-speed rail lines expected to be extended by a third by 2020 to 15,000 kilometers -lrb- 9,300 miles -rrb- . while the rail companies themselves will be laughing all the way to the bank , the alliance will also have environmentalists beaming from ear to ear , especially in germany . trains urged to meet environmental challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving budget airlines the red card earlier this year , german environment minister sigmar gabriel encouraged germans to take the train more often as part of the effort .
gabriel told the german tabloid bild in april that he planned to further subsidize germany 's extensive railway system to lure travelers away from inexpensive short-haul flights with airlines such as germanwings or ryanair . " we must ensure that train services are able to compete with air travel , " gabriel said , and suggested that train tickets should qualify for a sales tax break that would allow deutsche bahn ag to reduce ticket prices for consumers . " there is no tax on airline fuel , but the rail operator must pay the full value-added tax on the sale of long-distance tickets , " gabriel complained to the bundestag .
" that is unfair and can not remain that way . " super-fast rail link leads the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tgv-ice link aims to attract those who would normally fly much has been made about the environmental cost of operating so many cheap no-frill flights around europe and the train industry has regularly been told to pull its socks up in terms of offering a competitive alternative . only last month , deutsche bahn and sncf opened a new high-speed train link between paris and frankfurt which would provide fast connections to luxembourg and switzerland and cut the travel time between the french capital and frankfurt by two-and-a-half hours .
the new link was sold as a viable alternative to flying between the two neighboring countries . the new railteam alliance may also be another reason to stay on the rails . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu commission president jose manuel barroso meanwhile said that renegotiation is out of the question . members of the league of polish families , which forms part of poland 's right-wing coalition government , have said they will oppose adoption of the new treaty as it does not comply with polish family values and national interests , according to news reports .

eu commission president jose manuel barroso meanwhile said that renegotiation is out of the question . members of the league of polish families , which forms part of poland 's right-wing coalition government , have said they will oppose adoption of the new treaty as it does not comply with polish family values and national interests , according to news reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roman giertych said he wants poland 's interests put first " we will appeal to the public and to law and justice not to ratify the treaty , " said the league 's leader , deputy prime minister roman giertych , referring to the conservative party of president lech kaczynski and prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski .
" we will start a campaign against the treaty because , thanks to germany , it includes amendments which are putting eu interests ahead of poland 's interests . "
it is still not clear whether poland will ratify the treaty via referendum or through parliamentary approval .
the treaty will create an eu president and a foreign policy chief and make it easier to reach decisions in the long term by changing the current unanimous voting structure .
the agreement , however , falls short of an eu constitution , the draft of which was rejected by french and dutch voters and faced strong resistance from poland 's twin leaders .
according to reuters news service , the league has been blamed for the rise of xenophobia and racism in poland by the european parliament .
the party opposed the country 's eu membership in 2004 and has long held anti-german views .
no more negotiations eu commission president jose manuel barroso meanwhile said that there was no way to restart negotiations on the treaty , which leaders from the 27-member eu agreed to in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said the time for negotiation is over " none of the issues which were agreed upon can be reopened again , " barroso told journalists during a visit to portugal to mark the beginning of the country 's eu presidency .
portugal is now in charge of drafting the new treaty , which portuguese prime minister jose socrates aims to have ready by october .
" the portuguese presidency has received a mandate to produce a new treaty , and in the mandate it does n't say : ' oh , by the way , you can revise the mandate , " ' said socrates at the same news conference with barroso .

" the existence of a real european high-speed network , which remains little known , needs to be made known to customers , " said sncf chief executive guillaume pepy . along with sncf , the alliance - dubbed railteam - will include germany 's deutsche bahn , oebb of austria , sncb of belgium , ns of the netherlands , cff of switzerland and eurostar uk of britain . taking their cue from airline networks skyteam , star alliance and one world , the companies want to make connections easier by improving scheduling and hooking up reservation systems . however , for the time being , the main innovation will be that if someone misses a connection because of a delay on the first leg of a trip , the passenger will be able to take the next train without having to get a new ticket . making rail travel easier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one ticket could see you leave frankfurt and arrive in london from january 2009 , passengers will need only one ticket for a cross-border trip with multiple connections , making it possible for example to go from frankfurt to london passing through paris on a single ticket . eventually , the alliance is to introduce customer fidelity programs that would allow passengers to accumulate points that could be used on the network as is already common in the airline industry . in order to avoid problems with antitrust regulators , members of the alliance would not agree on prices and would continue to set their own rates on routes currently covered by more than one of them . railteam aims to transport 25 million passengers per year as of 2010 from 15 million currently with high-speed rail lines expected to be extended by a third by 2020 to 15,000 kilometers -lrb- 9,300 miles -rrb- . while the rail companies themselves will be laughing all the way to the bank , the alliance will also have environmentalists beaming from ear to ear , especially in germany . trains urged to meet environmental challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving budget airlines the red card earlier this year , german environment minister sigmar gabriel encouraged germans to take the train more often as part of the effort .
gabriel told the german tabloid bild in april that he planned to further subsidize germany 's extensive railway system to lure travelers away from inexpensive short-haul flights with airlines such as germanwings or ryanair . " we must ensure that train services are able to compete with air travel , " gabriel said , and suggested that train tickets should qualify for a sales tax break that would allow deutsche bahn ag to reduce ticket prices for consumers . " there is no tax on airline fuel , but the rail operator must pay the full value-added tax on the sale of long-distance tickets , " gabriel complained to the bundestag .
" that is unfair and can not remain that way . " super-fast rail link leads the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tgv-ice link aims to attract those who would normally fly much has been made about the environmental cost of operating so many cheap no-frill flights around europe and the train industry has regularly been told to pull its socks up in terms of offering a competitive alternative . only last month , deutsche bahn and sncf opened a new high-speed train link between paris and frankfurt which would provide fast connections to luxembourg and switzerland and cut the travel time between the french capital and frankfurt by two-and-a-half hours .
the new link was sold as a viable alternative to flying between the two neighboring countries . the new railteam alliance may also be another reason to stay on the rails . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she says children and young people are particularly tempted to take up the habit by smoking scenes in films and on tv . german television should show less people smoking , according to the country 's federal drug commissioner sabine bätzing . " there has been a shift in thinking at the broadcasters , " bätzing said in berlin on tuesday . bätzing was presenting a study entitled " smoking in film and television , " which is now being published in full .
the study , commissioned by the federal health ministry , came to the conclusion that there was more smoking in german series and films than in foreign productions , and significantly influences the smoking habits of children and young people . the study 's initial results were released in november .
as a result , bätzing contacted directors and those responsible for programming at the country 's public and private television stations . " they signaled a willingness to see to it that not smoking would be emphasized in their programming , " bätzing said . smoking stars as role models according to the study , film scenes with cigarettes entice children and young people to begin smoking themselves .
the study said their risk to become a smoker doubled when films they watched often contained scenes with smoking . bätzing said it was therefore necessary for the media to take its task as a role model seriously . stars who smoked were strong examples for children and youth , she said , encouraging more sensitivity and restraint from filmmakers and stations . " smoking in films and on television is not a dramaturgical means free of values , " bätzing said . the german upper house of parliament bundesrat will decide on friday on smoking bans in federal offices , public buses and trains . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

george w. bush and vladimir putin struck a relaxed tone after their recent meeting in the united states , where both presidents searched for middle ground on the contentious issue of a us missile defense system in europe . us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin met at bush family 's oceanfront compound in kennebunkport , maine .
the two leaders hoped mend relations that have frayed in recent months over a number of issues concerning europe , including independence for kosovo and sanctions against iran .
but the us ' plans to station part of a missile defense shield in europe were at the top of the agenda .
while neither side backed down from their positions , bush and putin seemed ready to widen the dialogue within europe and to include nato in discussions .
" such cooperation , i believe , would result in raising to an entirely new level the quality of cooperation between russia and the united states , " putin said .
" for all practical purposes , this would lead to a great deal of development of strategic partnership in the area of security . "
" i 'm in strong agreement with that concept , " bush said of the proposal to widen the dialogue .
eastern europe still contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin had hoped a personal meeting would clear the clouds hanging over relations russia has expressed its opposition to the us proposal of setting up defensive missiles in poland and a radar tracking station in the czech republic .
while the us insisted the system would protect against rogue states such as iran , russia sees itself as a target .
at last month 's group of eight summit in germany , putin had suggested an alternative : a joint us-russia defense system located in azerbaijan .
on monday , putin surprised bush by proposing that the defense system be extended to other parts of europe , with nato participation .
bush welcomed the idea as " very constructive and bold " but insisted that the czech republic and poland remain " integral " to the system .
changing tones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin want to send a shared message the meeting was seen as fostering us-russian dialog in what the media called the presidents ' " lobster summit " after bush and putin went fishing together , with putin reeling in a striped bass .
the two seemed more relaxed than they had at the g8 meeting last month .
" the kennebunkport meeting seems to have succeeded in rekindling a sense of camaraderie between the two leaders , " charles kupchan , professor of international affairs at washington 's georgetown university told the afp news agency .
" but there does n't seem to have been substantial progress on reaching concrete agreements on any of the major areas of dispute . "
putin 's offer could be a serious alternative to the current plan , said kupchan , who was the head of european affairs on the national security council under former us president bill clinton .
but the offer could also be putin trying to divert us attention and stall the deployment of the defense system in eastern europe , kupchan added .
bush 's national security advisor stephen hadley said he believes putin wants to cooperate with the us , but acknowledged discussions remain in the preliminary stages .
" what you saw was a very interesting shift and some real progress on this issue , " hadley said .
iranian question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear plans remain a point of dispute between russia and the usa how to handle iran 's nuclear ambitions has also been a contentious issue between the us and russia .
" when russia and america speak along the same lines , it tends to have an effect , " bush said , adding that he and putin had agreed to send a common message .
but finding common ground could prove difficult as the us and its european allies accuse iran of using its nuclear program as a cover to build atomic weapons and are pushing for tougher un sanctions against tehran .
moscow , however , has maintained that iran has cooperated with un nuclear inspectors and sees progress in bringing iran into further compliance .
" so far , we have managed to work within the framework of the security council , and i think we will continue to be successful in this track , " putin said .

george w. bush and vladimir putin struck a relaxed tone after their recent meeting in the united states , where both presidents searched for middle ground on the contentious issue of a us missile defense system in europe . us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin met at bush family 's oceanfront compound in kennebunkport , maine .
the two leaders hoped mend relations that have frayed in recent months over a number of issues concerning europe , including independence for kosovo and sanctions against iran .
but the us ' plans to station part of a missile defense shield in europe were at the top of the agenda .
while neither side backed down from their positions , bush and putin seemed ready to widen the dialogue within europe and to include nato in discussions .
" such cooperation , i believe , would result in raising to an entirely new level the quality of cooperation between russia and the united states , " putin said .
" for all practical purposes , this would lead to a great deal of development of strategic partnership in the area of security . "
" i 'm in strong agreement with that concept , " bush said of the proposal to widen the dialogue .
eastern europe still contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin had hoped a personal meeting would clear the clouds hanging over relations russia has expressed its opposition to the us proposal of setting up defensive missiles in poland and a radar tracking station in the czech republic .
while the us insisted the system would protect against rogue states such as iran , russia sees itself as a target .
at last month 's group of eight summit in germany , putin had suggested an alternative : a joint us-russia defense system located in azerbaijan .
on monday , putin surprised bush by proposing that the defense system be extended to other parts of europe , with nato participation .
bush welcomed the idea as " very constructive and bold " but insisted that the czech republic and poland remain " integral " to the system .
changing tones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin want to send a shared message the meeting was seen as fostering us-russian dialog in what the media called the presidents ' " lobster summit " after bush and putin went fishing together , with putin reeling in a striped bass .
the two seemed more relaxed than they had at the g8 meeting last month .
" the kennebunkport meeting seems to have succeeded in rekindling a sense of camaraderie between the two leaders , " charles kupchan , professor of international affairs at washington 's georgetown university told the afp news agency .
" but there does n't seem to have been substantial progress on reaching concrete agreements on any of the major areas of dispute . "
putin 's offer could be a serious alternative to the current plan , said kupchan , who was the head of european affairs on the national security council under former us president bill clinton .
but the offer could also be putin trying to divert us attention and stall the deployment of the defense system in eastern europe , kupchan added .
bush 's national security advisor stephen hadley said he believes putin wants to cooperate with the us , but acknowledged discussions remain in the preliminary stages .
" what you saw was a very interesting shift and some real progress on this issue , " hadley said .
iranian question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear plans remain a point of dispute between russia and the usa how to handle iran 's nuclear ambitions has also been a contentious issue between the us and russia .
" when russia and america speak along the same lines , it tends to have an effect , " bush said , adding that he and putin had agreed to send a common message .
but finding common ground could prove difficult as the us and its european allies accuse iran of using its nuclear program as a cover to build atomic weapons and are pushing for tougher un sanctions against tehran .
moscow , however , has maintained that iran has cooperated with un nuclear inspectors and sees progress in bringing iran into further compliance .
" so far , we have managed to work within the framework of the security council , and i think we will continue to be successful in this track , " putin said .

after talks with leaders of germany 's energy sector , chancellor angela merkel said tuesday that her government will present a new energy policy later this year .
industry representatives called her plans " unrealistic . " merkel said that climate change had been unambiguously proved by science to be happening and germany must act on emissions .
" obviously germany will make its contribution to achieving the targets , " she said , adding that the basic target was to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
only if other nations joined in would germany expand the cut to 30 or 40 percent .
merkel said she could not promise that before negotiations were finished .
incentives to save energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel , merkel and glos after an earlier energy summit last year the chancellor also told reporters that economics minister michael glos and environment minister sigmar gabriel , who attended the meetings , would jointly work on a concept for a new energy and climate change policy to reach germany 's target to cut co2 emissions . gabriel said that the government 's proposals would be finalized by the fall and decided on before the un climate conference in december . he added that incentives to improve insulation and heating systems in buildings were under consideration .
germans would also be encouraged to use waste heat from power stations and buy power-saving home appliances , he said .
industry representatives , meanwhile , expressed their concerns about the government 's plans , saying that the goal to lower co2 emissions by 40 percent was unrealistic .

she also criticized energy providers for rising prices at the earliest opportunity after price caps expired on july 1 .

if you want people to take notice of what you 're doing , show lots of couples having rampant sex in your promotional video . when it comes to institutions with a sexy image , the european commission is hardly the playboy mansion .
and apart from commission vice president günther verheugen 's alleged penchant for going au natural , there are also very few candidates in line to be the bloc 's hugh hefner .
both may be reasons why the eu is now using a bunch of beautiful young things engaging in steamy scenes to promote the eu 's media fund which helps distribute successful european movies around the continent .
sex montage promotes eu cinema bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel : not in the video and not enjoying a " sensual " moment in one clip , which has , unsurprisingly , attracted the most attention , eighteen different couples have sex in a montage of love scenes culled from european cinema .
the 44-second mini skin flick , shown on the bloc 's eutube internet video channel , has had over 120,000 people logging on to get an eyeful of the writhing flesh and ecstatic moans and groans .
it is by far the most-watched video on the channel and has double the viewing figures of the next most popular : a short film about eu humanitarian aid which contains no sex whatsoever and only partial nudity .
however , the sexing-up of the eu has not gone down well and has been hard for some in the bloc to swallow , so to speak .
one of the passionate scenes involving two men has drawn a flood of complaints from poland , a country where recent anti-gay rhetoric has caused uncomfortable ripples around europe .
no puritans in the eu apparently bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlikely to make poles more enthusiastic for the eu but commission media spokesperson martin selmayr is unapologetic . " the european union is not the bible belt , " he said .
" these clips come from award-winning films and they show the eu 's rich cinematic heritage , which we can all be proud of . "
" what can i say ? "
eu communication spokesperson mikolaj dowglielewicz added .
" it does n't always have to be about press releases .

a particularity of the bundeswehr is that it is a parliamentary army .
it 's not up to the ruling administration to decide on deployments as the president of the united states largely can do , but an issue for the parliament , and that 's where there will probably be a correction here or there to be made . some , especially in the left party , are hoping for more than a correction .
can the federal constitutional court really a play a main role in the tornados ' deployment ? the federal constitutional court is not the only actor .
human rights and un mandates and decisions are , of course , also involved , and they are not all completely justiciable for only the constitutional court .
these are foreign policy decisions that are on the edge of what is constitutionally revisable . still , the court 's ruling will have an influence on german foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german parliament gave its approval to the tornados ' mission that the administration will not get away everything it wants is clear and obvious .
at the beginning of the year it still said it could decide everything on its own and did not need parliamentary approval .
that it did not need a new mandate for the tornados and that everything was covered by the existing mandate .
the court would probably have said : that 's not the way things work .
but the administration understood it and got a new mandate , but the government gave it a try and that 's a grey area . how willing is the federal constitutional court to get involved in highly political questions ? there is no general answer for that .
the general line is that it is not like the us supreme court , which can and does say " that 's a purely political issue , we 're not getting involved . "
the federal constitutional court does not have that right under the german constitution .
it has to decide on all the points of law brought before it - no matter how political they may be . does that make it possible for the court to be abused to serve political goals ?

a particularity of the bundeswehr is that it is a parliamentary army .
it 's not up to the ruling administration to decide on deployments as the president of the united states largely can do , but an issue for the parliament , and that 's where there will probably be a correction here or there to be made . some , especially in the left party , are hoping for more than a correction .
can the federal constitutional court really a play a main role in the tornados ' deployment ? the federal constitutional court is not the only actor .
human rights and un mandates and decisions are , of course , also involved , and they are not all completely justiciable for only the constitutional court .
these are foreign policy decisions that are on the edge of what is constitutionally revisable . still , the court 's ruling will have an influence on german foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german parliament gave its approval to the tornados ' mission that the administration will not get away everything it wants is clear and obvious .
at the beginning of the year it still said it could decide everything on its own and did not need parliamentary approval .
that it did not need a new mandate for the tornados and that everything was covered by the existing mandate .

but the administration understood it and got a new mandate , but the government gave it a try and that 's a grey area . how willing is the federal constitutional court to get involved in highly political questions ? there is no general answer for that .
the general line is that it is not like the us supreme court , which can and does say " that 's a purely political issue , we 're not getting involved . "
the federal constitutional court does not have that right under the german constitution .
it has to decide on all the points of law brought before it - no matter how political they may be . does that make it possible for the court to be abused to serve political goals ?

the overall interest in all things gdr is also on the rise . the number of germans wanting to see the files the former east german secret service kept on them has increased , a report released in berlin on tuesday found .
according to the annual report , around 97,000 germans applied for access to their stasi files in 2006 , an increase of 20 percent from the previous year .
marianne birthler , the government official in charge of the stasi files archive , said that the number of people wanting to see their files was just one aspect of the overall increase in interest in the history of east germany .
the trend , she said , was continuing into 2007 with more than 7,000 people per month applying for access to files .

birthler 's own department was the subject of an investigation last year after it was revealed that former stasi operatives had been employed there . birthler rejected the accusations that the employment of former stasi members in " sensitive areas " of the archives was a security risk , calling them " absurd .

a particularity of the bundeswehr is that it is a parliamentary army .
it 's not up to the ruling administration to decide on deployments as the president of the united states largely can do , but an issue for the parliament , and that 's where there will probably be a correction here or there to be made . some , especially in the left party , are hoping for more than a correction .
can the federal constitutional court really a play a main role in the tornados ' deployment ? the federal constitutional court is not the only actor .
human rights and un mandates and decisions are , of course , also involved , and they are not all completely justiciable for only the constitutional court .
these are foreign policy decisions that are on the edge of what is constitutionally revisable . still , the court 's ruling will have an influence on german foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german parliament gave its approval to the tornados ' mission that the administration will not get away everything it wants is clear and obvious .
at the beginning of the year it still said it could decide everything on its own and did not need parliamentary approval .
that it did not need a new mandate for the tornados and that everything was covered by the existing mandate .
the court would probably have said : that 's not the way things work .
but the administration understood it and got a new mandate , but the government gave it a try and that 's a grey area . how willing is the federal constitutional court to get involved in highly political questions ? there is no general answer for that .
the general line is that it is not like the us supreme court , which can and does say " that 's a purely political issue , we 're not getting involved . "
the federal constitutional court does not have that right under the german constitution .
it has to decide on all the points of law brought before it - no matter how political they may be . does that make it possible for the court to be abused to serve political goals ?
how can the court defend itself from being over politicized ? a very old saying from a previous president of the reich 's court said to attempt to separate purely political issues from purely legal issues would be like trying to separate flowers into those that are poisonous and those that smell good .
it 's something the federal constitutional court can not do , even if it sometimes manages to on the sly .
when it considers highly political question the court has at times said an issue needs to be respected as being within the margin of political decision making or the prerogative of political debate . ulrich battis was interviewed by sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the overall interest in all things gdr is also on the rise . the number of germans wanting to see the files the former east german secret service kept on them has increased , a report released in berlin on tuesday found .
according to the annual report , around 97,000 germans applied for access to their stasi files in 2006 , an increase of 20 percent from the previous year .
marianne birthler , the government official in charge of the stasi files archive , said that the number of people wanting to see their files was just one aspect of the overall increase in interest in the history of east germany .
the trend , she said , was continuing into 2007 with more than 7,000 people per month applying for access to files .
birthler said that the increase in interest was also on the rise in schools . " we have a new generation of people who have questions , " she said at the report 's launch . a big draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an installation at the stasi museum in berlin interest in the gdr and the stasi in the west is also on the increase thanks to a wave of historical and fictional publications on the east and successful german films such as 1999 's " sonnenallee " and 2007 's oscar-winning " das leben der anderen " -lrb- the lives of others -rrb- .
birthler believes that there is not as much stigma attached to the stasi files as before , prompting more people to come forward to read their own .
there is also a desire to learn how the east german regime operated and the gdr 's role in the wider history of germany .
older generation still harbors suspicions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birthler 's colleagues were investigated while time and shifts in perception and culture continue to slowly change the way the stasi and its activities are seen by younger germans , many who lived under the communist regime still hold deep-rooted suspicions of those once involved with the secret service .
birthler 's own department was the subject of an investigation last year after it was revealed that former stasi operatives had been employed there . birthler rejected the accusations that the employment of former stasi members in " sensitive areas " of the archives was a security risk , calling them " absurd . "
the investigation eventually led to a number of employees being moved to other jobs . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the existence of a real european high-speed network , which remains little known , needs to be made known to customers , " said sncf chief executive guillaume pepy . along with sncf , the alliance - dubbed railteam - will include germany 's deutsche bahn , oebb of austria , sncb of belgium , ns of the netherlands , cff of switzerland and eurostar uk of britain . taking their cue from airline networks skyteam , star alliance and one world , the companies want to make connections easier by improving scheduling and hooking up reservation systems . however , for the time being , the main innovation will be that if someone misses a connection because of a delay on the first leg of a trip , the passenger will be able to take the next train without having to get a new ticket . making rail travel easier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one ticket could see you leave frankfurt and arrive in london from january 2009 , passengers will need only one ticket for a cross-border trip with multiple connections , making it possible for example to go from frankfurt to london passing through paris on a single ticket . eventually , the alliance is to introduce customer fidelity programs that would allow passengers to accumulate points that could be used on the network as is already common in the airline industry . in order to avoid problems with antitrust regulators , members of the alliance would not agree on prices and would continue to set their own rates on routes currently covered by more than one of them . railteam aims to transport 25 million passengers per year as of 2010 from 15 million currently with high-speed rail lines expected to be extended by a third by 2020 to 15,000 kilometers -lrb- 9,300 miles -rrb- . while the rail companies themselves will be laughing all the way to the bank , the alliance will also have environmentalists beaming from ear to ear , especially in germany . trains urged to meet environmental challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving budget airlines the red card earlier this year , german environment minister sigmar gabriel encouraged germans to take the train more often as part of the effort .
gabriel told the german tabloid bild in april that he planned to further subsidize germany 's extensive railway system to lure travelers away from inexpensive short-haul flights with airlines such as germanwings or ryanair . " we must ensure that train services are able to compete with air travel , " gabriel said , and suggested that train tickets should qualify for a sales tax break that would allow deutsche bahn ag to reduce ticket prices for consumers . " there is no tax on airline fuel , but the rail operator must pay the full value-added tax on the sale of long-distance tickets , " gabriel complained to the bundestag .
" that is unfair and can not remain that way . " super-fast rail link leads the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tgv-ice link aims to attract those who would normally fly much has been made about the environmental cost of operating so many cheap no-frill flights around europe and the train industry has regularly been told to pull its socks up in terms of offering a competitive alternative . only last month , deutsche bahn and sncf opened a new high-speed train link between paris and frankfurt which would provide fast connections to luxembourg and switzerland and cut the travel time between the french capital and frankfurt by two-and-a-half hours .

linz was where police said one alleged drug trafficker was killed and that the two suspected paid killers had been picked up at the austrian-italian border .
the drug ring was also involved in bringing in cocaine from peru , chile and the dominican republic for sale in austria and italy .
latin american drug lords target europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is the top cocaine market after the us roughly 80 percent of cocaine from latin america that was destined for markets outside of the united states in 2005 was bound for europe , according to united states drug enforcement administration -lrb- dea -rrb- estimates .
in all , austrian police said the joint operation had led to the arrest of 54 people , mostly from south america , in austria , germany and italy .
police searches also found 16 kilos -lrb- 35 pounds -rrb- of heroin , some 28,000 pills of ecstasy , as well as weapons and false passports .
international drug trafficking rings have been drawn to the european market because of the higher prices paid on the continent . last year wholesale prices for cocaine in the european union ranged between 28,000 and 56,600 euros -lrb- $ 38,000 and $ 77,000 -rrb- per kilogram compared to between $ 9,000 and $ 40,000 in the united states where the supply is larger , according to the dea .
spain in the spotlight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is the main entry point for drugs from latin america trafficking groups from latin america are taking advantage of weak governments in african nations as well as their historical ties to europe to smuggle drugs into the continent , specifically spain . spain has become the main gateway for latin american cocaine coming into europe and has set up its own robust fight against drug smuggling .
spanish officials seized over 40 tons of cocaine last year , a record amount and more than any other nation in the world except for colombia , the united states and venezuela , camacho said .
the supply of cocaine in europe has increased since the late 1990s leading to lower prices . this , combined with its association to a supposedly glamorous lifestyle , is fueling its growing use , drug experts say . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a study at cologne university has revealed that turkish attitudes differ significantly from those of eu nationals when it comes to freedom of religion and gender equality .
but this could change if turkey joined the eu . citizens in practically all eu nations support the bloc 's basic principles : freedom of religion , democracy , gender equality and the rule of law .
according to a sociologist 's study at cologne university , however , turkey assumed an exceptional position when it came to freedom of religion and gender equality . " two basic eu principles are not being supported , " said frederike wuermeling , the author of the study .
although eu europeans varied in their attitudes , turkey held a " distinct marginal position " within europe , she said . only one-third of turks backed gender equality .
when it came to freedom of religion , only 16 percent explicitly agreed to this principle , the study revealed . however , turkey was in line with other eu countries when it came to the principles of the rule of law .
in terms of democratic principles , 87.9 percent of those surveyed in turkey supported this notion .
but 66.1 percent also said they considered a strong leader important , who did n't have to attend to the parliament . wealth and religion play a decisive role the study was based on data from the european values survey .
it had questioned some 1,000 respondents in each of the 27 eu member states , as well as in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this turkish artist questions his country 's eu compatibility according to wuermeling , turkey 's economic underdevelopment , as well as the country 's high percentage of muslims played a decisive role in this case . " there is a positive connection between a country 's wealth and the acceptance of eu principles , " wuermeling told dw-world.de. she said this meant that economic improvement could lead to a change in values . " this has been the case in the history of the eu , " wuermeling said .
" one can assume that it becomes more likely that a privileged partnership or eu membership would lead to a shift in values in turkey . "
a stronger orientation towards performance could make religion and traditional family structures less important . at the moment , however , this was not the case . " turkey does not fit into the eu at this time , " wuermeling said . turkey began negotiating for membership in the eu in 2005 .
last week , the eu resumed official accession talks with turkey , even though its membership is not guaranteed .
diplomats estimate that it could take 10 to 15 years to reach a result . religious reservations also exist in eu nations the study 's findings supported the so-called hypothesis of modernization .
it assumes that the higher a country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , level of education and degree of urbanization , the higher the agreement to eu principles .
the analysis also backed the cultural hypothesis , which states that the higher the percentage of muslims in a country and the higher the level of individual religious belief , the lower the agreement to eu principles . wuermeling 's study said that the biggest advocates of all four eu principles were sweden and denmark . in three european countries , the study noted a negative attitude .

a study at cologne university has revealed that turkish attitudes differ significantly from those of eu nationals when it comes to freedom of religion and gender equality .
but this could change if turkey joined the eu . citizens in practically all eu nations support the bloc 's basic principles : freedom of religion , democracy , gender equality and the rule of law .
according to a sociologist 's study at cologne university , however , turkey assumed an exceptional position when it came to freedom of religion and gender equality . " two basic eu principles are not being supported , " said frederike wuermeling , the author of the study .
although eu europeans varied in their attitudes , turkey held a " distinct marginal position " within europe , she said . only one-third of turks backed gender equality .
when it came to freedom of religion , only 16 percent explicitly agreed to this principle , the study revealed . however , turkey was in line with other eu countries when it came to the principles of the rule of law .
in terms of democratic principles , 87.9 percent of those surveyed in turkey supported this notion .
but 66.1 percent also said they considered a strong leader important , who did n't have to attend to the parliament . wealth and religion play a decisive role the study was based on data from the european values survey .
it had questioned some 1,000 respondents in each of the 27 eu member states , as well as in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this turkish artist questions his country 's eu compatibility according to wuermeling , turkey 's economic underdevelopment , as well as the country 's high percentage of muslims played a decisive role in this case .

" this has been the case in the history of the eu , " wuermeling said .
" one can assume that it becomes more likely that a privileged partnership or eu membership would lead to a shift in values in turkey . "
a stronger orientation towards performance could make religion and traditional family structures less important . at the moment , however , this was not the case . " turkey does not fit into the eu at this time , " wuermeling said . turkey began negotiating for membership in the eu in 2005 .
last week , the eu resumed official accession talks with turkey , even though its membership is not guaranteed .

the country 's highest court dismissed a complaint concerning the bundestag 's decision to deploy six reconnaissance aircraft to southern afghanistan . the left party had filed a complaint with germany 's federal constitutional court .
the pacifist party , made up mainly of disgruntled social democrats and former communist party members , charged that the parliament 's decision to allow the mission violated a 1955 law governing germany 's role in nato .
the six tornado warplanes have been used to fly reconnaissance missions for nato forces since mid-april .
the planes are accompanied by approximately 200 military personnel .
under the mandate given to them , bundeswehr troops are prohibited from participating in combat missions .
members of the left party have said they are concerned that the tornado deployment would lead to troops becoming mired in fighting .
politicians welcome ruling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are part of a nato peacekeeping mission german defense minister franz josef jung welcomed the ruling and said he expects the parliament to approve an extension of the mandate this fall .
" i am happy the constitutional court confirmed the position of the government that the deployment of the tornado jets is constitutional and complies with our basic law , " he said at a security conference in berlin .
" i think that is an important message for our soldiers , who are making an important contribution to peace and stability .
the tornados offer protection to our soldiers and the -lrb- civilian -rrb- population . " the court ruled that the mission serves to protect " the security of the euro-atlantic region . " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier echoed jung 's comments , saying the tornado jets were helping with the security and rebuilding of afghanistan .
planes can stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three german soldiers were killed in afghanistan this spring the court ruled the parliament did not exceed its authority and dismissed the case tuesday , saying that the german government should be allowed maneuvering room in questions of foreign policy .
germany currently has about 3,000 soldiers serving with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission in the north of the country .
the tornados are equipped with two high-tech optical cameras along with an infra-red sensor in a pod slung below the fuselage .
their mission is to spy out taliban positions in the southern provinces of helmand , kandahar and uruzgan , where british , canadian and dutch troops are deployed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung has been a supporter of keeping troops in afghanistan under the terms of their six-month mission , they will not fly at low- level and will not be used to bomb taliban positions .
the german government has been adamant that the planes will not be used as fighter jets . " the reconnaissance gathered by our tornadoes will bring more stability and security to afghanistan , " german defense minister franz josef jung said when the planes were first deployed . " their mission is to protect isaf troops , as well as civilian aid workers and the afghan population . " public opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the constitutional court hand down their opinion the tornado mission will last until october under its current mandate .
a lengthy debate is expected this autumn when the bundestag debates an extension of the bundeswehr 's nato mandate . deployment of tornado jets has been controversial with the german public as well .
surveys show that many fear germany will become a target for terrorists if the bundeswehr is seen as aiding nato 's mission in afghanistan .
a poll by the tns institute earlier this spring showed 57 percent of those surveyed wanted a complete withdrawal of german troops from afghanistan , while 36 percent were in favor of continued engagement . only 4 percent backed increasing the german military presence . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pacifist party , made up mainly of disgruntled social democrats and former communist party members , charged that the parliament 's decision to allow the mission violated a 1955 law governing germany 's role in nato .

" the existence of a real european high-speed network , which remains little known , needs to be made known to customers , " said sncf chief executive guillaume pepy . along with sncf , the alliance - dubbed railteam - will include germany 's deutsche bahn , oebb of austria , sncb of belgium , ns of the netherlands , cff of switzerland and eurostar uk of britain . taking their cue from airline networks skyteam , star alliance and one world , the companies want to make connections easier by improving scheduling and hooking up reservation systems . however , for the time being , the main innovation will be that if someone misses a connection because of a delay on the first leg of a trip , the passenger will be able to take the next train without having to get a new ticket . making rail travel easier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one ticket could see you leave frankfurt and arrive in london from january 2009 , passengers will need only one ticket for a cross-border trip with multiple connections , making it possible for example to go from frankfurt to london passing through paris on a single ticket . eventually , the alliance is to introduce customer fidelity programs that would allow passengers to accumulate points that could be used on the network as is already common in the airline industry . in order to avoid problems with antitrust regulators , members of the alliance would not agree on prices and would continue to set their own rates on routes currently covered by more than one of them . railteam aims to transport 25 million passengers per year as of 2010 from 15 million currently with high-speed rail lines expected to be extended by a third by 2020 to 15,000 kilometers -lrb- 9,300 miles -rrb- . while the rail companies themselves will be laughing all the way to the bank , the alliance will also have environmentalists beaming from ear to ear , especially in germany . trains urged to meet environmental challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving budget airlines the red card earlier this year , german environment minister sigmar gabriel encouraged germans to take the train more often as part of the effort .
gabriel told the german tabloid bild in april that he planned to further subsidize germany 's extensive railway system to lure travelers away from inexpensive short-haul flights with airlines such as germanwings or ryanair . " we must ensure that train services are able to compete with air travel , " gabriel said , and suggested that train tickets should qualify for a sales tax break that would allow deutsche bahn ag to reduce ticket prices for consumers . " there is no tax on airline fuel , but the rail operator must pay the full value-added tax on the sale of long-distance tickets , " gabriel complained to the bundestag .
" that is unfair and can not remain that way . " super-fast rail link leads the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tgv-ice link aims to attract those who would normally fly much has been made about the environmental cost of operating so many cheap no-frill flights around europe and the train industry has regularly been told to pull its socks up in terms of offering a competitive alternative . only last month , deutsche bahn and sncf opened a new high-speed train link between paris and frankfurt which would provide fast connections to luxembourg and switzerland and cut the travel time between the french capital and frankfurt by two-and-a-half hours .
the new link was sold as a viable alternative to flying between the two neighboring countries . the new railteam alliance may also be another reason to stay on the rails . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's highest court dismissed a complaint concerning the bundestag 's decision to deploy six reconnaissance aircraft to southern afghanistan . the left party had filed a complaint with germany 's federal constitutional court .
the pacifist party , made up mainly of disgruntled social democrats and former communist party members , charged that the parliament 's decision to allow the mission violated a 1955 law governing germany 's role in nato .
the six tornado warplanes have been used to fly reconnaissance missions for nato forces since mid-april .
the planes are accompanied by approximately 200 military personnel .
under the mandate given to them , bundeswehr troops are prohibited from participating in combat missions .
members of the left party have said they are concerned that the tornado deployment would lead to troops becoming mired in fighting .
politicians welcome ruling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are part of a nato peacekeeping mission german defense minister franz josef jung welcomed the ruling and said he expects the parliament to approve an extension of the mandate this fall .
" i am happy the constitutional court confirmed the position of the government that the deployment of the tornado jets is constitutional and complies with our basic law , " he said at a security conference in berlin .
" i think that is an important message for our soldiers , who are making an important contribution to peace and stability .
the tornados offer protection to our soldiers and the -lrb- civilian -rrb- population . " the court ruled that the mission serves to protect " the security of the euro-atlantic region . " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier echoed jung 's comments , saying the tornado jets were helping with the security and rebuilding of afghanistan .

germany currently has about 3,000 soldiers serving with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission in the north of the country .
the tornados are equipped with two high-tech optical cameras along with an infra-red sensor in a pod slung below the fuselage .
their mission is to spy out taliban positions in the southern provinces of helmand , kandahar and uruzgan , where british , canadian and dutch troops are deployed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung has been a supporter of keeping troops in afghanistan under the terms of their six-month mission , they will not fly at low- level and will not be used to bomb taliban positions .
the german government has been adamant that the planes will not be used as fighter jets . " the reconnaissance gathered by our tornadoes will bring more stability and security to afghanistan , " german defense minister franz josef jung said when the planes were first deployed . " their mission is to protect isaf troops , as well as civilian aid workers and the afghan population . " public opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the constitutional court hand down their opinion the tornado mission will last until october under its current mandate .
a lengthy debate is expected this autumn when the bundestag debates an extension of the bundeswehr 's nato mandate . deployment of tornado jets has been controversial with the german public as well .
surveys show that many fear germany will become a target for terrorists if the bundeswehr is seen as aiding nato 's mission in afghanistan .
a poll by the tns institute earlier this spring showed 57 percent of those surveyed wanted a complete withdrawal of german troops from afghanistan , while 36 percent were in favor of continued engagement . only 4 percent backed increasing the german military presence . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's highest court dismissed a complaint concerning the bundestag 's decision to deploy six reconnaissance aircraft to southern afghanistan . the left party had filed a complaint with germany 's federal constitutional court .
the pacifist party , made up mainly of disgruntled social democrats and former communist party members , charged that the parliament 's decision to allow the mission violated a 1955 law governing germany 's role in nato .
the six tornado warplanes have been used to fly reconnaissance missions for nato forces since mid-april .
the planes are accompanied by approximately 200 military personnel .
under the mandate given to them , bundeswehr troops are prohibited from participating in combat missions .
members of the left party have said they are concerned that the tornado deployment would lead to troops becoming mired in fighting .
politicians welcome ruling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are part of a nato peacekeeping mission german defense minister franz josef jung welcomed the ruling and said he expects the parliament to approve an extension of the mandate this fall .
" i am happy the constitutional court confirmed the position of the government that the deployment of the tornado jets is constitutional and complies with our basic law , " he said at a security conference in berlin .
" i think that is an important message for our soldiers , who are making an important contribution to peace and stability .
the tornados offer protection to our soldiers and the -lrb- civilian -rrb- population . " the court ruled that the mission serves to protect " the security of the euro-atlantic region . " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier echoed jung 's comments , saying the tornado jets were helping with the security and rebuilding of afghanistan .
planes can stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three german soldiers were killed in afghanistan this spring the court ruled the parliament did not exceed its authority and dismissed the case tuesday , saying that the german government should be allowed maneuvering room in questions of foreign policy .
germany currently has about 3,000 soldiers serving with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission in the north of the country .
the tornados are equipped with two high-tech optical cameras along with an infra-red sensor in a pod slung below the fuselage .
their mission is to spy out taliban positions in the southern provinces of helmand , kandahar and uruzgan , where british , canadian and dutch troops are deployed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung has been a supporter of keeping troops in afghanistan under the terms of their six-month mission , they will not fly at low- level and will not be used to bomb taliban positions .
the german government has been adamant that the planes will not be used as fighter jets . " the reconnaissance gathered by our tornadoes will bring more stability and security to afghanistan , " german defense minister franz josef jung said when the planes were first deployed . " their mission is to protect isaf troops , as well as civilian aid workers and the afghan population . " public opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the constitutional court hand down their opinion the tornado mission will last until october under its current mandate .
a lengthy debate is expected this autumn when the bundestag debates an extension of the bundeswehr 's nato mandate . deployment of tornado jets has been controversial with the german public as well .
surveys show that many fear germany will become a target for terrorists if the bundeswehr is seen as aiding nato 's mission in afghanistan .
a poll by the tns institute earlier this spring showed 57 percent of those surveyed wanted a complete withdrawal of german troops from afghanistan , while 36 percent were in favor of continued engagement . only 4 percent backed increasing the german military presence . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a study at cologne university has revealed that turkish attitudes differ significantly from those of eu nationals when it comes to freedom of religion and gender equality .
but this could change if turkey joined the eu . citizens in practically all eu nations support the bloc 's basic principles : freedom of religion , democracy , gender equality and the rule of law .
according to a sociologist 's study at cologne university , however , turkey assumed an exceptional position when it came to freedom of religion and gender equality . " two basic eu principles are not being supported , " said frederike wuermeling , the author of the study .
although eu europeans varied in their attitudes , turkey held a " distinct marginal position " within europe , she said . only one-third of turks backed gender equality .
when it came to freedom of religion , only 16 percent explicitly agreed to this principle , the study revealed . however , turkey was in line with other eu countries when it came to the principles of the rule of law .
in terms of democratic principles , 87.9 percent of those surveyed in turkey supported this notion .
but 66.1 percent also said they considered a strong leader important , who did n't have to attend to the parliament . wealth and religion play a decisive role the study was based on data from the european values survey .
it had questioned some 1,000 respondents in each of the 27 eu member states , as well as in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this turkish artist questions his country 's eu compatibility according to wuermeling , turkey 's economic underdevelopment , as well as the country 's high percentage of muslims played a decisive role in this case . " there is a positive connection between a country 's wealth and the acceptance of eu principles , " wuermeling told dw-world.de. she said this meant that economic improvement could lead to a change in values . " this has been the case in the history of the eu , " wuermeling said .
" one can assume that it becomes more likely that a privileged partnership or eu membership would lead to a shift in values in turkey . "
a stronger orientation towards performance could make religion and traditional family structures less important . at the moment , however , this was not the case . " turkey does not fit into the eu at this time , " wuermeling said . turkey began negotiating for membership in the eu in 2005 .
last week , the eu resumed official accession talks with turkey , even though its membership is not guaranteed .
diplomats estimate that it could take 10 to 15 years to reach a result . religious reservations also exist in eu nations the study 's findings supported the so-called hypothesis of modernization .
it assumes that the higher a country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , level of education and degree of urbanization , the higher the agreement to eu principles .
the analysis also backed the cultural hypothesis , which states that the higher the percentage of muslims in a country and the higher the level of individual religious belief , the lower the agreement to eu principles . wuermeling 's study said that the biggest advocates of all four eu principles were sweden and denmark . in three european countries , the study noted a negative attitude .

a study at cologne university has revealed that turkish attitudes differ significantly from those of eu nationals when it comes to freedom of religion and gender equality .
but this could change if turkey joined the eu . citizens in practically all eu nations support the bloc 's basic principles : freedom of religion , democracy , gender equality and the rule of law .
according to a sociologist 's study at cologne university , however , turkey assumed an exceptional position when it came to freedom of religion and gender equality . " two basic eu principles are not being supported , " said frederike wuermeling , the author of the study .
although eu europeans varied in their attitudes , turkey held a " distinct marginal position " within europe , she said . only one-third of turks backed gender equality .
when it came to freedom of religion , only 16 percent explicitly agreed to this principle , the study revealed . however , turkey was in line with other eu countries when it came to the principles of the rule of law .
in terms of democratic principles , 87.9 percent of those surveyed in turkey supported this notion .
but 66.1 percent also said they considered a strong leader important , who did n't have to attend to the parliament . wealth and religion play a decisive role the study was based on data from the european values survey .

" this has been the case in the history of the eu , " wuermeling said .
" one can assume that it becomes more likely that a privileged partnership or eu membership would lead to a shift in values in turkey . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 03.07.2007 putin proposes broader european missile defense großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could europe become the home for a joint us-russian missile defense ?
george w. bush and vladimir putin struck a relaxed tone after their recent meeting in the united states , where both presidents searched for middle ground on the contentious issue of a us missile defense system in europe . us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin met at bush family 's oceanfront compound in kennebunkport , maine .
the two leaders hoped mend relations that have frayed in recent months over a number of issues concerning europe , including independence for kosovo and sanctions against iran .
but the us ' plans to station part of a missile defense shield in europe were at the top of the agenda .
while neither side backed down from their positions , bush and putin seemed ready to widen the dialogue within europe and to include nato in discussions .
" such cooperation , i believe , would result in raising to an entirely new level the quality of cooperation between russia and the united states , " putin said .
" for all practical purposes , this would lead to a great deal of development of strategic partnership in the area of security . "
" i 'm in strong agreement with that concept , " bush said of the proposal to widen the dialogue .
eastern europe still contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin had hoped a personal meeting would clear the clouds hanging over relations russia has expressed its opposition to the us proposal of setting up defensive missiles in poland and a radar tracking station in the czech republic .
while the us insisted the system would protect against rogue states such as iran , russia sees itself as a target .
at last month 's group of eight summit in germany , putin had suggested an alternative : a joint us-russia defense system located in azerbaijan .
on monday , putin surprised bush by proposing that the defense system be extended to other parts of europe , with nato participation .
bush welcomed the idea as " very constructive and bold " but insisted that the czech republic and poland remain " integral " to the system .
changing tones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin want to send a shared message the meeting was seen as fostering us-russian dialog in what the media called the presidents ' " lobster summit " after bush and putin went fishing together , with putin reeling in a striped bass .
the two seemed more relaxed than they had at the g8 meeting last month .
" the kennebunkport meeting seems to have succeeded in rekindling a sense of camaraderie between the two leaders , " charles kupchan , professor of international affairs at washington 's georgetown university told the afp news agency .
" but there does n't seem to have been substantial progress on reaching concrete agreements on any of the major areas of dispute . "
putin 's offer could be a serious alternative to the current plan , said kupchan , who was the head of european affairs on the national security council under former us president bill clinton .
but the offer could also be putin trying to divert us attention and stall the deployment of the defense system in eastern europe , kupchan added .
bush 's national security advisor stephen hadley said he believes putin wants to cooperate with the us , but acknowledged discussions remain in the preliminary stages .
" what you saw was a very interesting shift and some real progress on this issue , " hadley said .
iranian question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear plans remain a point of dispute between russia and the usa how to handle iran 's nuclear ambitions has also been a contentious issue between the us and russia .
" when russia and america speak along the same lines , it tends to have an effect , " bush said , adding that he and putin had agreed to send a common message .
but finding common ground could prove difficult as the us and its european allies accuse iran of using its nuclear program as a cover to build atomic weapons and are pushing for tougher un sanctions against tehran .
moscow , however , has maintained that iran has cooperated with un nuclear inspectors and sees progress in bringing iran into further compliance .
" so far , we have managed to work within the framework of the security council , and i think we will continue to be successful in this track , " putin said .
the future of the serbian province of kosovo was also a contentious issue with russia and the us having different views on the country 's future .
possible independence for kosovo was not mentioned in a press conference held at the end of the presidents ' meeting . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

george w. bush and vladimir putin struck a relaxed tone after their recent meeting in the united states , where both presidents searched for middle ground on the contentious issue of a us missile defense system in europe . us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin met at bush family 's oceanfront compound in kennebunkport , maine .
the two leaders hoped mend relations that have frayed in recent months over a number of issues concerning europe , including independence for kosovo and sanctions against iran .
but the us ' plans to station part of a missile defense shield in europe were at the top of the agenda .
while neither side backed down from their positions , bush and putin seemed ready to widen the dialogue within europe and to include nato in discussions .
" such cooperation , i believe , would result in raising to an entirely new level the quality of cooperation between russia and the united states , " putin said .
" for all practical purposes , this would lead to a great deal of development of strategic partnership in the area of security . "
" i 'm in strong agreement with that concept , " bush said of the proposal to widen the dialogue .
eastern europe still contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin had hoped a personal meeting would clear the clouds hanging over relations russia has expressed its opposition to the us proposal of setting up defensive missiles in poland and a radar tracking station in the czech republic .
while the us insisted the system would protect against rogue states such as iran , russia sees itself as a target .
at last month 's group of eight summit in germany , putin had suggested an alternative : a joint us-russia defense system located in azerbaijan .
on monday , putin surprised bush by proposing that the defense system be extended to other parts of europe , with nato participation .
bush welcomed the idea as " very constructive and bold " but insisted that the czech republic and poland remain " integral " to the system .
changing tones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin want to send a shared message the meeting was seen as fostering us-russian dialog in what the media called the presidents ' " lobster summit " after bush and putin went fishing together , with putin reeling in a striped bass .
the two seemed more relaxed than they had at the g8 meeting last month .
" the kennebunkport meeting seems to have succeeded in rekindling a sense of camaraderie between the two leaders , " charles kupchan , professor of international affairs at washington 's georgetown university told the afp news agency .
" but there does n't seem to have been substantial progress on reaching concrete agreements on any of the major areas of dispute . "
putin 's offer could be a serious alternative to the current plan , said kupchan , who was the head of european affairs on the national security council under former us president bill clinton .
but the offer could also be putin trying to divert us attention and stall the deployment of the defense system in eastern europe , kupchan added .
bush 's national security advisor stephen hadley said he believes putin wants to cooperate with the us , but acknowledged discussions remain in the preliminary stages .
" what you saw was a very interesting shift and some real progress on this issue , " hadley said .
iranian question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear plans remain a point of dispute between russia and the usa how to handle iran 's nuclear ambitions has also been a contentious issue between the us and russia .
" when russia and america speak along the same lines , it tends to have an effect , " bush said , adding that he and putin had agreed to send a common message .
but finding common ground could prove difficult as the us and its european allies accuse iran of using its nuclear program as a cover to build atomic weapons and are pushing for tougher un sanctions against tehran .
moscow , however , has maintained that iran has cooperated with un nuclear inspectors and sees progress in bringing iran into further compliance .
" so far , we have managed to work within the framework of the security council , and i think we will continue to be successful in this track , " putin said .
the future of the serbian province of kosovo was also a contentious issue with russia and the us having different views on the country 's future .

eastern europe still contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin had hoped a personal meeting would clear the clouds hanging over relations russia has expressed its opposition to the us proposal of setting up defensive missiles in poland and a radar tracking station in the czech republic .
while the us insisted the system would protect against rogue states such as iran , russia sees itself as a target .
at last month 's group of eight summit in germany , putin had suggested an alternative : a joint us-russia defense system located in azerbaijan .
on monday , putin surprised bush by proposing that the defense system be extended to other parts of europe , with nato participation .
bush welcomed the idea as " very constructive and bold " but insisted that the czech republic and poland remain " integral " to the system .
changing tones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin want to send a shared message the meeting was seen as fostering us-russian dialog in what the media called the presidents ' " lobster summit " after bush and putin went fishing together , with putin reeling in a striped bass .
the two seemed more relaxed than they had at the g8 meeting last month .
" the kennebunkport meeting seems to have succeeded in rekindling a sense of camaraderie between the two leaders , " charles kupchan , professor of international affairs at washington 's georgetown university told the afp news agency .
" but there does n't seem to have been substantial progress on reaching concrete agreements on any of the major areas of dispute . "
putin 's offer could be a serious alternative to the current plan , said kupchan , who was the head of european affairs on the national security council under former us president bill clinton .
but the offer could also be putin trying to divert us attention and stall the deployment of the defense system in eastern europe , kupchan added .
bush 's national security advisor stephen hadley said he believes putin wants to cooperate with the us , but acknowledged discussions remain in the preliminary stages .
" what you saw was a very interesting shift and some real progress on this issue , " hadley said .
iranian question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear plans remain a point of dispute between russia and the usa how to handle iran 's nuclear ambitions has also been a contentious issue between the us and russia .
" when russia and america speak along the same lines , it tends to have an effect , " bush said , adding that he and putin had agreed to send a common message .
but finding common ground could prove difficult as the us and its european allies accuse iran of using its nuclear program as a cover to build atomic weapons and are pushing for tougher un sanctions against tehran .
moscow , however , has maintained that iran has cooperated with un nuclear inspectors and sees progress in bringing iran into further compliance .
" so far , we have managed to work within the framework of the security council , and i think we will continue to be successful in this track , " putin said .
the future of the serbian province of kosovo was also a contentious issue with russia and the us having different views on the country 's future .

the locomotive drivers ' union gdl called a four-hour nationwide stoppage , following a series of pinpoint strikes by members of two other unions that disrupted services on monday .
all three unions are demanding that the state-owned national railways company deutsche bahn meet their demands for higher pay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many commuters were waiting in vain for trains on tuesday the gdl union is also seeking a separate contract as well as pay increases of up to 31 percent for deutsche bahn 's 20,000 train drivers and 12,000 related staff .
the transnet and gdba unions launched strike action monday after employers rejected their demands to raise pay for 134,000 unionized workers by 7 percent .
deutsche bahn offered a one-off payment of 300 euros -lrb- $ 402 -rrb- for this year and a 2-percent increase from january 2008 and another 2 percent in 2009 .
more strikes ahead gdl said the train drivers would end their stoppage at 9 a.m. , but warned it would ballot its members for all-out strike action if management failed to meet their demands .
" we 'll wait and see if the railway 's board makes us a new offer , " said gdl chairman manfred schell .
" if that 's not the case then further strike action ca n't be ruled out . "

the two sides met saturday evening in a last-ditch effort to avert a strike , but the negotiations broke up after eight hours on sunday without an agreement being reached .

a particularity of the bundeswehr is that it is a parliamentary army .
it 's not up to the ruling administration to decide on deployments as the president of the united states largely can do , but an issue for the parliament , and that 's where there will probably be a correction here or there to be made . some , especially in the left party , are hoping for more than a correction .
can the federal constitutional court really a play a main role in the tornados ' deployment ? the federal constitutional court is not the only actor .
human rights and un mandates and decisions are , of course , also involved , and they are not all completely justiciable for only the constitutional court .

linz was where police said one alleged drug trafficker was killed and that the two suspected paid killers had been picked up at the austrian-italian border .
the drug ring was also involved in bringing in cocaine from peru , chile and the dominican republic for sale in austria and italy .
latin american drug lords target europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is the top cocaine market after the us roughly 80 percent of cocaine from latin america that was destined for markets outside of the united states in 2005 was bound for europe , according to united states drug enforcement administration -lrb- dea -rrb- estimates .
in all , austrian police said the joint operation had led to the arrest of 54 people , mostly from south america , in austria , germany and italy .
police searches also found 16 kilos -lrb- 35 pounds -rrb- of heroin , some 28,000 pills of ecstasy , as well as weapons and false passports .
international drug trafficking rings have been drawn to the european market because of the higher prices paid on the continent . last year wholesale prices for cocaine in the european union ranged between 28,000 and 56,600 euros -lrb- $ 38,000 and $ 77,000 -rrb- per kilogram compared to between $ 9,000 and $ 40,000 in the united states where the supply is larger , according to the dea .
spain in the spotlight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is the main entry point for drugs from latin america trafficking groups from latin america are taking advantage of weak governments in african nations as well as their historical ties to europe to smuggle drugs into the continent , specifically spain . spain has become the main gateway for latin american cocaine coming into europe and has set up its own robust fight against drug smuggling .
spanish officials seized over 40 tons of cocaine last year , a record amount and more than any other nation in the world except for colombia , the united states and venezuela , camacho said .
the supply of cocaine in europe has increased since the late 1990s leading to lower prices . this , combined with its association to a supposedly glamorous lifestyle , is fueling its growing use , drug experts say . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she says children and young people are particularly tempted to take up the habit by smoking scenes in films and on tv . german television should show less people smoking , according to the country 's federal drug commissioner sabine bätzing . " there has been a shift in thinking at the broadcasters , " bätzing said in berlin on tuesday . bätzing was presenting a study entitled " smoking in film and television , " which is now being published in full .
the study , commissioned by the federal health ministry , came to the conclusion that there was more smoking in german series and films than in foreign productions , and significantly influences the smoking habits of children and young people . the study 's initial results were released in november .
as a result , bätzing contacted directors and those responsible for programming at the country 's public and private television stations . " they signaled a willingness to see to it that not smoking would be emphasized in their programming , " bätzing said . smoking stars as role models according to the study , film scenes with cigarettes entice children and young people to begin smoking themselves .
the study said their risk to become a smoker doubled when films they watched often contained scenes with smoking . bätzing said it was therefore necessary for the media to take its task as a role model seriously . stars who smoked were strong examples for children and youth , she said , encouraging more sensitivity and restraint from filmmakers and stations . " smoking in films and on television is not a dramaturgical means free of values , " bätzing said . the german upper house of parliament bundesrat will decide on friday on smoking bans in federal offices , public buses and trains . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 03.07.2007 study shows turkish values do n't coincide with eu ideals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could turkey 's attitudes change if it was part of the european union ?
a study at cologne university has revealed that turkish attitudes differ significantly from those of eu nationals when it comes to freedom of religion and gender equality .
but this could change if turkey joined the eu . citizens in practically all eu nations support the bloc 's basic principles : freedom of religion , democracy , gender equality and the rule of law .
according to a sociologist 's study at cologne university , however , turkey assumed an exceptional position when it came to freedom of religion and gender equality . " two basic eu principles are not being supported , " said frederike wuermeling , the author of the study .
although eu europeans varied in their attitudes , turkey held a " distinct marginal position " within europe , she said . only one-third of turks backed gender equality .
when it came to freedom of religion , only 16 percent explicitly agreed to this principle , the study revealed . however , turkey was in line with other eu countries when it came to the principles of the rule of law .
in terms of democratic principles , 87.9 percent of those surveyed in turkey supported this notion .
but 66.1 percent also said they considered a strong leader important , who did n't have to attend to the parliament . wealth and religion play a decisive role the study was based on data from the european values survey .
it had questioned some 1,000 respondents in each of the 27 eu member states , as well as in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this turkish artist questions his country 's eu compatibility according to wuermeling , turkey 's economic underdevelopment , as well as the country 's high percentage of muslims played a decisive role in this case . " there is a positive connection between a country 's wealth and the acceptance of eu principles , " wuermeling told dw-world.de. she said this meant that economic improvement could lead to a change in values . " this has been the case in the history of the eu , " wuermeling said .
" one can assume that it becomes more likely that a privileged partnership or eu membership would lead to a shift in values in turkey . "
a stronger orientation towards performance could make religion and traditional family structures less important . at the moment , however , this was not the case . " turkey does not fit into the eu at this time , " wuermeling said . turkey began negotiating for membership in the eu in 2005 .
last week , the eu resumed official accession talks with turkey , even though its membership is not guaranteed .
diplomats estimate that it could take 10 to 15 years to reach a result . religious reservations also exist in eu nations the study 's findings supported the so-called hypothesis of modernization .
it assumes that the higher a country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , level of education and degree of urbanization , the higher the agreement to eu principles .
the analysis also backed the cultural hypothesis , which states that the higher the percentage of muslims in a country and the higher the level of individual religious belief , the lower the agreement to eu principles . wuermeling 's study said that the biggest advocates of all four eu principles were sweden and denmark . in three european countries , the study noted a negative attitude .
in malta , with a catholic population of 97 percent , there were reservations regarding freedom of religion and equal rights .
in the predominantly orthodox greece , as well as in romania , the number of opponents to freedom of religion prevailed . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the existence of a real european high-speed network , which remains little known , needs to be made known to customers , " said sncf chief executive guillaume pepy . along with sncf , the alliance - dubbed railteam - will include germany 's deutsche bahn , oebb of austria , sncb of belgium , ns of the netherlands , cff of switzerland and eurostar uk of britain . taking their cue from airline networks skyteam , star alliance and one world , the companies want to make connections easier by improving scheduling and hooking up reservation systems . however , for the time being , the main innovation will be that if someone misses a connection because of a delay on the first leg of a trip , the passenger will be able to take the next train without having to get a new ticket . making rail travel easier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one ticket could see you leave frankfurt and arrive in london from january 2009 , passengers will need only one ticket for a cross-border trip with multiple connections , making it possible for example to go from frankfurt to london passing through paris on a single ticket . eventually , the alliance is to introduce customer fidelity programs that would allow passengers to accumulate points that could be used on the network as is already common in the airline industry . in order to avoid problems with antitrust regulators , members of the alliance would not agree on prices and would continue to set their own rates on routes currently covered by more than one of them . railteam aims to transport 25 million passengers per year as of 2010 from 15 million currently with high-speed rail lines expected to be extended by a third by 2020 to 15,000 kilometers -lrb- 9,300 miles -rrb- . while the rail companies themselves will be laughing all the way to the bank , the alliance will also have environmentalists beaming from ear to ear , especially in germany . trains urged to meet environmental challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving budget airlines the red card earlier this year , german environment minister sigmar gabriel encouraged germans to take the train more often as part of the effort .
gabriel told the german tabloid bild in april that he planned to further subsidize germany 's extensive railway system to lure travelers away from inexpensive short-haul flights with airlines such as germanwings or ryanair . " we must ensure that train services are able to compete with air travel , " gabriel said , and suggested that train tickets should qualify for a sales tax break that would allow deutsche bahn ag to reduce ticket prices for consumers . " there is no tax on airline fuel , but the rail operator must pay the full value-added tax on the sale of long-distance tickets , " gabriel complained to the bundestag .

the locomotive drivers ' union gdl called a four-hour nationwide stoppage , following a series of pinpoint strikes by members of two other unions that disrupted services on monday .
all three unions are demanding that the state-owned national railways company deutsche bahn meet their demands for higher pay .

the transnet and gdba unions launched strike action monday after employers rejected their demands to raise pay for 134,000 unionized workers by 7 percent .
deutsche bahn offered a one-off payment of 300 euros -lrb- $ 402 -rrb- for this year and a 2-percent increase from january 2008 and another 2 percent in 2009 .

george w. bush and vladimir putin struck a relaxed tone after their recent meeting in the united states , where both presidents searched for middle ground on the contentious issue of a us missile defense system in europe . us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin met at bush family 's oceanfront compound in kennebunkport , maine .
the two leaders hoped mend relations that have frayed in recent months over a number of issues concerning europe , including independence for kosovo and sanctions against iran .
but the us ' plans to station part of a missile defense shield in europe were at the top of the agenda .
while neither side backed down from their positions , bush and putin seemed ready to widen the dialogue within europe and to include nato in discussions .
" such cooperation , i believe , would result in raising to an entirely new level the quality of cooperation between russia and the united states , " putin said .
" for all practical purposes , this would lead to a great deal of development of strategic partnership in the area of security . "
" i 'm in strong agreement with that concept , " bush said of the proposal to widen the dialogue .
eastern europe still contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin had hoped a personal meeting would clear the clouds hanging over relations russia has expressed its opposition to the us proposal of setting up defensive missiles in poland and a radar tracking station in the czech republic .
while the us insisted the system would protect against rogue states such as iran , russia sees itself as a target .
at last month 's group of eight summit in germany , putin had suggested an alternative : a joint us-russia defense system located in azerbaijan .
on monday , putin surprised bush by proposing that the defense system be extended to other parts of europe , with nato participation .
bush welcomed the idea as " very constructive and bold " but insisted that the czech republic and poland remain " integral " to the system .
changing tones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin want to send a shared message the meeting was seen as fostering us-russian dialog in what the media called the presidents ' " lobster summit " after bush and putin went fishing together , with putin reeling in a striped bass .
the two seemed more relaxed than they had at the g8 meeting last month .
" the kennebunkport meeting seems to have succeeded in rekindling a sense of camaraderie between the two leaders , " charles kupchan , professor of international affairs at washington 's georgetown university told the afp news agency .
" but there does n't seem to have been substantial progress on reaching concrete agreements on any of the major areas of dispute . "
putin 's offer could be a serious alternative to the current plan , said kupchan , who was the head of european affairs on the national security council under former us president bill clinton .
but the offer could also be putin trying to divert us attention and stall the deployment of the defense system in eastern europe , kupchan added .
bush 's national security advisor stephen hadley said he believes putin wants to cooperate with the us , but acknowledged discussions remain in the preliminary stages .
" what you saw was a very interesting shift and some real progress on this issue , " hadley said .
iranian question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear plans remain a point of dispute between russia and the usa how to handle iran 's nuclear ambitions has also been a contentious issue between the us and russia .
" when russia and america speak along the same lines , it tends to have an effect , " bush said , adding that he and putin had agreed to send a common message .
but finding common ground could prove difficult as the us and its european allies accuse iran of using its nuclear program as a cover to build atomic weapons and are pushing for tougher un sanctions against tehran .
moscow , however , has maintained that iran has cooperated with un nuclear inspectors and sees progress in bringing iran into further compliance .
" so far , we have managed to work within the framework of the security council , and i think we will continue to be successful in this track , " putin said .
the future of the serbian province of kosovo was also a contentious issue with russia and the us having different views on the country 's future .
possible independence for kosovo was not mentioned in a press conference held at the end of the presidents ' meeting . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

george w. bush and vladimir putin struck a relaxed tone after their recent meeting in the united states , where both presidents searched for middle ground on the contentious issue of a us missile defense system in europe . us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin met at bush family 's oceanfront compound in kennebunkport , maine .
the two leaders hoped mend relations that have frayed in recent months over a number of issues concerning europe , including independence for kosovo and sanctions against iran .
but the us ' plans to station part of a missile defense shield in europe were at the top of the agenda .
while neither side backed down from their positions , bush and putin seemed ready to widen the dialogue within europe and to include nato in discussions .
" such cooperation , i believe , would result in raising to an entirely new level the quality of cooperation between russia and the united states , " putin said .
" for all practical purposes , this would lead to a great deal of development of strategic partnership in the area of security . "

while the us insisted the system would protect against rogue states such as iran , russia sees itself as a target .
at last month 's group of eight summit in germany , putin had suggested an alternative : a joint us-russia defense system located in azerbaijan .
on monday , putin surprised bush by proposing that the defense system be extended to other parts of europe , with nato participation .
bush welcomed the idea as " very constructive and bold " but insisted that the czech republic and poland remain " integral " to the system .

eu commission president jose manuel barroso meanwhile said that renegotiation is out of the question . members of the league of polish families , which forms part of poland 's right-wing coalition government , have said they will oppose adoption of the new treaty as it does not comply with polish family values and national interests , according to news reports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roman giertych said he wants poland 's interests put first " we will appeal to the public and to law and justice not to ratify the treaty , " said the league 's leader , deputy prime minister roman giertych , referring to the conservative party of president lech kaczynski and prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski .
" we will start a campaign against the treaty because , thanks to germany , it includes amendments which are putting eu interests ahead of poland 's interests . "
it is still not clear whether poland will ratify the treaty via referendum or through parliamentary approval .
the treaty will create an eu president and a foreign policy chief and make it easier to reach decisions in the long term by changing the current unanimous voting structure .
the agreement , however , falls short of an eu constitution , the draft of which was rejected by french and dutch voters and faced strong resistance from poland 's twin leaders .
according to reuters news service , the league has been blamed for the rise of xenophobia and racism in poland by the european parliament .
the party opposed the country 's eu membership in 2004 and has long held anti-german views .
no more negotiations eu commission president jose manuel barroso meanwhile said that there was no way to restart negotiations on the treaty , which leaders from the 27-member eu agreed to in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso said the time for negotiation is over " none of the issues which were agreed upon can be reopened again , " barroso told journalists during a visit to portugal to mark the beginning of the country 's eu presidency .
portugal is now in charge of drafting the new treaty , which portuguese prime minister jose socrates aims to have ready by october .
" the portuguese presidency has received a mandate to produce a new treaty , and in the mandate it does n't say : ' oh , by the way , you can revise the mandate , " ' said socrates at the same news conference with barroso .
" i do n't think it makes any sense nor do i see any country that wants to question " the mandate . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a study at cologne university has revealed that turkish attitudes differ significantly from those of eu nationals when it comes to freedom of religion and gender equality .
but this could change if turkey joined the eu . citizens in practically all eu nations support the bloc 's basic principles : freedom of religion , democracy , gender equality and the rule of law .
according to a sociologist 's study at cologne university , however , turkey assumed an exceptional position when it came to freedom of religion and gender equality . " two basic eu principles are not being supported , " said frederike wuermeling , the author of the study .
although eu europeans varied in their attitudes , turkey held a " distinct marginal position " within europe , she said . only one-third of turks backed gender equality .
when it came to freedom of religion , only 16 percent explicitly agreed to this principle , the study revealed . however , turkey was in line with other eu countries when it came to the principles of the rule of law .
in terms of democratic principles , 87.9 percent of those surveyed in turkey supported this notion .
but 66.1 percent also said they considered a strong leader important , who did n't have to attend to the parliament . wealth and religion play a decisive role the study was based on data from the european values survey .
it had questioned some 1,000 respondents in each of the 27 eu member states , as well as in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this turkish artist questions his country 's eu compatibility according to wuermeling , turkey 's economic underdevelopment , as well as the country 's high percentage of muslims played a decisive role in this case . " there is a positive connection between a country 's wealth and the acceptance of eu principles , " wuermeling told dw-world.de. she said this meant that economic improvement could lead to a change in values . " this has been the case in the history of the eu , " wuermeling said .
" one can assume that it becomes more likely that a privileged partnership or eu membership would lead to a shift in values in turkey . "
a stronger orientation towards performance could make religion and traditional family structures less important . at the moment , however , this was not the case . " turkey does not fit into the eu at this time , " wuermeling said . turkey began negotiating for membership in the eu in 2005 .
last week , the eu resumed official accession talks with turkey , even though its membership is not guaranteed .
diplomats estimate that it could take 10 to 15 years to reach a result . religious reservations also exist in eu nations the study 's findings supported the so-called hypothesis of modernization .
it assumes that the higher a country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , level of education and degree of urbanization , the higher the agreement to eu principles .
the analysis also backed the cultural hypothesis , which states that the higher the percentage of muslims in a country and the higher the level of individual religious belief , the lower the agreement to eu principles . wuermeling 's study said that the biggest advocates of all four eu principles were sweden and denmark . in three european countries , the study noted a negative attitude .

a study at cologne university has revealed that turkish attitudes differ significantly from those of eu nationals when it comes to freedom of religion and gender equality .
but this could change if turkey joined the eu . citizens in practically all eu nations support the bloc 's basic principles : freedom of religion , democracy , gender equality and the rule of law .
according to a sociologist 's study at cologne university , however , turkey assumed an exceptional position when it came to freedom of religion and gender equality . " two basic eu principles are not being supported , " said frederike wuermeling , the author of the study .
although eu europeans varied in their attitudes , turkey held a " distinct marginal position " within europe , she said . only one-third of turks backed gender equality .
when it came to freedom of religion , only 16 percent explicitly agreed to this principle , the study revealed . however , turkey was in line with other eu countries when it came to the principles of the rule of law .
in terms of democratic principles , 87.9 percent of those surveyed in turkey supported this notion .
but 66.1 percent also said they considered a strong leader important , who did n't have to attend to the parliament . wealth and religion play a decisive role the study was based on data from the european values survey .
it had questioned some 1,000 respondents in each of the 27 eu member states , as well as in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this turkish artist questions his country 's eu compatibility according to wuermeling , turkey 's economic underdevelopment , as well as the country 's high percentage of muslims played a decisive role in this case . " there is a positive connection between a country 's wealth and the acceptance of eu principles , " wuermeling told dw-world.de. she said this meant that economic improvement could lead to a change in values . " this has been the case in the history of the eu , " wuermeling said .
" one can assume that it becomes more likely that a privileged partnership or eu membership would lead to a shift in values in turkey . "
a stronger orientation towards performance could make religion and traditional family structures less important . at the moment , however , this was not the case . " turkey does not fit into the eu at this time , " wuermeling said . turkey began negotiating for membership in the eu in 2005 .
last week , the eu resumed official accession talks with turkey , even though its membership is not guaranteed .
diplomats estimate that it could take 10 to 15 years to reach a result . religious reservations also exist in eu nations the study 's findings supported the so-called hypothesis of modernization .
it assumes that the higher a country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , level of education and degree of urbanization , the higher the agreement to eu principles .
the analysis also backed the cultural hypothesis , which states that the higher the percentage of muslims in a country and the higher the level of individual religious belief , the lower the agreement to eu principles . wuermeling 's study said that the biggest advocates of all four eu principles were sweden and denmark . in three european countries , the study noted a negative attitude .

the country 's highest court dismissed a complaint concerning the bundestag 's decision to deploy six reconnaissance aircraft to southern afghanistan . the left party had filed a complaint with germany 's federal constitutional court .
the pacifist party , made up mainly of disgruntled social democrats and former communist party members , charged that the parliament 's decision to allow the mission violated a 1955 law governing germany 's role in nato .
the six tornado warplanes have been used to fly reconnaissance missions for nato forces since mid-april .
the planes are accompanied by approximately 200 military personnel .
under the mandate given to them , bundeswehr troops are prohibited from participating in combat missions .
members of the left party have said they are concerned that the tornado deployment would lead to troops becoming mired in fighting .
politicians welcome ruling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are part of a nato peacekeeping mission german defense minister franz josef jung welcomed the ruling and said he expects the parliament to approve an extension of the mandate this fall .
" i am happy the constitutional court confirmed the position of the government that the deployment of the tornado jets is constitutional and complies with our basic law , " he said at a security conference in berlin .
" i think that is an important message for our soldiers , who are making an important contribution to peace and stability .
the tornados offer protection to our soldiers and the -lrb- civilian -rrb- population . " the court ruled that the mission serves to protect " the security of the euro-atlantic region .

germany currently has about 3,000 soldiers serving with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission in the north of the country .
the tornados are equipped with two high-tech optical cameras along with an infra-red sensor in a pod slung below the fuselage .
their mission is to spy out taliban positions in the southern provinces of helmand , kandahar and uruzgan , where british , canadian and dutch troops are deployed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung has been a supporter of keeping troops in afghanistan under the terms of their six-month mission , they will not fly at low- level and will not be used to bomb taliban positions .

a lengthy debate is expected this autumn when the bundestag debates an extension of the bundeswehr 's nato mandate . deployment of tornado jets has been controversial with the german public as well .
surveys show that many fear germany will become a target for terrorists if the bundeswehr is seen as aiding nato 's mission in afghanistan .

the country 's highest court dismissed a complaint concerning the bundestag 's decision to deploy six reconnaissance aircraft to southern afghanistan . the left party had filed a complaint with germany 's federal constitutional court .
the pacifist party , made up mainly of disgruntled social democrats and former communist party members , charged that the parliament 's decision to allow the mission violated a 1955 law governing germany 's role in nato .
the six tornado warplanes have been used to fly reconnaissance missions for nato forces since mid-april .
the planes are accompanied by approximately 200 military personnel .
under the mandate given to them , bundeswehr troops are prohibited from participating in combat missions .
members of the left party have said they are concerned that the tornado deployment would lead to troops becoming mired in fighting .
politicians welcome ruling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are part of a nato peacekeeping mission german defense minister franz josef jung welcomed the ruling and said he expects the parliament to approve an extension of the mandate this fall .
" i am happy the constitutional court confirmed the position of the government that the deployment of the tornado jets is constitutional and complies with our basic law , " he said at a security conference in berlin .
" i think that is an important message for our soldiers , who are making an important contribution to peace and stability .
the tornados offer protection to our soldiers and the -lrb- civilian -rrb- population . " the court ruled that the mission serves to protect " the security of the euro-atlantic region . " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier echoed jung 's comments , saying the tornado jets were helping with the security and rebuilding of afghanistan .
planes can stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three german soldiers were killed in afghanistan this spring the court ruled the parliament did not exceed its authority and dismissed the case tuesday , saying that the german government should be allowed maneuvering room in questions of foreign policy .
germany currently has about 3,000 soldiers serving with the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission in the north of the country .
the tornados are equipped with two high-tech optical cameras along with an infra-red sensor in a pod slung below the fuselage .
their mission is to spy out taliban positions in the southern provinces of helmand , kandahar and uruzgan , where british , canadian and dutch troops are deployed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung has been a supporter of keeping troops in afghanistan under the terms of their six-month mission , they will not fly at low- level and will not be used to bomb taliban positions .
the german government has been adamant that the planes will not be used as fighter jets . " the reconnaissance gathered by our tornadoes will bring more stability and security to afghanistan , " german defense minister franz josef jung said when the planes were first deployed . " their mission is to protect isaf troops , as well as civilian aid workers and the afghan population . " public opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the constitutional court hand down their opinion the tornado mission will last until october under its current mandate .
a lengthy debate is expected this autumn when the bundestag debates an extension of the bundeswehr 's nato mandate . deployment of tornado jets has been controversial with the german public as well .
surveys show that many fear germany will become a target for terrorists if the bundeswehr is seen as aiding nato 's mission in afghanistan .
a poll by the tns institute earlier this spring showed 57 percent of those surveyed wanted a complete withdrawal of german troops from afghanistan , while 36 percent were in favor of continued engagement . only 4 percent backed increasing the german military presence . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the overall interest in all things gdr is also on the rise . the number of germans wanting to see the files the former east german secret service kept on them has increased , a report released in berlin on tuesday found .
according to the annual report , around 97,000 germans applied for access to their stasi files in 2006 , an increase of 20 percent from the previous year .
marianne birthler , the government official in charge of the stasi files archive , said that the number of people wanting to see their files was just one aspect of the overall increase in interest in the history of east germany .
the trend , she said , was continuing into 2007 with more than 7,000 people per month applying for access to files .
birthler said that the increase in interest was also on the rise in schools . " we have a new generation of people who have questions , " she said at the report 's launch . a big draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an installation at the stasi museum in berlin interest in the gdr and the stasi in the west is also on the increase thanks to a wave of historical and fictional publications on the east and successful german films such as 1999 's " sonnenallee " and 2007 's oscar-winning " das leben der anderen " -lrb- the lives of others -rrb- .

the overall interest in all things gdr is also on the rise . the number of germans wanting to see the files the former east german secret service kept on them has increased , a report released in berlin on tuesday found .
according to the annual report , around 97,000 germans applied for access to their stasi files in 2006 , an increase of 20 percent from the previous year .
marianne birthler , the government official in charge of the stasi files archive , said that the number of people wanting to see their files was just one aspect of the overall increase in interest in the history of east germany .
the trend , she said , was continuing into 2007 with more than 7,000 people per month applying for access to files .
birthler said that the increase in interest was also on the rise in schools . " we have a new generation of people who have questions , " she said at the report 's launch . a big draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an installation at the stasi museum in berlin interest in the gdr and the stasi in the west is also on the increase thanks to a wave of historical and fictional publications on the east and successful german films such as 1999 's " sonnenallee " and 2007 's oscar-winning " das leben der anderen " -lrb- the lives of others -rrb- .
birthler believes that there is not as much stigma attached to the stasi files as before , prompting more people to come forward to read their own .
there is also a desire to learn how the east german regime operated and the gdr 's role in the wider history of germany .
older generation still harbors suspicions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birthler 's colleagues were investigated while time and shifts in perception and culture continue to slowly change the way the stasi and its activities are seen by younger germans , many who lived under the communist regime still hold deep-rooted suspicions of those once involved with the secret service .
birthler 's own department was the subject of an investigation last year after it was revealed that former stasi operatives had been employed there . birthler rejected the accusations that the employment of former stasi members in " sensitive areas " of the archives was a security risk , calling them " absurd . "
the investigation eventually led to a number of employees being moved to other jobs . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if you want people to take notice of what you 're doing , show lots of couples having rampant sex in your promotional video . when it comes to institutions with a sexy image , the european commission is hardly the playboy mansion .

it is by far the most-watched video on the channel and has double the viewing figures of the next most popular : a short film about eu humanitarian aid which contains no sex whatsoever and only partial nudity .

she says children and young people are particularly tempted to take up the habit by smoking scenes in films and on tv . german television should show less people smoking , according to the country 's federal drug commissioner sabine bätzing . " there has been a shift in thinking at the broadcasters , " bätzing said in berlin on tuesday . bätzing was presenting a study entitled " smoking in film and television , " which is now being published in full .
the study , commissioned by the federal health ministry , came to the conclusion that there was more smoking in german series and films than in foreign productions , and significantly influences the smoking habits of children and young people . the study 's initial results were released in november .
as a result , bätzing contacted directors and those responsible for programming at the country 's public and private television stations . " they signaled a willingness to see to it that not smoking would be emphasized in their programming , " bätzing said . smoking stars as role models according to the study , film scenes with cigarettes entice children and young people to begin smoking themselves .
the study said their risk to become a smoker doubled when films they watched often contained scenes with smoking . bätzing said it was therefore necessary for the media to take its task as a role model seriously . stars who smoked were strong examples for children and youth , she said , encouraging more sensitivity and restraint from filmmakers and stations .

the study said their risk to become a smoker doubled when films they watched often contained scenes with smoking . bätzing said it was therefore necessary for the media to take its task as a role model seriously . stars who smoked were strong examples for children and youth , she said , encouraging more sensitivity and restraint from filmmakers and stations .

it is by far the most-watched video on the channel and has double the viewing figures of the next most popular : a short film about eu humanitarian aid which contains no sex whatsoever and only partial nudity .
however , the sexing-up of the eu has not gone down well and has been hard for some in the bloc to swallow , so to speak .

a study at cologne university has revealed that turkish attitudes differ significantly from those of eu nationals when it comes to freedom of religion and gender equality .
but this could change if turkey joined the eu . citizens in practically all eu nations support the bloc 's basic principles : freedom of religion , democracy , gender equality and the rule of law .
according to a sociologist 's study at cologne university , however , turkey assumed an exceptional position when it came to freedom of religion and gender equality . " two basic eu principles are not being supported , " said frederike wuermeling , the author of the study .
although eu europeans varied in their attitudes , turkey held a " distinct marginal position " within europe , she said . only one-third of turks backed gender equality .
when it came to freedom of religion , only 16 percent explicitly agreed to this principle , the study revealed . however , turkey was in line with other eu countries when it came to the principles of the rule of law .
in terms of democratic principles , 87.9 percent of those surveyed in turkey supported this notion .
but 66.1 percent also said they considered a strong leader important , who did n't have to attend to the parliament . wealth and religion play a decisive role the study was based on data from the european values survey .
it had questioned some 1,000 respondents in each of the 27 eu member states , as well as in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this turkish artist questions his country 's eu compatibility according to wuermeling , turkey 's economic underdevelopment , as well as the country 's high percentage of muslims played a decisive role in this case . " there is a positive connection between a country 's wealth and the acceptance of eu principles , " wuermeling told dw-world.de. she said this meant that economic improvement could lead to a change in values . " this has been the case in the history of the eu , " wuermeling said .
" one can assume that it becomes more likely that a privileged partnership or eu membership would lead to a shift in values in turkey . "
a stronger orientation towards performance could make religion and traditional family structures less important . at the moment , however , this was not the case . " turkey does not fit into the eu at this time , " wuermeling said . turkey began negotiating for membership in the eu in 2005 .
last week , the eu resumed official accession talks with turkey , even though its membership is not guaranteed .
diplomats estimate that it could take 10 to 15 years to reach a result . religious reservations also exist in eu nations the study 's findings supported the so-called hypothesis of modernization .
it assumes that the higher a country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , level of education and degree of urbanization , the higher the agreement to eu principles .
the analysis also backed the cultural hypothesis , which states that the higher the percentage of muslims in a country and the higher the level of individual religious belief , the lower the agreement to eu principles . wuermeling 's study said that the biggest advocates of all four eu principles were sweden and denmark . in three european countries , the study noted a negative attitude .
in malta , with a catholic population of 97 percent , there were reservations regarding freedom of religion and equal rights .
in the predominantly orthodox greece , as well as in romania , the number of opponents to freedom of religion prevailed . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the overall interest in all things gdr is also on the rise . the number of germans wanting to see the files the former east german secret service kept on them has increased , a report released in berlin on tuesday found .
according to the annual report , around 97,000 germans applied for access to their stasi files in 2006 , an increase of 20 percent from the previous year .
marianne birthler , the government official in charge of the stasi files archive , said that the number of people wanting to see their files was just one aspect of the overall increase in interest in the history of east germany .
the trend , she said , was continuing into 2007 with more than 7,000 people per month applying for access to files .
birthler said that the increase in interest was also on the rise in schools . " we have a new generation of people who have questions , " she said at the report 's launch . a big draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an installation at the stasi museum in berlin interest in the gdr and the stasi in the west is also on the increase thanks to a wave of historical and fictional publications on the east and successful german films such as 1999 's " sonnenallee " and 2007 's oscar-winning " das leben der anderen " -lrb- the lives of others -rrb- .
birthler believes that there is not as much stigma attached to the stasi files as before , prompting more people to come forward to read their own .
there is also a desire to learn how the east german regime operated and the gdr 's role in the wider history of germany .
older generation still harbors suspicions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birthler 's colleagues were investigated while time and shifts in perception and culture continue to slowly change the way the stasi and its activities are seen by younger germans , many who lived under the communist regime still hold deep-rooted suspicions of those once involved with the secret service .
birthler 's own department was the subject of an investigation last year after it was revealed that former stasi operatives had been employed there . birthler rejected the accusations that the employment of former stasi members in " sensitive areas " of the archives was a security risk , calling them " absurd . "
the investigation eventually led to a number of employees being moved to other jobs . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after talks with leaders of germany 's energy sector , chancellor angela merkel said tuesday that her government will present a new energy policy later this year .
industry representatives called her plans " unrealistic . " merkel said that climate change had been unambiguously proved by science to be happening and germany must act on emissions .
" obviously germany will make its contribution to achieving the targets , " she said , adding that the basic target was to cut co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
only if other nations joined in would germany expand the cut to 30 or 40 percent .
merkel said she could not promise that before negotiations were finished .
incentives to save energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel , merkel and glos after an earlier energy summit last year the chancellor also told reporters that economics minister michael glos and environment minister sigmar gabriel , who attended the meetings , would jointly work on a concept for a new energy and climate change policy to reach germany 's target to cut co2 emissions . gabriel said that the government 's proposals would be finalized by the fall and decided on before the un climate conference in december . he added that incentives to improve insulation and heating systems in buildings were under consideration .
germans would also be encouraged to use waste heat from power stations and buy power-saving home appliances , he said .
industry representatives , meanwhile , expressed their concerns about the government 's plans , saying that the goal to lower co2 emissions by 40 percent was unrealistic .
keep talking merkel said she expected annual climate-change talks with industry from 2010 onwards would review if the targets were feasible .
she also criticized energy providers for rising prices at the earliest opportunity after price caps expired on july 1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government wants to encourage people to improve insulation on their houses the energy " summit " in berlin was the third and last of a series of meetings on how energy-poor germany can keep the wheels of industry turning and electrical appliances running while reducing emissions .

economics minister glos , a member of the christian social union , the sister party of merkel 's christian democratic union , favors keeping nuclear power longer so as to hold down co2 emissions .
glos said tuesday that debate about this would continue until the next election in 2009 .

parmalat finanziaria fell in 2003 under 14 billion euros -lrb- $ 18.6bn ; £ 9.4bn -rrb- of debt , in one of europe 's biggest ever corporate bankruptcy cases .
the judge rejected a request by " new parmalat " to dismiss a group lawsuit by shareholders seeking compensation .
parmalat officials said on monday they planned to appeal against the ruling .
us district judge lewis a kaplan declined to dismiss parmalat , which he referred to as " new parmalat " from a shareholder complaint that is seeking class-action status .
he said the re-incarnated parmalat had assumed " all debts " belonging to its predecessor .
the judge added that under italian law , the new parmalat inherited the liabilities of the previous entity , parmalat finanziaria .
officials of the reorganised dairy firm had argued that any fraud had been committed by the previous company and they did not assume liability for the pre-insolvency behaviour of the company .
they also said the ruling was not consistent with the opinions of other italian courts .

existing eurotunnel shares were swapped for shares in the newly created groupe eurotunnel after the firm agreed a deal with its creditors to cut its debt .
but analysts set a target price for the new get shares well below the level at which they were issued .
get shares were trading down 42 % , at 45 euro cents , at close on monday .
analysts at societe generale envisage the newly issued shares trading at about 26 euros cents within one year .
eurotunnel shares , which are set to be delisted , fell 6.5 % to 72 cents .
decades of problems since its formation in 1986 , the channel tunnel operator has struggled to make cash , owing to larger-than-expected construction costs and lower-than-estimated traffic through the tunnel .
existing shareholders were able to swap their shares on a one-for-one basis in the new entity .
the share swap followed tough negotiations with creditors and put a line under 20 years of financial problems for the group .
since the tunnel opened in 1994 , losses sustained during its construction were never recovered through car and freight traffic or through its high speed train user eurostar , which meant the debt could never be paid back .

existing eurotunnel shares were swapped for shares in the newly created groupe eurotunnel after the firm agreed a deal with its creditors to cut its debt .
but analysts set a target price for the new get shares well below the level at which they were issued .
get shares were trading down 42 % , at 45 euro cents , at close on monday .
analysts at societe generale envisage the newly issued shares trading at about 26 euros cents within one year .
eurotunnel shares , which are set to be delisted , fell 6.5 % to 72 cents .
decades of problems since its formation in 1986 , the channel tunnel operator has struggled to make cash , owing to larger-than-expected construction costs and lower-than-estimated traffic through the tunnel .
existing shareholders were able to swap their shares on a one-for-one basis in the new entity .
the share swap followed tough negotiations with creditors and put a line under 20 years of financial problems for the group .
since the tunnel opened in 1994 , losses sustained during its construction were never recovered through car and freight traffic or through its high speed train user eurostar , which meant the debt could never be paid back .

sap said changes had now been made to tomorrownow 's management .
" even a single inappropriate download is unacceptable from my perspective .

lucrative market oracle has claimed the german firm is guilty of " corporate theft on a grand scale " by gaining illegal access to one of its customer support websites .
oracle and sap compete in the business software sector , selling programs that help firms to run more efficiently .
oracle 's lawsuit claims that sap resorted to illegal activity to maintain its leadership in the market for business applications software .

the software was part of the peoplesoft business that was bought by oracle in 2005 .
the peoplesoft deal was one of a $ 20bn series of takeovers that oracle has pulled off in the past three years , exerting greater pressure on market leader sap .
through its actions , tomorrownow had assembled a " storehouse of stolen oracle intellectual property " , oracle says .
" this theft appears to be an essential , and illegal , part of sap 's competitive strategy against oracle , " the complaint - lodged with a federal court in san francisco - alleges .

he was enmeshed in the inquiry into the leaking of the identity of a cia operative - who happened to be the wife of a prominent critic of white house iraq policy .
as chief aide to vice-president dick cheney , libby had been involved in almost every major decision made by the bush administration .
he immediately resigned after a federal grand jury indicted him on five counts in the cia leak case .
they included charges of obstruction of justice , making a false statement and perjury .
he was convicted of all but one of the charges in march 2007 .
he was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison , two years of probation and a fine of $ 250,000 -lrb- £ 125,000 -rrb- in june .
but in july , president george w bush intervened to commute libby 's sentence , describing it as " excessive " .
though no longer required to go to jail , libby is still due to serve the probation period and pay the fine .
key iraq role seen as an arch neo-conservative - schooled at yale by the hawkish former deputy defence secretary paul wolfowitz - libby had been described as " a force multiplier for cheney 's agenda and views " . "
i 'm a great fan of the vice-president - i think he 's one of the smartest , most honourable people i 've ever met " " scooter " libby he played a key role in compiling the white house 's allegations over iraq 's weapons of mass destruction , and opponents said he tried to firm up a number of discredited allegations that had been used to build the case against saddam hussein .
these included the assertion that a saddam agent met one of the lead hijackers in prague in the months before the 9/11 attacks on the us .
libby also took flak from opponents after reports that he had met pentagon officials before a substantial contract to repair iraq 's oil fields was awarded to halliburton - mr cheney 's old firm .
nickname libby was a lawyer before becoming an adviser to mr wolfowitz at the state department in 1981 , at the start of the reagan administration .
after another spell in private practice , he returned to mr wolfowitz 's side in 1991 , this time at the pentagon in the administration of president george bush senior .
it was there that a policy paper he wrote , calling for the us to build up its military strength to a point at which it could not be challenged , caught the eye of mr cheney , who was then defence secretary .
libby is also an accomplished skier , and the author of a highly praised 1996 novel - the apprentice , a tale of passion and murder set in rural japan in 1903 .
in a us tv interview to promote the paperback edition of the book in 2002 , libby told host larry king : " i 'm a great fan of the vice-president .
i think he 's one of the smartest , most honourable people i 've ever met .
" so , i 'd like to consider myself fully on his team , but there 's always a novel kicking around in the back somewhere . "
the nickname " scooter " reportedly derives from the way he scooted about his cot as a baby .

french researchers told a fertility conference in lyon how risk of ovarian , kidney and thyroid cancers rises by more than a third with the condition .
meanwhile , spanish researchers described a potential new endometriosis drug treatment .
in endometriosis , the type of tissue that lines the inside of the womb is found elsewhere in the body .
maybe the treatment of endometriosis can influence cancer development dr anna-sofia melin karolinska institute when a woman menstruates , the tissue degenerates , causing pain , bloating , heavy bleeding and fatigue .
the condition is known to be linked with certain cancers and with difficulty conceiving , although it has been unclear exactly why .
dr anna-sofia melin and colleagues at the karolinska institute in stockholm , sweden , looked at data on 63,630 women with endometriosis .
they identified 3,822 cases of cancer among these women - which is no more than the general population .
however , certain tumour types , including ovary and brain , were far more common with endometriosis .
dr melin said various theories for the link between endometriosis and cancer had been put forward .
" it could be that defects in the immune system allow the endometriosis to grow and also might allow cancer cells to grow in different parts of the body .
" maybe the treatment of endometriosis can influence cancer development .
we do not know yet . "
the study showed that the cancer risk remained similar regardless of how many children a woman had .
the researchers said this made it unlikely that fertility problems associated with endometriosis were to blame for the elevated cancer risk .
' not cancer condition ' dr edurne novella-maestre and colleagues from the valencia infertility institute in spain told the eshre conference how a new treatment might block endometriosis and the associated cancers .
in mice , drugs that mimic the brain chemical dopamine - similar to those used to treat parkinson 's disease - stopped the formation of new blood vessels which feed the abnormal growths .
professor jan brosens , honorary consultant gynaecologist and obstetrician at imperial college london , said : " endometriosis is indeed dependent upon the growth of new vessels .
" furthermore , dopamine agonists are safe drugs , which could be useful in reducing leakage of newly formed vessels .
" however , endometriosis is a slow and progressive disease and whether this class of drugs would really improve the symptoms of affected women remains speculative . "
he said endometriosis should not be viewed as a condition that leads to cancer .
but mary lou ballweg , of the endometriosis association , said : " there 's a danger doctors might feel women do n't want to know about the extra cancer risk .
" but what 's worse , to be a little afraid and watchful for symptoms or to be dead ?
" women need to be seeing a specialist to ensure they are getting the best possible help . "
dr joanna owens , cancer research uk 's senior science information officer , said : " previously published research suggests that endometriosis can affect cancer risk and further studies are needed to fully explain this link .
" our advice to all women is to know your body , contact your doctor promptly if you notice any changes and attend screening when invited . "

the study showed that the cancer risk remained similar regardless of how many children a woman had .
the researchers said this made it unlikely that fertility problems associated with endometriosis were to blame for the elevated cancer risk .

he was found guilty of four of the five counts against him and sentenced to 30 months in prison .
president george w bush later intervened to commute libby 's sentence .
libby is the only person charged over the leak investigation the prosecution said libby tried to block an investigation into who revealed that the wife of a white house critic was secretly a cia agent .
no-one was ever charged with the leak itself , but the prosecution said libby was part of a cover-up .
his defence argued that his inconsistent testimony to investigators was the result of honest lapses in the memory of a very busy public official .
here , we summarise the most important developments in the trial as it progressed .
monday , 2 july 2007 president bush intervenes to commute libby 's sentence , describing it as " excessive " .
though no longer required to go to jail , libby is still due to serve the probation period and pay the fine .
earlier , a us appeals court refuses to delay libby 's jail sentence .
his supporters call on president bush to pardon him .
thursday , 14 june 2007 libby is told by judge walton he can not delay starting his jail term while he appeals against his conviction .
libby 's lawyers say they will seek an emergency order delaying his prison sentence .
they are also appealing against libby 's conviction .
tuesday , 5 june 2007 libby is sentenced to 30 months in jail and fined $ 250,000 -lrb- £ 125,000 -rrb- .
judge walton also places libby on probation for two years following his release from prison .
libby remains free pending an appeal hearing .
tuesday , 6 march 2007 the jury finds libby guilty on four of the five counts against him .
libby 's defence attorney , ted wells , says he will request a new trial - a common tactic - and if it is denied , will appeal against the verdict .
sentencing is set for 5 june .
libby is fingerprinted and released on his own recognizance .
monday , 26 february the judge dismisses one juror - an older woman who works at an art gallery - after she admits to coming into contact with material about the trial at the weekend .
the defence says it is happy to continue with only 11 jurors , while the prosecution says it would prefer 12 .
-lrb- there are two alternates who may be available to join the jury , although that would mean restarting deliberations from the beginning . -rrb-
the judge decides to continue with 11 .
wednesday , 21 february judge reggie b walton gives the jury about an hour of instruction on legal issues related to the case and sends them out to decide their verdict .
they will meet from 0900 to 1700 , with an hour for lunch , each weekday until they reach a verdict on all five counts .
tuesday , 20 february prosecution and defence make their closing arguments .
prosecutor patrick fitzgerald summarises his case bluntly for the jury : libby " made a gamble .
he lied .
do n't you think the fbi and the grand jury and the american people are entitled to straight answers ? "
lead defence lawyer theodore wells responds with an emotional plea : " this is a man with a wife and two children .
he is a good person .
he 's been under my protection for the last month .
i give him to you .
give him back to me . "
wednesday , 14 february judge reggie walton denies a defence request to recall journalist tim russert for additional testimony .
he also says that , as libby will not testify , libby 's former cia briefers can not testify .
defence lawyers make a final speech about libby 's national security responsibilities at the white house , then rest their case .
tuesday , 13 february the defence announces that neither libby nor vice-president cheney will testify .
judge walton asks libby to confirm that he is giving up his right to speak in his own defence , prompting his only utterance in court : " yes , sir . "
john hannah , who worked for libby at the white house testifies that the defendant " had an awful memory " - a key part of the defence case .
monday , 12 february some of washington 's best-known journalists take the stand as the defence of libby begins .
bob woodward and walter pincus of the washington post and david sanger of the new york times testify that libby did not tell them about valerie plame , the wife of administration critic joseph wilson .
mr woodward plays out a tape of former deputy secretary of state richard armitage revealing ms plame 's identity to him .
robert novak - who was the first to publish that ms plame worked for the cia - also testifies for the defence .
the defence seems to be trying to persuade the jury that libby did not leak ms plame 's identity as part of a deliberate white house strategy to attack mr wilson .
thursday , 8 february lawyers for the defence continue to question prosecution witness nbc journalist tim russert .
they ask him why he told an fbi agent about a july 2003 conversation with libby , but later said in a sworn statement that he would not testify about the conversation because it was confidential .
mr russert says he viewed the fbi conversation and the subpoena differently .
the prosecution then rests its case .
wednesday , 7 february the prosecution calls its final scheduled witness , nbc journalist tim russert , who contradicts previously secret testimony given by mr libby to a grand jury in 2004 .
mr russert tells the court he never discussed the identity of ms plame with libby , who has asserted that mr russert told him ms plame 's identity .
-lrb- the five charges against libby revolve around what he told investigators about how and when he learned of ms plame . -rrb-
defence lawyers question mr russert 's account , suggesting that as a reporter , mr russert would have wanted to discuss the issue during a telephone conversation with libby as the story broke in 2003 .
tuesday , 6 february the trial continues to hear some of the more than six hours of audio tapes of libby 's secret grand jury testimony .
libby is heard saying he learned about ms plame from vice-president cheney , forgot about her , then learned about her again from mr russert several weeks later .
libby is also heard repeatedly saying he can not remember details of conversations other officials have said they had with him .
monday , 5 february prosecutors begin to play audio tapes of libby 's secret grand jury testimony dating from march 2004 .
the testimony forms key evidence in the charges against him .
on one tape , investigator patrick fitzgerald is heard asking libby if he understands that a person who does not tell the truth to a grand jury can be charged with perjury .
libby replies that he understands .
judge reggie walton rules that the recordings of the grand jury testimony will be released publicly after the trial has finished hearing them .
libby 's lawyers had argued that releasing them would " seriously threaten " his right to a fair trial .
thursday , 1 february judge reggie walton casts doubt on the defence argument that the white house made a " scapegoat " of libby , sacrificing him to protect president bush 's political guru karl rove .
the judge allows the prosecution to play portions of videos of briefings by former white house press spokesman scott mcclellan in which he denies either libby or mr rove was behind the leak .
later , fbi agent deborah bond - one of the investigators into the leak - says libby did not tell her of many conversations he had had with reporters about valerie plame before he claims he learned from nbc newsman tim russert that she worked for the cia .
the defence presses ms bond to acknowledge libby had said he was uncertain about his memory and needed to consult notes to be sure of his facts .
wednesday , 31 january libby 's lawyers cross-examine former new york times reporter judith miller , who a day earlier said he had twice told her ms plame worked for the cia before he claims to have learned that fact .
under cross-examination , she admits that she can not be " absolutely , absolutely certain " that she first heard about ms plame - the wife of bush administration critic joseph wilson - from libby .
former time magazine white house correspondent matt cooper takes the stand after ms miller .
he says he first learned of ms plame from mr rove and that libby confirmed her identity for him on 12 july 2003 .
testifying for the prosecution , he says libby told him " i 've heard that too " when he mentioned having heard from mr rove that ms plame worked for the cia .
he says libby did not qualify his statement in any way , although libby said under oath he had told reporters he was only citing rumours he had heard from other journalists .
libby 's lawyers cast doubt on mr cooper 's note-taking and memory of events , saying his testimony does not match communications he had with his editors at the time .
tuesday , 30 january former new york times reporter judith miller - who went to jail for 85 days to shield libby as a confidential source - testifies that he told her on 23 june 2003 that ms plame worked for the cia .
that is three weeks before libby claims to have learned the information from nbc journalist tim russert .
earlier , libby 's successor as vice-president cheney 's chief of staff , david addington , says libby told him in september 2003 : " i did n't do it . "
mr addington says he did not ask libby what " it " was .
monday , 29 january ari fleischer , president bush 's former press spokesman , testifies that libby told him that ms plame worked for the cia on 7 july 2003 .
he says libby mentioned the connection matter-of-factly , adding that it was " hush-hush " .
the former spokesman says he revealed it to two journalists , one from nbc and one from time , on 11 july 2003 , not realising it was classified .
the defence attempts to cast doubt on mr fleischer 's memory of events .
he stands by most of his statements , but admits that he is not certain libby used ms plame 's name in the 7 july conversation .
mr fleischer obtained immunity from prosecution for the leak in a deal with prosecutors in february 2004 .
thursday , 25 january vice-president cheney 's former spokeswoman catherine martin , a prosecution witness , testifies that she personally told libby and mr cheney that ms plame worked for the cia several days before libby claims to have heard of the association from mr russert .
she says mr cheney ordered her to monitor media coverage of ms plame 's husband joseph wilson after he emerged as an administration critic .
but she says neither mr cheney nor libby suggested leaking ms plame 's identity as part of a strategy to rebut mr wilson 's attacks .
prosecutor patrick fitzgerald says that he offered former white house spokesman ari fleischer immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony - without first knowing what mr fleischer knew , an arrangement the defence calls highly unusual .
wednesday , 24 january the prosecution calls three witnesses , former senior state department official marc grossman ; former cia official robert grenier ; and craig schmall , libby 's former cia briefer .
all testify they had discussed valerie plame with libby - contradicting his statement to investigators that he had learned about her from nbc newsman tim russert .
the defence seeks to exposes inconsistencies in the testimony of the three men .
tuesday , 23 january a jury of nine men , three women and four alternates is seated , days later than expected .
the defence blocked any potential jurors who expressed dislike of the bush administration or its conduct of the war , since vice-president cheney is expected to testify on libby 's behalf and the defence does not want jurors who already do not trust him .
prosecutor patrick fitzgerald says in his opening statement that libby had lied about conversations he had had with reporters .
the prosecution says libby had claimed he had learned from journalists that valerie plame was a cia agent and was married to white house critic joseph wilson , when in fact he was providing that information to the media .
defence lawyer theodore wells responds with a surprising line of argument in his opening statement .
he says libby was made a scapegoat by the white house in order to protect president bush 's chief political strategist karl rove , who has admitted to being a source of the original leak .

the former spokesman says he revealed it to two journalists , one from nbc and one from time , on 11 july 2003 , not realising it was classified .
the defence attempts to cast doubt on mr fleischer 's memory of events .
he stands by most of his statements , but admits that he is not certain libby used ms plame 's name in the 7 july conversation .
mr fleischer obtained immunity from prosecution for the leak in a deal with prosecutors in february 2004 .
thursday , 25 january vice-president cheney 's former spokeswoman catherine martin , a prosecution witness , testifies that she personally told libby and mr cheney that ms plame worked for the cia several days before libby claims to have heard of the association from mr russert .
she says mr cheney ordered her to monitor media coverage of ms plame 's husband joseph wilson after he emerged as an administration critic .
but she says neither mr cheney nor libby suggested leaking ms plame 's identity as part of a strategy to rebut mr wilson 's attacks .
prosecutor patrick fitzgerald says that he offered former white house spokesman ari fleischer immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony - without first knowing what mr fleischer knew , an arrangement the defence calls highly unusual .
wednesday , 24 january the prosecution calls three witnesses , former senior state department official marc grossman ; former cia official robert grenier ; and craig schmall , libby 's former cia briefer .
all testify they had discussed valerie plame with libby - contradicting his statement to investigators that he had learned about her from nbc newsman tim russert .
the defence seeks to exposes inconsistencies in the testimony of the three men .
tuesday , 23 january a jury of nine men , three women and four alternates is seated , days later than expected .
the defence blocked any potential jurors who expressed dislike of the bush administration or its conduct of the war , since vice-president cheney is expected to testify on libby 's behalf and the defence does not want jurors who already do not trust him .
prosecutor patrick fitzgerald says in his opening statement that libby had lied about conversations he had had with reporters .
the prosecution says libby had claimed he had learned from journalists that valerie plame was a cia agent and was married to white house critic joseph wilson , when in fact he was providing that information to the media .
defence lawyer theodore wells responds with a surprising line of argument in his opening statement .
he says libby was made a scapegoat by the white house in order to protect president bush 's chief political strategist karl rove , who has admitted to being a source of the original leak .

he was found guilty of four of the five counts against him and sentenced to 30 months in prison .
president george w bush later intervened to commute libby 's sentence .
libby is the only person charged over the leak investigation the prosecution said libby tried to block an investigation into who revealed that the wife of a white house critic was secretly a cia agent .
no-one was ever charged with the leak itself , but the prosecution said libby was part of a cover-up .
his defence argued that his inconsistent testimony to investigators was the result of honest lapses in the memory of a very busy public official .
here , we summarise the most important developments in the trial as it progressed .
monday , 2 july 2007 president bush intervenes to commute libby 's sentence , describing it as " excessive " .
though no longer required to go to jail , libby is still due to serve the probation period and pay the fine .
earlier , a us appeals court refuses to delay libby 's jail sentence .
his supporters call on president bush to pardon him .
thursday , 14 june 2007 libby is told by judge walton he can not delay starting his jail term while he appeals against his conviction .
libby 's lawyers say they will seek an emergency order delaying his prison sentence .
they are also appealing against libby 's conviction .
tuesday , 5 june 2007 libby is sentenced to 30 months in jail and fined $ 250,000 -lrb- £ 125,000 -rrb- .
judge walton also places libby on probation for two years following his release from prison .
libby remains free pending an appeal hearing .
tuesday , 6 march 2007 the jury finds libby guilty on four of the five counts against him .
libby 's defence attorney , ted wells , says he will request a new trial - a common tactic - and if it is denied , will appeal against the verdict .
sentencing is set for 5 june .
libby is fingerprinted and released on his own recognizance .
monday , 26 february the judge dismisses one juror - an older woman who works at an art gallery - after she admits to coming into contact with material about the trial at the weekend .
the defence says it is happy to continue with only 11 jurors , while the prosecution says it would prefer 12 .
-lrb- there are two alternates who may be available to join the jury , although that would mean restarting deliberations from the beginning . -rrb-
the judge decides to continue with 11 .
wednesday , 21 february judge reggie b walton gives the jury about an hour of instruction on legal issues related to the case and sends them out to decide their verdict .
they will meet from 0900 to 1700 , with an hour for lunch , each weekday until they reach a verdict on all five counts .
tuesday , 20 february prosecution and defence make their closing arguments .
prosecutor patrick fitzgerald summarises his case bluntly for the jury : libby " made a gamble .
he lied .
do n't you think the fbi and the grand jury and the american people are entitled to straight answers ? "
lead defence lawyer theodore wells responds with an emotional plea : " this is a man with a wife and two children .
he is a good person .
he 's been under my protection for the last month .
i give him to you .
give him back to me . "
wednesday , 14 february judge reggie walton denies a defence request to recall journalist tim russert for additional testimony .
he also says that , as libby will not testify , libby 's former cia briefers can not testify .
defence lawyers make a final speech about libby 's national security responsibilities at the white house , then rest their case .
tuesday , 13 february the defence announces that neither libby nor vice-president cheney will testify .
judge walton asks libby to confirm that he is giving up his right to speak in his own defence , prompting his only utterance in court : " yes , sir . "
john hannah , who worked for libby at the white house testifies that the defendant " had an awful memory " - a key part of the defence case .
monday , 12 february some of washington 's best-known journalists take the stand as the defence of libby begins .
bob woodward and walter pincus of the washington post and david sanger of the new york times testify that libby did not tell them about valerie plame , the wife of administration critic joseph wilson .
mr woodward plays out a tape of former deputy secretary of state richard armitage revealing ms plame 's identity to him .
robert novak - who was the first to publish that ms plame worked for the cia - also testifies for the defence .
the defence seems to be trying to persuade the jury that libby did not leak ms plame 's identity as part of a deliberate white house strategy to attack mr wilson .
thursday , 8 february lawyers for the defence continue to question prosecution witness nbc journalist tim russert .
they ask him why he told an fbi agent about a july 2003 conversation with libby , but later said in a sworn statement that he would not testify about the conversation because it was confidential .
mr russert says he viewed the fbi conversation and the subpoena differently .
the prosecution then rests its case .
wednesday , 7 february the prosecution calls its final scheduled witness , nbc journalist tim russert , who contradicts previously secret testimony given by mr libby to a grand jury in 2004 .
mr russert tells the court he never discussed the identity of ms plame with libby , who has asserted that mr russert told him ms plame 's identity .
-lrb- the five charges against libby revolve around what he told investigators about how and when he learned of ms plame . -rrb-
defence lawyers question mr russert 's account , suggesting that as a reporter , mr russert would have wanted to discuss the issue during a telephone conversation with libby as the story broke in 2003 .
tuesday , 6 february the trial continues to hear some of the more than six hours of audio tapes of libby 's secret grand jury testimony .
libby is heard saying he learned about ms plame from vice-president cheney , forgot about her , then learned about her again from mr russert several weeks later .
libby is also heard repeatedly saying he can not remember details of conversations other officials have said they had with him .
monday , 5 february prosecutors begin to play audio tapes of libby 's secret grand jury testimony dating from march 2004 .
the testimony forms key evidence in the charges against him .
on one tape , investigator patrick fitzgerald is heard asking libby if he understands that a person who does not tell the truth to a grand jury can be charged with perjury .
libby replies that he understands .
judge reggie walton rules that the recordings of the grand jury testimony will be released publicly after the trial has finished hearing them .
libby 's lawyers had argued that releasing them would " seriously threaten " his right to a fair trial .
thursday , 1 february judge reggie walton casts doubt on the defence argument that the white house made a " scapegoat " of libby , sacrificing him to protect president bush 's political guru karl rove .
the judge allows the prosecution to play portions of videos of briefings by former white house press spokesman scott mcclellan in which he denies either libby or mr rove was behind the leak .
later , fbi agent deborah bond - one of the investigators into the leak - says libby did not tell her of many conversations he had had with reporters about valerie plame before he claims he learned from nbc newsman tim russert that she worked for the cia .
the defence presses ms bond to acknowledge libby had said he was uncertain about his memory and needed to consult notes to be sure of his facts .
wednesday , 31 january libby 's lawyers cross-examine former new york times reporter judith miller , who a day earlier said he had twice told her ms plame worked for the cia before he claims to have learned that fact .
under cross-examination , she admits that she can not be " absolutely , absolutely certain " that she first heard about ms plame - the wife of bush administration critic joseph wilson - from libby .
former time magazine white house correspondent matt cooper takes the stand after ms miller .
he says he first learned of ms plame from mr rove and that libby confirmed her identity for him on 12 july 2003 .
testifying for the prosecution , he says libby told him " i 've heard that too " when he mentioned having heard from mr rove that ms plame worked for the cia .
he says libby did not qualify his statement in any way , although libby said under oath he had told reporters he was only citing rumours he had heard from other journalists .
libby 's lawyers cast doubt on mr cooper 's note-taking and memory of events , saying his testimony does not match communications he had with his editors at the time .
tuesday , 30 january former new york times reporter judith miller - who went to jail for 85 days to shield libby as a confidential source - testifies that he told her on 23 june 2003 that ms plame worked for the cia .
that is three weeks before libby claims to have learned the information from nbc journalist tim russert .
earlier , libby 's successor as vice-president cheney 's chief of staff , david addington , says libby told him in september 2003 : " i did n't do it . "
mr addington says he did not ask libby what " it " was .
monday , 29 january ari fleischer , president bush 's former press spokesman , testifies that libby told him that ms plame worked for the cia on 7 july 2003 .
he says libby mentioned the connection matter-of-factly , adding that it was " hush-hush " .

danish researchers also found women with epilepsy were more likely to kill themselves than men with the condition .
people diagnosed with epilepsy in the previous six months were at an even higher risk of committing suicide .
the lancet neurology study said greater efforts were needed to control seizures , which could be stigmatising , and had many knock-on effects .
the aarhus university hospital team studied 21,169 cases of suicide in denmark between 1981 and 1997 . "
epilepsy lowers the overall quality of life " dr jakob christensen they found that 492 -lrb- 2.32 % -rrb- of the suicide cases had epilepsy .
however , the rate of epilepsy among a random matched sample of over 400,000 people in the general population was just 0.74 % .
even after taking account of factors such as mental illness , job status , income and marital status , people with epilepsy were still twice as likely to kill themselves .
and people who had been diagnosed with epilepsy within the previous six months were more than five times more likely to commit suicide .
people with both epilepsy and a psychiatric illness were nearly 14 times more likely to commit suicide than people with neither conditon .
the trend in the general population is for the risk of suicide to increase with age .
but the researchers found that , in the case of people with epilepsy , the risk of suicide fell as they got older .
big impact on life researcher dr jakob christensen said : " there may be a number of factors that have a major impact on the wellbeing of people with chronic disorders such as epilepsy .
" we know that epilepsy lowers the overall quality of life of the affected individuals - especially shortly after the diagnosis is given .
" an epilepsy diagnosis affects important parts of people 's lives : job opportunities disappear , patients usually lose their driver 's licence , drug treatment may decrease fertility , and pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations of the newborn child .
" the latter may be part of the explanation of why the impact of epilepsy with regard to suicide seems greatest in women . "
dr christensen added that having seizures could be a very unpleasant and stigmatising experience .
he said ; " epilepsy is not a rare disorder , affecting up to 1 % of the population .
" thus , great efforts should be put into reducing the risk of seizures in patients . "
the charity epilepsy action said the figures emphasised the impact that epilepsy could have on a person 's life .
it is campaigning for better epilepsy services to speed up diagnosis and treatment of the condition .
with the right anti-epileptic drugs , an estimated 70 % of people can be kept free of seizures .
a report by mps published last month suggested almost half of the 990 epilepsy-linked deaths in england each year were avoidable .
however , professor ley sander , of the national society for epilepsy , said : " it is almost certainly true that people with epilepsy are at greater risk of committing suicide than people without but why that should be is not clear from this study . "

epilepsy lowers the overall quality of life dr jakob christensen they found that 492 -lrb- 2.32 % -rrb- of the suicide cases had epilepsy .
however , the rate of epilepsy among a random matched sample of over 400,000 people in the general population was just 0.74 % .
even after taking account of factors such as mental illness , job status , income and marital status , people with epilepsy were still twice as likely to kill themselves .
and people who had been diagnosed with epilepsy within the previous six months were more than five times more likely to commit suicide .
people with both epilepsy and a psychiatric illness were nearly 14 times more likely to commit suicide than people with neither conditon .
the trend in the general population is for the risk of suicide to increase with age .
but the researchers found that , in the case of people with epilepsy , the risk of suicide fell as they got older .
big impact on life researcher dr jakob christensen said : " there may be a number of factors that have a major impact on the wellbeing of people with chronic disorders such as epilepsy .
" we know that epilepsy lowers the overall quality of life of the affected individuals - especially shortly after the diagnosis is given .
" an epilepsy diagnosis affects important parts of people 's lives : job opportunities disappear , patients usually lose their driver 's licence , drug treatment may decrease fertility , and pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations of the newborn child .
" the latter may be part of the explanation of why the impact of epilepsy with regard to suicide seems greatest in women . "
dr christensen added that having seizures could be a very unpleasant and stigmatising experience .
he said ; " epilepsy is not a rare disorder , affecting up to 1 % of the population .
" thus , great efforts should be put into reducing the risk of seizures in patients . "
the charity epilepsy action said the figures emphasised the impact that epilepsy could have on a person 's life .
it is campaigning for better epilepsy services to speed up diagnosis and treatment of the condition .
with the right anti-epileptic drugs , an estimated 70 % of people can be kept free of seizures .
a report by mps published last month suggested almost half of the 990 epilepsy-linked deaths in england each year were avoidable .
however , professor ley sander , of the national society for epilepsy , said : " it is almost certainly true that people with epilepsy are at greater risk of committing suicide than people without but why that should be is not clear from this study . "

city officials are hopeful the former thailand prime minister will have the 75 % share of the club he needs to take control within the next 24 hours .
former england coach eriksson will then formally sign the three-year contract he has already agreed in principle .
thaksin has currently bought up a 65.78 % share in the premiership club .
earlier in june , he lodged an £ 81.6m takeover bid for city through his company uk sports investments .
the eastlands board has backed the bid but there have been concerns about the source of the money , with thaksin facing corruption charges in thailand .

on sunday , keith harris , executive chairman of seymour pierce investment bank , said the money had been " legitimately and transparently transferred to the uk " .
thaksin will have to pass the premier league 's standard " fit and proper person " test before being able to complete the proposed takeover .
thai prosecutors recently filed corruption charges against thaksin .
they have also frozen his assets but thaksin insisted this would have no effect on his takeover of the club and that the charges were politically motivated by the junta that replaced him .
the new shares are believed to be from broadcaster sky as they are the only major shareholder remaining after thaksin received a 55.9 % stake following pledges from board members and former chairman francis lee .
he is now getting nearer to the 75 % ownership mark where he can de-list the company and take it into private ownership .

the stark prediction for bentley and toll bar near doncaster was made by environment secretary hilary benn as he updated the commons on monday evening .
more than 300 people were still living in temporary accommodation , he said .
doncaster council said it would take another three to four days to pump the water from homes in toll bar .
mr benn reminded mps of the long-lasting effects of the carlisle floods in january 2005 .
" experience from carlisle suggests that some properties may not be habitable for many months , " he said .
mr benn said lessons would be learned from last week 's disaster and government spending on flood defences would rise from £ 600m this year to £ 800m by 2010/11 .
the water only appears to be decreasing gradually - but i want to emphasise to residents the enormous scale of this operation martin winter , mayor of doncaster meanwhile , three severe flood warnings remained in place in south yorkshire - two on the river don at bentley moor and thorpe in balne and one on the ea beck at toll bar .
doncaster council said even more high-volume pumps have been brought in to the affected areas .
but despite firefighters from 26 services around the uk removing 346m litres of water per day , the environment agency estimates there is still about 1.8m cubic metres of water in the area .
doncaster 's elected mayor , martin winter , said on tuesday he had been told by the agency that the toll bar area would take three to four more days to drain .
mr benn said further work was needed to look at flooding risks mr winter said : " the water only appears to be decreasing gradually , but i want to emphasise to residents the enormous scale of this operation not only on the ground , but co-ordination from behind the scenes .
" we are succeeding slowly but surely in the reduction of water in toll bar and will soon be pumping out 240,000 litres a minute . "
it was also announced that prime minister gordon brown has agreed local government minister john healey will co-ordinate the government 's contribution to recovery from the recent floods .
mr healey said : " we want to see communities , householders and businesses return to normal as rapidly as possible .
" i have seen first-hand the effects of flooding in my own constituency , rotherham , and last week visited homes and businesses who have suffered .
" i will make sure central government brings a relentless focus to support the local recovery efforts and ensure that all of those involved play their full part .
" this will help ensure we move from a fully co-ordinated emergency response effort to a fully co-ordinated support for the recovery effort . "

the stark prediction for bentley and toll bar near doncaster was made by environment secretary hilary benn as he updated the commons on monday evening .
more than 300 people were still living in temporary accommodation , he said .
doncaster council said it would take another three to four days to pump the water from homes in toll bar .
mr benn reminded mps of the long-lasting effects of the carlisle floods in january 2005 .
" experience from carlisle suggests that some properties may not be habitable for many months , " he said .
mr benn said lessons would be learned from last week 's disaster and government spending on flood defences would rise from £ 600m this year to £ 800m by 2010/11 .
the water only appears to be decreasing gradually - but i want to emphasise to residents the enormous scale of this operation martin winter , mayor of doncaster meanwhile , three severe flood warnings remained in place in south yorkshire - two on the river don at bentley moor and thorpe in balne and one on the ea beck at toll bar .
doncaster council said even more high-volume pumps have been brought in to the affected areas .
but despite firefighters from 26 services around the uk removing 346m litres of water per day , the environment agency estimates there is still about 1.8m cubic metres of water in the area .
doncaster 's elected mayor , martin winter , said on tuesday he had been told by the agency that the toll bar area would take three to four more days to drain .
mr benn said further work was needed to look at flooding risks mr winter said : " the water only appears to be decreasing gradually , but i want to emphasise to residents the enormous scale of this operation not only on the ground , but co-ordination from behind the scenes .
" we are succeeding slowly but surely in the reduction of water in toll bar and will soon be pumping out 240,000 litres a minute . "
it was also announced that prime minister gordon brown has agreed local government minister john healey will co-ordinate the government 's contribution to recovery from the recent floods .
mr healey said : " we want to see communities , householders and businesses return to normal as rapidly as possible .
" i have seen first-hand the effects of flooding in my own constituency , rotherham , and last week visited homes and businesses who have suffered .
" i will make sure central government brings a relentless focus to support the local recovery efforts and ensure that all of those involved play their full part .
" this will help ensure we move from a fully co-ordinated emergency response effort to a fully co-ordinated support for the recovery effort . "
