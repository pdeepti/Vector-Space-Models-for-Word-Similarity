a leading jewish organization called the findings " ugly , disastrous and sad . " a popular german talk show host was recently fired for praising hitler 's family policies . the nazis encouraged women to stay at home , look after their husbands , and produce and rear children .
the incident has sparked a debate in germany over whether it is acceptable to say anything positive about the nazis , 62 years after the end of world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva herman got fired for her comments a recent poll shows that a quarter of germans agree that nazi rule had some positive aspects .
the weekly stern magazine commissioned the forsa agency to conduct the poll after talk show host eva herman was fired from germany 's ndr public broadcaster last month for her comments on the third reich and motherhood .
pollsters asked whether national socialism had any good points .
twenty-five percent of the respondents said " yes , " citing the construction of the famous autobahn or network of highways , low unemployment and crime rate and a strong sense of family as examples .
" the insecurity about how to deal with nazism is huge .
as is ignorance .
eva herman has unwittingly kicked off a long-neglected debate , " stern magazine wrote in a cover story .
the poll , released wednesday , oct .
17 , was conducted a week earlier .
poll should be a " warning sign " the poll results have sparked condemnation from the central council of jews in germany .
dieter graumann , vice president of the council , said that the poll should be considered a " warning sign . "
" the result of the poll is ugly , disastrous and makes me sad and angry , " he told the netzeitung online newspaper .
still , he cautioned against " alarmism " and called for more education about the nazi period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis wanted to create a " master race " the blue-eyed , blonde-haired herman got into trouble while presenting her latest book .
news reports quoted her as saying that while adolf hitler was very bad , there were good things about nazi rule as well .
she cited " the high regard for the mother " as an example and said she regretted that family values nurtured by the nazis had been swept away .
she was recently thrown off a talk show after refusing to apologize for her comments .
the nazis offered incentives to child-bearing women .
yet their family policies were part of a racist ideology whose goal was the creation of a master race .
it 's not the first time the 48-year-old herman has ruffled feathers .
she angered feminists last year when she said women should raise children rather than pursue careers of their own .
herman insists that her latest comments were taken out of context . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one which has been around for three decades and which has taught hundreds of kids may not even feature at all . officials in the north german city of bremen have been left searching for an explanation as to how a ' secret ' primary school managed to operate for 30 years and send hundreds of children on to secondary education and beyond without anyone apparently noticing .
after ruling out top secret cloaking devices and the possibility of magic , the authorities are slowly coming to the conclusion that a long line of education ministry officials in the city state have been guilty of incompetence on a major scale .
the school in the district of steintor , organized by disgruntled leftwing , mainly academic parents , taught several hundred children aged between four and ten right under the noses of the state education ministry for nearly three decades .
disgruntled parents opted out of state system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : invisible children learning in a non-existant school in a reaction to the rigid pedagogical practices of the state system , the parents set up the school in an old villa where pupils attended mixed and same-sex classes , combining all age groups , in a relaxed and fun atmosphere .
the kids then went on to high schools in the area with forged education certificates .
many of them excelled , attended university and went on to build successful careers . renate jürgens-pieper , the social democrat education minister for the state of bremen , attempted to deflect the accusations of incompetence by accusing the parents of deception .
" they have been cheating us for years , " she said in a report published by british newspaper the guardian .

one which has been around for three decades and which has taught hundreds of kids may not even feature at all . officials in the north german city of bremen have been left searching for an explanation as to how a ' secret ' primary school managed to operate for 30 years and send hundreds of children on to secondary education and beyond without anyone apparently noticing .
after ruling out top secret cloaking devices and the possibility of magic , the authorities are slowly coming to the conclusion that a long line of education ministry officials in the city state have been guilty of incompetence on a major scale .
the school in the district of steintor , organized by disgruntled leftwing , mainly academic parents , taught several hundred children aged between four and ten right under the noses of the state education ministry for nearly three decades .
disgruntled parents opted out of state system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : invisible children learning in a non-existant school in a reaction to the rigid pedagogical practices of the state system , the parents set up the school in an old villa where pupils attended mixed and same-sex classes , combining all age groups , in a relaxed and fun atmosphere .
the kids then went on to high schools in the area with forged education certificates .
many of them excelled , attended university and went on to build successful careers . renate jürgens-pieper , the social democrat education minister for the state of bremen , attempted to deflect the accusations of incompetence by accusing the parents of deception .
" they have been cheating us for years , " she said in a report published by british newspaper the guardian .
as an unregistered institution run by parents , she added , the school failed to abide by basic health and safety standards such as stair rails , separate toilets for pupils and teachers , and fire regulations .
school raided by cops but remained unseen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i see no school " what is unusual is that the authorities claim not to have been aware of the existence of the unregistered alternative primary school despite it being raided by police on one occasion in the past , suggesting that rather than not knowing it was there , state officials in the past had turned a blind eye to the school .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 18.10.2007 us official : missile shield plans for europe dependent on iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the iranian nuclear threat recedes , the us could rethink its defense shield plans for europe the future of bases for the proposed us missile shield in europe is dependent on whether iran gives up its controversial uranium enrichment program , a senior us state department official suggested . assistant secretary of state daniel fried told reporters in brussels on wednesday , oct .
17 , after meeting with nato and russian officials that washington 's missile shield plans could be changed should iran suspend its nuclear program .
the shield is " intended against the major problem we see developing , which is iran , and if that problem went away or attenuated we would obviously draw conclusions , " said fried .
" this is a threat-based system , and we would be affected if iran gave up its -lsb- uranium -rsb- enrichment and worked with the international community , and had a different approach to things . "
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own defenses .
shield plans could slow down under " right conditions " while fried ruled out any immediate halt , he did suggest that the development of the shield might slow down under the right conditions .
" our position is that our negotiations with the poles and the czechs will continue , but we do n't feel the need to spend money at quite as fast a rate for a threat that is attenuated , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fried assured russia that it was not a target fried also reiterated that the defense shield was needed to guard against threats from " rogue states " like iran or north korea and assured russia once again that it was not a target .
" our real concern is not russia , " he said .
" we are advancing a missile defense program in response to what we see as an iranian ballistic missile and nuclear weapons threat .
" we want -lsb- russia 's -rsb- help , and the help of all responsible nations , to work with iran so this problem is attenuated and goes away , " fried said and added that us officials had explained their stance on iran to the russians , and that " they seemed interested in the concept . "
polish election could affect us relations another factor which may force washington 's hand in adapting its plan for european bases is poland 's parliamentary election on sunday .
poland 's ties with the united states , its cooperation on the defense shield and the presence of polish troops in iraq could all change if prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski loses power .
the centrist civic platform party , the main opposition to kaczynski 's ruling conservatives , is mounting a strong challenge to the current leadership and is gaining support through its leader donald tusk 's assertions that a government under his authority would not want so close a relationship with washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister kaczynski faces a challenge in the polls surveys show most poles want their troops out of iraq and oppose the missile shield .
recent events , including an attack on the polish ambassador in iraq last week , have brought these topics and poland 's foreign policy as a whole to the forefront of the civic platform party 's agenda .
prime minister kaczynski and his twin brother lech , the polish president , have put close ties with the us at the center of poland 's foreign policy alongside a distrust of the eu .
since coming to power in 2005 , the brothers have maintained the country 's military presence in iraq , increased polish forces in afghanistan and have all but pledged to host the anti-missile shield . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european treaty has loomed large on the horizon of the eu political landscape for the past few weeks as eu leaders prepare to agree on the its final text on oct .
18-19 . this week 's eu summit in lisbon is an informal meeting for heads of state to see the results of legal work carried out on the european treaty over the autumn .
if the reformed treaty text is approved it will then go forward to a formal heads of state meeting in brussels in december .
if the treat receives the leaders ' approval again it will then be sent for ratification by all 27 eu member states . but what is the european treaty and what is all the fuss about ?
dw-world.de answers some of the most pertinent questions . what is the european reform treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution has made way for the treaty after the failure of its forerunner , the european constitution , which was rejected in 2005 by voters in france and the netherlands , the european reform treaty was conceived as an alternative series of amendments to two existing eu treaties , the treaty on the european union -lrb- maastricht -rrb- and the treaty establishing the european community -lrb- rome -rrb- . the idea is that the reform treaty will be a blueprint for running the expanded european union more efficiently .
the reform treaty was presented to the eu leaders in brussels in july by the portuguese presidency , after an initial hard-fought agreement on its text was hammered out in under berlin 's leadership in june . what will the european reform treaty do ? the eu leaders will decide on the final draft for the european reform treaty in lisbon on oct .
18-19 and so the precise wording of the treaty has yet to be agreed .
however , the document is expected to include the following : create the role of european president this is one of the most controversial proposals as the idea was initially opposed by smaller eu nations but was forced through by the larger member states .
the presidential role has official backing but opposition and resentment remain .
the president would serve a two-and-a half-year term , replacing the current system of a rotating six-month presidency , and will not be allowed to serve more than two terms . create the role of eu high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy essentially the eu 's foreign minister -lrb- as proposed in the constitution -rrb- , this role will combine the posts of current foreign affairs chief javier solana , and the external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and will be the eu 's point person for world affairs .
reduce the size of the european commission just as the european parliament recently announced that the number of parliamentarians would be capped at 750 regardless of new countries joining the bloc , the eu commission will reduce the number of its commissioners .
there will be fewer commissioners than member states by 2014 , with only two-thirds of countries supplying a commissioner on a rotational basis . redistribute voting weights among member states this is another controversial aspect that has had many member states , particularly poland and britain , up in arms .
the treaty intends to introduce majority voting , which will allow votes to be carried on a 55 percent majority as long as that majority also represent 65 percent of the european population .
this would be phased in between 2014 and 2017 . give new powers to the european commission , european parliament and european court of justice , in areas such as justice and domestic affairs remove the national veto in a number of areas is the reform treaty just the failed european constitution under a different name ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french , along with the dutch , gave a resounding " non " originally , the reform treaty was described as having " no constitutional characteristics , " but investigations by a number of international analysis groups have noted that only two of the 440 provisions in the reform treaty differ from the original constitution .
the constitution 's references to european flags and anthems , which proved unpopular with voters , have been left out .
however , the existing flag , anthem and european motto - " united in diversity " - will remain . the role of european foreign minister included in the constitution text has also been replaced by the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , and the use of the term " european laws " has been dropped in favor of " european regulations . " what is likely to happen in lisbon and in the future ? the representatives from the 27 eu member states are expected to agree on the final text of the treaty in lisbon and then sign off on the treaty at a summit of european leaders in brussels in december .
much like the process used for the doomed constitution , the treaty will then have to be ratified by all the eu 's member states .
if this is completed , the treaty will come into force in 2009 . ratification was the process that spelled the end of the constitution .
some countries chose to put the constitution to the people in a referendum .
it was killed off by two " no " votes , from france and the netherlands .
to avoid this , most countries are expected to leave the ratification of the treaty to their parliaments , who are expected to back the deal . however , ireland plans to hold a referendum , the danes want one too and so do quite a few dutch , despite their government taking a huge risk by holding out against the will of the people .
the british government promised a referendum on the constitution but never got the chance to hold one as the french and dutch votes made it unnecessary . what could go wrong ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things may not be so clear if some nations cause trouble for the treaty to come into being , all the decisions surrounding it have to be unanimous .
there are a number of wrenches that could potentially end up in the works , specifically those lobbed in from poland and the uk . poland is threatening to block the treaty unless it includes an agreement - known as the ioannina compromise - to allow countries to defer unpalatable decisions that have been agreed by a narrow majority . the british have a number of " red lines " regarding issues of sovereignty in which the uk has an opt-out clause .
the exceptions were agreed to principle in discussions under german leadership in june .
however , britain could pull the treaty plug if the legal work carried out on the treaty text since june adapts or removes any of these " red lines . " while these two offer the greatest threats to the treaty , the most bizarre arguably comes from bulgaria .

the reform treaty was presented to the eu leaders in brussels in july by the portuguese presidency , after an initial hard-fought agreement on its text was hammered out in under berlin 's leadership in june . what will the european reform treaty do ? the eu leaders will decide on the final draft for the european reform treaty in lisbon on oct .
18-19 and so the precise wording of the treaty has yet to be agreed .
however , the document is expected to include the following : create the role of european president this is one of the most controversial proposals as the idea was initially opposed by smaller eu nations but was forced through by the larger member states .
the presidential role has official backing but opposition and resentment remain .
the president would serve a two-and-a half-year term , replacing the current system of a rotating six-month presidency , and will not be allowed to serve more than two terms . create the role of eu high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy essentially the eu 's foreign minister -lrb- as proposed in the constitution -rrb- , this role will combine the posts of current foreign affairs chief javier solana , and the external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and will be the eu 's point person for world affairs .
reduce the size of the european commission just as the european parliament recently announced that the number of parliamentarians would be capped at 750 regardless of new countries joining the bloc , the eu commission will reduce the number of its commissioners .
there will be fewer commissioners than member states by 2014 , with only two-thirds of countries supplying a commissioner on a rotational basis . redistribute voting weights among member states this is another controversial aspect that has had many member states , particularly poland and britain , up in arms .
the treaty intends to introduce majority voting , which will allow votes to be carried on a 55 percent majority as long as that majority also represent 65 percent of the european population .
this would be phased in between 2014 and 2017 . give new powers to the european commission , european parliament and european court of justice , in areas such as justice and domestic affairs remove the national veto in a number of areas is the reform treaty just the failed european constitution under a different name ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french , along with the dutch , gave a resounding " non " originally , the reform treaty was described as having " no constitutional characteristics , " but investigations by a number of international analysis groups have noted that only two of the 440 provisions in the reform treaty differ from the original constitution .

however , the existing flag , anthem and european motto - " united in diversity " - will remain . the role of european foreign minister included in the constitution text has also been replaced by the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , and the use of the term " european laws " has been dropped in favor of " european regulations . " what is likely to happen in lisbon and in the future ? the representatives from the 27 eu member states are expected to agree on the final text of the treaty in lisbon and then sign off on the treaty at a summit of european leaders in brussels in december .

the british government promised a referendum on the constitution but never got the chance to hold one as the french and dutch votes made it unnecessary . what could go wrong ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things may not be so clear if some nations cause trouble for the treaty to come into being , all the decisions surrounding it have to be unanimous .

hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon the european treaty : frequently asked questions reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's kaczynski brothers want more power for the ioannina delaying tactic poland is a big fan , although it wants it to go further , and yet it has only been invoked once to resolve a dispute over sardines .
what exactly is the ioannina compromise and why is it so important to the eu treaty ? the so-called " ioannina compromise " is one of the most talked-about and perhaps least well-understood issues relating to the ongoing reform treaty negotiations .
the term was coined after an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers which took place in ioannina , a greek city north of athens , in 1994 .
broadly speaking , the ioannina compromise is a gentlemen 's agreement , a time-out or emergency break designed to reassure individual member states who fear fellow eu members may cut deals which they strongly dislike .
ioannina gives countries a pause to find a solution in essence , if a country feels that its vital interests are threatened but can not muster a blocking minority , the decision is delayed while attempts to find a satisfactory solution are made .
the ioannina mechanism was first proposed when foreign ministers from the then 15-member union were called to discuss how voting rules should change if norway joined the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the initial compromise was lost when the eu signed nice at the meeting , ministers agreed that if eu members wished to oppose a measure but could not muster enough support to block it , they could ask the bloc 's council of member states to do " all within its power , within a reasonable space of time , to reach a satisfactory solution " that would be acceptable to a qualified majority .
norway eventually decided not to join the union , and the " gentlemen 's agreement " remained little more than a curious appendix to the eu decision-making process .
it was superseded by the nice treaty of 2000 , which established new voting rules for the eu ahead of the entry in 2004 of 10 new member states .
poland 's fight over voting rights resurrects ioannina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels agreed on a draft inclusion for the compromise but one of those newcomers - poland - fought hard to resurrect it this year during bitter negotiations over national voting rights in the reform treaty .
and in a bid to find a satisfactory compromise , the then german presidency of the eu in june included a reference to ioannina in an annex of the treaty .
according to the draft agreed last june in brussels , the eu council is forced to freeze decisions if : " -lrb- a -rrb- at least three quarters of the population , or -lrb- b -rrb- at least three quarters of the number of member states necessary to constitute a blocking minority ... indicate their opposition to the council adopting an act by a qualified majority . "
the annex does not place any formal time limits , saying that member states should spend " a reasonable time " looking for an acceptable solution .
kaczynskis want more time and legal framework but poland is campaigning for a " reinforced " ioannina mechanism and argues that two years constitutes a " reasonable time . "
moreover , poland wants the council to make an official decision on ioannina in lisbon and make it legally binding in some form or other .
because the council normally tries to reach decisions by consensus , the original ioannina compromise has been rarely invoked .
experts say there was only one unsuccessful attempt to use it during its limited lifespan : a case involving portuguese sardines . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

currently in berlin , he took time off from writing to discuss his latest work and what 's going wrong in both of his home countries . with his 2003 debut " the russian debutante 's handbook " and the follow-up " absurdistan " from 2006 , gary shteyngart established his credentials as one of the english language 's best young writers and a satirist with a talent for highlighting the absurdities of both the east and the west after the cold war .
now he 's trying something a bit different .
dw-world.de : your books have been read and marketed as part of a new immigrant literature in the us , but they 're not at all earnest or politically correct .
why is that ?
gary shteyngart : well , first of all , because i was very unlucky and got sent to this horrible hebrew school .
if it was n't for those eight years being told by rabbis that the holocaust happened because i ate a piece of pork salami , i do n't think you would have had books like " absurdistan . "
that took away any sense i might have had about anything being sacred .
unless you were an idiot , you could see from a mile away that a lot of things were just plain stupid and very coercive .
then i went to a really great high school in manhattan that was a true melting pot , a holding pen for multinational nerds .
it was a place where chinese , russian and indian people gathered together , and it was a real free-for-all .
then i went to oberlin college , and that was the final straw .
from the moment i got there i just wanted to make fun of it .
the first week i was there , i got chewed out for calling some a freshman instead of a " fresh person , " and there was a professor who had devoted his life to translating brezhnev 's works into yiddish .
so that was maybe the best part of my education since it gave me such wonderful targets to go after .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of " absurdistan " is called " snack daddy 's adventurous trip " you 're working on a new book as a fellow of the american academy here in berlin .
what 's the novel about ?
it 's the first book i 've set almost entirely in america , and it takes place - god help me because the phrase " speculative fiction " makes my skin crawl - in the near future .
it follows the love affair of two immigrants , as america slowly disintegrates .
new york and los angeles have become two heavily guarded areas , or what i call " cooperative exclusion zones . "
a small group of rich shareholders achieve immortality , while the vast majority of the population loses the ability to speak , read and write in english .
and that 's what happens to one of the two lovers .
that 's very different from your first two books , which feature unscrupulous us-immigrant protagonists forced to go back to an absurd , violent and materialistic eastern europe .
one sets up a pyramid scheme in prague , while the other tries to procure a fake passport amidst a halliburton-sponsored war in the caucasus .
why the change in the emphasis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of eastern european oil is a shteyngart speciality well , i ca n't do the same story over and over again .
the first book , " the russian debutante 's handbook , " dealt with the rise of turbo-capitalism in eastern europe , and the second , " absurdistan , " took that further by bringing in us foreign policy , specifically the politics of the oil industry .
the third one deals with the fact that we in the us have become " absurdistan " in some respects , for instance , in our approach to human rights issues , privacy and upholding the constitution .
one of the worst outcomes of 9/11 is that many of the people who traditionally came to america are now having second thoughts about that .
i also wanted to write about the baby boomers ' inability to come to terms with their own mortality .
and lastly , this book features a love affair that runs from page one to page 350 or whatever .
i 've never done that before .
why come to berlin if the book is set almost entirely in america ?
i work a lot better off-shore , so to speak , than in america .
there 's something about being in countries where i do n't speak the language .
most of " absurdistan " was written in italy .
and i 'm working much faster here than i ever have before .
like in new york , there 's both an excitement and a gloom about the city , but what interests me is that , unlike new york , there 's a real collision of east and west here .
to think that we 're only an hour and a half from poland here is really amazing .
what do you think then about the latest developments in eastern europe , in particular vladimir putin 's russia ?
some of them resemble the fictional scenarios you created in " absurdistan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shteyngart says both bush and putin have betrayed the ideals of democracy i began writing that book before 9/11 and before halliburton got so involved in iraq .
but i was observing events in azerbaijan and georgia , and the path looked very clear .
in the book i 'm writing now , russia is called " petro-state russia . "
and that 's exactly what russia is - a state run on the profits of natural gas , oil and a couple of other commodities .
putin has done it .
there 's a chance that there will be no opposition parties whatsoever in the next russian election .
there 's not even a pretense of democracy .
basically , putin can have power for life if he wants it .
he can just say : " now i 'm going to be the president , now i 'm going to be the prime minister . "
he 'll just take the power with him from office to office like a traveling bag .
the country has sold out any ideals of democracy it ever had for the idea some sort of stability .
and there 's a huge gap between rich and poor - in my third book , i 'm calling that up and bringing it back to america .
it does n't sound as though you have high hopes for either russia or the us .
i was brought up between these two empires , one of which died and the other of which is dying in its own way .
as far as russia goes , there 's a restaurant in st. petersburg that 's called " 1913 , " which is known as the only good year in russian history .

17 , after meeting with nato and russian officials that washington 's missile shield plans could be changed should iran suspend its nuclear program .
the shield is " intended against the major problem we see developing , which is iran , and if that problem went away or attenuated we would obviously draw conclusions , " said fried .
" this is a threat-based system , and we would be affected if iran gave up its -lsb- uranium -rsb- enrichment and worked with the international community , and had a different approach to things . "
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own defenses .
shield plans could slow down under " right conditions " while fried ruled out any immediate halt , he did suggest that the development of the shield might slow down under the right conditions .
" our position is that our negotiations with the poles and the czechs will continue , but we do n't feel the need to spend money at quite as fast a rate for a threat that is attenuated , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fried assured russia that it was not a target fried also reiterated that the defense shield was needed to guard against threats from " rogue states " like iran or north korea and assured russia once again that it was not a target .
" our real concern is not russia , " he said .
" we are advancing a missile defense program in response to what we see as an iranian ballistic missile and nuclear weapons threat .
" we want -lsb- russia 's -rsb- help , and the help of all responsible nations , to work with iran so this problem is attenuated and goes away , " fried said and added that us officials had explained their stance on iran to the russians , and that " they seemed interested in the concept . "
polish election could affect us relations another factor which may force washington 's hand in adapting its plan for european bases is poland 's parliamentary election on sunday .
poland 's ties with the united states , its cooperation on the defense shield and the presence of polish troops in iraq could all change if prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski loses power .
the centrist civic platform party , the main opposition to kaczynski 's ruling conservatives , is mounting a strong challenge to the current leadership and is gaining support through its leader donald tusk 's assertions that a government under his authority would not want so close a relationship with washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister kaczynski faces a challenge in the polls surveys show most poles want their troops out of iraq and oppose the missile shield .
recent events , including an attack on the polish ambassador in iraq last week , have brought these topics and poland 's foreign policy as a whole to the forefront of the civic platform party 's agenda .
prime minister kaczynski and his twin brother lech , the polish president , have put close ties with the us at the center of poland 's foreign policy alongside a distrust of the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 18.10.2007 russian-american author sees bleak future for democracy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shteyngart describes russia and the us as dying and soon-to-be-dead empires novelist gary shteyngart was born in russia but moved to the us at age seven .
currently in berlin , he took time off from writing to discuss his latest work and what 's going wrong in both of his home countries . with his 2003 debut " the russian debutante 's handbook " and the follow-up " absurdistan " from 2006 , gary shteyngart established his credentials as one of the english language 's best young writers and a satirist with a talent for highlighting the absurdities of both the east and the west after the cold war .
now he 's trying something a bit different .
dw-world.de : your books have been read and marketed as part of a new immigrant literature in the us , but they 're not at all earnest or politically correct .
why is that ?
gary shteyngart : well , first of all , because i was very unlucky and got sent to this horrible hebrew school .
if it was n't for those eight years being told by rabbis that the holocaust happened because i ate a piece of pork salami , i do n't think you would have had books like " absurdistan . "
that took away any sense i might have had about anything being sacred .
unless you were an idiot , you could see from a mile away that a lot of things were just plain stupid and very coercive .
then i went to a really great high school in manhattan that was a true melting pot , a holding pen for multinational nerds .
it was a place where chinese , russian and indian people gathered together , and it was a real free-for-all .
then i went to oberlin college , and that was the final straw .
from the moment i got there i just wanted to make fun of it .
the first week i was there , i got chewed out for calling some a freshman instead of a " fresh person , " and there was a professor who had devoted his life to translating brezhnev 's works into yiddish .
so that was maybe the best part of my education since it gave me such wonderful targets to go after .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of " absurdistan " is called " snack daddy 's adventurous trip " you 're working on a new book as a fellow of the american academy here in berlin .
what 's the novel about ?
it 's the first book i 've set almost entirely in america , and it takes place - god help me because the phrase " speculative fiction " makes my skin crawl - in the near future .
it follows the love affair of two immigrants , as america slowly disintegrates .
new york and los angeles have become two heavily guarded areas , or what i call " cooperative exclusion zones . "
a small group of rich shareholders achieve immortality , while the vast majority of the population loses the ability to speak , read and write in english .
and that 's what happens to one of the two lovers .
that 's very different from your first two books , which feature unscrupulous us-immigrant protagonists forced to go back to an absurd , violent and materialistic eastern europe .
one sets up a pyramid scheme in prague , while the other tries to procure a fake passport amidst a halliburton-sponsored war in the caucasus .
why the change in the emphasis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of eastern european oil is a shteyngart speciality well , i ca n't do the same story over and over again .
the first book , " the russian debutante 's handbook , " dealt with the rise of turbo-capitalism in eastern europe , and the second , " absurdistan , " took that further by bringing in us foreign policy , specifically the politics of the oil industry .
the third one deals with the fact that we in the us have become " absurdistan " in some respects , for instance , in our approach to human rights issues , privacy and upholding the constitution .
one of the worst outcomes of 9/11 is that many of the people who traditionally came to america are now having second thoughts about that .
i also wanted to write about the baby boomers ' inability to come to terms with their own mortality .
and lastly , this book features a love affair that runs from page one to page 350 or whatever .
i 've never done that before .
why come to berlin if the book is set almost entirely in america ?
i work a lot better off-shore , so to speak , than in america .
there 's something about being in countries where i do n't speak the language .
most of " absurdistan " was written in italy .
and i 'm working much faster here than i ever have before .
like in new york , there 's both an excitement and a gloom about the city , but what interests me is that , unlike new york , there 's a real collision of east and west here .
to think that we 're only an hour and a half from poland here is really amazing .
what do you think then about the latest developments in eastern europe , in particular vladimir putin 's russia ?
some of them resemble the fictional scenarios you created in " absurdistan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shteyngart says both bush and putin have betrayed the ideals of democracy i began writing that book before 9/11 and before halliburton got so involved in iraq .
but i was observing events in azerbaijan and georgia , and the path looked very clear .
in the book i 'm writing now , russia is called " petro-state russia . "
and that 's exactly what russia is - a state run on the profits of natural gas , oil and a couple of other commodities .
putin has done it .
there 's a chance that there will be no opposition parties whatsoever in the next russian election .
there 's not even a pretense of democracy .
basically , putin can have power for life if he wants it .
he can just say : " now i 'm going to be the president , now i 'm going to be the prime minister . "
he 'll just take the power with him from office to office like a traveling bag .
the country has sold out any ideals of democracy it ever had for the idea some sort of stability .
and there 's a huge gap between rich and poor - in my third book , i 'm calling that up and bringing it back to america .
it does n't sound as though you have high hopes for either russia or the us .
i was brought up between these two empires , one of which died and the other of which is dying in its own way .
as far as russia goes , there 's a restaurant in st. petersburg that 's called " 1913 , " which is known as the only good year in russian history .
it 's an autocratic country with an autocratic tradition and an autocratic church .
with america , i feel very much an american these days , because something i love is being destroyed .
for those of us who were displaced at an early age , america was always the place to go to , and the worst result of 9/11 would be that it stops being that . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

currently in berlin , he took time off from writing to discuss his latest work and what 's going wrong in both of his home countries . with his 2003 debut " the russian debutante 's handbook " and the follow-up " absurdistan " from 2006 , gary shteyngart established his credentials as one of the english language 's best young writers and a satirist with a talent for highlighting the absurdities of both the east and the west after the cold war .
now he 's trying something a bit different .
dw-world.de : your books have been read and marketed as part of a new immigrant literature in the us , but they 're not at all earnest or politically correct .
why is that ?
gary shteyngart : well , first of all , because i was very unlucky and got sent to this horrible hebrew school .
if it was n't for those eight years being told by rabbis that the holocaust happened because i ate a piece of pork salami , i do n't think you would have had books like " absurdistan . "
that took away any sense i might have had about anything being sacred .
unless you were an idiot , you could see from a mile away that a lot of things were just plain stupid and very coercive .
then i went to a really great high school in manhattan that was a true melting pot , a holding pen for multinational nerds .
it was a place where chinese , russian and indian people gathered together , and it was a real free-for-all .
then i went to oberlin college , and that was the final straw .
from the moment i got there i just wanted to make fun of it .
the first week i was there , i got chewed out for calling some a freshman instead of a " fresh person , " and there was a professor who had devoted his life to translating brezhnev 's works into yiddish .
so that was maybe the best part of my education since it gave me such wonderful targets to go after .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of " absurdistan " is called " snack daddy 's adventurous trip " you 're working on a new book as a fellow of the american academy here in berlin .
what 's the novel about ?
it 's the first book i 've set almost entirely in america , and it takes place - god help me because the phrase " speculative fiction " makes my skin crawl - in the near future .
it follows the love affair of two immigrants , as america slowly disintegrates .
new york and los angeles have become two heavily guarded areas , or what i call " cooperative exclusion zones . "
a small group of rich shareholders achieve immortality , while the vast majority of the population loses the ability to speak , read and write in english .
and that 's what happens to one of the two lovers .
that 's very different from your first two books , which feature unscrupulous us-immigrant protagonists forced to go back to an absurd , violent and materialistic eastern europe .
one sets up a pyramid scheme in prague , while the other tries to procure a fake passport amidst a halliburton-sponsored war in the caucasus .
why the change in the emphasis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of eastern european oil is a shteyngart speciality well , i ca n't do the same story over and over again .
the first book , " the russian debutante 's handbook , " dealt with the rise of turbo-capitalism in eastern europe , and the second , " absurdistan , " took that further by bringing in us foreign policy , specifically the politics of the oil industry .
the third one deals with the fact that we in the us have become " absurdistan " in some respects , for instance , in our approach to human rights issues , privacy and upholding the constitution .
one of the worst outcomes of 9/11 is that many of the people who traditionally came to america are now having second thoughts about that .
i also wanted to write about the baby boomers ' inability to come to terms with their own mortality .
and lastly , this book features a love affair that runs from page one to page 350 or whatever .
i 've never done that before .
why come to berlin if the book is set almost entirely in america ?
i work a lot better off-shore , so to speak , than in america .
there 's something about being in countries where i do n't speak the language .
most of " absurdistan " was written in italy .
and i 'm working much faster here than i ever have before .
like in new york , there 's both an excitement and a gloom about the city , but what interests me is that , unlike new york , there 's a real collision of east and west here .
to think that we 're only an hour and a half from poland here is really amazing .
what do you think then about the latest developments in eastern europe , in particular vladimir putin 's russia ?
some of them resemble the fictional scenarios you created in " absurdistan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shteyngart says both bush and putin have betrayed the ideals of democracy i began writing that book before 9/11 and before halliburton got so involved in iraq .
but i was observing events in azerbaijan and georgia , and the path looked very clear .
in the book i 'm writing now , russia is called " petro-state russia . "
and that 's exactly what russia is - a state run on the profits of natural gas , oil and a couple of other commodities .
putin has done it .
there 's a chance that there will be no opposition parties whatsoever in the next russian election .
there 's not even a pretense of democracy .
basically , putin can have power for life if he wants it .
he can just say : " now i 'm going to be the president , now i 'm going to be the prime minister . "
he 'll just take the power with him from office to office like a traveling bag .
the country has sold out any ideals of democracy it ever had for the idea some sort of stability .
and there 's a huge gap between rich and poor - in my third book , i 'm calling that up and bringing it back to america .
it does n't sound as though you have high hopes for either russia or the us .
i was brought up between these two empires , one of which died and the other of which is dying in its own way .
as far as russia goes , there 's a restaurant in st. petersburg that 's called " 1913 , " which is known as the only good year in russian history .
it 's an autocratic country with an autocratic tradition and an autocratic church .
with america , i feel very much an american these days , because something i love is being destroyed .
for those of us who were displaced at an early age , america was always the place to go to , and the worst result of 9/11 would be that it stops being that . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 18.10.2007 institutes urge reforms to reverse german economic slowdown großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calls for more economic and labor reforms are not what angela merkel wants to hear leading economic institutes called on german chancellor angela merkel 's government on thursday , oct .
18 , to step up reform and warned that europe 's biggest economy faced slowing growth next year . the institutes told the government in their autumn report presented in berlin on thursday that german growth will slip back to 2.2 percent in 2008 from 2.6 percent this year , with a soaring euro , the global credit crunch and surging oil prices undercutting the nation 's expansion rate .
some economists are more pessimistic and believe germany will be lucky to reach a growth rate next year of 2 percent .
the international monetary fund said this week it expects german growth will slip to 2 percent next year from 2.4 percent for 2007 .
thursday 's report was drawn up by four leading german economic institutes in conjunction with research groups from other european nations .
criticism of ineffective reforms coming in the wake of criticism by german business about the failure of angela merkel 's government coalition to press on with economic reform , the institutes said : " much more additional work needs to be done rather than roll back the reforms so far discussed .
" the labor market reform course of the last few years has not progressed , " the institutes added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us housing market crisis had a knock-on effect the report comes as economists attempt to size up the ramifications of the shakeout in global share prices in august following the credit crunch triggered by the us housing market crisis .
at the same time , the institutes joined a growing list of forecasters who have revised down their growth outlook for germany .
high oil prices , the strong euro and financial market uncertainty will " dampen growth , " roland döhrn , an economist with the essen-based institute for scientific research -lrb- rwi -rrb- , told a press conference following the release of the report .
in their last report in the spring , the institutes projected a growth rate for germany of 2.4 percent in both 2007 and 2008 , with strong export demand powering the nation 's economic performance .
export growth likely to decline since then , however , the euro has climbed to an all-time high of $ 1.43 as fears have set in about the us economic outlook , consequently fuelling concerns about the prospects for germany 's key export machine .
the institutes predict german export growth will decline to 3 percent in 2008 from 3.5 percent this year , with stronger private consumption emerging as a key pillar of growth .
the institutes are also forecasting private consumption to grow by 1.5 percent next year compared to just 0.2 percent in 2007 .
the release of the institutes ' report is expected to lead to the german government also scaling back its growth projections for the nation .
germany emerged last year from a protracted period of stagnation , with a recent solid growth rate helping to ease the nation 's high unemployment .
larger reduction in unemployment that expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german unemployment dropped in september the number of people out of work in germany fell more than expected in september , data released last month showed , with employers continuing to hire on the back of the economic upswing and years of wage restraint .

hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 the european treaty : frequently asked questions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu be hanging out the decorations in celebration of the treaty come december ?
the european treaty has loomed large on the horizon of the eu political landscape for the past few weeks as eu leaders prepare to agree on the its final text on oct .
18-19 . this week 's eu summit in lisbon is an informal meeting for heads of state to see the results of legal work carried out on the european treaty over the autumn .
if the reformed treaty text is approved it will then go forward to a formal heads of state meeting in brussels in december .
if the treat receives the leaders ' approval again it will then be sent for ratification by all 27 eu member states . but what is the european treaty and what is all the fuss about ?
dw-world.de answers some of the most pertinent questions . what is the european reform treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution has made way for the treaty after the failure of its forerunner , the european constitution , which was rejected in 2005 by voters in france and the netherlands , the european reform treaty was conceived as an alternative series of amendments to two existing eu treaties , the treaty on the european union -lrb- maastricht -rrb- and the treaty establishing the european community -lrb- rome -rrb- . the idea is that the reform treaty will be a blueprint for running the expanded european union more efficiently .
the reform treaty was presented to the eu leaders in brussels in july by the portuguese presidency , after an initial hard-fought agreement on its text was hammered out in under berlin 's leadership in june . what will the european reform treaty do ? the eu leaders will decide on the final draft for the european reform treaty in lisbon on oct .
18-19 and so the precise wording of the treaty has yet to be agreed .
however , the document is expected to include the following : create the role of european president this is one of the most controversial proposals as the idea was initially opposed by smaller eu nations but was forced through by the larger member states .
the presidential role has official backing but opposition and resentment remain .
the president would serve a two-and-a half-year term , replacing the current system of a rotating six-month presidency , and will not be allowed to serve more than two terms . create the role of eu high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy essentially the eu 's foreign minister -lrb- as proposed in the constitution -rrb- , this role will combine the posts of current foreign affairs chief javier solana , and the external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and will be the eu 's point person for world affairs .
reduce the size of the european commission just as the european parliament recently announced that the number of parliamentarians would be capped at 750 regardless of new countries joining the bloc , the eu commission will reduce the number of its commissioners .
there will be fewer commissioners than member states by 2014 , with only two-thirds of countries supplying a commissioner on a rotational basis . redistribute voting weights among member states this is another controversial aspect that has had many member states , particularly poland and britain , up in arms .
the treaty intends to introduce majority voting , which will allow votes to be carried on a 55 percent majority as long as that majority also represent 65 percent of the european population .
this would be phased in between 2014 and 2017 . give new powers to the european commission , european parliament and european court of justice , in areas such as justice and domestic affairs remove the national veto in a number of areas is the reform treaty just the failed european constitution under a different name ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french , along with the dutch , gave a resounding " non " originally , the reform treaty was described as having " no constitutional characteristics , " but investigations by a number of international analysis groups have noted that only two of the 440 provisions in the reform treaty differ from the original constitution .
the constitution 's references to european flags and anthems , which proved unpopular with voters , have been left out .
however , the existing flag , anthem and european motto - " united in diversity " - will remain . the role of european foreign minister included in the constitution text has also been replaced by the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , and the use of the term " european laws " has been dropped in favor of " european regulations . " what is likely to happen in lisbon and in the future ? the representatives from the 27 eu member states are expected to agree on the final text of the treaty in lisbon and then sign off on the treaty at a summit of european leaders in brussels in december .
much like the process used for the doomed constitution , the treaty will then have to be ratified by all the eu 's member states .
if this is completed , the treaty will come into force in 2009 . ratification was the process that spelled the end of the constitution .
some countries chose to put the constitution to the people in a referendum .
it was killed off by two " no " votes , from france and the netherlands .
to avoid this , most countries are expected to leave the ratification of the treaty to their parliaments , who are expected to back the deal . however , ireland plans to hold a referendum , the danes want one too and so do quite a few dutch , despite their government taking a huge risk by holding out against the will of the people .
the british government promised a referendum on the constitution but never got the chance to hold one as the french and dutch votes made it unnecessary . what could go wrong ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things may not be so clear if some nations cause trouble for the treaty to come into being , all the decisions surrounding it have to be unanimous .
there are a number of wrenches that could potentially end up in the works , specifically those lobbed in from poland and the uk . poland is threatening to block the treaty unless it includes an agreement - known as the ioannina compromise - to allow countries to defer unpalatable decisions that have been agreed by a narrow majority . the british have a number of " red lines " regarding issues of sovereignty in which the uk has an opt-out clause .
the exceptions were agreed to principle in discussions under german leadership in june .
however , britain could pull the treaty plug if the legal work carried out on the treaty text since june adapts or removes any of these " red lines . " while these two offer the greatest threats to the treaty , the most bizarre arguably comes from bulgaria .
sofia is threatening to derail the treaty over the spelling of euro currency , which it insists should be " evro " in its cyrillic alphabet . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained the european treaty : frequently asked questions the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 eu treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european union edges closer to a treaty that could make it more efficient after months of political skirmishes , eu leaders are expected to clinch a long-awaited deal on the european treaty , a document many claim will make the eu more efficient and give it more credibility . despite the assertions that the eu will finally get a new treaty which will make it easier for the bloc to manage itself , there are still some who harbor reservations .
the two-day informal summit beginning in lisbon on thursday , oct .
18 , will bring the reformed treaty one step closer to a final agreement , with representatives of the 27 eu member states expected to agree on the final text .
but failure is still possible for the document . the issues of a polish request for a mechanism allowing minorities to delay decisions that they do not like to be made legally binding and british demands to be granted an opt-out on european policies in the field of justice and domestic affairs are expected to dominate the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will gordon brown 's " red lines " be responsible for axing the reform treaty ?
however , a number of countries , including austria , britain , denmark and italy , have also expressed concerns - not all of them strictly connected to the treaty 's contents .
with the treaty relying on unanimity to get through to the final stage at a summit in brussels in december , any one country , if dissatisfied , could send the eu planners back to the drawing board .
on the positive side , the treaty has the strong backing of eu heavyweights germany and france , in contrast to the constitution draft that preceded it and was rejected by dutch and french voters in 2005 .
opposition getting quieter and quieter as the lisbon meeting gets closer , fewer and fewer dissenting voices can be heard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski has been more positive of late the czech republic , whose euroskeptic governing coalition had previously warned that the treaty would devolve too much power to brussels , recently described it as " a reasonable compromise . "
even poland , by far the most critical voice , has been scaling down its objections in the run-up to the meeting . " i am convinced it will be a success , " polish president lech kaczynski said ahead of a meeting with german chancellor angela merkel in berlin last friday .
comments of this nature have encouraged diplomats and experts in brussels to become " quietly optimistic " that community spirit will prevail over national interests once leaders gather in the portuguese capital .
eu 's size necessitates reform if a deal is indeed clinched in lisbon , it will represent a key step forward in giving the world 's biggest economic entity a much-needed political boost .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu table creaks under the weight of enlargement eu leaders first realized they would have to improve the bloc 's laborious decision-making process in view of its enlargement to 27 member states at the beginning of the new millennium .
before they can be put in place many decisions in the bloc require unanimity , which has become harder and harder to find in the expanding union .
in december 2001 , eu leaders meeting in laeken , belgium , agreed to set up a convention on the future of the eu chaired by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing .
the convention led to the constitutional treaty , which was signed in october 2004 , only to be ditched after it was given the thumbs-down by referendums held in france and the netherlands a year later .
there followed what came to be known as a " period of reflection , " until the german presidency of the eu , in the first half of 2007 , succeeded in reopening the debate , which ultimately led to the current draft .
shadow on constitution remains despite amendments the treaty under discussion in lisbon drops many of the symbolic references that were included in the proposed constitution , such as an eu flag and anthem , but preserves many of its key elements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jobs of ferrero-waldner -lrb- r . -rrb- and solana -lrb- l . -rrb- will merge these include simplifying the eu 's relations with non-members by creating a single foreign affairs chief and ending the system of a six-month rotating presidency in favor of an elected european council president . the treaty also preserves a complex double-majority rule for council decisions .
proposed eu legislation requiring a qualified majority would have to muster the support of 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's total population of nearly 500 million people . # b # if the draft text is approved , it will have to be formally signed at a ceremony tentatively scheduled for the end of the year and then ratified in all 27 member states before european parliament elections are held in 2009 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two-day informal summit beginning in lisbon on thursday , oct .
18 , will bring the reformed treaty one step closer to a final agreement , with representatives of the 27 eu member states expected to agree on the final text .
but failure is still possible for the document . the issues of a polish request for a mechanism allowing minorities to delay decisions that they do not like to be made legally binding and british demands to be granted an opt-out on european policies in the field of justice and domestic affairs are expected to dominate the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will gordon brown 's " red lines " be responsible for axing the reform treaty ?
however , a number of countries , including austria , britain , denmark and italy , have also expressed concerns - not all of them strictly connected to the treaty 's contents .
with the treaty relying on unanimity to get through to the final stage at a summit in brussels in december , any one country , if dissatisfied , could send the eu planners back to the drawing board .
on the positive side , the treaty has the strong backing of eu heavyweights germany and france , in contrast to the constitution draft that preceded it and was rejected by dutch and french voters in 2005 .

"
even poland , by far the most critical voice , has been scaling down its objections in the run-up to the meeting . " i am convinced it will be a success , " polish president lech kaczynski said ahead of a meeting with german chancellor angela merkel in berlin last friday .
comments of this nature have encouraged diplomats and experts in brussels to become " quietly optimistic " that community spirit will prevail over national interests once leaders gather in the portuguese capital .
eu 's size necessitates reform if a deal is indeed clinched in lisbon , it will represent a key step forward in giving the world 's biggest economic entity a much-needed political boost .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu table creaks under the weight of enlargement eu leaders first realized they would have to improve the bloc 's laborious decision-making process in view of its enlargement to 27 member states at the beginning of the new millennium .
before they can be put in place many decisions in the bloc require unanimity , which has become harder and harder to find in the expanding union .
in december 2001 , eu leaders meeting in laeken , belgium , agreed to set up a convention on the future of the eu chaired by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing .
the convention led to the constitutional treaty , which was signed in october 2004 , only to be ditched after it was given the thumbs-down by referendums held in france and the netherlands a year later .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 18.10.2007 russian-american author sees bleak future for democracy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shteyngart describes russia and the us as dying and soon-to-be-dead empires novelist gary shteyngart was born in russia but moved to the us at age seven .
currently in berlin , he took time off from writing to discuss his latest work and what 's going wrong in both of his home countries . with his 2003 debut " the russian debutante 's handbook " and the follow-up " absurdistan " from 2006 , gary shteyngart established his credentials as one of the english language 's best young writers and a satirist with a talent for highlighting the absurdities of both the east and the west after the cold war .
now he 's trying something a bit different .
dw-world.de : your books have been read and marketed as part of a new immigrant literature in the us , but they 're not at all earnest or politically correct .
why is that ?
gary shteyngart : well , first of all , because i was very unlucky and got sent to this horrible hebrew school .
if it was n't for those eight years being told by rabbis that the holocaust happened because i ate a piece of pork salami , i do n't think you would have had books like " absurdistan . "
that took away any sense i might have had about anything being sacred .
unless you were an idiot , you could see from a mile away that a lot of things were just plain stupid and very coercive .
then i went to a really great high school in manhattan that was a true melting pot , a holding pen for multinational nerds .
it was a place where chinese , russian and indian people gathered together , and it was a real free-for-all .
then i went to oberlin college , and that was the final straw .
from the moment i got there i just wanted to make fun of it .
the first week i was there , i got chewed out for calling some a freshman instead of a " fresh person , " and there was a professor who had devoted his life to translating brezhnev 's works into yiddish .
so that was maybe the best part of my education since it gave me such wonderful targets to go after .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of " absurdistan " is called " snack daddy 's adventurous trip " you 're working on a new book as a fellow of the american academy here in berlin .
what 's the novel about ?
it 's the first book i 've set almost entirely in america , and it takes place - god help me because the phrase " speculative fiction " makes my skin crawl - in the near future .
it follows the love affair of two immigrants , as america slowly disintegrates .
new york and los angeles have become two heavily guarded areas , or what i call " cooperative exclusion zones . "
a small group of rich shareholders achieve immortality , while the vast majority of the population loses the ability to speak , read and write in english .
and that 's what happens to one of the two lovers .
that 's very different from your first two books , which feature unscrupulous us-immigrant protagonists forced to go back to an absurd , violent and materialistic eastern europe .
one sets up a pyramid scheme in prague , while the other tries to procure a fake passport amidst a halliburton-sponsored war in the caucasus .
why the change in the emphasis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of eastern european oil is a shteyngart speciality well , i ca n't do the same story over and over again .

currently in berlin , he took time off from writing to discuss his latest work and what 's going wrong in both of his home countries . with his 2003 debut " the russian debutante 's handbook " and the follow-up " absurdistan " from 2006 , gary shteyngart established his credentials as one of the english language 's best young writers and a satirist with a talent for highlighting the absurdities of both the east and the west after the cold war .
now he 's trying something a bit different .
dw-world.de : your books have been read and marketed as part of a new immigrant literature in the us , but they 're not at all earnest or politically correct .
why is that ?
gary shteyngart : well , first of all , because i was very unlucky and got sent to this horrible hebrew school .
if it was n't for those eight years being told by rabbis that the holocaust happened because i ate a piece of pork salami , i do n't think you would have had books like " absurdistan . "
that took away any sense i might have had about anything being sacred .
unless you were an idiot , you could see from a mile away that a lot of things were just plain stupid and very coercive .
then i went to a really great high school in manhattan that was a true melting pot , a holding pen for multinational nerds .
it was a place where chinese , russian and indian people gathered together , and it was a real free-for-all .
then i went to oberlin college , and that was the final straw .
from the moment i got there i just wanted to make fun of it .
the first week i was there , i got chewed out for calling some a freshman instead of a " fresh person , " and there was a professor who had devoted his life to translating brezhnev 's works into yiddish .
so that was maybe the best part of my education since it gave me such wonderful targets to go after .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of " absurdistan " is called " snack daddy 's adventurous trip " you 're working on a new book as a fellow of the american academy here in berlin .
what 's the novel about ?
it 's the first book i 've set almost entirely in america , and it takes place - god help me because the phrase " speculative fiction " makes my skin crawl - in the near future .
it follows the love affair of two immigrants , as america slowly disintegrates .
new york and los angeles have become two heavily guarded areas , or what i call " cooperative exclusion zones . "
a small group of rich shareholders achieve immortality , while the vast majority of the population loses the ability to speak , read and write in english .
and that 's what happens to one of the two lovers .
that 's very different from your first two books , which feature unscrupulous us-immigrant protagonists forced to go back to an absurd , violent and materialistic eastern europe .
one sets up a pyramid scheme in prague , while the other tries to procure a fake passport amidst a halliburton-sponsored war in the caucasus .
why the change in the emphasis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of eastern european oil is a shteyngart speciality well , i ca n't do the same story over and over again .
the first book , " the russian debutante 's handbook , " dealt with the rise of turbo-capitalism in eastern europe , and the second , " absurdistan , " took that further by bringing in us foreign policy , specifically the politics of the oil industry .
the third one deals with the fact that we in the us have become " absurdistan " in some respects , for instance , in our approach to human rights issues , privacy and upholding the constitution .
one of the worst outcomes of 9/11 is that many of the people who traditionally came to america are now having second thoughts about that .

hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon the european treaty : frequently asked questions reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's kaczynski brothers want more power for the ioannina delaying tactic poland is a big fan , although it wants it to go further , and yet it has only been invoked once to resolve a dispute over sardines .
what exactly is the ioannina compromise and why is it so important to the eu treaty ? the so-called " ioannina compromise " is one of the most talked-about and perhaps least well-understood issues relating to the ongoing reform treaty negotiations .
the term was coined after an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers which took place in ioannina , a greek city north of athens , in 1994 .
broadly speaking , the ioannina compromise is a gentlemen 's agreement , a time-out or emergency break designed to reassure individual member states who fear fellow eu members may cut deals which they strongly dislike .
ioannina gives countries a pause to find a solution in essence , if a country feels that its vital interests are threatened but can not muster a blocking minority , the decision is delayed while attempts to find a satisfactory solution are made .
the ioannina mechanism was first proposed when foreign ministers from the then 15-member union were called to discuss how voting rules should change if norway joined the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the initial compromise was lost when the eu signed nice at the meeting , ministers agreed that if eu members wished to oppose a measure but could not muster enough support to block it , they could ask the bloc 's council of member states to do " all within its power , within a reasonable space of time , to reach a satisfactory solution " that would be acceptable to a qualified majority .
norway eventually decided not to join the union , and the " gentlemen 's agreement " remained little more than a curious appendix to the eu decision-making process .
it was superseded by the nice treaty of 2000 , which established new voting rules for the eu ahead of the entry in 2004 of 10 new member states .
poland 's fight over voting rights resurrects ioannina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels agreed on a draft inclusion for the compromise but one of those newcomers - poland - fought hard to resurrect it this year during bitter negotiations over national voting rights in the reform treaty .
and in a bid to find a satisfactory compromise , the then german presidency of the eu in june included a reference to ioannina in an annex of the treaty .
according to the draft agreed last june in brussels , the eu council is forced to freeze decisions if : " -lrb- a -rrb- at least three quarters of the population , or -lrb- b -rrb- at least three quarters of the number of member states necessary to constitute a blocking minority ... indicate their opposition to the council adopting an act by a qualified majority . "
the annex does not place any formal time limits , saying that member states should spend " a reasonable time " looking for an acceptable solution .
kaczynskis want more time and legal framework but poland is campaigning for a " reinforced " ioannina mechanism and argues that two years constitutes a " reasonable time . "
moreover , poland wants the council to make an official decision on ioannina in lisbon and make it legally binding in some form or other .

what exactly is the ioannina compromise and why is it so important to the eu treaty ? the so-called " ioannina compromise " is one of the most talked-about and perhaps least well-understood issues relating to the ongoing reform treaty negotiations .
the term was coined after an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers which took place in ioannina , a greek city north of athens , in 1994 .
broadly speaking , the ioannina compromise is a gentlemen 's agreement , a time-out or emergency break designed to reassure individual member states who fear fellow eu members may cut deals which they strongly dislike .
ioannina gives countries a pause to find a solution in essence , if a country feels that its vital interests are threatened but can not muster a blocking minority , the decision is delayed while attempts to find a satisfactory solution are made .
the ioannina mechanism was first proposed when foreign ministers from the then 15-member union were called to discuss how voting rules should change if norway joined the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the initial compromise was lost when the eu signed nice at the meeting , ministers agreed that if eu members wished to oppose a measure but could not muster enough support to block it , they could ask the bloc 's council of member states to do " all within its power , within a reasonable space of time , to reach a satisfactory solution " that would be acceptable to a qualified majority .
norway eventually decided not to join the union , and the " gentlemen 's agreement " remained little more than a curious appendix to the eu decision-making process .
it was superseded by the nice treaty of 2000 , which established new voting rules for the eu ahead of the entry in 2004 of 10 new member states .
poland 's fight over voting rights resurrects ioannina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels agreed on a draft inclusion for the compromise but one of those newcomers - poland - fought hard to resurrect it this year during bitter negotiations over national voting rights in the reform treaty .
and in a bid to find a satisfactory compromise , the then german presidency of the eu in june included a reference to ioannina in an annex of the treaty .
according to the draft agreed last june in brussels , the eu council is forced to freeze decisions if : " -lrb- a -rrb- at least three quarters of the population , or -lrb- b -rrb- at least three quarters of the number of member states necessary to constitute a blocking minority ... indicate their opposition to the council adopting an act by a qualified majority . "
the annex does not place any formal time limits , saying that member states should spend " a reasonable time " looking for an acceptable solution .
kaczynskis want more time and legal framework but poland is campaigning for a " reinforced " ioannina mechanism and argues that two years constitutes a " reasonable time . "
moreover , poland wants the council to make an official decision on ioannina in lisbon and make it legally binding in some form or other .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 18.10.2007 russian-american author sees bleak future for democracy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shteyngart describes russia and the us as dying and soon-to-be-dead empires novelist gary shteyngart was born in russia but moved to the us at age seven .
currently in berlin , he took time off from writing to discuss his latest work and what 's going wrong in both of his home countries . with his 2003 debut " the russian debutante 's handbook " and the follow-up " absurdistan " from 2006 , gary shteyngart established his credentials as one of the english language 's best young writers and a satirist with a talent for highlighting the absurdities of both the east and the west after the cold war .
now he 's trying something a bit different .
dw-world.de : your books have been read and marketed as part of a new immigrant literature in the us , but they 're not at all earnest or politically correct .
why is that ?
gary shteyngart : well , first of all , because i was very unlucky and got sent to this horrible hebrew school .
if it was n't for those eight years being told by rabbis that the holocaust happened because i ate a piece of pork salami , i do n't think you would have had books like " absurdistan . "
that took away any sense i might have had about anything being sacred .
unless you were an idiot , you could see from a mile away that a lot of things were just plain stupid and very coercive .
then i went to a really great high school in manhattan that was a true melting pot , a holding pen for multinational nerds .
it was a place where chinese , russian and indian people gathered together , and it was a real free-for-all .
then i went to oberlin college , and that was the final straw .
from the moment i got there i just wanted to make fun of it .
the first week i was there , i got chewed out for calling some a freshman instead of a " fresh person , " and there was a professor who had devoted his life to translating brezhnev 's works into yiddish .
so that was maybe the best part of my education since it gave me such wonderful targets to go after .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of " absurdistan " is called " snack daddy 's adventurous trip " you 're working on a new book as a fellow of the american academy here in berlin .
what 's the novel about ?
it 's the first book i 've set almost entirely in america , and it takes place - god help me because the phrase " speculative fiction " makes my skin crawl - in the near future .
it follows the love affair of two immigrants , as america slowly disintegrates .
new york and los angeles have become two heavily guarded areas , or what i call " cooperative exclusion zones . "
a small group of rich shareholders achieve immortality , while the vast majority of the population loses the ability to speak , read and write in english .
and that 's what happens to one of the two lovers .
that 's very different from your first two books , which feature unscrupulous us-immigrant protagonists forced to go back to an absurd , violent and materialistic eastern europe .
one sets up a pyramid scheme in prague , while the other tries to procure a fake passport amidst a halliburton-sponsored war in the caucasus .
why the change in the emphasis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of eastern european oil is a shteyngart speciality well , i ca n't do the same story over and over again .
the first book , " the russian debutante 's handbook , " dealt with the rise of turbo-capitalism in eastern europe , and the second , " absurdistan , " took that further by bringing in us foreign policy , specifically the politics of the oil industry .
the third one deals with the fact that we in the us have become " absurdistan " in some respects , for instance , in our approach to human rights issues , privacy and upholding the constitution .
one of the worst outcomes of 9/11 is that many of the people who traditionally came to america are now having second thoughts about that .
i also wanted to write about the baby boomers ' inability to come to terms with their own mortality .
and lastly , this book features a love affair that runs from page one to page 350 or whatever .
i 've never done that before .
why come to berlin if the book is set almost entirely in america ?
i work a lot better off-shore , so to speak , than in america .
there 's something about being in countries where i do n't speak the language .
most of " absurdistan " was written in italy .
and i 'm working much faster here than i ever have before .
like in new york , there 's both an excitement and a gloom about the city , but what interests me is that , unlike new york , there 's a real collision of east and west here .
to think that we 're only an hour and a half from poland here is really amazing .
what do you think then about the latest developments in eastern europe , in particular vladimir putin 's russia ?
some of them resemble the fictional scenarios you created in " absurdistan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shteyngart says both bush and putin have betrayed the ideals of democracy i began writing that book before 9/11 and before halliburton got so involved in iraq .
but i was observing events in azerbaijan and georgia , and the path looked very clear .
in the book i 'm writing now , russia is called " petro-state russia . "
and that 's exactly what russia is - a state run on the profits of natural gas , oil and a couple of other commodities .
putin has done it .
there 's a chance that there will be no opposition parties whatsoever in the next russian election .
there 's not even a pretense of democracy .
basically , putin can have power for life if he wants it .
he can just say : " now i 'm going to be the president , now i 'm going to be the prime minister . "
he 'll just take the power with him from office to office like a traveling bag .
the country has sold out any ideals of democracy it ever had for the idea some sort of stability .
and there 's a huge gap between rich and poor - in my third book , i 'm calling that up and bringing it back to america .
it does n't sound as though you have high hopes for either russia or the us .
i was brought up between these two empires , one of which died and the other of which is dying in its own way .
as far as russia goes , there 's a restaurant in st. petersburg that 's called " 1913 , " which is known as the only good year in russian history .
it 's an autocratic country with an autocratic tradition and an autocratic church .
with america , i feel very much an american these days , because something i love is being destroyed .
for those of us who were displaced at an early age , america was always the place to go to , and the worst result of 9/11 would be that it stops being that . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon the european treaty : frequently asked questions reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's kaczynski brothers want more power for the ioannina delaying tactic poland is a big fan , although it wants it to go further , and yet it has only been invoked once to resolve a dispute over sardines .
what exactly is the ioannina compromise and why is it so important to the eu treaty ? the so-called " ioannina compromise " is one of the most talked-about and perhaps least well-understood issues relating to the ongoing reform treaty negotiations .
the term was coined after an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers which took place in ioannina , a greek city north of athens , in 1994 .
broadly speaking , the ioannina compromise is a gentlemen 's agreement , a time-out or emergency break designed to reassure individual member states who fear fellow eu members may cut deals which they strongly dislike .
ioannina gives countries a pause to find a solution in essence , if a country feels that its vital interests are threatened but can not muster a blocking minority , the decision is delayed while attempts to find a satisfactory solution are made .
the ioannina mechanism was first proposed when foreign ministers from the then 15-member union were called to discuss how voting rules should change if norway joined the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the initial compromise was lost when the eu signed nice at the meeting , ministers agreed that if eu members wished to oppose a measure but could not muster enough support to block it , they could ask the bloc 's council of member states to do " all within its power , within a reasonable space of time , to reach a satisfactory solution " that would be acceptable to a qualified majority .
norway eventually decided not to join the union , and the " gentlemen 's agreement " remained little more than a curious appendix to the eu decision-making process .
it was superseded by the nice treaty of 2000 , which established new voting rules for the eu ahead of the entry in 2004 of 10 new member states .
poland 's fight over voting rights resurrects ioannina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels agreed on a draft inclusion for the compromise but one of those newcomers - poland - fought hard to resurrect it this year during bitter negotiations over national voting rights in the reform treaty .
and in a bid to find a satisfactory compromise , the then german presidency of the eu in june included a reference to ioannina in an annex of the treaty .
according to the draft agreed last june in brussels , the eu council is forced to freeze decisions if : " -lrb- a -rrb- at least three quarters of the population , or -lrb- b -rrb- at least three quarters of the number of member states necessary to constitute a blocking minority ... indicate their opposition to the council adopting an act by a qualified majority . "
the annex does not place any formal time limits , saying that member states should spend " a reasonable time " looking for an acceptable solution .
kaczynskis want more time and legal framework but poland is campaigning for a " reinforced " ioannina mechanism and argues that two years constitutes a " reasonable time . "
moreover , poland wants the council to make an official decision on ioannina in lisbon and make it legally binding in some form or other .
because the council normally tries to reach decisions by consensus , the original ioannina compromise has been rarely invoked .
experts say there was only one unsuccessful attempt to use it during its limited lifespan : a case involving portuguese sardines . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
domestic pressures weigh heavily on the leaders of poland , britain and italy as they gather in lisbon for an eu summit which hopes to finalize the charter to reform the bloc 's institutions . as representatives from the 27 eu members states converged on the portuguese capital on thursday , oct .
18 , for crunch talks to approve a new treaty , the leaders of poland , italy and britain came armed with issues that could torpedo the charter at the eleventh hour . in poland , where a closely-contested parliamentary election is to take place on sunday , nationalists who support the government want their country to be granted more power to delay eu decisions that it dislikes .
polish president lech kaczynski is thus insisting that the so-called " ioannina compromise " - a gentlemen 's agreement that allows eu members that can not muster a blocking minority to delay a decision while attempts to find a satisfactory solution are made - to be made legally binding .
polish president reiterates treaty delay threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president kaczynski wants what poland deserves before leaving for lisbon , the president reiterated his threat to delay the charter .
" we do n't want anything more than is our right , " president lech kaczynski told polish radio before leaving for the summit .
asked what would happen if polish demands were not met , kaczynski replied : " we will have to delay the discussion " .
any delay would be a huge blow for the treaty and the eu which has been plagued by in-fighting over the text of this charter and its predecessor , the doomed eu constitution which was derailed by referendums in france and the netherlands in 2005 .
with summits with russia and china on the horizon , the eu would face a crisis of credibility and confidence if it was to meet these powers without an agreement on the treaty behind it .
britain 's brown under domestic pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown will halt the treaty talks if need be eurosceptic britain could also throw a spanner in the works if the legal work which has been done on the draft treaty since an initial agreement in berlin in june changes or removes any of the " red lines " - areas of national sovereignty where britain would hold a veto - which the uk had asked to be included .
with public opinion showing huge opposition to any increased eu influence over british domestic politics , prime minister gordon brown will be under pressure to ensure that britain 's toes are not trodden on .
if he feels that the uk is getting a raw deal , brown may delay the treaty to get what he - and the people who will decide his fate at the next general election - wants .
prodi smarting from parliament decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's prodi has not accepted parliament 's decision meanwhile , italy is still smarting from last week 's announcement that the reduction of seats in the european parliament will mean fewer italian representatives , a decision prime minister romano prodi said he was not ready to accept .
while the issue is not directly linked to the treaty , the subject may be included in the agenda for the summit and prodi hinted that he may make it a treaty problem unless italy 's demands on the composition of the future european parliament are met .
" we can not accept a solution ... based on the number of residents rather than citizens because that does not agree with either the spirit or the letter of the new treaty , " prodi said .
the european parliament has adopted a new plan for allocating seats starting with the next legislature -lrb- 2009-14 -rrb- under which for the first time italy would have less meps -lrb- 72 -rrb- than either france -lrb- 74 -rrb- or britain -lrb- 73 -rrb- .
italy has so far refused the plan .
rome argues that it is not the total population resident in each country that should form the basis of the calculation , but rather the number of european citizens .
observers suspect that the unusually tough line taken by prodi , a former eu commission head , has a lot to do with the difficulties his fragile centre-left coalition is facing back home .
notwithstanding the many obstacles , portuguese prime minister jose socrates whose country currently heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency said he 's optimistic of reaching a deal .
" i think we are getting very , very close to a new treaty and this will be called the lisbon treaty , " socrates told reporters ahead of chairing the summit . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
domestic pressures weigh heavily on the leaders of poland , britain and italy as they gather in lisbon for an eu summit which hopes to finalize the charter to reform the bloc 's institutions . as representatives from the 27 eu members states converged on the portuguese capital on thursday , oct .
18 , for crunch talks to approve a new treaty , the leaders of poland , italy and britain came armed with issues that could torpedo the charter at the eleventh hour . in poland , where a closely-contested parliamentary election is to take place on sunday , nationalists who support the government want their country to be granted more power to delay eu decisions that it dislikes .
polish president lech kaczynski is thus insisting that the so-called " ioannina compromise " - a gentlemen 's agreement that allows eu members that can not muster a blocking minority to delay a decision while attempts to find a satisfactory solution are made - to be made legally binding .
polish president reiterates treaty delay threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president kaczynski wants what poland deserves before leaving for lisbon , the president reiterated his threat to delay the charter .
" we do n't want anything more than is our right , " president lech kaczynski told polish radio before leaving for the summit .
asked what would happen if polish demands were not met , kaczynski replied : " we will have to delay the discussion " .
any delay would be a huge blow for the treaty and the eu which has been plagued by in-fighting over the text of this charter and its predecessor , the doomed eu constitution which was derailed by referendums in france and the netherlands in 2005 .
with summits with russia and china on the horizon , the eu would face a crisis of credibility and confidence if it was to meet these powers without an agreement on the treaty behind it .
britain 's brown under domestic pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown will halt the treaty talks if need be eurosceptic britain could also throw a spanner in the works if the legal work which has been done on the draft treaty since an initial agreement in berlin in june changes or removes any of the " red lines " - areas of national sovereignty where britain would hold a veto - which the uk had asked to be included .
with public opinion showing huge opposition to any increased eu influence over british domestic politics , prime minister gordon brown will be under pressure to ensure that britain 's toes are not trodden on .
if he feels that the uk is getting a raw deal , brown may delay the treaty to get what he - and the people who will decide his fate at the next general election - wants .
prodi smarting from parliament decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's prodi has not accepted parliament 's decision meanwhile , italy is still smarting from last week 's announcement that the reduction of seats in the european parliament will mean fewer italian representatives , a decision prime minister romano prodi said he was not ready to accept .
while the issue is not directly linked to the treaty , the subject may be included in the agenda for the summit and prodi hinted that he may make it a treaty problem unless italy 's demands on the composition of the future european parliament are met .
" we can not accept a solution ... based on the number of residents rather than citizens because that does not agree with either the spirit or the letter of the new treaty , " prodi said .
the european parliament has adopted a new plan for allocating seats starting with the next legislature -lrb- 2009-14 -rrb- under which for the first time italy would have less meps -lrb- 72 -rrb- than either france -lrb- 74 -rrb- or britain -lrb- 73 -rrb- .
italy has so far refused the plan .
rome argues that it is not the total population resident in each country that should form the basis of the calculation , but rather the number of european citizens .
observers suspect that the unusually tough line taken by prodi , a former eu commission head , has a lot to do with the difficulties his fragile centre-left coalition is facing back home .
notwithstanding the many obstacles , portuguese prime minister jose socrates whose country currently heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency said he 's optimistic of reaching a deal .

he ’ s 25 years old and frankfurt 's new captain for this season .
things are going well for the striker at the moment .
his team is seventh on the table and he just shot greece into euro 2008 . dw-tv : first of all : should we refer to each other formally or by first name ?
ioannis amanatidis : using first names is fine .
okay , that 's good .
my name 's andré ...
i 'm ianni .
ianni , i 'm from australia and as an australian i 've spent the last months watching the cricket world cup and rugby world cup .
it was great .
why should i come down on a saturday afternoon and watch frankfurt play ?
i think in europe , and especially germany , football really is the number one sport .
you can see that when you go to a game .
the stadium here is fantastic , with a great atmosphere .
every week we have basically a sell out crowd .
the feeling is indescribable .
you just have to be there yourself and experience it .
you 've played with a few teams in germany : fürth , kaiserslautern , stuttgart .
what 's so special about frankfurt ?
i 've been pretty much everywhere in southern germany , that 's true .
but somehow i just could n't leave frankfurt .
i just like it here i suppose .
i 've played the majority of my bundesliga games for frankfurt , scored most of my goals here and when i 'm moving around the city i feel comfortable .
if i go away and visit friends - to stuttgart or wherever - then i immediately feel at home when i drive back in to the city .
that 's a satisfying feeling .
you mention feeling at home here ... but you were born in kozani , in northern greece .
what was life like back then ?
it was a simple village life .
i lived there until i was 9 years old and went to school there .
well actually as soon as i got home from school i went and played football on the street with my friends .
sometimes i got in trouble because there was homework that needed doing ... other times i just slipped off without anyone noticing .
i suppose you could say that greek village life is a bit more relaxed than living here .
then my family decided that we were going to move to germany .
you are now in the greek international side , have been for a while in fact .
do you have goals at that level ?
of course .
i want to play for greece as much as i can .
when i first came in to the national team i was 21 or 22 and was playing only irregularly .
now i have established myself .
if i stay fit and perform at my best , i should be playing .
and that 's the goal .
and if i am on the field then i want to show what i can do - for my country and for our fans , my countrymen , who always come and support us .
speaking of countrymen : there is another greek player at frankfurt , sotirios kyrgiakos .
what 's it like having him on the pitch for you as captain ? he 's still having difficulties with his german , probably because he does n't want to speak the language .
but that 's not important because we all speak a type of football language with each other anyway .
for that reason language is n't so important and he does n't have to learn german , but it might help him in his private life .
he helps our team immensely on the field .
i help him in training and on the field to understand what 's going on .
it 's good that he 's here in frankfurt - he strengthens our team and that 's the most important thing .
you must have personal goals though at frankfurt .
what do you aim for yourself at the start of each season ?
do you say : i want 20 goals ?
no , i do n't believe in that .
i put the team first and its success .
if we are successful , if we play well and develop our game , then each one of us will develop individually anyway .
that 's a basic principle but you have to understand it .
i will never say : i want 10 , 15 or 20 goals in a season .
i 've scored three thus far , that 's okay .
i would certainly like to score a few more this season .
but the specific number is unimportant .
let 's say , hypothetically , you are playing for frankfurt in the german cup and you score a goal .
two months later you score a goal for greece in the european championships .
what 's more important for you , personally ?
well , it depends .
if it was the third or fourth goal in a game then it 's not so important as when it is a tight 1-0 win .
if it was the 1-0 for greece then i would prefer to score that than the 4-0 for frankfurt because there the game has already been won !
a very diplomatic answer .
okay , ianni , thanks for your time .
no worries .

if i go away and visit friends - to stuttgart or wherever - then i immediately feel at home when i drive back in to the city .
that 's a satisfying feeling .
you mention feeling at home here ... but you were born in kozani , in northern greece .
what was life like back then ?
it was a simple village life .
i lived there until i was 9 years old and went to school there .
well actually as soon as i got home from school i went and played football on the street with my friends .
sometimes i got in trouble because there was homework that needed doing ... other times i just slipped off without anyone noticing .
i suppose you could say that greek village life is a bit more relaxed than living here .
then my family decided that we were going to move to germany .
you are now in the greek international side , have been for a while in fact .
do you have goals at that level ?
of course .
i want to play for greece as much as i can .
when i first came in to the national team i was 21 or 22 and was playing only irregularly .
now i have established myself .
if i stay fit and perform at my best , i should be playing .
and that 's the goal .
and if i am on the field then i want to show what i can do - for my country and for our fans , my countrymen , who always come and support us .
speaking of countrymen : there is another greek player at frankfurt , sotirios kyrgiakos .
what 's it like having him on the pitch for you as captain ? he 's still having difficulties with his german , probably because he does n't want to speak the language .
but that 's not important because we all speak a type of football language with each other anyway .
for that reason language is n't so important and he does n't have to learn german , but it might help him in his private life .
he helps our team immensely on the field .
i help him in training and on the field to understand what 's going on .
it 's good that he 's here in frankfurt - he strengthens our team and that 's the most important thing .
you must have personal goals though at frankfurt .
what do you aim for yourself at the start of each season ?
do you say : i want 20 goals ?
no , i do n't believe in that .
i put the team first and its success .
if we are successful , if we play well and develop our game , then each one of us will develop individually anyway .
that 's a basic principle but you have to understand it .
i will never say : i want 10 , 15 or 20 goals in a season .
i 've scored three thus far , that 's okay .
i would certainly like to score a few more this season .
but the specific number is unimportant .
let 's say , hypothetically , you are playing for frankfurt in the german cup and you score a goal .
two months later you score a goal for greece in the european championships .
what 's more important for you , personally ?
well , it depends .
if it was the third or fourth goal in a game then it 's not so important as when it is a tight 1-0 win .
if it was the 1-0 for greece then i would prefer to score that than the 4-0 for frankfurt because there the game has already been won !
a very diplomatic answer .
okay , ianni , thanks for your time .
no worries .

he ’ s 25 years old and frankfurt 's new captain for this season .
things are going well for the striker at the moment .
his team is seventh on the table and he just shot greece into euro 2008 . dw-tv : first of all : should we refer to each other formally or by first name ?
ioannis amanatidis : using first names is fine .
okay , that 's good .
my name 's andré ...
i 'm ianni .
ianni , i 'm from australia and as an australian i 've spent the last months watching the cricket world cup and rugby world cup .
it was great .
why should i come down on a saturday afternoon and watch frankfurt play ?
i think in europe , and especially germany , football really is the number one sport .
you can see that when you go to a game .
the stadium here is fantastic , with a great atmosphere .
every week we have basically a sell out crowd .
the feeling is indescribable .
you just have to be there yourself and experience it .
you 've played with a few teams in germany : fürth , kaiserslautern , stuttgart .

he ’ s 25 years old and frankfurt 's new captain for this season .
things are going well for the striker at the moment .
his team is seventh on the table and he just shot greece into euro 2008 . dw-tv : first of all : should we refer to each other formally or by first name ?
ioannis amanatidis : using first names is fine .
okay , that 's good .
my name 's andré ...
i 'm ianni .
ianni , i 'm from australia and as an australian i 've spent the last months watching the cricket world cup and rugby world cup .
it was great .
why should i come down on a saturday afternoon and watch frankfurt play ?
i think in europe , and especially germany , football really is the number one sport .
you can see that when you go to a game .
the stadium here is fantastic , with a great atmosphere .
every week we have basically a sell out crowd .
the feeling is indescribable .
you just have to be there yourself and experience it .
you 've played with a few teams in germany : fürth , kaiserslautern , stuttgart .
what 's so special about frankfurt ?
i 've been pretty much everywhere in southern germany , that 's true .
but somehow i just could n't leave frankfurt .
i just like it here i suppose .
i 've played the majority of my bundesliga games for frankfurt , scored most of my goals here and when i 'm moving around the city i feel comfortable .
if i go away and visit friends - to stuttgart or wherever - then i immediately feel at home when i drive back in to the city .
that 's a satisfying feeling .
you mention feeling at home here ... but you were born in kozani , in northern greece .
what was life like back then ?
it was a simple village life .
i lived there until i was 9 years old and went to school there .
well actually as soon as i got home from school i went and played football on the street with my friends .
sometimes i got in trouble because there was homework that needed doing ... other times i just slipped off without anyone noticing .
i suppose you could say that greek village life is a bit more relaxed than living here .
then my family decided that we were going to move to germany .
you are now in the greek international side , have been for a while in fact .
do you have goals at that level ?
of course .
i want to play for greece as much as i can .
when i first came in to the national team i was 21 or 22 and was playing only irregularly .
now i have established myself .
if i stay fit and perform at my best , i should be playing .
and that 's the goal .
and if i am on the field then i want to show what i can do - for my country and for our fans , my countrymen , who always come and support us .
speaking of countrymen : there is another greek player at frankfurt , sotirios kyrgiakos .
what 's it like having him on the pitch for you as captain ? he 's still having difficulties with his german , probably because he does n't want to speak the language .
but that 's not important because we all speak a type of football language with each other anyway .
for that reason language is n't so important and he does n't have to learn german , but it might help him in his private life .
he helps our team immensely on the field .
i help him in training and on the field to understand what 's going on .
it 's good that he 's here in frankfurt - he strengthens our team and that 's the most important thing .
you must have personal goals though at frankfurt .
what do you aim for yourself at the start of each season ?
do you say : i want 20 goals ?
no , i do n't believe in that .
i put the team first and its success .
if we are successful , if we play well and develop our game , then each one of us will develop individually anyway .
that 's a basic principle but you have to understand it .
i will never say : i want 10 , 15 or 20 goals in a season .
i 've scored three thus far , that 's okay .
i would certainly like to score a few more this season .
but the specific number is unimportant .
let 's say , hypothetically , you are playing for frankfurt in the german cup and you score a goal .
two months later you score a goal for greece in the european championships .
what 's more important for you , personally ?
well , it depends .
if it was the third or fourth goal in a game then it 's not so important as when it is a tight 1-0 win .
if it was the 1-0 for greece then i would prefer to score that than the 4-0 for frankfurt because there the game has already been won !
a very diplomatic answer .
okay , ianni , thanks for your time .
no worries .

18 , to step up reform and warned that europe 's biggest economy faced slowing growth next year . the institutes told the government in their autumn report presented in berlin on thursday that german growth will slip back to 2.2 percent in 2008 from 2.6 percent this year , with a soaring euro , the global credit crunch and surging oil prices undercutting the nation 's expansion rate .
some economists are more pessimistic and believe germany will be lucky to reach a growth rate next year of 2 percent .
the international monetary fund said this week it expects german growth will slip to 2 percent next year from 2.4 percent for 2007 .
thursday 's report was drawn up by four leading german economic institutes in conjunction with research groups from other european nations .
criticism of ineffective reforms coming in the wake of criticism by german business about the failure of angela merkel 's government coalition to press on with economic reform , the institutes said : " much more additional work needs to be done rather than roll back the reforms so far discussed .
" the labor market reform course of the last few years has not progressed , " the institutes added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us housing market crisis had a knock-on effect the report comes as economists attempt to size up the ramifications of the shakeout in global share prices in august following the credit crunch triggered by the us housing market crisis .
at the same time , the institutes joined a growing list of forecasters who have revised down their growth outlook for germany .
high oil prices , the strong euro and financial market uncertainty will " dampen growth , " roland döhrn , an economist with the essen-based institute for scientific research -lrb- rwi -rrb- , told a press conference following the release of the report .
in their last report in the spring , the institutes projected a growth rate for germany of 2.4 percent in both 2007 and 2008 , with strong export demand powering the nation 's economic performance .
export growth likely to decline since then , however , the euro has climbed to an all-time high of $ 1.43 as fears have set in about the us economic outlook , consequently fuelling concerns about the prospects for germany 's key export machine .
the institutes predict german export growth will decline to 3 percent in 2008 from 3.5 percent this year , with stronger private consumption emerging as a key pillar of growth .
the institutes are also forecasting private consumption to grow by 1.5 percent next year compared to just 0.2 percent in 2007 .
the release of the institutes ' report is expected to lead to the german government also scaling back its growth projections for the nation .
germany emerged last year from a protracted period of stagnation , with a recent solid growth rate helping to ease the nation 's high unemployment .
larger reduction in unemployment that expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german unemployment dropped in september the number of people out of work in germany fell more than expected in september , data released last month showed , with employers continuing to hire on the back of the economic upswing and years of wage restraint .
the institutes expect unemployment to continue falling to average 7.9 percent in 2008 compared to 8.7 percent in 2007 .
germany 's jobless rate stood at 10.3 percent last year .
apart from the rwi , the german institutes involved in drawing up the report included the kiel institute for the world economy -lrb- ifw -rrb- , halle institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- and the munich- based ifo institute for economic research . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , to step up reform and warned that europe 's biggest economy faced slowing growth next year . the institutes told the government in their autumn report presented in berlin on thursday that german growth will slip back to 2.2 percent in 2008 from 2.6 percent this year , with a soaring euro , the global credit crunch and surging oil prices undercutting the nation 's expansion rate .
some economists are more pessimistic and believe germany will be lucky to reach a growth rate next year of 2 percent .
the international monetary fund said this week it expects german growth will slip to 2 percent next year from 2.4 percent for 2007 .
thursday 's report was drawn up by four leading german economic institutes in conjunction with research groups from other european nations .
criticism of ineffective reforms coming in the wake of criticism by german business about the failure of angela merkel 's government coalition to press on with economic reform , the institutes said : " much more additional work needs to be done rather than roll back the reforms so far discussed .
" the labor market reform course of the last few years has not progressed , " the institutes added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us housing market crisis had a knock-on effect the report comes as economists attempt to size up the ramifications of the shakeout in global share prices in august following the credit crunch triggered by the us housing market crisis .
at the same time , the institutes joined a growing list of forecasters who have revised down their growth outlook for germany .
high oil prices , the strong euro and financial market uncertainty will " dampen growth , " roland döhrn , an economist with the essen-based institute for scientific research -lrb- rwi -rrb- , told a press conference following the release of the report .
in their last report in the spring , the institutes projected a growth rate for germany of 2.4 percent in both 2007 and 2008 , with strong export demand powering the nation 's economic performance .
export growth likely to decline since then , however , the euro has climbed to an all-time high of $ 1.43 as fears have set in about the us economic outlook , consequently fuelling concerns about the prospects for germany 's key export machine .
the institutes predict german export growth will decline to 3 percent in 2008 from 3.5 percent this year , with stronger private consumption emerging as a key pillar of growth .
the institutes are also forecasting private consumption to grow by 1.5 percent next year compared to just 0.2 percent in 2007 .
the release of the institutes ' report is expected to lead to the german government also scaling back its growth projections for the nation .
germany emerged last year from a protracted period of stagnation , with a recent solid growth rate helping to ease the nation 's high unemployment .
larger reduction in unemployment that expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german unemployment dropped in september the number of people out of work in germany fell more than expected in september , data released last month showed , with employers continuing to hire on the back of the economic upswing and years of wage restraint .
the institutes expect unemployment to continue falling to average 7.9 percent in 2008 compared to 8.7 percent in 2007 .
germany 's jobless rate stood at 10.3 percent last year .

hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon the european treaty : frequently asked questions reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's kaczynski brothers want more power for the ioannina delaying tactic poland is a big fan , although it wants it to go further , and yet it has only been invoked once to resolve a dispute over sardines .
what exactly is the ioannina compromise and why is it so important to the eu treaty ? the so-called " ioannina compromise " is one of the most talked-about and perhaps least well-understood issues relating to the ongoing reform treaty negotiations .
the term was coined after an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers which took place in ioannina , a greek city north of athens , in 1994 .
broadly speaking , the ioannina compromise is a gentlemen 's agreement , a time-out or emergency break designed to reassure individual member states who fear fellow eu members may cut deals which they strongly dislike .
ioannina gives countries a pause to find a solution in essence , if a country feels that its vital interests are threatened but can not muster a blocking minority , the decision is delayed while attempts to find a satisfactory solution are made .
the ioannina mechanism was first proposed when foreign ministers from the then 15-member union were called to discuss how voting rules should change if norway joined the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the initial compromise was lost when the eu signed nice at the meeting , ministers agreed that if eu members wished to oppose a measure but could not muster enough support to block it , they could ask the bloc 's council of member states to do " all within its power , within a reasonable space of time , to reach a satisfactory solution " that would be acceptable to a qualified majority .
norway eventually decided not to join the union , and the " gentlemen 's agreement " remained little more than a curious appendix to the eu decision-making process .
it was superseded by the nice treaty of 2000 , which established new voting rules for the eu ahead of the entry in 2004 of 10 new member states .
poland 's fight over voting rights resurrects ioannina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels agreed on a draft inclusion for the compromise but one of those newcomers - poland - fought hard to resurrect it this year during bitter negotiations over national voting rights in the reform treaty .
and in a bid to find a satisfactory compromise , the then german presidency of the eu in june included a reference to ioannina in an annex of the treaty .
according to the draft agreed last june in brussels , the eu council is forced to freeze decisions if : " -lrb- a -rrb- at least three quarters of the population , or -lrb- b -rrb- at least three quarters of the number of member states necessary to constitute a blocking minority ... indicate their opposition to the council adopting an act by a qualified majority . "
the annex does not place any formal time limits , saying that member states should spend " a reasonable time " looking for an acceptable solution .
kaczynskis want more time and legal framework but poland is campaigning for a " reinforced " ioannina mechanism and argues that two years constitutes a " reasonable time . "
moreover , poland wants the council to make an official decision on ioannina in lisbon and make it legally binding in some form or other .
because the council normally tries to reach decisions by consensus , the original ioannina compromise has been rarely invoked .
experts say there was only one unsuccessful attempt to use it during its limited lifespan : a case involving portuguese sardines . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pollsters asked whether national socialism had any good points .

she cited " the high regard for the mother " as an example and said she regretted that family values nurtured by the nazis had been swept away .
she was recently thrown off a talk show after refusing to apologize for her comments .
the nazis offered incentives to child-bearing women .
yet their family policies were part of a racist ideology whose goal was the creation of a master race .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the eu treaty - a blueprint for europe 's future ?
hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 the european treaty : frequently asked questions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu be hanging out the decorations in celebration of the treaty come december ?
the european treaty has loomed large on the horizon of the eu political landscape for the past few weeks as eu leaders prepare to agree on the its final text on oct .
18-19 . this week 's eu summit in lisbon is an informal meeting for heads of state to see the results of legal work carried out on the european treaty over the autumn .
if the reformed treaty text is approved it will then go forward to a formal heads of state meeting in brussels in december .
if the treat receives the leaders ' approval again it will then be sent for ratification by all 27 eu member states . but what is the european treaty and what is all the fuss about ?
dw-world.de answers some of the most pertinent questions . what is the european reform treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution has made way for the treaty after the failure of its forerunner , the european constitution , which was rejected in 2005 by voters in france and the netherlands , the european reform treaty was conceived as an alternative series of amendments to two existing eu treaties , the treaty on the european union -lrb- maastricht -rrb- and the treaty establishing the european community -lrb- rome -rrb- . the idea is that the reform treaty will be a blueprint for running the expanded european union more efficiently .
the reform treaty was presented to the eu leaders in brussels in july by the portuguese presidency , after an initial hard-fought agreement on its text was hammered out in under berlin 's leadership in june . what will the european reform treaty do ? the eu leaders will decide on the final draft for the european reform treaty in lisbon on oct .
18-19 and so the precise wording of the treaty has yet to be agreed .
however , the document is expected to include the following : create the role of european president this is one of the most controversial proposals as the idea was initially opposed by smaller eu nations but was forced through by the larger member states .
the presidential role has official backing but opposition and resentment remain .
the president would serve a two-and-a half-year term , replacing the current system of a rotating six-month presidency , and will not be allowed to serve more than two terms . create the role of eu high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy essentially the eu 's foreign minister -lrb- as proposed in the constitution -rrb- , this role will combine the posts of current foreign affairs chief javier solana , and the external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and will be the eu 's point person for world affairs .
reduce the size of the european commission just as the european parliament recently announced that the number of parliamentarians would be capped at 750 regardless of new countries joining the bloc , the eu commission will reduce the number of its commissioners .
there will be fewer commissioners than member states by 2014 , with only two-thirds of countries supplying a commissioner on a rotational basis . redistribute voting weights among member states this is another controversial aspect that has had many member states , particularly poland and britain , up in arms .
the treaty intends to introduce majority voting , which will allow votes to be carried on a 55 percent majority as long as that majority also represent 65 percent of the european population .

hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 the european treaty : frequently asked questions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu be hanging out the decorations in celebration of the treaty come december ?
the european treaty has loomed large on the horizon of the eu political landscape for the past few weeks as eu leaders prepare to agree on the its final text on oct .
18-19 . this week 's eu summit in lisbon is an informal meeting for heads of state to see the results of legal work carried out on the european treaty over the autumn .
if the reformed treaty text is approved it will then go forward to a formal heads of state meeting in brussels in december .
if the treat receives the leaders ' approval again it will then be sent for ratification by all 27 eu member states . but what is the european treaty and what is all the fuss about ?
dw-world.de answers some of the most pertinent questions . what is the european reform treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution has made way for the treaty after the failure of its forerunner , the european constitution , which was rejected in 2005 by voters in france and the netherlands , the european reform treaty was conceived as an alternative series of amendments to two existing eu treaties , the treaty on the european union -lrb- maastricht -rrb- and the treaty establishing the european community -lrb- rome -rrb- . the idea is that the reform treaty will be a blueprint for running the expanded european union more efficiently .
the reform treaty was presented to the eu leaders in brussels in july by the portuguese presidency , after an initial hard-fought agreement on its text was hammered out in under berlin 's leadership in june . what will the european reform treaty do ? the eu leaders will decide on the final draft for the european reform treaty in lisbon on oct .
18-19 and so the precise wording of the treaty has yet to be agreed .
however , the document is expected to include the following : create the role of european president this is one of the most controversial proposals as the idea was initially opposed by smaller eu nations but was forced through by the larger member states .
the presidential role has official backing but opposition and resentment remain .
the president would serve a two-and-a half-year term , replacing the current system of a rotating six-month presidency , and will not be allowed to serve more than two terms . create the role of eu high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy essentially the eu 's foreign minister -lrb- as proposed in the constitution -rrb- , this role will combine the posts of current foreign affairs chief javier solana , and the external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and will be the eu 's point person for world affairs .
reduce the size of the european commission just as the european parliament recently announced that the number of parliamentarians would be capped at 750 regardless of new countries joining the bloc , the eu commission will reduce the number of its commissioners .
there will be fewer commissioners than member states by 2014 , with only two-thirds of countries supplying a commissioner on a rotational basis . redistribute voting weights among member states this is another controversial aspect that has had many member states , particularly poland and britain , up in arms .
the treaty intends to introduce majority voting , which will allow votes to be carried on a 55 percent majority as long as that majority also represent 65 percent of the european population .
this would be phased in between 2014 and 2017 . give new powers to the european commission , european parliament and european court of justice , in areas such as justice and domestic affairs remove the national veto in a number of areas is the reform treaty just the failed european constitution under a different name ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french , along with the dutch , gave a resounding " non " originally , the reform treaty was described as having " no constitutional characteristics , " but investigations by a number of international analysis groups have noted that only two of the 440 provisions in the reform treaty differ from the original constitution .

currently in berlin , he took time off from writing to discuss his latest work and what 's going wrong in both of his home countries . with his 2003 debut " the russian debutante 's handbook " and the follow-up " absurdistan " from 2006 , gary shteyngart established his credentials as one of the english language 's best young writers and a satirist with a talent for highlighting the absurdities of both the east and the west after the cold war .
now he 's trying something a bit different .
dw-world.de : your books have been read and marketed as part of a new immigrant literature in the us , but they 're not at all earnest or politically correct .
why is that ?
gary shteyngart : well , first of all , because i was very unlucky and got sent to this horrible hebrew school .
if it was n't for those eight years being told by rabbis that the holocaust happened because i ate a piece of pork salami , i do n't think you would have had books like " absurdistan . "
that took away any sense i might have had about anything being sacred .
unless you were an idiot , you could see from a mile away that a lot of things were just plain stupid and very coercive .
then i went to a really great high school in manhattan that was a true melting pot , a holding pen for multinational nerds .
it was a place where chinese , russian and indian people gathered together , and it was a real free-for-all .
then i went to oberlin college , and that was the final straw .
from the moment i got there i just wanted to make fun of it .
the first week i was there , i got chewed out for calling some a freshman instead of a " fresh person , " and there was a professor who had devoted his life to translating brezhnev 's works into yiddish .
so that was maybe the best part of my education since it gave me such wonderful targets to go after .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of " absurdistan " is called " snack daddy 's adventurous trip " you 're working on a new book as a fellow of the american academy here in berlin .
what 's the novel about ?
it 's the first book i 've set almost entirely in america , and it takes place - god help me because the phrase " speculative fiction " makes my skin crawl - in the near future .
it follows the love affair of two immigrants , as america slowly disintegrates .
new york and los angeles have become two heavily guarded areas , or what i call " cooperative exclusion zones . "
a small group of rich shareholders achieve immortality , while the vast majority of the population loses the ability to speak , read and write in english .
and that 's what happens to one of the two lovers .
that 's very different from your first two books , which feature unscrupulous us-immigrant protagonists forced to go back to an absurd , violent and materialistic eastern europe .
one sets up a pyramid scheme in prague , while the other tries to procure a fake passport amidst a halliburton-sponsored war in the caucasus .
why the change in the emphasis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of eastern european oil is a shteyngart speciality well , i ca n't do the same story over and over again .
the first book , " the russian debutante 's handbook , " dealt with the rise of turbo-capitalism in eastern europe , and the second , " absurdistan , " took that further by bringing in us foreign policy , specifically the politics of the oil industry .
the third one deals with the fact that we in the us have become " absurdistan " in some respects , for instance , in our approach to human rights issues , privacy and upholding the constitution .
one of the worst outcomes of 9/11 is that many of the people who traditionally came to america are now having second thoughts about that .
i also wanted to write about the baby boomers ' inability to come to terms with their own mortality .
and lastly , this book features a love affair that runs from page one to page 350 or whatever .
i 've never done that before .
why come to berlin if the book is set almost entirely in america ?
i work a lot better off-shore , so to speak , than in america .
there 's something about being in countries where i do n't speak the language .
most of " absurdistan " was written in italy .
and i 'm working much faster here than i ever have before .
like in new york , there 's both an excitement and a gloom about the city , but what interests me is that , unlike new york , there 's a real collision of east and west here .
to think that we 're only an hour and a half from poland here is really amazing .
what do you think then about the latest developments in eastern europe , in particular vladimir putin 's russia ?
some of them resemble the fictional scenarios you created in " absurdistan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shteyngart says both bush and putin have betrayed the ideals of democracy i began writing that book before 9/11 and before halliburton got so involved in iraq .
but i was observing events in azerbaijan and georgia , and the path looked very clear .
in the book i 'm writing now , russia is called " petro-state russia . "
and that 's exactly what russia is - a state run on the profits of natural gas , oil and a couple of other commodities .
putin has done it .
there 's a chance that there will be no opposition parties whatsoever in the next russian election .
there 's not even a pretense of democracy .
basically , putin can have power for life if he wants it .
he can just say : " now i 'm going to be the president , now i 'm going to be the prime minister . "
he 'll just take the power with him from office to office like a traveling bag .
the country has sold out any ideals of democracy it ever had for the idea some sort of stability .
and there 's a huge gap between rich and poor - in my third book , i 'm calling that up and bringing it back to america .
it does n't sound as though you have high hopes for either russia or the us .
i was brought up between these two empires , one of which died and the other of which is dying in its own way .
as far as russia goes , there 's a restaurant in st. petersburg that 's called " 1913 , " which is known as the only good year in russian history .
it 's an autocratic country with an autocratic tradition and an autocratic church .
with america , i feel very much an american these days , because something i love is being destroyed .
for those of us who were displaced at an early age , america was always the place to go to , and the worst result of 9/11 would be that it stops being that . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i was brought up between these two empires , one of which died and the other of which is dying in its own way .
as far as russia goes , there 's a restaurant in st. petersburg that 's called " 1913 , " which is known as the only good year in russian history .
it 's an autocratic country with an autocratic tradition and an autocratic church .
with america , i feel very much an american these days , because something i love is being destroyed .
for those of us who were displaced at an early age , america was always the place to go to , and the worst result of 9/11 would be that it stops being that . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
domestic pressures weigh heavily on the leaders of poland , britain and italy as they gather in lisbon for an eu summit which hopes to finalize the charter to reform the bloc 's institutions . as representatives from the 27 eu members states converged on the portuguese capital on thursday , oct .
18 , for crunch talks to approve a new treaty , the leaders of poland , italy and britain came armed with issues that could torpedo the charter at the eleventh hour . in poland , where a closely-contested parliamentary election is to take place on sunday , nationalists who support the government want their country to be granted more power to delay eu decisions that it dislikes .
polish president lech kaczynski is thus insisting that the so-called " ioannina compromise " - a gentlemen 's agreement that allows eu members that can not muster a blocking minority to delay a decision while attempts to find a satisfactory solution are made - to be made legally binding .
polish president reiterates treaty delay threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president kaczynski wants what poland deserves before leaving for lisbon , the president reiterated his threat to delay the charter .
" we do n't want anything more than is our right , " president lech kaczynski told polish radio before leaving for the summit .
asked what would happen if polish demands were not met , kaczynski replied : " we will have to delay the discussion " .
any delay would be a huge blow for the treaty and the eu which has been plagued by in-fighting over the text of this charter and its predecessor , the doomed eu constitution which was derailed by referendums in france and the netherlands in 2005 .
with summits with russia and china on the horizon , the eu would face a crisis of credibility and confidence if it was to meet these powers without an agreement on the treaty behind it .
britain 's brown under domestic pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown will halt the treaty talks if need be eurosceptic britain could also throw a spanner in the works if the legal work which has been done on the draft treaty since an initial agreement in berlin in june changes or removes any of the " red lines " - areas of national sovereignty where britain would hold a veto - which the uk had asked to be included .
with public opinion showing huge opposition to any increased eu influence over british domestic politics , prime minister gordon brown will be under pressure to ensure that britain 's toes are not trodden on .
if he feels that the uk is getting a raw deal , brown may delay the treaty to get what he - and the people who will decide his fate at the next general election - wants .
prodi smarting from parliament decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's prodi has not accepted parliament 's decision meanwhile , italy is still smarting from last week 's announcement that the reduction of seats in the european parliament will mean fewer italian representatives , a decision prime minister romano prodi said he was not ready to accept .
while the issue is not directly linked to the treaty , the subject may be included in the agenda for the summit and prodi hinted that he may make it a treaty problem unless italy 's demands on the composition of the future european parliament are met .
" we can not accept a solution ... based on the number of residents rather than citizens because that does not agree with either the spirit or the letter of the new treaty , " prodi said .
the european parliament has adopted a new plan for allocating seats starting with the next legislature -lrb- 2009-14 -rrb- under which for the first time italy would have less meps -lrb- 72 -rrb- than either france -lrb- 74 -rrb- or britain -lrb- 73 -rrb- .
italy has so far refused the plan .
rome argues that it is not the total population resident in each country that should form the basis of the calculation , but rather the number of european citizens .
observers suspect that the unusually tough line taken by prodi , a former eu commission head , has a lot to do with the difficulties his fragile centre-left coalition is facing back home .
notwithstanding the many obstacles , portuguese prime minister jose socrates whose country currently heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency said he 's optimistic of reaching a deal .

"
domestic pressures weigh heavily on the leaders of poland , britain and italy as they gather in lisbon for an eu summit which hopes to finalize the charter to reform the bloc 's institutions . as representatives from the 27 eu members states converged on the portuguese capital on thursday , oct .
18 , for crunch talks to approve a new treaty , the leaders of poland , italy and britain came armed with issues that could torpedo the charter at the eleventh hour . in poland , where a closely-contested parliamentary election is to take place on sunday , nationalists who support the government want their country to be granted more power to delay eu decisions that it dislikes .
polish president lech kaczynski is thus insisting that the so-called " ioannina compromise " - a gentlemen 's agreement that allows eu members that can not muster a blocking minority to delay a decision while attempts to find a satisfactory solution are made - to be made legally binding .
polish president reiterates treaty delay threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president kaczynski wants what poland deserves before leaving for lisbon , the president reiterated his threat to delay the charter .
" we do n't want anything more than is our right , " president lech kaczynski told polish radio before leaving for the summit .
asked what would happen if polish demands were not met , kaczynski replied : " we will have to delay the discussion " .
any delay would be a huge blow for the treaty and the eu which has been plagued by in-fighting over the text of this charter and its predecessor , the doomed eu constitution which was derailed by referendums in france and the netherlands in 2005 .
with summits with russia and china on the horizon , the eu would face a crisis of credibility and confidence if it was to meet these powers without an agreement on the treaty behind it .
britain 's brown under domestic pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown will halt the treaty talks if need be eurosceptic britain could also throw a spanner in the works if the legal work which has been done on the draft treaty since an initial agreement in berlin in june changes or removes any of the " red lines " - areas of national sovereignty where britain would hold a veto - which the uk had asked to be included .
with public opinion showing huge opposition to any increased eu influence over british domestic politics , prime minister gordon brown will be under pressure to ensure that britain 's toes are not trodden on .
if he feels that the uk is getting a raw deal , brown may delay the treaty to get what he - and the people who will decide his fate at the next general election - wants .
prodi smarting from parliament decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's prodi has not accepted parliament 's decision meanwhile , italy is still smarting from last week 's announcement that the reduction of seats in the european parliament will mean fewer italian representatives , a decision prime minister romano prodi said he was not ready to accept .
while the issue is not directly linked to the treaty , the subject may be included in the agenda for the summit and prodi hinted that he may make it a treaty problem unless italy 's demands on the composition of the future european parliament are met .
" we can not accept a solution ... based on the number of residents rather than citizens because that does not agree with either the spirit or the letter of the new treaty , " prodi said .
the european parliament has adopted a new plan for allocating seats starting with the next legislature -lrb- 2009-14 -rrb- under which for the first time italy would have less meps -lrb- 72 -rrb- than either france -lrb- 74 -rrb- or britain -lrb- 73 -rrb- .
italy has so far refused the plan .
rome argues that it is not the total population resident in each country that should form the basis of the calculation , but rather the number of european citizens .
observers suspect that the unusually tough line taken by prodi , a former eu commission head , has a lot to do with the difficulties his fragile centre-left coalition is facing back home .
notwithstanding the many obstacles , portuguese prime minister jose socrates whose country currently heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency said he 's optimistic of reaching a deal .
" i think we are getting very , very close to a new treaty and this will be called the lisbon treaty , " socrates told reporters ahead of chairing the summit . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , will bring the reformed treaty one step closer to a final agreement , with representatives of the 27 eu member states expected to agree on the final text .
but failure is still possible for the document . the issues of a polish request for a mechanism allowing minorities to delay decisions that they do not like to be made legally binding and british demands to be granted an opt-out on european policies in the field of justice and domestic affairs are expected to dominate the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will gordon brown 's " red lines " be responsible for axing the reform treaty ?
however , a number of countries , including austria , britain , denmark and italy , have also expressed concerns - not all of them strictly connected to the treaty 's contents .
with the treaty relying on unanimity to get through to the final stage at a summit in brussels in december , any one country , if dissatisfied , could send the eu planners back to the drawing board .
on the positive side , the treaty has the strong backing of eu heavyweights germany and france , in contrast to the constitution draft that preceded it and was rejected by dutch and french voters in 2005 .

even poland , by far the most critical voice , has been scaling down its objections in the run-up to the meeting . " i am convinced it will be a success , " polish president lech kaczynski said ahead of a meeting with german chancellor angela merkel in berlin last friday .
comments of this nature have encouraged diplomats and experts in brussels to become " quietly optimistic " that community spirit will prevail over national interests once leaders gather in the portuguese capital .

before they can be put in place many decisions in the bloc require unanimity , which has become harder and harder to find in the expanding union .
in december 2001 , eu leaders meeting in laeken , belgium , agreed to set up a convention on the future of the eu chaired by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing .
the convention led to the constitutional treaty , which was signed in october 2004 , only to be ditched after it was given the thumbs-down by referendums held in france and the netherlands a year later .

however , a number of countries , including austria , britain , denmark and italy , have also expressed concerns - not all of them strictly connected to the treaty 's contents .
with the treaty relying on unanimity to get through to the final stage at a summit in brussels in december , any one country , if dissatisfied , could send the eu planners back to the drawing board .

he ’ s 25 years old and frankfurt 's new captain for this season .
things are going well for the striker at the moment .
his team is seventh on the table and he just shot greece into euro 2008 . dw-tv : first of all : should we refer to each other formally or by first name ?
ioannis amanatidis : using first names is fine .
okay , that 's good .
my name 's andré ...
i 'm ianni .
ianni , i 'm from australia and as an australian i 've spent the last months watching the cricket world cup and rugby world cup .
it was great .
why should i come down on a saturday afternoon and watch frankfurt play ?
i think in europe , and especially germany , football really is the number one sport .
you can see that when you go to a game .
the stadium here is fantastic , with a great atmosphere .
every week we have basically a sell out crowd .
the feeling is indescribable .
you just have to be there yourself and experience it .
you 've played with a few teams in germany : fürth , kaiserslautern , stuttgart .
what 's so special about frankfurt ?
i 've been pretty much everywhere in southern germany , that 's true .
but somehow i just could n't leave frankfurt .
i just like it here i suppose .
i 've played the majority of my bundesliga games for frankfurt , scored most of my goals here and when i 'm moving around the city i feel comfortable .
if i go away and visit friends - to stuttgart or wherever - then i immediately feel at home when i drive back in to the city .
that 's a satisfying feeling .
you mention feeling at home here ... but you were born in kozani , in northern greece .
what was life like back then ?
it was a simple village life .
i lived there until i was 9 years old and went to school there .
well actually as soon as i got home from school i went and played football on the street with my friends .
sometimes i got in trouble because there was homework that needed doing ... other times i just slipped off without anyone noticing .
i suppose you could say that greek village life is a bit more relaxed than living here .
then my family decided that we were going to move to germany .
you are now in the greek international side , have been for a while in fact .
do you have goals at that level ?
of course .
i want to play for greece as much as i can .
when i first came in to the national team i was 21 or 22 and was playing only irregularly .
now i have established myself .
if i stay fit and perform at my best , i should be playing .
and that 's the goal .
and if i am on the field then i want to show what i can do - for my country and for our fans , my countrymen , who always come and support us .
speaking of countrymen : there is another greek player at frankfurt , sotirios kyrgiakos .
what 's it like having him on the pitch for you as captain ? he 's still having difficulties with his german , probably because he does n't want to speak the language .
but that 's not important because we all speak a type of football language with each other anyway .
for that reason language is n't so important and he does n't have to learn german , but it might help him in his private life .
he helps our team immensely on the field .
i help him in training and on the field to understand what 's going on .
it 's good that he 's here in frankfurt - he strengthens our team and that 's the most important thing .
you must have personal goals though at frankfurt .
what do you aim for yourself at the start of each season ?
do you say : i want 20 goals ?
no , i do n't believe in that .
i put the team first and its success .
if we are successful , if we play well and develop our game , then each one of us will develop individually anyway .
that 's a basic principle but you have to understand it .
i will never say : i want 10 , 15 or 20 goals in a season .
i 've scored three thus far , that 's okay .
i would certainly like to score a few more this season .
but the specific number is unimportant .
let 's say , hypothetically , you are playing for frankfurt in the german cup and you score a goal .
two months later you score a goal for greece in the european championships .
what 's more important for you , personally ?
well , it depends .
if it was the third or fourth goal in a game then it 's not so important as when it is a tight 1-0 win .
if it was the 1-0 for greece then i would prefer to score that than the 4-0 for frankfurt because there the game has already been won !
a very diplomatic answer .
okay , ianni , thanks for your time .
no worries .

and that 's the goal .
and if i am on the field then i want to show what i can do - for my country and for our fans , my countrymen , who always come and support us .
speaking of countrymen : there is another greek player at frankfurt , sotirios kyrgiakos .
what 's it like having him on the pitch for you as captain ? he 's still having difficulties with his german , probably because he does n't want to speak the language .
but that 's not important because we all speak a type of football language with each other anyway .
for that reason language is n't so important and he does n't have to learn german , but it might help him in his private life .
he helps our team immensely on the field .
i help him in training and on the field to understand what 's going on .
it 's good that he 's here in frankfurt - he strengthens our team and that 's the most important thing .
you must have personal goals though at frankfurt .
what do you aim for yourself at the start of each season ?
do you say : i want 20 goals ?
no , i do n't believe in that .
i put the team first and its success .
if we are successful , if we play well and develop our game , then each one of us will develop individually anyway .
that 's a basic principle but you have to understand it .
i will never say : i want 10 , 15 or 20 goals in a season .
i 've scored three thus far , that 's okay .
i would certainly like to score a few more this season .
but the specific number is unimportant .
let 's say , hypothetically , you are playing for frankfurt in the german cup and you score a goal .
two months later you score a goal for greece in the european championships .
what 's more important for you , personally ?
well , it depends .
if it was the third or fourth goal in a game then it 's not so important as when it is a tight 1-0 win .
if it was the 1-0 for greece then i would prefer to score that than the 4-0 for frankfurt because there the game has already been won !
a very diplomatic answer .
okay , ianni , thanks for your time .
no worries .

he ’ s 25 years old and frankfurt 's new captain for this season .
things are going well for the striker at the moment .
his team is seventh on the table and he just shot greece into euro 2008 . dw-tv : first of all : should we refer to each other formally or by first name ?
ioannis amanatidis : using first names is fine .
okay , that 's good .
my name 's andré ...
i 'm ianni .
ianni , i 'm from australia and as an australian i 've spent the last months watching the cricket world cup and rugby world cup .
it was great .
why should i come down on a saturday afternoon and watch frankfurt play ?
i think in europe , and especially germany , football really is the number one sport .
you can see that when you go to a game .
the stadium here is fantastic , with a great atmosphere .
every week we have basically a sell out crowd .
the feeling is indescribable .
you just have to be there yourself and experience it .
you 've played with a few teams in germany : fürth , kaiserslautern , stuttgart .
what 's so special about frankfurt ?
i 've been pretty much everywhere in southern germany , that 's true .
but somehow i just could n't leave frankfurt .
i just like it here i suppose .
i 've played the majority of my bundesliga games for frankfurt , scored most of my goals here and when i 'm moving around the city i feel comfortable .
if i go away and visit friends - to stuttgart or wherever - then i immediately feel at home when i drive back in to the city .
that 's a satisfying feeling .
you mention feeling at home here ... but you were born in kozani , in northern greece .
what was life like back then ?
it was a simple village life .
i lived there until i was 9 years old and went to school there .
well actually as soon as i got home from school i went and played football on the street with my friends .
sometimes i got in trouble because there was homework that needed doing ... other times i just slipped off without anyone noticing .
i suppose you could say that greek village life is a bit more relaxed than living here .
then my family decided that we were going to move to germany .
you are now in the greek international side , have been for a while in fact .
do you have goals at that level ?
of course .
i want to play for greece as much as i can .
when i first came in to the national team i was 21 or 22 and was playing only irregularly .
now i have established myself .
if i stay fit and perform at my best , i should be playing .
and that 's the goal .
and if i am on the field then i want to show what i can do - for my country and for our fans , my countrymen , who always come and support us .

18 , to step up reform and warned that europe 's biggest economy faced slowing growth next year . the institutes told the government in their autumn report presented in berlin on thursday that german growth will slip back to 2.2 percent in 2008 from 2.6 percent this year , with a soaring euro , the global credit crunch and surging oil prices undercutting the nation 's expansion rate .
some economists are more pessimistic and believe germany will be lucky to reach a growth rate next year of 2 percent .
the international monetary fund said this week it expects german growth will slip to 2 percent next year from 2.4 percent for 2007 .
thursday 's report was drawn up by four leading german economic institutes in conjunction with research groups from other european nations .
criticism of ineffective reforms coming in the wake of criticism by german business about the failure of angela merkel 's government coalition to press on with economic reform , the institutes said : " much more additional work needs to be done rather than roll back the reforms so far discussed .
" the labor market reform course of the last few years has not progressed , " the institutes added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us housing market crisis had a knock-on effect the report comes as economists attempt to size up the ramifications of the shakeout in global share prices in august following the credit crunch triggered by the us housing market crisis .
at the same time , the institutes joined a growing list of forecasters who have revised down their growth outlook for germany .
high oil prices , the strong euro and financial market uncertainty will " dampen growth , " roland döhrn , an economist with the essen-based institute for scientific research -lrb- rwi -rrb- , told a press conference following the release of the report .
in their last report in the spring , the institutes projected a growth rate for germany of 2.4 percent in both 2007 and 2008 , with strong export demand powering the nation 's economic performance .
export growth likely to decline since then , however , the euro has climbed to an all-time high of $ 1.43 as fears have set in about the us economic outlook , consequently fuelling concerns about the prospects for germany 's key export machine .
the institutes predict german export growth will decline to 3 percent in 2008 from 3.5 percent this year , with stronger private consumption emerging as a key pillar of growth .
the institutes are also forecasting private consumption to grow by 1.5 percent next year compared to just 0.2 percent in 2007 .
the release of the institutes ' report is expected to lead to the german government also scaling back its growth projections for the nation .
germany emerged last year from a protracted period of stagnation , with a recent solid growth rate helping to ease the nation 's high unemployment .
larger reduction in unemployment that expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german unemployment dropped in september the number of people out of work in germany fell more than expected in september , data released last month showed , with employers continuing to hire on the back of the economic upswing and years of wage restraint .
the institutes expect unemployment to continue falling to average 7.9 percent in 2008 compared to 8.7 percent in 2007 .
germany 's jobless rate stood at 10.3 percent last year .
apart from the rwi , the german institutes involved in drawing up the report included the kiel institute for the world economy -lrb- ifw -rrb- , halle institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- and the munich- based ifo institute for economic research . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some economists are more pessimistic and believe germany will be lucky to reach a growth rate next year of 2 percent .
the international monetary fund said this week it expects german growth will slip to 2 percent next year from 2.4 percent for 2007 .
thursday 's report was drawn up by four leading german economic institutes in conjunction with research groups from other european nations .
criticism of ineffective reforms coming in the wake of criticism by german business about the failure of angela merkel 's government coalition to press on with economic reform , the institutes said : " much more additional work needs to be done rather than roll back the reforms so far discussed .
" the labor market reform course of the last few years has not progressed , " the institutes added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us housing market crisis had a knock-on effect the report comes as economists attempt to size up the ramifications of the shakeout in global share prices in august following the credit crunch triggered by the us housing market crisis .
at the same time , the institutes joined a growing list of forecasters who have revised down their growth outlook for germany .
high oil prices , the strong euro and financial market uncertainty will " dampen growth , " roland döhrn , an economist with the essen-based institute for scientific research -lrb- rwi -rrb- , told a press conference following the release of the report .
in their last report in the spring , the institutes projected a growth rate for germany of 2.4 percent in both 2007 and 2008 , with strong export demand powering the nation 's economic performance .
export growth likely to decline since then , however , the euro has climbed to an all-time high of $ 1.43 as fears have set in about the us economic outlook , consequently fuelling concerns about the prospects for germany 's key export machine .
the institutes predict german export growth will decline to 3 percent in 2008 from 3.5 percent this year , with stronger private consumption emerging as a key pillar of growth .
the institutes are also forecasting private consumption to grow by 1.5 percent next year compared to just 0.2 percent in 2007 .
the release of the institutes ' report is expected to lead to the german government also scaling back its growth projections for the nation .
germany emerged last year from a protracted period of stagnation , with a recent solid growth rate helping to ease the nation 's high unemployment .
larger reduction in unemployment that expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german unemployment dropped in september the number of people out of work in germany fell more than expected in september , data released last month showed , with employers continuing to hire on the back of the economic upswing and years of wage restraint .
the institutes expect unemployment to continue falling to average 7.9 percent in 2008 compared to 8.7 percent in 2007 .
germany 's jobless rate stood at 10.3 percent last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the eu treaty - a blueprint for europe 's future ?
hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 the european treaty : frequently asked questions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu be hanging out the decorations in celebration of the treaty come december ?
the european treaty has loomed large on the horizon of the eu political landscape for the past few weeks as eu leaders prepare to agree on the its final text on oct .
18-19 . this week 's eu summit in lisbon is an informal meeting for heads of state to see the results of legal work carried out on the european treaty over the autumn .
if the reformed treaty text is approved it will then go forward to a formal heads of state meeting in brussels in december .
if the treat receives the leaders ' approval again it will then be sent for ratification by all 27 eu member states . but what is the european treaty and what is all the fuss about ?
dw-world.de answers some of the most pertinent questions . what is the european reform treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution has made way for the treaty after the failure of its forerunner , the european constitution , which was rejected in 2005 by voters in france and the netherlands , the european reform treaty was conceived as an alternative series of amendments to two existing eu treaties , the treaty on the european union -lrb- maastricht -rrb- and the treaty establishing the european community -lrb- rome -rrb- . the idea is that the reform treaty will be a blueprint for running the expanded european union more efficiently .
the reform treaty was presented to the eu leaders in brussels in july by the portuguese presidency , after an initial hard-fought agreement on its text was hammered out in under berlin 's leadership in june . what will the european reform treaty do ? the eu leaders will decide on the final draft for the european reform treaty in lisbon on oct .
18-19 and so the precise wording of the treaty has yet to be agreed .
however , the document is expected to include the following : create the role of european president this is one of the most controversial proposals as the idea was initially opposed by smaller eu nations but was forced through by the larger member states .
the presidential role has official backing but opposition and resentment remain .
the president would serve a two-and-a half-year term , replacing the current system of a rotating six-month presidency , and will not be allowed to serve more than two terms . create the role of eu high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy essentially the eu 's foreign minister -lrb- as proposed in the constitution -rrb- , this role will combine the posts of current foreign affairs chief javier solana , and the external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and will be the eu 's point person for world affairs .
reduce the size of the european commission just as the european parliament recently announced that the number of parliamentarians would be capped at 750 regardless of new countries joining the bloc , the eu commission will reduce the number of its commissioners .
there will be fewer commissioners than member states by 2014 , with only two-thirds of countries supplying a commissioner on a rotational basis . redistribute voting weights among member states this is another controversial aspect that has had many member states , particularly poland and britain , up in arms .
the treaty intends to introduce majority voting , which will allow votes to be carried on a 55 percent majority as long as that majority also represent 65 percent of the european population .
this would be phased in between 2014 and 2017 . give new powers to the european commission , european parliament and european court of justice , in areas such as justice and domestic affairs remove the national veto in a number of areas is the reform treaty just the failed european constitution under a different name ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french , along with the dutch , gave a resounding " non " originally , the reform treaty was described as having " no constitutional characteristics , " but investigations by a number of international analysis groups have noted that only two of the 440 provisions in the reform treaty differ from the original constitution .
the constitution 's references to european flags and anthems , which proved unpopular with voters , have been left out .
however , the existing flag , anthem and european motto - " united in diversity " - will remain . the role of european foreign minister included in the constitution text has also been replaced by the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , and the use of the term " european laws " has been dropped in favor of " european regulations . " what is likely to happen in lisbon and in the future ? the representatives from the 27 eu member states are expected to agree on the final text of the treaty in lisbon and then sign off on the treaty at a summit of european leaders in brussels in december .
much like the process used for the doomed constitution , the treaty will then have to be ratified by all the eu 's member states .
if this is completed , the treaty will come into force in 2009 . ratification was the process that spelled the end of the constitution .
some countries chose to put the constitution to the people in a referendum .
it was killed off by two " no " votes , from france and the netherlands .
to avoid this , most countries are expected to leave the ratification of the treaty to their parliaments , who are expected to back the deal . however , ireland plans to hold a referendum , the danes want one too and so do quite a few dutch , despite their government taking a huge risk by holding out against the will of the people .
the british government promised a referendum on the constitution but never got the chance to hold one as the french and dutch votes made it unnecessary . what could go wrong ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things may not be so clear if some nations cause trouble for the treaty to come into being , all the decisions surrounding it have to be unanimous .
there are a number of wrenches that could potentially end up in the works , specifically those lobbed in from poland and the uk . poland is threatening to block the treaty unless it includes an agreement - known as the ioannina compromise - to allow countries to defer unpalatable decisions that have been agreed by a narrow majority . the british have a number of " red lines " regarding issues of sovereignty in which the uk has an opt-out clause .
the exceptions were agreed to principle in discussions under german leadership in june .
however , britain could pull the treaty plug if the legal work carried out on the treaty text since june adapts or removes any of these " red lines . " while these two offer the greatest threats to the treaty , the most bizarre arguably comes from bulgaria .
sofia is threatening to derail the treaty over the spelling of euro currency , which it insists should be " evro " in its cyrillic alphabet . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives after months of political skirmishes , eu leaders are expected to clinch a long-awaited deal on the european reform treaty , a document many claim will make the eu more efficient and give it more credibility .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 18.10.2007 us official : missile shield plans for europe dependent on iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the iranian nuclear threat recedes , the us could rethink its defense shield plans for europe the future of bases for the proposed us missile shield in europe is dependent on whether iran gives up its controversial uranium enrichment program , a senior us state department official suggested . assistant secretary of state daniel fried told reporters in brussels on wednesday , oct .
17 , after meeting with nato and russian officials that washington 's missile shield plans could be changed should iran suspend its nuclear program .
the shield is " intended against the major problem we see developing , which is iran , and if that problem went away or attenuated we would obviously draw conclusions , " said fried .
" this is a threat-based system , and we would be affected if iran gave up its -lsb- uranium -rsb- enrichment and worked with the international community , and had a different approach to things . "
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own defenses .
shield plans could slow down under " right conditions " while fried ruled out any immediate halt , he did suggest that the development of the shield might slow down under the right conditions .
" our position is that our negotiations with the poles and the czechs will continue , but we do n't feel the need to spend money at quite as fast a rate for a threat that is attenuated , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fried assured russia that it was not a target fried also reiterated that the defense shield was needed to guard against threats from " rogue states " like iran or north korea and assured russia once again that it was not a target .
" our real concern is not russia , " he said .
" we are advancing a missile defense program in response to what we see as an iranian ballistic missile and nuclear weapons threat .
" we want -lsb- russia 's -rsb- help , and the help of all responsible nations , to work with iran so this problem is attenuated and goes away , " fried said and added that us officials had explained their stance on iran to the russians , and that " they seemed interested in the concept . "
polish election could affect us relations another factor which may force washington 's hand in adapting its plan for european bases is poland 's parliamentary election on sunday .
poland 's ties with the united states , its cooperation on the defense shield and the presence of polish troops in iraq could all change if prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski loses power .
the centrist civic platform party , the main opposition to kaczynski 's ruling conservatives , is mounting a strong challenge to the current leadership and is gaining support through its leader donald tusk 's assertions that a government under his authority would not want so close a relationship with washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister kaczynski faces a challenge in the polls surveys show most poles want their troops out of iraq and oppose the missile shield .
recent events , including an attack on the polish ambassador in iraq last week , have brought these topics and poland 's foreign policy as a whole to the forefront of the civic platform party 's agenda .
prime minister kaczynski and his twin brother lech , the polish president , have put close ties with the us at the center of poland 's foreign policy alongside a distrust of the eu .
since coming to power in 2005 , the brothers have maintained the country 's military presence in iraq , increased polish forces in afghanistan and have all but pledged to host the anti-missile shield . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , after meeting with nato and russian officials that washington 's missile shield plans could be changed should iran suspend its nuclear program .
the shield is " intended against the major problem we see developing , which is iran , and if that problem went away or attenuated we would obviously draw conclusions , " said fried .
" this is a threat-based system , and we would be affected if iran gave up its -lsb- uranium -rsb- enrichment and worked with the international community , and had a different approach to things . "
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own defenses .
shield plans could slow down under " right conditions " while fried ruled out any immediate halt , he did suggest that the development of the shield might slow down under the right conditions .
" our position is that our negotiations with the poles and the czechs will continue , but we do n't feel the need to spend money at quite as fast a rate for a threat that is attenuated , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fried assured russia that it was not a target fried also reiterated that the defense shield was needed to guard against threats from " rogue states " like iran or north korea and assured russia once again that it was not a target .

currently in berlin , he took time off from writing to discuss his latest work and what 's going wrong in both of his home countries . with his 2003 debut " the russian debutante 's handbook " and the follow-up " absurdistan " from 2006 , gary shteyngart established his credentials as one of the english language 's best young writers and a satirist with a talent for highlighting the absurdities of both the east and the west after the cold war .
now he 's trying something a bit different .
dw-world.de : your books have been read and marketed as part of a new immigrant literature in the us , but they 're not at all earnest or politically correct .
why is that ?
gary shteyngart : well , first of all , because i was very unlucky and got sent to this horrible hebrew school .
if it was n't for those eight years being told by rabbis that the holocaust happened because i ate a piece of pork salami , i do n't think you would have had books like " absurdistan . "
that took away any sense i might have had about anything being sacred .
unless you were an idiot , you could see from a mile away that a lot of things were just plain stupid and very coercive .
then i went to a really great high school in manhattan that was a true melting pot , a holding pen for multinational nerds .
it was a place where chinese , russian and indian people gathered together , and it was a real free-for-all .
then i went to oberlin college , and that was the final straw .
from the moment i got there i just wanted to make fun of it .
the first week i was there , i got chewed out for calling some a freshman instead of a " fresh person , " and there was a professor who had devoted his life to translating brezhnev 's works into yiddish .
so that was maybe the best part of my education since it gave me such wonderful targets to go after .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of " absurdistan " is called " snack daddy 's adventurous trip " you 're working on a new book as a fellow of the american academy here in berlin .
what 's the novel about ?
it 's the first book i 've set almost entirely in america , and it takes place - god help me because the phrase " speculative fiction " makes my skin crawl - in the near future .
it follows the love affair of two immigrants , as america slowly disintegrates .
new york and los angeles have become two heavily guarded areas , or what i call " cooperative exclusion zones . "
a small group of rich shareholders achieve immortality , while the vast majority of the population loses the ability to speak , read and write in english .
and that 's what happens to one of the two lovers .
that 's very different from your first two books , which feature unscrupulous us-immigrant protagonists forced to go back to an absurd , violent and materialistic eastern europe .
one sets up a pyramid scheme in prague , while the other tries to procure a fake passport amidst a halliburton-sponsored war in the caucasus .
why the change in the emphasis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of eastern european oil is a shteyngart speciality well , i ca n't do the same story over and over again .
the first book , " the russian debutante 's handbook , " dealt with the rise of turbo-capitalism in eastern europe , and the second , " absurdistan , " took that further by bringing in us foreign policy , specifically the politics of the oil industry .
the third one deals with the fact that we in the us have become " absurdistan " in some respects , for instance , in our approach to human rights issues , privacy and upholding the constitution .
one of the worst outcomes of 9/11 is that many of the people who traditionally came to america are now having second thoughts about that .
i also wanted to write about the baby boomers ' inability to come to terms with their own mortality .
and lastly , this book features a love affair that runs from page one to page 350 or whatever .
i 've never done that before .
why come to berlin if the book is set almost entirely in america ?
i work a lot better off-shore , so to speak , than in america .
there 's something about being in countries where i do n't speak the language .
most of " absurdistan " was written in italy .
and i 'm working much faster here than i ever have before .
like in new york , there 's both an excitement and a gloom about the city , but what interests me is that , unlike new york , there 's a real collision of east and west here .
to think that we 're only an hour and a half from poland here is really amazing .
what do you think then about the latest developments in eastern europe , in particular vladimir putin 's russia ?
some of them resemble the fictional scenarios you created in " absurdistan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shteyngart says both bush and putin have betrayed the ideals of democracy i began writing that book before 9/11 and before halliburton got so involved in iraq .
but i was observing events in azerbaijan and georgia , and the path looked very clear .
in the book i 'm writing now , russia is called " petro-state russia . "
and that 's exactly what russia is - a state run on the profits of natural gas , oil and a couple of other commodities .
putin has done it .
there 's a chance that there will be no opposition parties whatsoever in the next russian election .
there 's not even a pretense of democracy .
basically , putin can have power for life if he wants it .
he can just say : " now i 'm going to be the president , now i 'm going to be the prime minister . "
he 'll just take the power with him from office to office like a traveling bag .
the country has sold out any ideals of democracy it ever had for the idea some sort of stability .
and there 's a huge gap between rich and poor - in my third book , i 'm calling that up and bringing it back to america .
it does n't sound as though you have high hopes for either russia or the us .
i was brought up between these two empires , one of which died and the other of which is dying in its own way .
as far as russia goes , there 's a restaurant in st. petersburg that 's called " 1913 , " which is known as the only good year in russian history .
it 's an autocratic country with an autocratic tradition and an autocratic church .
with america , i feel very much an american these days , because something i love is being destroyed .
for those of us who were displaced at an early age , america was always the place to go to , and the worst result of 9/11 would be that it stops being that . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

currently in berlin , he took time off from writing to discuss his latest work and what 's going wrong in both of his home countries . with his 2003 debut " the russian debutante 's handbook " and the follow-up " absurdistan " from 2006 , gary shteyngart established his credentials as one of the english language 's best young writers and a satirist with a talent for highlighting the absurdities of both the east and the west after the cold war .
now he 's trying something a bit different .
dw-world.de : your books have been read and marketed as part of a new immigrant literature in the us , but they 're not at all earnest or politically correct .
why is that ?
gary shteyngart : well , first of all , because i was very unlucky and got sent to this horrible hebrew school .
if it was n't for those eight years being told by rabbis that the holocaust happened because i ate a piece of pork salami , i do n't think you would have had books like " absurdistan . "
that took away any sense i might have had about anything being sacred .
unless you were an idiot , you could see from a mile away that a lot of things were just plain stupid and very coercive .
then i went to a really great high school in manhattan that was a true melting pot , a holding pen for multinational nerds .
it was a place where chinese , russian and indian people gathered together , and it was a real free-for-all .
then i went to oberlin college , and that was the final straw .
from the moment i got there i just wanted to make fun of it .
the first week i was there , i got chewed out for calling some a freshman instead of a " fresh person , " and there was a professor who had devoted his life to translating brezhnev 's works into yiddish .
so that was maybe the best part of my education since it gave me such wonderful targets to go after .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of " absurdistan " is called " snack daddy 's adventurous trip " you 're working on a new book as a fellow of the american academy here in berlin .
what 's the novel about ?
it 's the first book i 've set almost entirely in america , and it takes place - god help me because the phrase " speculative fiction " makes my skin crawl - in the near future .
it follows the love affair of two immigrants , as america slowly disintegrates .
new york and los angeles have become two heavily guarded areas , or what i call " cooperative exclusion zones . "
a small group of rich shareholders achieve immortality , while the vast majority of the population loses the ability to speak , read and write in english .
and that 's what happens to one of the two lovers .
that 's very different from your first two books , which feature unscrupulous us-immigrant protagonists forced to go back to an absurd , violent and materialistic eastern europe .
one sets up a pyramid scheme in prague , while the other tries to procure a fake passport amidst a halliburton-sponsored war in the caucasus .
why the change in the emphasis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of eastern european oil is a shteyngart speciality well , i ca n't do the same story over and over again .
the first book , " the russian debutante 's handbook , " dealt with the rise of turbo-capitalism in eastern europe , and the second , " absurdistan , " took that further by bringing in us foreign policy , specifically the politics of the oil industry .
the third one deals with the fact that we in the us have become " absurdistan " in some respects , for instance , in our approach to human rights issues , privacy and upholding the constitution .
one of the worst outcomes of 9/11 is that many of the people who traditionally came to america are now having second thoughts about that .
i also wanted to write about the baby boomers ' inability to come to terms with their own mortality .
and lastly , this book features a love affair that runs from page one to page 350 or whatever .
i 've never done that before .
why come to berlin if the book is set almost entirely in america ?
i work a lot better off-shore , so to speak , than in america .
there 's something about being in countries where i do n't speak the language .
most of " absurdistan " was written in italy .
and i 'm working much faster here than i ever have before .
like in new york , there 's both an excitement and a gloom about the city , but what interests me is that , unlike new york , there 's a real collision of east and west here .
to think that we 're only an hour and a half from poland here is really amazing .
what do you think then about the latest developments in eastern europe , in particular vladimir putin 's russia ?
some of them resemble the fictional scenarios you created in " absurdistan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shteyngart says both bush and putin have betrayed the ideals of democracy i began writing that book before 9/11 and before halliburton got so involved in iraq .
but i was observing events in azerbaijan and georgia , and the path looked very clear .
in the book i 'm writing now , russia is called " petro-state russia . "
and that 's exactly what russia is - a state run on the profits of natural gas , oil and a couple of other commodities .
putin has done it .
there 's a chance that there will be no opposition parties whatsoever in the next russian election .
there 's not even a pretense of democracy .
basically , putin can have power for life if he wants it .
he can just say : " now i 'm going to be the president , now i 'm going to be the prime minister . "
he 'll just take the power with him from office to office like a traveling bag .
the country has sold out any ideals of democracy it ever had for the idea some sort of stability .
and there 's a huge gap between rich and poor - in my third book , i 'm calling that up and bringing it back to america .
it does n't sound as though you have high hopes for either russia or the us .
i was brought up between these two empires , one of which died and the other of which is dying in its own way .
as far as russia goes , there 's a restaurant in st. petersburg that 's called " 1913 , " which is known as the only good year in russian history .
it 's an autocratic country with an autocratic tradition and an autocratic church .
with america , i feel very much an american these days , because something i love is being destroyed .
for those of us who were displaced at an early age , america was always the place to go to , and the worst result of 9/11 would be that it stops being that . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon the european treaty : frequently asked questions reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's kaczynski brothers want more power for the ioannina delaying tactic poland is a big fan , although it wants it to go further , and yet it has only been invoked once to resolve a dispute over sardines .
what exactly is the ioannina compromise and why is it so important to the eu treaty ? the so-called " ioannina compromise " is one of the most talked-about and perhaps least well-understood issues relating to the ongoing reform treaty negotiations .
the term was coined after an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers which took place in ioannina , a greek city north of athens , in 1994 .
broadly speaking , the ioannina compromise is a gentlemen 's agreement , a time-out or emergency break designed to reassure individual member states who fear fellow eu members may cut deals which they strongly dislike .
ioannina gives countries a pause to find a solution in essence , if a country feels that its vital interests are threatened but can not muster a blocking minority , the decision is delayed while attempts to find a satisfactory solution are made .
the ioannina mechanism was first proposed when foreign ministers from the then 15-member union were called to discuss how voting rules should change if norway joined the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the initial compromise was lost when the eu signed nice at the meeting , ministers agreed that if eu members wished to oppose a measure but could not muster enough support to block it , they could ask the bloc 's council of member states to do " all within its power , within a reasonable space of time , to reach a satisfactory solution " that would be acceptable to a qualified majority .
norway eventually decided not to join the union , and the " gentlemen 's agreement " remained little more than a curious appendix to the eu decision-making process .
it was superseded by the nice treaty of 2000 , which established new voting rules for the eu ahead of the entry in 2004 of 10 new member states .
poland 's fight over voting rights resurrects ioannina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels agreed on a draft inclusion for the compromise but one of those newcomers - poland - fought hard to resurrect it this year during bitter negotiations over national voting rights in the reform treaty .
and in a bid to find a satisfactory compromise , the then german presidency of the eu in june included a reference to ioannina in an annex of the treaty .
according to the draft agreed last june in brussels , the eu council is forced to freeze decisions if : " -lrb- a -rrb- at least three quarters of the population , or -lrb- b -rrb- at least three quarters of the number of member states necessary to constitute a blocking minority ... indicate their opposition to the council adopting an act by a qualified majority . "
the annex does not place any formal time limits , saying that member states should spend " a reasonable time " looking for an acceptable solution .
kaczynskis want more time and legal framework but poland is campaigning for a " reinforced " ioannina mechanism and argues that two years constitutes a " reasonable time . "
moreover , poland wants the council to make an official decision on ioannina in lisbon and make it legally binding in some form or other .
because the council normally tries to reach decisions by consensus , the original ioannina compromise has been rarely invoked .
experts say there was only one unsuccessful attempt to use it during its limited lifespan : a case involving portuguese sardines . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon the european treaty : frequently asked questions reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's kaczynski brothers want more power for the ioannina delaying tactic poland is a big fan , although it wants it to go further , and yet it has only been invoked once to resolve a dispute over sardines .
what exactly is the ioannina compromise and why is it so important to the eu treaty ? the so-called " ioannina compromise " is one of the most talked-about and perhaps least well-understood issues relating to the ongoing reform treaty negotiations .
the term was coined after an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers which took place in ioannina , a greek city north of athens , in 1994 .
broadly speaking , the ioannina compromise is a gentlemen 's agreement , a time-out or emergency break designed to reassure individual member states who fear fellow eu members may cut deals which they strongly dislike .
ioannina gives countries a pause to find a solution in essence , if a country feels that its vital interests are threatened but can not muster a blocking minority , the decision is delayed while attempts to find a satisfactory solution are made .
the ioannina mechanism was first proposed when foreign ministers from the then 15-member union were called to discuss how voting rules should change if norway joined the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the initial compromise was lost when the eu signed nice at the meeting , ministers agreed that if eu members wished to oppose a measure but could not muster enough support to block it , they could ask the bloc 's council of member states to do " all within its power , within a reasonable space of time , to reach a satisfactory solution " that would be acceptable to a qualified majority .
norway eventually decided not to join the union , and the " gentlemen 's agreement " remained little more than a curious appendix to the eu decision-making process .
it was superseded by the nice treaty of 2000 , which established new voting rules for the eu ahead of the entry in 2004 of 10 new member states .
poland 's fight over voting rights resurrects ioannina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels agreed on a draft inclusion for the compromise but one of those newcomers - poland - fought hard to resurrect it this year during bitter negotiations over national voting rights in the reform treaty .
and in a bid to find a satisfactory compromise , the then german presidency of the eu in june included a reference to ioannina in an annex of the treaty .
according to the draft agreed last june in brussels , the eu council is forced to freeze decisions if : " -lrb- a -rrb- at least three quarters of the population , or -lrb- b -rrb- at least three quarters of the number of member states necessary to constitute a blocking minority ... indicate their opposition to the council adopting an act by a qualified majority . "
the annex does not place any formal time limits , saying that member states should spend " a reasonable time " looking for an acceptable solution .
kaczynskis want more time and legal framework but poland is campaigning for a " reinforced " ioannina mechanism and argues that two years constitutes a " reasonable time . "
moreover , poland wants the council to make an official decision on ioannina in lisbon and make it legally binding in some form or other .
because the council normally tries to reach decisions by consensus , the original ioannina compromise has been rarely invoked .
experts say there was only one unsuccessful attempt to use it during its limited lifespan : a case involving portuguese sardines . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 the european treaty : frequently asked questions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu be hanging out the decorations in celebration of the treaty come december ?
the european treaty has loomed large on the horizon of the eu political landscape for the past few weeks as eu leaders prepare to agree on the its final text on oct .
18-19 . this week 's eu summit in lisbon is an informal meeting for heads of state to see the results of legal work carried out on the european treaty over the autumn .
if the reformed treaty text is approved it will then go forward to a formal heads of state meeting in brussels in december .
if the treat receives the leaders ' approval again it will then be sent for ratification by all 27 eu member states . but what is the european treaty and what is all the fuss about ?
dw-world.de answers some of the most pertinent questions . what is the european reform treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution has made way for the treaty after the failure of its forerunner , the european constitution , which was rejected in 2005 by voters in france and the netherlands , the european reform treaty was conceived as an alternative series of amendments to two existing eu treaties , the treaty on the european union -lrb- maastricht -rrb- and the treaty establishing the european community -lrb- rome -rrb- . the idea is that the reform treaty will be a blueprint for running the expanded european union more efficiently .
the reform treaty was presented to the eu leaders in brussels in july by the portuguese presidency , after an initial hard-fought agreement on its text was hammered out in under berlin 's leadership in june . what will the european reform treaty do ? the eu leaders will decide on the final draft for the european reform treaty in lisbon on oct .
18-19 and so the precise wording of the treaty has yet to be agreed .
however , the document is expected to include the following : create the role of european president this is one of the most controversial proposals as the idea was initially opposed by smaller eu nations but was forced through by the larger member states .
the presidential role has official backing but opposition and resentment remain .
the president would serve a two-and-a half-year term , replacing the current system of a rotating six-month presidency , and will not be allowed to serve more than two terms . create the role of eu high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy essentially the eu 's foreign minister -lrb- as proposed in the constitution -rrb- , this role will combine the posts of current foreign affairs chief javier solana , and the external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and will be the eu 's point person for world affairs .
reduce the size of the european commission just as the european parliament recently announced that the number of parliamentarians would be capped at 750 regardless of new countries joining the bloc , the eu commission will reduce the number of its commissioners .
there will be fewer commissioners than member states by 2014 , with only two-thirds of countries supplying a commissioner on a rotational basis . redistribute voting weights among member states this is another controversial aspect that has had many member states , particularly poland and britain , up in arms .
the treaty intends to introduce majority voting , which will allow votes to be carried on a 55 percent majority as long as that majority also represent 65 percent of the european population .
this would be phased in between 2014 and 2017 . give new powers to the european commission , european parliament and european court of justice , in areas such as justice and domestic affairs remove the national veto in a number of areas is the reform treaty just the failed european constitution under a different name ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french , along with the dutch , gave a resounding " non " originally , the reform treaty was described as having " no constitutional characteristics , " but investigations by a number of international analysis groups have noted that only two of the 440 provisions in the reform treaty differ from the original constitution .
the constitution 's references to european flags and anthems , which proved unpopular with voters , have been left out .
however , the existing flag , anthem and european motto - " united in diversity " - will remain . the role of european foreign minister included in the constitution text has also been replaced by the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , and the use of the term " european laws " has been dropped in favor of " european regulations . " what is likely to happen in lisbon and in the future ? the representatives from the 27 eu member states are expected to agree on the final text of the treaty in lisbon and then sign off on the treaty at a summit of european leaders in brussels in december .
much like the process used for the doomed constitution , the treaty will then have to be ratified by all the eu 's member states .
if this is completed , the treaty will come into force in 2009 . ratification was the process that spelled the end of the constitution .
some countries chose to put the constitution to the people in a referendum .
it was killed off by two " no " votes , from france and the netherlands .
to avoid this , most countries are expected to leave the ratification of the treaty to their parliaments , who are expected to back the deal . however , ireland plans to hold a referendum , the danes want one too and so do quite a few dutch , despite their government taking a huge risk by holding out against the will of the people .
the british government promised a referendum on the constitution but never got the chance to hold one as the french and dutch votes made it unnecessary . what could go wrong ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things may not be so clear if some nations cause trouble for the treaty to come into being , all the decisions surrounding it have to be unanimous .
there are a number of wrenches that could potentially end up in the works , specifically those lobbed in from poland and the uk . poland is threatening to block the treaty unless it includes an agreement - known as the ioannina compromise - to allow countries to defer unpalatable decisions that have been agreed by a narrow majority . the british have a number of " red lines " regarding issues of sovereignty in which the uk has an opt-out clause .
the exceptions were agreed to principle in discussions under german leadership in june .
however , britain could pull the treaty plug if the legal work carried out on the treaty text since june adapts or removes any of these " red lines . " while these two offer the greatest threats to the treaty , the most bizarre arguably comes from bulgaria .

hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 the european treaty : frequently asked questions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu be hanging out the decorations in celebration of the treaty come december ?
the european treaty has loomed large on the horizon of the eu political landscape for the past few weeks as eu leaders prepare to agree on the its final text on oct .
18-19 . this week 's eu summit in lisbon is an informal meeting for heads of state to see the results of legal work carried out on the european treaty over the autumn .
if the reformed treaty text is approved it will then go forward to a formal heads of state meeting in brussels in december .
if the treat receives the leaders ' approval again it will then be sent for ratification by all 27 eu member states . but what is the european treaty and what is all the fuss about ?
dw-world.de answers some of the most pertinent questions . what is the european reform treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution has made way for the treaty after the failure of its forerunner , the european constitution , which was rejected in 2005 by voters in france and the netherlands , the european reform treaty was conceived as an alternative series of amendments to two existing eu treaties , the treaty on the european union -lrb- maastricht -rrb- and the treaty establishing the european community -lrb- rome -rrb- . the idea is that the reform treaty will be a blueprint for running the expanded european union more efficiently .
the reform treaty was presented to the eu leaders in brussels in july by the portuguese presidency , after an initial hard-fought agreement on its text was hammered out in under berlin 's leadership in june . what will the european reform treaty do ? the eu leaders will decide on the final draft for the european reform treaty in lisbon on oct .
18-19 and so the precise wording of the treaty has yet to be agreed .
however , the document is expected to include the following : create the role of european president this is one of the most controversial proposals as the idea was initially opposed by smaller eu nations but was forced through by the larger member states .
the presidential role has official backing but opposition and resentment remain .
the president would serve a two-and-a half-year term , replacing the current system of a rotating six-month presidency , and will not be allowed to serve more than two terms . create the role of eu high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy essentially the eu 's foreign minister -lrb- as proposed in the constitution -rrb- , this role will combine the posts of current foreign affairs chief javier solana , and the external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and will be the eu 's point person for world affairs .
reduce the size of the european commission just as the european parliament recently announced that the number of parliamentarians would be capped at 750 regardless of new countries joining the bloc , the eu commission will reduce the number of its commissioners .
there will be fewer commissioners than member states by 2014 , with only two-thirds of countries supplying a commissioner on a rotational basis . redistribute voting weights among member states this is another controversial aspect that has had many member states , particularly poland and britain , up in arms .
the treaty intends to introduce majority voting , which will allow votes to be carried on a 55 percent majority as long as that majority also represent 65 percent of the european population .
this would be phased in between 2014 and 2017 . give new powers to the european commission , european parliament and european court of justice , in areas such as justice and domestic affairs remove the national veto in a number of areas is the reform treaty just the failed european constitution under a different name ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french , along with the dutch , gave a resounding " non " originally , the reform treaty was described as having " no constitutional characteristics , " but investigations by a number of international analysis groups have noted that only two of the 440 provisions in the reform treaty differ from the original constitution .
the constitution 's references to european flags and anthems , which proved unpopular with voters , have been left out .
however , the existing flag , anthem and european motto - " united in diversity " - will remain . the role of european foreign minister included in the constitution text has also been replaced by the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , and the use of the term " european laws " has been dropped in favor of " european regulations . " what is likely to happen in lisbon and in the future ? the representatives from the 27 eu member states are expected to agree on the final text of the treaty in lisbon and then sign off on the treaty at a summit of european leaders in brussels in december .
much like the process used for the doomed constitution , the treaty will then have to be ratified by all the eu 's member states .
if this is completed , the treaty will come into force in 2009 . ratification was the process that spelled the end of the constitution .
some countries chose to put the constitution to the people in a referendum .
it was killed off by two " no " votes , from france and the netherlands .
to avoid this , most countries are expected to leave the ratification of the treaty to their parliaments , who are expected to back the deal . however , ireland plans to hold a referendum , the danes want one too and so do quite a few dutch , despite their government taking a huge risk by holding out against the will of the people .
the british government promised a referendum on the constitution but never got the chance to hold one as the french and dutch votes made it unnecessary . what could go wrong ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things may not be so clear if some nations cause trouble for the treaty to come into being , all the decisions surrounding it have to be unanimous .
there are a number of wrenches that could potentially end up in the works , specifically those lobbed in from poland and the uk . poland is threatening to block the treaty unless it includes an agreement - known as the ioannina compromise - to allow countries to defer unpalatable decisions that have been agreed by a narrow majority . the british have a number of " red lines " regarding issues of sovereignty in which the uk has an opt-out clause .
the exceptions were agreed to principle in discussions under german leadership in june .
however , britain could pull the treaty plug if the legal work carried out on the treaty text since june adapts or removes any of these " red lines . " while these two offer the greatest threats to the treaty , the most bizarre arguably comes from bulgaria .
sofia is threatening to derail the treaty over the spelling of euro currency , which it insists should be " evro " in its cyrillic alphabet . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a leading jewish organization called the findings " ugly , disastrous and sad . " a popular german talk show host was recently fired for praising hitler 's family policies . the nazis encouraged women to stay at home , look after their husbands , and produce and rear children .
the incident has sparked a debate in germany over whether it is acceptable to say anything positive about the nazis , 62 years after the end of world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva herman got fired for her comments a recent poll shows that a quarter of germans agree that nazi rule had some positive aspects .
the weekly stern magazine commissioned the forsa agency to conduct the poll after talk show host eva herman was fired from germany 's ndr public broadcaster last month for her comments on the third reich and motherhood .
pollsters asked whether national socialism had any good points .
twenty-five percent of the respondents said " yes , " citing the construction of the famous autobahn or network of highways , low unemployment and crime rate and a strong sense of family as examples .
" the insecurity about how to deal with nazism is huge .
as is ignorance .
eva herman has unwittingly kicked off a long-neglected debate , " stern magazine wrote in a cover story .
the poll , released wednesday , oct .
17 , was conducted a week earlier .
poll should be a " warning sign " the poll results have sparked condemnation from the central council of jews in germany .
dieter graumann , vice president of the council , said that the poll should be considered a " warning sign . "
" the result of the poll is ugly , disastrous and makes me sad and angry , " he told the netzeitung online newspaper .
still , he cautioned against " alarmism " and called for more education about the nazi period .

17 , after meeting with nato and russian officials that washington 's missile shield plans could be changed should iran suspend its nuclear program .
the shield is " intended against the major problem we see developing , which is iran , and if that problem went away or attenuated we would obviously draw conclusions , " said fried .
" this is a threat-based system , and we would be affected if iran gave up its -lsb- uranium -rsb- enrichment and worked with the international community , and had a different approach to things . "
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own defenses .
shield plans could slow down under " right conditions " while fried ruled out any immediate halt , he did suggest that the development of the shield might slow down under the right conditions .
" our position is that our negotiations with the poles and the czechs will continue , but we do n't feel the need to spend money at quite as fast a rate for a threat that is attenuated , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fried assured russia that it was not a target fried also reiterated that the defense shield was needed to guard against threats from " rogue states " like iran or north korea and assured russia once again that it was not a target .
" our real concern is not russia , " he said .
" we are advancing a missile defense program in response to what we see as an iranian ballistic missile and nuclear weapons threat .
" we want -lsb- russia 's -rsb- help , and the help of all responsible nations , to work with iran so this problem is attenuated and goes away , " fried said and added that us officials had explained their stance on iran to the russians , and that " they seemed interested in the concept . "
polish election could affect us relations another factor which may force washington 's hand in adapting its plan for european bases is poland 's parliamentary election on sunday .
poland 's ties with the united states , its cooperation on the defense shield and the presence of polish troops in iraq could all change if prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski loses power .
the centrist civic platform party , the main opposition to kaczynski 's ruling conservatives , is mounting a strong challenge to the current leadership and is gaining support through its leader donald tusk 's assertions that a government under his authority would not want so close a relationship with washington .

"
domestic pressures weigh heavily on the leaders of poland , britain and italy as they gather in lisbon for an eu summit which hopes to finalize the charter to reform the bloc 's institutions . as representatives from the 27 eu members states converged on the portuguese capital on thursday , oct .

polish president lech kaczynski is thus insisting that the so-called " ioannina compromise " - a gentlemen 's agreement that allows eu members that can not muster a blocking minority to delay a decision while attempts to find a satisfactory solution are made - to be made legally binding .
polish president reiterates treaty delay threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president kaczynski wants what poland deserves before leaving for lisbon , the president reiterated his threat to delay the charter .
" we do n't want anything more than is our right , " president lech kaczynski told polish radio before leaving for the summit .
asked what would happen if polish demands were not met , kaczynski replied : " we will have to delay the discussion " .
any delay would be a huge blow for the treaty and the eu which has been plagued by in-fighting over the text of this charter and its predecessor , the doomed eu constitution which was derailed by referendums in france and the netherlands in 2005 .
with summits with russia and china on the horizon , the eu would face a crisis of credibility and confidence if it was to meet these powers without an agreement on the treaty behind it .

with public opinion showing huge opposition to any increased eu influence over british domestic politics , prime minister gordon brown will be under pressure to ensure that britain 's toes are not trodden on .
if he feels that the uk is getting a raw deal , brown may delay the treaty to get what he - and the people who will decide his fate at the next general election - wants .
prodi smarting from parliament decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's prodi has not accepted parliament 's decision meanwhile , italy is still smarting from last week 's announcement that the reduction of seats in the european parliament will mean fewer italian representatives , a decision prime minister romano prodi said he was not ready to accept .
while the issue is not directly linked to the treaty , the subject may be included in the agenda for the summit and prodi hinted that he may make it a treaty problem unless italy 's demands on the composition of the future european parliament are met .
" we can not accept a solution ... based on the number of residents rather than citizens because that does not agree with either the spirit or the letter of the new treaty , " prodi said .
the european parliament has adopted a new plan for allocating seats starting with the next legislature -lrb- 2009-14 -rrb- under which for the first time italy would have less meps -lrb- 72 -rrb- than either france -lrb- 74 -rrb- or britain -lrb- 73 -rrb- .
italy has so far refused the plan .
rome argues that it is not the total population resident in each country that should form the basis of the calculation , but rather the number of european citizens .
observers suspect that the unusually tough line taken by prodi , a former eu commission head , has a lot to do with the difficulties his fragile centre-left coalition is facing back home .
notwithstanding the many obstacles , portuguese prime minister jose socrates whose country currently heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency said he 's optimistic of reaching a deal .

domestic pressures weigh heavily on the leaders of poland , britain and italy as they gather in lisbon for an eu summit which hopes to finalize the charter to reform the bloc 's institutions . as representatives from the 27 eu members states converged on the portuguese capital on thursday , oct .

currently in berlin , he took time off from writing to discuss his latest work and what 's going wrong in both of his home countries . with his 2003 debut " the russian debutante 's handbook " and the follow-up " absurdistan " from 2006 , gary shteyngart established his credentials as one of the english language 's best young writers and a satirist with a talent for highlighting the absurdities of both the east and the west after the cold war .
now he 's trying something a bit different .
dw-world.de : your books have been read and marketed as part of a new immigrant literature in the us , but they 're not at all earnest or politically correct .
why is that ?
gary shteyngart : well , first of all , because i was very unlucky and got sent to this horrible hebrew school .
if it was n't for those eight years being told by rabbis that the holocaust happened because i ate a piece of pork salami , i do n't think you would have had books like " absurdistan . "
that took away any sense i might have had about anything being sacred .
unless you were an idiot , you could see from a mile away that a lot of things were just plain stupid and very coercive .
then i went to a really great high school in manhattan that was a true melting pot , a holding pen for multinational nerds .
it was a place where chinese , russian and indian people gathered together , and it was a real free-for-all .
then i went to oberlin college , and that was the final straw .
from the moment i got there i just wanted to make fun of it .
the first week i was there , i got chewed out for calling some a freshman instead of a " fresh person , " and there was a professor who had devoted his life to translating brezhnev 's works into yiddish .
so that was maybe the best part of my education since it gave me such wonderful targets to go after .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of " absurdistan " is called " snack daddy 's adventurous trip " you 're working on a new book as a fellow of the american academy here in berlin .
what 's the novel about ?
it 's the first book i 've set almost entirely in america , and it takes place - god help me because the phrase " speculative fiction " makes my skin crawl - in the near future .
it follows the love affair of two immigrants , as america slowly disintegrates .
new york and los angeles have become two heavily guarded areas , or what i call " cooperative exclusion zones . "
a small group of rich shareholders achieve immortality , while the vast majority of the population loses the ability to speak , read and write in english .
and that 's what happens to one of the two lovers .
that 's very different from your first two books , which feature unscrupulous us-immigrant protagonists forced to go back to an absurd , violent and materialistic eastern europe .
one sets up a pyramid scheme in prague , while the other tries to procure a fake passport amidst a halliburton-sponsored war in the caucasus .
why the change in the emphasis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of eastern european oil is a shteyngart speciality well , i ca n't do the same story over and over again .
the first book , " the russian debutante 's handbook , " dealt with the rise of turbo-capitalism in eastern europe , and the second , " absurdistan , " took that further by bringing in us foreign policy , specifically the politics of the oil industry .
the third one deals with the fact that we in the us have become " absurdistan " in some respects , for instance , in our approach to human rights issues , privacy and upholding the constitution .
one of the worst outcomes of 9/11 is that many of the people who traditionally came to america are now having second thoughts about that .
i also wanted to write about the baby boomers ' inability to come to terms with their own mortality .
and lastly , this book features a love affair that runs from page one to page 350 or whatever .
i 've never done that before .
why come to berlin if the book is set almost entirely in america ?
i work a lot better off-shore , so to speak , than in america .
there 's something about being in countries where i do n't speak the language .
most of " absurdistan " was written in italy .
and i 'm working much faster here than i ever have before .
like in new york , there 's both an excitement and a gloom about the city , but what interests me is that , unlike new york , there 's a real collision of east and west here .
to think that we 're only an hour and a half from poland here is really amazing .
what do you think then about the latest developments in eastern europe , in particular vladimir putin 's russia ?
some of them resemble the fictional scenarios you created in " absurdistan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shteyngart says both bush and putin have betrayed the ideals of democracy i began writing that book before 9/11 and before halliburton got so involved in iraq .
but i was observing events in azerbaijan and georgia , and the path looked very clear .
in the book i 'm writing now , russia is called " petro-state russia . "
and that 's exactly what russia is - a state run on the profits of natural gas , oil and a couple of other commodities .
putin has done it .
there 's a chance that there will be no opposition parties whatsoever in the next russian election .
there 's not even a pretense of democracy .
basically , putin can have power for life if he wants it .
he can just say : " now i 'm going to be the president , now i 'm going to be the prime minister . "
he 'll just take the power with him from office to office like a traveling bag .
the country has sold out any ideals of democracy it ever had for the idea some sort of stability .
and there 's a huge gap between rich and poor - in my third book , i 'm calling that up and bringing it back to america .
it does n't sound as though you have high hopes for either russia or the us .
i was brought up between these two empires , one of which died and the other of which is dying in its own way .
as far as russia goes , there 's a restaurant in st. petersburg that 's called " 1913 , " which is known as the only good year in russian history .
it 's an autocratic country with an autocratic tradition and an autocratic church .
with america , i feel very much an american these days , because something i love is being destroyed .
for those of us who were displaced at an early age , america was always the place to go to , and the worst result of 9/11 would be that it stops being that . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained the european treaty : frequently asked questions the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 eu treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european union edges closer to a treaty that could make it more efficient after months of political skirmishes , eu leaders are expected to clinch a long-awaited deal on the european treaty , a document many claim will make the eu more efficient and give it more credibility . despite the assertions that the eu will finally get a new treaty which will make it easier for the bloc to manage itself , there are still some who harbor reservations .
the two-day informal summit beginning in lisbon on thursday , oct .
18 , will bring the reformed treaty one step closer to a final agreement , with representatives of the 27 eu member states expected to agree on the final text .
but failure is still possible for the document . the issues of a polish request for a mechanism allowing minorities to delay decisions that they do not like to be made legally binding and british demands to be granted an opt-out on european policies in the field of justice and domestic affairs are expected to dominate the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will gordon brown 's " red lines " be responsible for axing the reform treaty ?
however , a number of countries , including austria , britain , denmark and italy , have also expressed concerns - not all of them strictly connected to the treaty 's contents .
with the treaty relying on unanimity to get through to the final stage at a summit in brussels in december , any one country , if dissatisfied , could send the eu planners back to the drawing board .
on the positive side , the treaty has the strong backing of eu heavyweights germany and france , in contrast to the constitution draft that preceded it and was rejected by dutch and french voters in 2005 .
opposition getting quieter and quieter as the lisbon meeting gets closer , fewer and fewer dissenting voices can be heard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski has been more positive of late the czech republic , whose euroskeptic governing coalition had previously warned that the treaty would devolve too much power to brussels , recently described it as " a reasonable compromise . "
even poland , by far the most critical voice , has been scaling down its objections in the run-up to the meeting . " i am convinced it will be a success , " polish president lech kaczynski said ahead of a meeting with german chancellor angela merkel in berlin last friday .
comments of this nature have encouraged diplomats and experts in brussels to become " quietly optimistic " that community spirit will prevail over national interests once leaders gather in the portuguese capital .
eu 's size necessitates reform if a deal is indeed clinched in lisbon , it will represent a key step forward in giving the world 's biggest economic entity a much-needed political boost .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu table creaks under the weight of enlargement eu leaders first realized they would have to improve the bloc 's laborious decision-making process in view of its enlargement to 27 member states at the beginning of the new millennium .
before they can be put in place many decisions in the bloc require unanimity , which has become harder and harder to find in the expanding union .
in december 2001 , eu leaders meeting in laeken , belgium , agreed to set up a convention on the future of the eu chaired by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing .
the convention led to the constitutional treaty , which was signed in october 2004 , only to be ditched after it was given the thumbs-down by referendums held in france and the netherlands a year later .
there followed what came to be known as a " period of reflection , " until the german presidency of the eu , in the first half of 2007 , succeeded in reopening the debate , which ultimately led to the current draft .
shadow on constitution remains despite amendments the treaty under discussion in lisbon drops many of the symbolic references that were included in the proposed constitution , such as an eu flag and anthem , but preserves many of its key elements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jobs of ferrero-waldner -lrb- r . -rrb- and solana -lrb- l . -rrb- will merge these include simplifying the eu 's relations with non-members by creating a single foreign affairs chief and ending the system of a six-month rotating presidency in favor of an elected european council president . the treaty also preserves a complex double-majority rule for council decisions .
proposed eu legislation requiring a qualified majority would have to muster the support of 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's total population of nearly 500 million people . # b # if the draft text is approved , it will have to be formally signed at a ceremony tentatively scheduled for the end of the year and then ratified in all 27 member states before european parliament elections are held in 2009 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 eu opens key treaty talks amid polish , british doubts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the summit produce a " lisbon treaty ? "
domestic pressures weigh heavily on the leaders of poland , britain and italy as they gather in lisbon for an eu summit which hopes to finalize the charter to reform the bloc 's institutions . as representatives from the 27 eu members states converged on the portuguese capital on thursday , oct .
18 , for crunch talks to approve a new treaty , the leaders of poland , italy and britain came armed with issues that could torpedo the charter at the eleventh hour . in poland , where a closely-contested parliamentary election is to take place on sunday , nationalists who support the government want their country to be granted more power to delay eu decisions that it dislikes .
polish president lech kaczynski is thus insisting that the so-called " ioannina compromise " - a gentlemen 's agreement that allows eu members that can not muster a blocking minority to delay a decision while attempts to find a satisfactory solution are made - to be made legally binding .
polish president reiterates treaty delay threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president kaczynski wants what poland deserves before leaving for lisbon , the president reiterated his threat to delay the charter .
" we do n't want anything more than is our right , " president lech kaczynski told polish radio before leaving for the summit .
asked what would happen if polish demands were not met , kaczynski replied : " we will have to delay the discussion " .
any delay would be a huge blow for the treaty and the eu which has been plagued by in-fighting over the text of this charter and its predecessor , the doomed eu constitution which was derailed by referendums in france and the netherlands in 2005 .
with summits with russia and china on the horizon , the eu would face a crisis of credibility and confidence if it was to meet these powers without an agreement on the treaty behind it .
britain 's brown under domestic pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown will halt the treaty talks if need be eurosceptic britain could also throw a spanner in the works if the legal work which has been done on the draft treaty since an initial agreement in berlin in june changes or removes any of the " red lines " - areas of national sovereignty where britain would hold a veto - which the uk had asked to be included .
with public opinion showing huge opposition to any increased eu influence over british domestic politics , prime minister gordon brown will be under pressure to ensure that britain 's toes are not trodden on .
if he feels that the uk is getting a raw deal , brown may delay the treaty to get what he - and the people who will decide his fate at the next general election - wants .
prodi smarting from parliament decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's prodi has not accepted parliament 's decision meanwhile , italy is still smarting from last week 's announcement that the reduction of seats in the european parliament will mean fewer italian representatives , a decision prime minister romano prodi said he was not ready to accept .
while the issue is not directly linked to the treaty , the subject may be included in the agenda for the summit and prodi hinted that he may make it a treaty problem unless italy 's demands on the composition of the future european parliament are met .
" we can not accept a solution ... based on the number of residents rather than citizens because that does not agree with either the spirit or the letter of the new treaty , " prodi said .
the european parliament has adopted a new plan for allocating seats starting with the next legislature -lrb- 2009-14 -rrb- under which for the first time italy would have less meps -lrb- 72 -rrb- than either france -lrb- 74 -rrb- or britain -lrb- 73 -rrb- .
italy has so far refused the plan .
rome argues that it is not the total population resident in each country that should form the basis of the calculation , but rather the number of european citizens .
observers suspect that the unusually tough line taken by prodi , a former eu commission head , has a lot to do with the difficulties his fragile centre-left coalition is facing back home .
notwithstanding the many obstacles , portuguese prime minister jose socrates whose country currently heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency said he 's optimistic of reaching a deal .
" i think we are getting very , very close to a new treaty and this will be called the lisbon treaty , " socrates told reporters ahead of chairing the summit . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , to step up reform and warned that europe 's biggest economy faced slowing growth next year . the institutes told the government in their autumn report presented in berlin on thursday that german growth will slip back to 2.2 percent in 2008 from 2.6 percent this year , with a soaring euro , the global credit crunch and surging oil prices undercutting the nation 's expansion rate .
some economists are more pessimistic and believe germany will be lucky to reach a growth rate next year of 2 percent .
the international monetary fund said this week it expects german growth will slip to 2 percent next year from 2.4 percent for 2007 .
thursday 's report was drawn up by four leading german economic institutes in conjunction with research groups from other european nations .
criticism of ineffective reforms coming in the wake of criticism by german business about the failure of angela merkel 's government coalition to press on with economic reform , the institutes said : " much more additional work needs to be done rather than roll back the reforms so far discussed .
" the labor market reform course of the last few years has not progressed , " the institutes added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us housing market crisis had a knock-on effect the report comes as economists attempt to size up the ramifications of the shakeout in global share prices in august following the credit crunch triggered by the us housing market crisis .
at the same time , the institutes joined a growing list of forecasters who have revised down their growth outlook for germany .
high oil prices , the strong euro and financial market uncertainty will " dampen growth , " roland döhrn , an economist with the essen-based institute for scientific research -lrb- rwi -rrb- , told a press conference following the release of the report .
in their last report in the spring , the institutes projected a growth rate for germany of 2.4 percent in both 2007 and 2008 , with strong export demand powering the nation 's economic performance .
export growth likely to decline since then , however , the euro has climbed to an all-time high of $ 1.43 as fears have set in about the us economic outlook , consequently fuelling concerns about the prospects for germany 's key export machine .
the institutes predict german export growth will decline to 3 percent in 2008 from 3.5 percent this year , with stronger private consumption emerging as a key pillar of growth .
the institutes are also forecasting private consumption to grow by 1.5 percent next year compared to just 0.2 percent in 2007 .
the release of the institutes ' report is expected to lead to the german government also scaling back its growth projections for the nation .
germany emerged last year from a protracted period of stagnation , with a recent solid growth rate helping to ease the nation 's high unemployment .
larger reduction in unemployment that expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german unemployment dropped in september the number of people out of work in germany fell more than expected in september , data released last month showed , with employers continuing to hire on the back of the economic upswing and years of wage restraint .
the institutes expect unemployment to continue falling to average 7.9 percent in 2008 compared to 8.7 percent in 2007 .
germany 's jobless rate stood at 10.3 percent last year .
apart from the rwi , the german institutes involved in drawing up the report included the kiel institute for the world economy -lrb- ifw -rrb- , halle institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- and the munich- based ifo institute for economic research . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , to step up reform and warned that europe 's biggest economy faced slowing growth next year . the institutes told the government in their autumn report presented in berlin on thursday that german growth will slip back to 2.2 percent in 2008 from 2.6 percent this year , with a soaring euro , the global credit crunch and surging oil prices undercutting the nation 's expansion rate .
some economists are more pessimistic and believe germany will be lucky to reach a growth rate next year of 2 percent .
the international monetary fund said this week it expects german growth will slip to 2 percent next year from 2.4 percent for 2007 .
thursday 's report was drawn up by four leading german economic institutes in conjunction with research groups from other european nations .
criticism of ineffective reforms coming in the wake of criticism by german business about the failure of angela merkel 's government coalition to press on with economic reform , the institutes said : " much more additional work needs to be done rather than roll back the reforms so far discussed .
" the labor market reform course of the last few years has not progressed , " the institutes added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us housing market crisis had a knock-on effect the report comes as economists attempt to size up the ramifications of the shakeout in global share prices in august following the credit crunch triggered by the us housing market crisis .
at the same time , the institutes joined a growing list of forecasters who have revised down their growth outlook for germany .
high oil prices , the strong euro and financial market uncertainty will " dampen growth , " roland döhrn , an economist with the essen-based institute for scientific research -lrb- rwi -rrb- , told a press conference following the release of the report .
in their last report in the spring , the institutes projected a growth rate for germany of 2.4 percent in both 2007 and 2008 , with strong export demand powering the nation 's economic performance .
export growth likely to decline since then , however , the euro has climbed to an all-time high of $ 1.43 as fears have set in about the us economic outlook , consequently fuelling concerns about the prospects for germany 's key export machine .
the institutes predict german export growth will decline to 3 percent in 2008 from 3.5 percent this year , with stronger private consumption emerging as a key pillar of growth .
the institutes are also forecasting private consumption to grow by 1.5 percent next year compared to just 0.2 percent in 2007 .
the release of the institutes ' report is expected to lead to the german government also scaling back its growth projections for the nation .
germany emerged last year from a protracted period of stagnation , with a recent solid growth rate helping to ease the nation 's high unemployment .
larger reduction in unemployment that expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german unemployment dropped in september the number of people out of work in germany fell more than expected in september , data released last month showed , with employers continuing to hire on the back of the economic upswing and years of wage restraint .
the institutes expect unemployment to continue falling to average 7.9 percent in 2008 compared to 8.7 percent in 2007 .
germany 's jobless rate stood at 10.3 percent last year .
apart from the rwi , the german institutes involved in drawing up the report included the kiel institute for the world economy -lrb- ifw -rrb- , halle institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- and the munich- based ifo institute for economic research . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
domestic pressures weigh heavily on the leaders of poland , britain and italy as they gather in lisbon for an eu summit which hopes to finalize the charter to reform the bloc 's institutions . as representatives from the 27 eu members states converged on the portuguese capital on thursday , oct .
18 , for crunch talks to approve a new treaty , the leaders of poland , italy and britain came armed with issues that could torpedo the charter at the eleventh hour . in poland , where a closely-contested parliamentary election is to take place on sunday , nationalists who support the government want their country to be granted more power to delay eu decisions that it dislikes .
polish president lech kaczynski is thus insisting that the so-called " ioannina compromise " - a gentlemen 's agreement that allows eu members that can not muster a blocking minority to delay a decision while attempts to find a satisfactory solution are made - to be made legally binding .
polish president reiterates treaty delay threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president kaczynski wants what poland deserves before leaving for lisbon , the president reiterated his threat to delay the charter .
" we do n't want anything more than is our right , " president lech kaczynski told polish radio before leaving for the summit .
asked what would happen if polish demands were not met , kaczynski replied : " we will have to delay the discussion " .
any delay would be a huge blow for the treaty and the eu which has been plagued by in-fighting over the text of this charter and its predecessor , the doomed eu constitution which was derailed by referendums in france and the netherlands in 2005 .
with summits with russia and china on the horizon , the eu would face a crisis of credibility and confidence if it was to meet these powers without an agreement on the treaty behind it .
britain 's brown under domestic pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown will halt the treaty talks if need be eurosceptic britain could also throw a spanner in the works if the legal work which has been done on the draft treaty since an initial agreement in berlin in june changes or removes any of the " red lines " - areas of national sovereignty where britain would hold a veto - which the uk had asked to be included .
with public opinion showing huge opposition to any increased eu influence over british domestic politics , prime minister gordon brown will be under pressure to ensure that britain 's toes are not trodden on .
if he feels that the uk is getting a raw deal , brown may delay the treaty to get what he - and the people who will decide his fate at the next general election - wants .
prodi smarting from parliament decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's prodi has not accepted parliament 's decision meanwhile , italy is still smarting from last week 's announcement that the reduction of seats in the european parliament will mean fewer italian representatives , a decision prime minister romano prodi said he was not ready to accept .
while the issue is not directly linked to the treaty , the subject may be included in the agenda for the summit and prodi hinted that he may make it a treaty problem unless italy 's demands on the composition of the future european parliament are met .
" we can not accept a solution ... based on the number of residents rather than citizens because that does not agree with either the spirit or the letter of the new treaty , " prodi said .
the european parliament has adopted a new plan for allocating seats starting with the next legislature -lrb- 2009-14 -rrb- under which for the first time italy would have less meps -lrb- 72 -rrb- than either france -lrb- 74 -rrb- or britain -lrb- 73 -rrb- .
italy has so far refused the plan .
rome argues that it is not the total population resident in each country that should form the basis of the calculation , but rather the number of european citizens .
observers suspect that the unusually tough line taken by prodi , a former eu commission head , has a lot to do with the difficulties his fragile centre-left coalition is facing back home .
notwithstanding the many obstacles , portuguese prime minister jose socrates whose country currently heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency said he 's optimistic of reaching a deal .
" i think we are getting very , very close to a new treaty and this will be called the lisbon treaty , " socrates told reporters ahead of chairing the summit . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european treaty has loomed large on the horizon of the eu political landscape for the past few weeks as eu leaders prepare to agree on the its final text on oct .
18-19 . this week 's eu summit in lisbon is an informal meeting for heads of state to see the results of legal work carried out on the european treaty over the autumn .
if the reformed treaty text is approved it will then go forward to a formal heads of state meeting in brussels in december .
if the treat receives the leaders ' approval again it will then be sent for ratification by all 27 eu member states . but what is the european treaty and what is all the fuss about ?
dw-world.de answers some of the most pertinent questions . what is the european reform treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution has made way for the treaty after the failure of its forerunner , the european constitution , which was rejected in 2005 by voters in france and the netherlands , the european reform treaty was conceived as an alternative series of amendments to two existing eu treaties , the treaty on the european union -lrb- maastricht -rrb- and the treaty establishing the european community -lrb- rome -rrb- . the idea is that the reform treaty will be a blueprint for running the expanded european union more efficiently .
the reform treaty was presented to the eu leaders in brussels in july by the portuguese presidency , after an initial hard-fought agreement on its text was hammered out in under berlin 's leadership in june . what will the european reform treaty do ? the eu leaders will decide on the final draft for the european reform treaty in lisbon on oct .
18-19 and so the precise wording of the treaty has yet to be agreed .
however , the document is expected to include the following : create the role of european president this is one of the most controversial proposals as the idea was initially opposed by smaller eu nations but was forced through by the larger member states .
the presidential role has official backing but opposition and resentment remain .
the president would serve a two-and-a half-year term , replacing the current system of a rotating six-month presidency , and will not be allowed to serve more than two terms . create the role of eu high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy essentially the eu 's foreign minister -lrb- as proposed in the constitution -rrb- , this role will combine the posts of current foreign affairs chief javier solana , and the external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and will be the eu 's point person for world affairs .
reduce the size of the european commission just as the european parliament recently announced that the number of parliamentarians would be capped at 750 regardless of new countries joining the bloc , the eu commission will reduce the number of its commissioners .
there will be fewer commissioners than member states by 2014 , with only two-thirds of countries supplying a commissioner on a rotational basis . redistribute voting weights among member states this is another controversial aspect that has had many member states , particularly poland and britain , up in arms .
the treaty intends to introduce majority voting , which will allow votes to be carried on a 55 percent majority as long as that majority also represent 65 percent of the european population .
this would be phased in between 2014 and 2017 . give new powers to the european commission , european parliament and european court of justice , in areas such as justice and domestic affairs remove the national veto in a number of areas is the reform treaty just the failed european constitution under a different name ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french , along with the dutch , gave a resounding " non " originally , the reform treaty was described as having " no constitutional characteristics , " but investigations by a number of international analysis groups have noted that only two of the 440 provisions in the reform treaty differ from the original constitution .
the constitution 's references to european flags and anthems , which proved unpopular with voters , have been left out .
however , the existing flag , anthem and european motto - " united in diversity " - will remain . the role of european foreign minister included in the constitution text has also been replaced by the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , and the use of the term " european laws " has been dropped in favor of " european regulations . " what is likely to happen in lisbon and in the future ? the representatives from the 27 eu member states are expected to agree on the final text of the treaty in lisbon and then sign off on the treaty at a summit of european leaders in brussels in december .
much like the process used for the doomed constitution , the treaty will then have to be ratified by all the eu 's member states .
if this is completed , the treaty will come into force in 2009 . ratification was the process that spelled the end of the constitution .
some countries chose to put the constitution to the people in a referendum .
it was killed off by two " no " votes , from france and the netherlands .
to avoid this , most countries are expected to leave the ratification of the treaty to their parliaments , who are expected to back the deal . however , ireland plans to hold a referendum , the danes want one too and so do quite a few dutch , despite their government taking a huge risk by holding out against the will of the people .
the british government promised a referendum on the constitution but never got the chance to hold one as the french and dutch votes made it unnecessary . what could go wrong ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things may not be so clear if some nations cause trouble for the treaty to come into being , all the decisions surrounding it have to be unanimous .
there are a number of wrenches that could potentially end up in the works , specifically those lobbed in from poland and the uk . poland is threatening to block the treaty unless it includes an agreement - known as the ioannina compromise - to allow countries to defer unpalatable decisions that have been agreed by a narrow majority . the british have a number of " red lines " regarding issues of sovereignty in which the uk has an opt-out clause .
the exceptions were agreed to principle in discussions under german leadership in june .
however , britain could pull the treaty plug if the legal work carried out on the treaty text since june adapts or removes any of these " red lines . " while these two offer the greatest threats to the treaty , the most bizarre arguably comes from bulgaria .

the treaty intends to introduce majority voting , which will allow votes to be carried on a 55 percent majority as long as that majority also represent 65 percent of the european population .
this would be phased in between 2014 and 2017 . give new powers to the european commission , european parliament and european court of justice , in areas such as justice and domestic affairs remove the national veto in a number of areas is the reform treaty just the failed european constitution under a different name ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french , along with the dutch , gave a resounding " non " originally , the reform treaty was described as having " no constitutional characteristics , " but investigations by a number of international analysis groups have noted that only two of the 440 provisions in the reform treaty differ from the original constitution .
the constitution 's references to european flags and anthems , which proved unpopular with voters , have been left out .
however , the existing flag , anthem and european motto - " united in diversity " - will remain . the role of european foreign minister included in the constitution text has also been replaced by the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , and the use of the term " european laws " has been dropped in favor of " european regulations . " what is likely to happen in lisbon and in the future ? the representatives from the 27 eu member states are expected to agree on the final text of the treaty in lisbon and then sign off on the treaty at a summit of european leaders in brussels in december .
much like the process used for the doomed constitution , the treaty will then have to be ratified by all the eu 's member states .
if this is completed , the treaty will come into force in 2009 . ratification was the process that spelled the end of the constitution .
some countries chose to put the constitution to the people in a referendum .
it was killed off by two " no " votes , from france and the netherlands .
to avoid this , most countries are expected to leave the ratification of the treaty to their parliaments , who are expected to back the deal . however , ireland plans to hold a referendum , the danes want one too and so do quite a few dutch , despite their government taking a huge risk by holding out against the will of the people .
the british government promised a referendum on the constitution but never got the chance to hold one as the french and dutch votes made it unnecessary . what could go wrong ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things may not be so clear if some nations cause trouble for the treaty to come into being , all the decisions surrounding it have to be unanimous .
there are a number of wrenches that could potentially end up in the works , specifically those lobbed in from poland and the uk . poland is threatening to block the treaty unless it includes an agreement - known as the ioannina compromise - to allow countries to defer unpalatable decisions that have been agreed by a narrow majority . the british have a number of " red lines " regarding issues of sovereignty in which the uk has an opt-out clause .
the exceptions were agreed to principle in discussions under german leadership in june .
however , britain could pull the treaty plug if the legal work carried out on the treaty text since june adapts or removes any of these " red lines . " while these two offer the greatest threats to the treaty , the most bizarre arguably comes from bulgaria .
sofia is threatening to derail the treaty over the spelling of euro currency , which it insists should be " evro " in its cyrillic alphabet . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

currently in berlin , he took time off from writing to discuss his latest work and what 's going wrong in both of his home countries . with his 2003 debut " the russian debutante 's handbook " and the follow-up " absurdistan " from 2006 , gary shteyngart established his credentials as one of the english language 's best young writers and a satirist with a talent for highlighting the absurdities of both the east and the west after the cold war .
now he 's trying something a bit different .
dw-world.de : your books have been read and marketed as part of a new immigrant literature in the us , but they 're not at all earnest or politically correct .
why is that ?
gary shteyngart : well , first of all , because i was very unlucky and got sent to this horrible hebrew school .
if it was n't for those eight years being told by rabbis that the holocaust happened because i ate a piece of pork salami , i do n't think you would have had books like " absurdistan . "
that took away any sense i might have had about anything being sacred .
unless you were an idiot , you could see from a mile away that a lot of things were just plain stupid and very coercive .
then i went to a really great high school in manhattan that was a true melting pot , a holding pen for multinational nerds .
it was a place where chinese , russian and indian people gathered together , and it was a real free-for-all .
then i went to oberlin college , and that was the final straw .
from the moment i got there i just wanted to make fun of it .
the first week i was there , i got chewed out for calling some a freshman instead of a " fresh person , " and there was a professor who had devoted his life to translating brezhnev 's works into yiddish .
so that was maybe the best part of my education since it gave me such wonderful targets to go after .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of " absurdistan " is called " snack daddy 's adventurous trip " you 're working on a new book as a fellow of the american academy here in berlin .
what 's the novel about ?
it 's the first book i 've set almost entirely in america , and it takes place - god help me because the phrase " speculative fiction " makes my skin crawl - in the near future .
it follows the love affair of two immigrants , as america slowly disintegrates .
new york and los angeles have become two heavily guarded areas , or what i call " cooperative exclusion zones . "
a small group of rich shareholders achieve immortality , while the vast majority of the population loses the ability to speak , read and write in english .
and that 's what happens to one of the two lovers .
that 's very different from your first two books , which feature unscrupulous us-immigrant protagonists forced to go back to an absurd , violent and materialistic eastern europe .
one sets up a pyramid scheme in prague , while the other tries to procure a fake passport amidst a halliburton-sponsored war in the caucasus .
why the change in the emphasis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of eastern european oil is a shteyngart speciality well , i ca n't do the same story over and over again .
the first book , " the russian debutante 's handbook , " dealt with the rise of turbo-capitalism in eastern europe , and the second , " absurdistan , " took that further by bringing in us foreign policy , specifically the politics of the oil industry .
the third one deals with the fact that we in the us have become " absurdistan " in some respects , for instance , in our approach to human rights issues , privacy and upholding the constitution .
one of the worst outcomes of 9/11 is that many of the people who traditionally came to america are now having second thoughts about that .
i also wanted to write about the baby boomers ' inability to come to terms with their own mortality .
and lastly , this book features a love affair that runs from page one to page 350 or whatever .
i 've never done that before .
why come to berlin if the book is set almost entirely in america ?
i work a lot better off-shore , so to speak , than in america .
there 's something about being in countries where i do n't speak the language .
most of " absurdistan " was written in italy .
and i 'm working much faster here than i ever have before .
like in new york , there 's both an excitement and a gloom about the city , but what interests me is that , unlike new york , there 's a real collision of east and west here .
to think that we 're only an hour and a half from poland here is really amazing .
what do you think then about the latest developments in eastern europe , in particular vladimir putin 's russia ?
some of them resemble the fictional scenarios you created in " absurdistan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shteyngart says both bush and putin have betrayed the ideals of democracy i began writing that book before 9/11 and before halliburton got so involved in iraq .
but i was observing events in azerbaijan and georgia , and the path looked very clear .
in the book i 'm writing now , russia is called " petro-state russia . "
and that 's exactly what russia is - a state run on the profits of natural gas , oil and a couple of other commodities .
putin has done it .
there 's a chance that there will be no opposition parties whatsoever in the next russian election .
there 's not even a pretense of democracy .
basically , putin can have power for life if he wants it .
he can just say : " now i 'm going to be the president , now i 'm going to be the prime minister . "
he 'll just take the power with him from office to office like a traveling bag .
the country has sold out any ideals of democracy it ever had for the idea some sort of stability .
and there 's a huge gap between rich and poor - in my third book , i 'm calling that up and bringing it back to america .
it does n't sound as though you have high hopes for either russia or the us .
i was brought up between these two empires , one of which died and the other of which is dying in its own way .
as far as russia goes , there 's a restaurant in st. petersburg that 's called " 1913 , " which is known as the only good year in russian history .
it 's an autocratic country with an autocratic tradition and an autocratic church .
with america , i feel very much an american these days , because something i love is being destroyed .
for those of us who were displaced at an early age , america was always the place to go to , and the worst result of 9/11 would be that it stops being that . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

currently in berlin , he took time off from writing to discuss his latest work and what 's going wrong in both of his home countries . with his 2003 debut " the russian debutante 's handbook " and the follow-up " absurdistan " from 2006 , gary shteyngart established his credentials as one of the english language 's best young writers and a satirist with a talent for highlighting the absurdities of both the east and the west after the cold war .
now he 's trying something a bit different .
dw-world.de : your books have been read and marketed as part of a new immigrant literature in the us , but they 're not at all earnest or politically correct .
why is that ?
gary shteyngart : well , first of all , because i was very unlucky and got sent to this horrible hebrew school .
if it was n't for those eight years being told by rabbis that the holocaust happened because i ate a piece of pork salami , i do n't think you would have had books like " absurdistan . "
that took away any sense i might have had about anything being sacred .
unless you were an idiot , you could see from a mile away that a lot of things were just plain stupid and very coercive .
then i went to a really great high school in manhattan that was a true melting pot , a holding pen for multinational nerds .
it was a place where chinese , russian and indian people gathered together , and it was a real free-for-all .
then i went to oberlin college , and that was the final straw .
from the moment i got there i just wanted to make fun of it .
the first week i was there , i got chewed out for calling some a freshman instead of a " fresh person , " and there was a professor who had devoted his life to translating brezhnev 's works into yiddish .
so that was maybe the best part of my education since it gave me such wonderful targets to go after .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of " absurdistan " is called " snack daddy 's adventurous trip " you 're working on a new book as a fellow of the american academy here in berlin .
what 's the novel about ?
it 's the first book i 've set almost entirely in america , and it takes place - god help me because the phrase " speculative fiction " makes my skin crawl - in the near future .
it follows the love affair of two immigrants , as america slowly disintegrates .
new york and los angeles have become two heavily guarded areas , or what i call " cooperative exclusion zones . "
a small group of rich shareholders achieve immortality , while the vast majority of the population loses the ability to speak , read and write in english .
and that 's what happens to one of the two lovers .
that 's very different from your first two books , which feature unscrupulous us-immigrant protagonists forced to go back to an absurd , violent and materialistic eastern europe .
one sets up a pyramid scheme in prague , while the other tries to procure a fake passport amidst a halliburton-sponsored war in the caucasus .
why the change in the emphasis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of eastern european oil is a shteyngart speciality well , i ca n't do the same story over and over again .
the first book , " the russian debutante 's handbook , " dealt with the rise of turbo-capitalism in eastern europe , and the second , " absurdistan , " took that further by bringing in us foreign policy , specifically the politics of the oil industry .
the third one deals with the fact that we in the us have become " absurdistan " in some respects , for instance , in our approach to human rights issues , privacy and upholding the constitution .
one of the worst outcomes of 9/11 is that many of the people who traditionally came to america are now having second thoughts about that .
i also wanted to write about the baby boomers ' inability to come to terms with their own mortality .
and lastly , this book features a love affair that runs from page one to page 350 or whatever .
i 've never done that before .
why come to berlin if the book is set almost entirely in america ?
i work a lot better off-shore , so to speak , than in america .
there 's something about being in countries where i do n't speak the language .
most of " absurdistan " was written in italy .
and i 'm working much faster here than i ever have before .
like in new york , there 's both an excitement and a gloom about the city , but what interests me is that , unlike new york , there 's a real collision of east and west here .
to think that we 're only an hour and a half from poland here is really amazing .
what do you think then about the latest developments in eastern europe , in particular vladimir putin 's russia ?
some of them resemble the fictional scenarios you created in " absurdistan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shteyngart says both bush and putin have betrayed the ideals of democracy i began writing that book before 9/11 and before halliburton got so involved in iraq .
but i was observing events in azerbaijan and georgia , and the path looked very clear .
in the book i 'm writing now , russia is called " petro-state russia . "
and that 's exactly what russia is - a state run on the profits of natural gas , oil and a couple of other commodities .
putin has done it .
there 's a chance that there will be no opposition parties whatsoever in the next russian election .
there 's not even a pretense of democracy .
basically , putin can have power for life if he wants it .
he can just say : " now i 'm going to be the president , now i 'm going to be the prime minister . "
he 'll just take the power with him from office to office like a traveling bag .
the country has sold out any ideals of democracy it ever had for the idea some sort of stability .
and there 's a huge gap between rich and poor - in my third book , i 'm calling that up and bringing it back to america .
it does n't sound as though you have high hopes for either russia or the us .
i was brought up between these two empires , one of which died and the other of which is dying in its own way .
as far as russia goes , there 's a restaurant in st. petersburg that 's called " 1913 , " which is known as the only good year in russian history .
it 's an autocratic country with an autocratic tradition and an autocratic church .
with america , i feel very much an american these days , because something i love is being destroyed .
for those of us who were displaced at an early age , america was always the place to go to , and the worst result of 9/11 would be that it stops being that . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 eu opens key treaty talks amid polish , british doubts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the summit produce a " lisbon treaty ? "
domestic pressures weigh heavily on the leaders of poland , britain and italy as they gather in lisbon for an eu summit which hopes to finalize the charter to reform the bloc 's institutions . as representatives from the 27 eu members states converged on the portuguese capital on thursday , oct .
18 , for crunch talks to approve a new treaty , the leaders of poland , italy and britain came armed with issues that could torpedo the charter at the eleventh hour . in poland , where a closely-contested parliamentary election is to take place on sunday , nationalists who support the government want their country to be granted more power to delay eu decisions that it dislikes .
polish president lech kaczynski is thus insisting that the so-called " ioannina compromise " - a gentlemen 's agreement that allows eu members that can not muster a blocking minority to delay a decision while attempts to find a satisfactory solution are made - to be made legally binding .
polish president reiterates treaty delay threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president kaczynski wants what poland deserves before leaving for lisbon , the president reiterated his threat to delay the charter .
" we do n't want anything more than is our right , " president lech kaczynski told polish radio before leaving for the summit .
asked what would happen if polish demands were not met , kaczynski replied : " we will have to delay the discussion " .
any delay would be a huge blow for the treaty and the eu which has been plagued by in-fighting over the text of this charter and its predecessor , the doomed eu constitution which was derailed by referendums in france and the netherlands in 2005 .
with summits with russia and china on the horizon , the eu would face a crisis of credibility and confidence if it was to meet these powers without an agreement on the treaty behind it .
britain 's brown under domestic pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown will halt the treaty talks if need be eurosceptic britain could also throw a spanner in the works if the legal work which has been done on the draft treaty since an initial agreement in berlin in june changes or removes any of the " red lines " - areas of national sovereignty where britain would hold a veto - which the uk had asked to be included .
with public opinion showing huge opposition to any increased eu influence over british domestic politics , prime minister gordon brown will be under pressure to ensure that britain 's toes are not trodden on .
if he feels that the uk is getting a raw deal , brown may delay the treaty to get what he - and the people who will decide his fate at the next general election - wants .
prodi smarting from parliament decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's prodi has not accepted parliament 's decision meanwhile , italy is still smarting from last week 's announcement that the reduction of seats in the european parliament will mean fewer italian representatives , a decision prime minister romano prodi said he was not ready to accept .
while the issue is not directly linked to the treaty , the subject may be included in the agenda for the summit and prodi hinted that he may make it a treaty problem unless italy 's demands on the composition of the future european parliament are met .
" we can not accept a solution ... based on the number of residents rather than citizens because that does not agree with either the spirit or the letter of the new treaty , " prodi said .
the european parliament has adopted a new plan for allocating seats starting with the next legislature -lrb- 2009-14 -rrb- under which for the first time italy would have less meps -lrb- 72 -rrb- than either france -lrb- 74 -rrb- or britain -lrb- 73 -rrb- .
italy has so far refused the plan .
rome argues that it is not the total population resident in each country that should form the basis of the calculation , but rather the number of european citizens .
observers suspect that the unusually tough line taken by prodi , a former eu commission head , has a lot to do with the difficulties his fragile centre-left coalition is facing back home .
notwithstanding the many obstacles , portuguese prime minister jose socrates whose country currently heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency said he 's optimistic of reaching a deal .
" i think we are getting very , very close to a new treaty and this will be called the lisbon treaty , " socrates told reporters ahead of chairing the summit . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european treaty has loomed large on the horizon of the eu political landscape for the past few weeks as eu leaders prepare to agree on the its final text on oct .
18-19 . this week 's eu summit in lisbon is an informal meeting for heads of state to see the results of legal work carried out on the european treaty over the autumn .
if the reformed treaty text is approved it will then go forward to a formal heads of state meeting in brussels in december .
if the treat receives the leaders ' approval again it will then be sent for ratification by all 27 eu member states . but what is the european treaty and what is all the fuss about ?
dw-world.de answers some of the most pertinent questions . what is the european reform treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution has made way for the treaty after the failure of its forerunner , the european constitution , which was rejected in 2005 by voters in france and the netherlands , the european reform treaty was conceived as an alternative series of amendments to two existing eu treaties , the treaty on the european union -lrb- maastricht -rrb- and the treaty establishing the european community -lrb- rome -rrb- . the idea is that the reform treaty will be a blueprint for running the expanded european union more efficiently .
the reform treaty was presented to the eu leaders in brussels in july by the portuguese presidency , after an initial hard-fought agreement on its text was hammered out in under berlin 's leadership in june . what will the european reform treaty do ? the eu leaders will decide on the final draft for the european reform treaty in lisbon on oct .
18-19 and so the precise wording of the treaty has yet to be agreed .
however , the document is expected to include the following : create the role of european president this is one of the most controversial proposals as the idea was initially opposed by smaller eu nations but was forced through by the larger member states .
the presidential role has official backing but opposition and resentment remain .
the president would serve a two-and-a half-year term , replacing the current system of a rotating six-month presidency , and will not be allowed to serve more than two terms . create the role of eu high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy essentially the eu 's foreign minister -lrb- as proposed in the constitution -rrb- , this role will combine the posts of current foreign affairs chief javier solana , and the external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and will be the eu 's point person for world affairs .
reduce the size of the european commission just as the european parliament recently announced that the number of parliamentarians would be capped at 750 regardless of new countries joining the bloc , the eu commission will reduce the number of its commissioners .
there will be fewer commissioners than member states by 2014 , with only two-thirds of countries supplying a commissioner on a rotational basis . redistribute voting weights among member states this is another controversial aspect that has had many member states , particularly poland and britain , up in arms .
the treaty intends to introduce majority voting , which will allow votes to be carried on a 55 percent majority as long as that majority also represent 65 percent of the european population .
this would be phased in between 2014 and 2017 . give new powers to the european commission , european parliament and european court of justice , in areas such as justice and domestic affairs remove the national veto in a number of areas is the reform treaty just the failed european constitution under a different name ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french , along with the dutch , gave a resounding " non " originally , the reform treaty was described as having " no constitutional characteristics , " but investigations by a number of international analysis groups have noted that only two of the 440 provisions in the reform treaty differ from the original constitution .
the constitution 's references to european flags and anthems , which proved unpopular with voters , have been left out .
however , the existing flag , anthem and european motto - " united in diversity " - will remain . the role of european foreign minister included in the constitution text has also been replaced by the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , and the use of the term " european laws " has been dropped in favor of " european regulations . " what is likely to happen in lisbon and in the future ? the representatives from the 27 eu member states are expected to agree on the final text of the treaty in lisbon and then sign off on the treaty at a summit of european leaders in brussels in december .
much like the process used for the doomed constitution , the treaty will then have to be ratified by all the eu 's member states .
if this is completed , the treaty will come into force in 2009 . ratification was the process that spelled the end of the constitution .
some countries chose to put the constitution to the people in a referendum .
it was killed off by two " no " votes , from france and the netherlands .
to avoid this , most countries are expected to leave the ratification of the treaty to their parliaments , who are expected to back the deal . however , ireland plans to hold a referendum , the danes want one too and so do quite a few dutch , despite their government taking a huge risk by holding out against the will of the people .
the british government promised a referendum on the constitution but never got the chance to hold one as the french and dutch votes made it unnecessary . what could go wrong ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things may not be so clear if some nations cause trouble for the treaty to come into being , all the decisions surrounding it have to be unanimous .
there are a number of wrenches that could potentially end up in the works , specifically those lobbed in from poland and the uk . poland is threatening to block the treaty unless it includes an agreement - known as the ioannina compromise - to allow countries to defer unpalatable decisions that have been agreed by a narrow majority . the british have a number of " red lines " regarding issues of sovereignty in which the uk has an opt-out clause .
the exceptions were agreed to principle in discussions under german leadership in june .
however , britain could pull the treaty plug if the legal work carried out on the treaty text since june adapts or removes any of these " red lines . " while these two offer the greatest threats to the treaty , the most bizarre arguably comes from bulgaria .

there will be fewer commissioners than member states by 2014 , with only two-thirds of countries supplying a commissioner on a rotational basis . redistribute voting weights among member states this is another controversial aspect that has had many member states , particularly poland and britain , up in arms .
the treaty intends to introduce majority voting , which will allow votes to be carried on a 55 percent majority as long as that majority also represent 65 percent of the european population .
this would be phased in between 2014 and 2017 . give new powers to the european commission , european parliament and european court of justice , in areas such as justice and domestic affairs remove the national veto in a number of areas is the reform treaty just the failed european constitution under a different name ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french , along with the dutch , gave a resounding " non " originally , the reform treaty was described as having " no constitutional characteristics , " but investigations by a number of international analysis groups have noted that only two of the 440 provisions in the reform treaty differ from the original constitution .
the constitution 's references to european flags and anthems , which proved unpopular with voters , have been left out .
however , the existing flag , anthem and european motto - " united in diversity " - will remain . the role of european foreign minister included in the constitution text has also been replaced by the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , and the use of the term " european laws " has been dropped in favor of " european regulations . " what is likely to happen in lisbon and in the future ? the representatives from the 27 eu member states are expected to agree on the final text of the treaty in lisbon and then sign off on the treaty at a summit of european leaders in brussels in december .
much like the process used for the doomed constitution , the treaty will then have to be ratified by all the eu 's member states .
if this is completed , the treaty will come into force in 2009 . ratification was the process that spelled the end of the constitution .
some countries chose to put the constitution to the people in a referendum .
it was killed off by two " no " votes , from france and the netherlands .
to avoid this , most countries are expected to leave the ratification of the treaty to their parliaments , who are expected to back the deal . however , ireland plans to hold a referendum , the danes want one too and so do quite a few dutch , despite their government taking a huge risk by holding out against the will of the people .
the british government promised a referendum on the constitution but never got the chance to hold one as the french and dutch votes made it unnecessary . what could go wrong ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things may not be so clear if some nations cause trouble for the treaty to come into being , all the decisions surrounding it have to be unanimous .
there are a number of wrenches that could potentially end up in the works , specifically those lobbed in from poland and the uk . poland is threatening to block the treaty unless it includes an agreement - known as the ioannina compromise - to allow countries to defer unpalatable decisions that have been agreed by a narrow majority . the british have a number of " red lines " regarding issues of sovereignty in which the uk has an opt-out clause .
the exceptions were agreed to principle in discussions under german leadership in june .
however , britain could pull the treaty plug if the legal work carried out on the treaty text since june adapts or removes any of these " red lines . " while these two offer the greatest threats to the treaty , the most bizarre arguably comes from bulgaria .
sofia is threatening to derail the treaty over the spelling of euro currency , which it insists should be " evro " in its cyrillic alphabet . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he ’ s 25 years old and frankfurt 's new captain for this season .
things are going well for the striker at the moment .
his team is seventh on the table and he just shot greece into euro 2008 . dw-tv : first of all : should we refer to each other formally or by first name ?
ioannis amanatidis : using first names is fine .
okay , that 's good .
my name 's andré ...
i 'm ianni .
ianni , i 'm from australia and as an australian i 've spent the last months watching the cricket world cup and rugby world cup .
it was great .
why should i come down on a saturday afternoon and watch frankfurt play ?
i think in europe , and especially germany , football really is the number one sport .
you can see that when you go to a game .
the stadium here is fantastic , with a great atmosphere .
every week we have basically a sell out crowd .
the feeling is indescribable .
you just have to be there yourself and experience it .
you 've played with a few teams in germany : fürth , kaiserslautern , stuttgart .
what 's so special about frankfurt ?
i 've been pretty much everywhere in southern germany , that 's true .
but somehow i just could n't leave frankfurt .
i just like it here i suppose .
i 've played the majority of my bundesliga games for frankfurt , scored most of my goals here and when i 'm moving around the city i feel comfortable .
if i go away and visit friends - to stuttgart or wherever - then i immediately feel at home when i drive back in to the city .
that 's a satisfying feeling .
you mention feeling at home here ... but you were born in kozani , in northern greece .
what was life like back then ?
it was a simple village life .
i lived there until i was 9 years old and went to school there .
well actually as soon as i got home from school i went and played football on the street with my friends .
sometimes i got in trouble because there was homework that needed doing ... other times i just slipped off without anyone noticing .
i suppose you could say that greek village life is a bit more relaxed than living here .
then my family decided that we were going to move to germany .
you are now in the greek international side , have been for a while in fact .
do you have goals at that level ?
of course .
i want to play for greece as much as i can .
when i first came in to the national team i was 21 or 22 and was playing only irregularly .
now i have established myself .
if i stay fit and perform at my best , i should be playing .
and that 's the goal .
and if i am on the field then i want to show what i can do - for my country and for our fans , my countrymen , who always come and support us .
speaking of countrymen : there is another greek player at frankfurt , sotirios kyrgiakos .
what 's it like having him on the pitch for you as captain ? he 's still having difficulties with his german , probably because he does n't want to speak the language .
but that 's not important because we all speak a type of football language with each other anyway .
for that reason language is n't so important and he does n't have to learn german , but it might help him in his private life .
he helps our team immensely on the field .
i help him in training and on the field to understand what 's going on .
it 's good that he 's here in frankfurt - he strengthens our team and that 's the most important thing .
you must have personal goals though at frankfurt .
what do you aim for yourself at the start of each season ?
do you say : i want 20 goals ?
no , i do n't believe in that .
i put the team first and its success .
if we are successful , if we play well and develop our game , then each one of us will develop individually anyway .
that 's a basic principle but you have to understand it .
i will never say : i want 10 , 15 or 20 goals in a season .
i 've scored three thus far , that 's okay .
i would certainly like to score a few more this season .
but the specific number is unimportant .
let 's say , hypothetically , you are playing for frankfurt in the german cup and you score a goal .
two months later you score a goal for greece in the european championships .
what 's more important for you , personally ?
well , it depends .
if it was the third or fourth goal in a game then it 's not so important as when it is a tight 1-0 win .
if it was the 1-0 for greece then i would prefer to score that than the 4-0 for frankfurt because there the game has already been won !
a very diplomatic answer .
okay , ianni , thanks for your time .
no worries .

he ’ s 25 years old and frankfurt 's new captain for this season .
things are going well for the striker at the moment .
his team is seventh on the table and he just shot greece into euro 2008 . dw-tv : first of all : should we refer to each other formally or by first name ?
ioannis amanatidis : using first names is fine .
okay , that 's good .
my name 's andré ...
i 'm ianni .
ianni , i 'm from australia and as an australian i 've spent the last months watching the cricket world cup and rugby world cup .
it was great .
why should i come down on a saturday afternoon and watch frankfurt play ?
i think in europe , and especially germany , football really is the number one sport .
you can see that when you go to a game .
the stadium here is fantastic , with a great atmosphere .
every week we have basically a sell out crowd .
the feeling is indescribable .
you just have to be there yourself and experience it .
you 've played with a few teams in germany : fürth , kaiserslautern , stuttgart .
what 's so special about frankfurt ?
i 've been pretty much everywhere in southern germany , that 's true .
but somehow i just could n't leave frankfurt .
i just like it here i suppose .
i 've played the majority of my bundesliga games for frankfurt , scored most of my goals here and when i 'm moving around the city i feel comfortable .
if i go away and visit friends - to stuttgart or wherever - then i immediately feel at home when i drive back in to the city .
that 's a satisfying feeling .
you mention feeling at home here ... but you were born in kozani , in northern greece .
what was life like back then ?
it was a simple village life .
i lived there until i was 9 years old and went to school there .
well actually as soon as i got home from school i went and played football on the street with my friends .
sometimes i got in trouble because there was homework that needed doing ... other times i just slipped off without anyone noticing .
i suppose you could say that greek village life is a bit more relaxed than living here .
then my family decided that we were going to move to germany .
you are now in the greek international side , have been for a while in fact .
do you have goals at that level ?
of course .
i want to play for greece as much as i can .
when i first came in to the national team i was 21 or 22 and was playing only irregularly .
now i have established myself .
if i stay fit and perform at my best , i should be playing .
and that 's the goal .
and if i am on the field then i want to show what i can do - for my country and for our fans , my countrymen , who always come and support us .
speaking of countrymen : there is another greek player at frankfurt , sotirios kyrgiakos .
what 's it like having him on the pitch for you as captain ? he 's still having difficulties with his german , probably because he does n't want to speak the language .
but that 's not important because we all speak a type of football language with each other anyway .
for that reason language is n't so important and he does n't have to learn german , but it might help him in his private life .
he helps our team immensely on the field .
i help him in training and on the field to understand what 's going on .
it 's good that he 's here in frankfurt - he strengthens our team and that 's the most important thing .
you must have personal goals though at frankfurt .
what do you aim for yourself at the start of each season ?
do you say : i want 20 goals ?
no , i do n't believe in that .
i put the team first and its success .
if we are successful , if we play well and develop our game , then each one of us will develop individually anyway .
that 's a basic principle but you have to understand it .
i will never say : i want 10 , 15 or 20 goals in a season .
i 've scored three thus far , that 's okay .
i would certainly like to score a few more this season .
but the specific number is unimportant .
let 's say , hypothetically , you are playing for frankfurt in the german cup and you score a goal .
two months later you score a goal for greece in the european championships .
what 's more important for you , personally ?
well , it depends .
if it was the third or fourth goal in a game then it 's not so important as when it is a tight 1-0 win .
if it was the 1-0 for greece then i would prefer to score that than the 4-0 for frankfurt because there the game has already been won !
a very diplomatic answer .
okay , ianni , thanks for your time .
no worries .

hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon the european treaty : frequently asked questions reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's kaczynski brothers want more power for the ioannina delaying tactic poland is a big fan , although it wants it to go further , and yet it has only been invoked once to resolve a dispute over sardines .
what exactly is the ioannina compromise and why is it so important to the eu treaty ? the so-called " ioannina compromise " is one of the most talked-about and perhaps least well-understood issues relating to the ongoing reform treaty negotiations .
the term was coined after an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers which took place in ioannina , a greek city north of athens , in 1994 .
broadly speaking , the ioannina compromise is a gentlemen 's agreement , a time-out or emergency break designed to reassure individual member states who fear fellow eu members may cut deals which they strongly dislike .
ioannina gives countries a pause to find a solution in essence , if a country feels that its vital interests are threatened but can not muster a blocking minority , the decision is delayed while attempts to find a satisfactory solution are made .
the ioannina mechanism was first proposed when foreign ministers from the then 15-member union were called to discuss how voting rules should change if norway joined the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the initial compromise was lost when the eu signed nice at the meeting , ministers agreed that if eu members wished to oppose a measure but could not muster enough support to block it , they could ask the bloc 's council of member states to do " all within its power , within a reasonable space of time , to reach a satisfactory solution " that would be acceptable to a qualified majority .

what exactly is the ioannina compromise and why is it so important to the eu treaty ? the so-called " ioannina compromise " is one of the most talked-about and perhaps least well-understood issues relating to the ongoing reform treaty negotiations .
the term was coined after an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers which took place in ioannina , a greek city north of athens , in 1994 .
broadly speaking , the ioannina compromise is a gentlemen 's agreement , a time-out or emergency break designed to reassure individual member states who fear fellow eu members may cut deals which they strongly dislike .
ioannina gives countries a pause to find a solution in essence , if a country feels that its vital interests are threatened but can not muster a blocking minority , the decision is delayed while attempts to find a satisfactory solution are made .
the ioannina mechanism was first proposed when foreign ministers from the then 15-member union were called to discuss how voting rules should change if norway joined the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the initial compromise was lost when the eu signed nice at the meeting , ministers agreed that if eu members wished to oppose a measure but could not muster enough support to block it , they could ask the bloc 's council of member states to do " all within its power , within a reasonable space of time , to reach a satisfactory solution " that would be acceptable to a qualified majority .

hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon the european treaty : frequently asked questions reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's kaczynski brothers want more power for the ioannina delaying tactic poland is a big fan , although it wants it to go further , and yet it has only been invoked once to resolve a dispute over sardines .
what exactly is the ioannina compromise and why is it so important to the eu treaty ? the so-called " ioannina compromise " is one of the most talked-about and perhaps least well-understood issues relating to the ongoing reform treaty negotiations .
the term was coined after an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers which took place in ioannina , a greek city north of athens , in 1994 .
broadly speaking , the ioannina compromise is a gentlemen 's agreement , a time-out or emergency break designed to reassure individual member states who fear fellow eu members may cut deals which they strongly dislike .
ioannina gives countries a pause to find a solution in essence , if a country feels that its vital interests are threatened but can not muster a blocking minority , the decision is delayed while attempts to find a satisfactory solution are made .
the ioannina mechanism was first proposed when foreign ministers from the then 15-member union were called to discuss how voting rules should change if norway joined the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the initial compromise was lost when the eu signed nice at the meeting , ministers agreed that if eu members wished to oppose a measure but could not muster enough support to block it , they could ask the bloc 's council of member states to do " all within its power , within a reasonable space of time , to reach a satisfactory solution " that would be acceptable to a qualified majority .
norway eventually decided not to join the union , and the " gentlemen 's agreement " remained little more than a curious appendix to the eu decision-making process .
it was superseded by the nice treaty of 2000 , which established new voting rules for the eu ahead of the entry in 2004 of 10 new member states .
poland 's fight over voting rights resurrects ioannina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels agreed on a draft inclusion for the compromise but one of those newcomers - poland - fought hard to resurrect it this year during bitter negotiations over national voting rights in the reform treaty .
and in a bid to find a satisfactory compromise , the then german presidency of the eu in june included a reference to ioannina in an annex of the treaty .
according to the draft agreed last june in brussels , the eu council is forced to freeze decisions if : " -lrb- a -rrb- at least three quarters of the population , or -lrb- b -rrb- at least three quarters of the number of member states necessary to constitute a blocking minority ... indicate their opposition to the council adopting an act by a qualified majority . "
the annex does not place any formal time limits , saying that member states should spend " a reasonable time " looking for an acceptable solution .
kaczynskis want more time and legal framework but poland is campaigning for a " reinforced " ioannina mechanism and argues that two years constitutes a " reasonable time . "
moreover , poland wants the council to make an official decision on ioannina in lisbon and make it legally binding in some form or other .
because the council normally tries to reach decisions by consensus , the original ioannina compromise has been rarely invoked .
experts say there was only one unsuccessful attempt to use it during its limited lifespan : a case involving portuguese sardines . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he ’ s 25 years old and frankfurt 's new captain for this season .
things are going well for the striker at the moment .
his team is seventh on the table and he just shot greece into euro 2008 . dw-tv : first of all : should we refer to each other formally or by first name ?
ioannis amanatidis : using first names is fine .
okay , that 's good .
my name 's andré ...
i 'm ianni .
ianni , i 'm from australia and as an australian i 've spent the last months watching the cricket world cup and rugby world cup .
it was great .
why should i come down on a saturday afternoon and watch frankfurt play ?
i think in europe , and especially germany , football really is the number one sport .
you can see that when you go to a game .
the stadium here is fantastic , with a great atmosphere .
every week we have basically a sell out crowd .
the feeling is indescribable .
you just have to be there yourself and experience it .
you 've played with a few teams in germany : fürth , kaiserslautern , stuttgart .
what 's so special about frankfurt ?
i 've been pretty much everywhere in southern germany , that 's true .
but somehow i just could n't leave frankfurt .
i just like it here i suppose .
i 've played the majority of my bundesliga games for frankfurt , scored most of my goals here and when i 'm moving around the city i feel comfortable .
if i go away and visit friends - to stuttgart or wherever - then i immediately feel at home when i drive back in to the city .
that 's a satisfying feeling .
you mention feeling at home here ... but you were born in kozani , in northern greece .
what was life like back then ?
it was a simple village life .
i lived there until i was 9 years old and went to school there .
well actually as soon as i got home from school i went and played football on the street with my friends .
sometimes i got in trouble because there was homework that needed doing ... other times i just slipped off without anyone noticing .
i suppose you could say that greek village life is a bit more relaxed than living here .
then my family decided that we were going to move to germany .
you are now in the greek international side , have been for a while in fact .
do you have goals at that level ?
of course .
i want to play for greece as much as i can .
when i first came in to the national team i was 21 or 22 and was playing only irregularly .
now i have established myself .
if i stay fit and perform at my best , i should be playing .
and that 's the goal .
and if i am on the field then i want to show what i can do - for my country and for our fans , my countrymen , who always come and support us .
speaking of countrymen : there is another greek player at frankfurt , sotirios kyrgiakos .
what 's it like having him on the pitch for you as captain ? he 's still having difficulties with his german , probably because he does n't want to speak the language .
but that 's not important because we all speak a type of football language with each other anyway .
for that reason language is n't so important and he does n't have to learn german , but it might help him in his private life .
he helps our team immensely on the field .
i help him in training and on the field to understand what 's going on .
it 's good that he 's here in frankfurt - he strengthens our team and that 's the most important thing .
you must have personal goals though at frankfurt .
what do you aim for yourself at the start of each season ?
do you say : i want 20 goals ?
no , i do n't believe in that .
i put the team first and its success .
if we are successful , if we play well and develop our game , then each one of us will develop individually anyway .
that 's a basic principle but you have to understand it .
i will never say : i want 10 , 15 or 20 goals in a season .
i 've scored three thus far , that 's okay .
i would certainly like to score a few more this season .
but the specific number is unimportant .
let 's say , hypothetically , you are playing for frankfurt in the german cup and you score a goal .
two months later you score a goal for greece in the european championships .
what 's more important for you , personally ?
well , it depends .
if it was the third or fourth goal in a game then it 's not so important as when it is a tight 1-0 win .
if it was the 1-0 for greece then i would prefer to score that than the 4-0 for frankfurt because there the game has already been won !
a very diplomatic answer .
okay , ianni , thanks for your time .
no worries .

kaczynskis want more time and legal framework but poland is campaigning for a " reinforced " ioannina mechanism and argues that two years constitutes a " reasonable time . "
moreover , poland wants the council to make an official decision on ioannina in lisbon and make it legally binding in some form or other .
because the council normally tries to reach decisions by consensus , the original ioannina compromise has been rarely invoked .
experts say there was only one unsuccessful attempt to use it during its limited lifespan : a case involving portuguese sardines . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

currently in berlin , he took time off from writing to discuss his latest work and what 's going wrong in both of his home countries . with his 2003 debut " the russian debutante 's handbook " and the follow-up " absurdistan " from 2006 , gary shteyngart established his credentials as one of the english language 's best young writers and a satirist with a talent for highlighting the absurdities of both the east and the west after the cold war .
now he 's trying something a bit different .
dw-world.de : your books have been read and marketed as part of a new immigrant literature in the us , but they 're not at all earnest or politically correct .
why is that ?
gary shteyngart : well , first of all , because i was very unlucky and got sent to this horrible hebrew school .
if it was n't for those eight years being told by rabbis that the holocaust happened because i ate a piece of pork salami , i do n't think you would have had books like " absurdistan . "
that took away any sense i might have had about anything being sacred .
unless you were an idiot , you could see from a mile away that a lot of things were just plain stupid and very coercive .
then i went to a really great high school in manhattan that was a true melting pot , a holding pen for multinational nerds .
it was a place where chinese , russian and indian people gathered together , and it was a real free-for-all .
then i went to oberlin college , and that was the final straw .
from the moment i got there i just wanted to make fun of it .
the first week i was there , i got chewed out for calling some a freshman instead of a " fresh person , " and there was a professor who had devoted his life to translating brezhnev 's works into yiddish .
so that was maybe the best part of my education since it gave me such wonderful targets to go after .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of " absurdistan " is called " snack daddy 's adventurous trip " you 're working on a new book as a fellow of the american academy here in berlin .
what 's the novel about ?
it 's the first book i 've set almost entirely in america , and it takes place - god help me because the phrase " speculative fiction " makes my skin crawl - in the near future .
it follows the love affair of two immigrants , as america slowly disintegrates .
new york and los angeles have become two heavily guarded areas , or what i call " cooperative exclusion zones . "
a small group of rich shareholders achieve immortality , while the vast majority of the population loses the ability to speak , read and write in english .
and that 's what happens to one of the two lovers .
that 's very different from your first two books , which feature unscrupulous us-immigrant protagonists forced to go back to an absurd , violent and materialistic eastern europe .
one sets up a pyramid scheme in prague , while the other tries to procure a fake passport amidst a halliburton-sponsored war in the caucasus .
why the change in the emphasis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of eastern european oil is a shteyngart speciality well , i ca n't do the same story over and over again .
the first book , " the russian debutante 's handbook , " dealt with the rise of turbo-capitalism in eastern europe , and the second , " absurdistan , " took that further by bringing in us foreign policy , specifically the politics of the oil industry .
the third one deals with the fact that we in the us have become " absurdistan " in some respects , for instance , in our approach to human rights issues , privacy and upholding the constitution .
one of the worst outcomes of 9/11 is that many of the people who traditionally came to america are now having second thoughts about that .
i also wanted to write about the baby boomers ' inability to come to terms with their own mortality .
and lastly , this book features a love affair that runs from page one to page 350 or whatever .
i 've never done that before .
why come to berlin if the book is set almost entirely in america ?
i work a lot better off-shore , so to speak , than in america .
there 's something about being in countries where i do n't speak the language .
most of " absurdistan " was written in italy .
and i 'm working much faster here than i ever have before .
like in new york , there 's both an excitement and a gloom about the city , but what interests me is that , unlike new york , there 's a real collision of east and west here .
to think that we 're only an hour and a half from poland here is really amazing .
what do you think then about the latest developments in eastern europe , in particular vladimir putin 's russia ?
some of them resemble the fictional scenarios you created in " absurdistan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shteyngart says both bush and putin have betrayed the ideals of democracy i began writing that book before 9/11 and before halliburton got so involved in iraq .
but i was observing events in azerbaijan and georgia , and the path looked very clear .
in the book i 'm writing now , russia is called " petro-state russia . "
and that 's exactly what russia is - a state run on the profits of natural gas , oil and a couple of other commodities .
putin has done it .
there 's a chance that there will be no opposition parties whatsoever in the next russian election .
there 's not even a pretense of democracy .
basically , putin can have power for life if he wants it .
he can just say : " now i 'm going to be the president , now i 'm going to be the prime minister . "
he 'll just take the power with him from office to office like a traveling bag .
the country has sold out any ideals of democracy it ever had for the idea some sort of stability .
and there 's a huge gap between rich and poor - in my third book , i 'm calling that up and bringing it back to america .
it does n't sound as though you have high hopes for either russia or the us .
i was brought up between these two empires , one of which died and the other of which is dying in its own way .
as far as russia goes , there 's a restaurant in st. petersburg that 's called " 1913 , " which is known as the only good year in russian history .
it 's an autocratic country with an autocratic tradition and an autocratic church .
with america , i feel very much an american these days , because something i love is being destroyed .
for those of us who were displaced at an early age , america was always the place to go to , and the worst result of 9/11 would be that it stops being that . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , after meeting with nato and russian officials that washington 's missile shield plans could be changed should iran suspend its nuclear program .
the shield is " intended against the major problem we see developing , which is iran , and if that problem went away or attenuated we would obviously draw conclusions , " said fried .
" this is a threat-based system , and we would be affected if iran gave up its -lsb- uranium -rsb- enrichment and worked with the international community , and had a different approach to things . "
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own defenses .
shield plans could slow down under " right conditions " while fried ruled out any immediate halt , he did suggest that the development of the shield might slow down under the right conditions .
" our position is that our negotiations with the poles and the czechs will continue , but we do n't feel the need to spend money at quite as fast a rate for a threat that is attenuated , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fried assured russia that it was not a target fried also reiterated that the defense shield was needed to guard against threats from " rogue states " like iran or north korea and assured russia once again that it was not a target .
" our real concern is not russia , " he said .
" we are advancing a missile defense program in response to what we see as an iranian ballistic missile and nuclear weapons threat .
" we want -lsb- russia 's -rsb- help , and the help of all responsible nations , to work with iran so this problem is attenuated and goes away , " fried said and added that us officials had explained their stance on iran to the russians , and that " they seemed interested in the concept . "
polish election could affect us relations another factor which may force washington 's hand in adapting its plan for european bases is poland 's parliamentary election on sunday .
poland 's ties with the united states , its cooperation on the defense shield and the presence of polish troops in iraq could all change if prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski loses power .
the centrist civic platform party , the main opposition to kaczynski 's ruling conservatives , is mounting a strong challenge to the current leadership and is gaining support through its leader donald tusk 's assertions that a government under his authority would not want so close a relationship with washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister kaczynski faces a challenge in the polls surveys show most poles want their troops out of iraq and oppose the missile shield .
recent events , including an attack on the polish ambassador in iraq last week , have brought these topics and poland 's foreign policy as a whole to the forefront of the civic platform party 's agenda .
prime minister kaczynski and his twin brother lech , the polish president , have put close ties with the us at the center of poland 's foreign policy alongside a distrust of the eu .
since coming to power in 2005 , the brothers have maintained the country 's military presence in iraq , increased polish forces in afghanistan and have all but pledged to host the anti-missile shield . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one which has been around for three decades and which has taught hundreds of kids may not even feature at all . officials in the north german city of bremen have been left searching for an explanation as to how a ' secret ' primary school managed to operate for 30 years and send hundreds of children on to secondary education and beyond without anyone apparently noticing .
after ruling out top secret cloaking devices and the possibility of magic , the authorities are slowly coming to the conclusion that a long line of education ministry officials in the city state have been guilty of incompetence on a major scale .
the school in the district of steintor , organized by disgruntled leftwing , mainly academic parents , taught several hundred children aged between four and ten right under the noses of the state education ministry for nearly three decades .
disgruntled parents opted out of state system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : invisible children learning in a non-existant school in a reaction to the rigid pedagogical practices of the state system , the parents set up the school in an old villa where pupils attended mixed and same-sex classes , combining all age groups , in a relaxed and fun atmosphere .
the kids then went on to high schools in the area with forged education certificates .
many of them excelled , attended university and went on to build successful careers . renate jürgens-pieper , the social democrat education minister for the state of bremen , attempted to deflect the accusations of incompetence by accusing the parents of deception .
" they have been cheating us for years , " she said in a report published by british newspaper the guardian .

one which has been around for three decades and which has taught hundreds of kids may not even feature at all . officials in the north german city of bremen have been left searching for an explanation as to how a ' secret ' primary school managed to operate for 30 years and send hundreds of children on to secondary education and beyond without anyone apparently noticing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 18.10.2007 us official : missile shield plans for europe dependent on iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the iranian nuclear threat recedes , the us could rethink its defense shield plans for europe the future of bases for the proposed us missile shield in europe is dependent on whether iran gives up its controversial uranium enrichment program , a senior us state department official suggested . assistant secretary of state daniel fried told reporters in brussels on wednesday , oct .
17 , after meeting with nato and russian officials that washington 's missile shield plans could be changed should iran suspend its nuclear program .
the shield is " intended against the major problem we see developing , which is iran , and if that problem went away or attenuated we would obviously draw conclusions , " said fried .
" this is a threat-based system , and we would be affected if iran gave up its -lsb- uranium -rsb- enrichment and worked with the international community , and had a different approach to things . "
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own defenses .
shield plans could slow down under " right conditions " while fried ruled out any immediate halt , he did suggest that the development of the shield might slow down under the right conditions .
" our position is that our negotiations with the poles and the czechs will continue , but we do n't feel the need to spend money at quite as fast a rate for a threat that is attenuated , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fried assured russia that it was not a target fried also reiterated that the defense shield was needed to guard against threats from " rogue states " like iran or north korea and assured russia once again that it was not a target .
" our real concern is not russia , " he said .
" we are advancing a missile defense program in response to what we see as an iranian ballistic missile and nuclear weapons threat .
" we want -lsb- russia 's -rsb- help , and the help of all responsible nations , to work with iran so this problem is attenuated and goes away , " fried said and added that us officials had explained their stance on iran to the russians , and that " they seemed interested in the concept . "
polish election could affect us relations another factor which may force washington 's hand in adapting its plan for european bases is poland 's parliamentary election on sunday .
poland 's ties with the united states , its cooperation on the defense shield and the presence of polish troops in iraq could all change if prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski loses power .
the centrist civic platform party , the main opposition to kaczynski 's ruling conservatives , is mounting a strong challenge to the current leadership and is gaining support through its leader donald tusk 's assertions that a government under his authority would not want so close a relationship with washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister kaczynski faces a challenge in the polls surveys show most poles want their troops out of iraq and oppose the missile shield .
recent events , including an attack on the polish ambassador in iraq last week , have brought these topics and poland 's foreign policy as a whole to the forefront of the civic platform party 's agenda .
prime minister kaczynski and his twin brother lech , the polish president , have put close ties with the us at the center of poland 's foreign policy alongside a distrust of the eu .
since coming to power in 2005 , the brothers have maintained the country 's military presence in iraq , increased polish forces in afghanistan and have all but pledged to host the anti-missile shield . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the weekly stern magazine commissioned the forsa agency to conduct the poll after talk show host eva herman was fired from germany 's ndr public broadcaster last month for her comments on the third reich and motherhood .
pollsters asked whether national socialism had any good points .

she cited " the high regard for the mother " as an example and said she regretted that family values nurtured by the nazis had been swept away .
she was recently thrown off a talk show after refusing to apologize for her comments .
the nazis offered incentives to child-bearing women .
yet their family policies were part of a racist ideology whose goal was the creation of a master race .
it 's not the first time the 48-year-old herman has ruffled feathers .
she angered feminists last year when she said women should raise children rather than pursue careers of their own .

18 , to step up reform and warned that europe 's biggest economy faced slowing growth next year . the institutes told the government in their autumn report presented in berlin on thursday that german growth will slip back to 2.2 percent in 2008 from 2.6 percent this year , with a soaring euro , the global credit crunch and surging oil prices undercutting the nation 's expansion rate .
some economists are more pessimistic and believe germany will be lucky to reach a growth rate next year of 2 percent .
the international monetary fund said this week it expects german growth will slip to 2 percent next year from 2.4 percent for 2007 .
thursday 's report was drawn up by four leading german economic institutes in conjunction with research groups from other european nations .
criticism of ineffective reforms coming in the wake of criticism by german business about the failure of angela merkel 's government coalition to press on with economic reform , the institutes said : " much more additional work needs to be done rather than roll back the reforms so far discussed .
" the labor market reform course of the last few years has not progressed , " the institutes added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us housing market crisis had a knock-on effect the report comes as economists attempt to size up the ramifications of the shakeout in global share prices in august following the credit crunch triggered by the us housing market crisis .
at the same time , the institutes joined a growing list of forecasters who have revised down their growth outlook for germany .
high oil prices , the strong euro and financial market uncertainty will " dampen growth , " roland döhrn , an economist with the essen-based institute for scientific research -lrb- rwi -rrb- , told a press conference following the release of the report .
in their last report in the spring , the institutes projected a growth rate for germany of 2.4 percent in both 2007 and 2008 , with strong export demand powering the nation 's economic performance .
export growth likely to decline since then , however , the euro has climbed to an all-time high of $ 1.43 as fears have set in about the us economic outlook , consequently fuelling concerns about the prospects for germany 's key export machine .
the institutes predict german export growth will decline to 3 percent in 2008 from 3.5 percent this year , with stronger private consumption emerging as a key pillar of growth .
the institutes are also forecasting private consumption to grow by 1.5 percent next year compared to just 0.2 percent in 2007 .
the release of the institutes ' report is expected to lead to the german government also scaling back its growth projections for the nation .
germany emerged last year from a protracted period of stagnation , with a recent solid growth rate helping to ease the nation 's high unemployment .
larger reduction in unemployment that expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german unemployment dropped in september the number of people out of work in germany fell more than expected in september , data released last month showed , with employers continuing to hire on the back of the economic upswing and years of wage restraint .
the institutes expect unemployment to continue falling to average 7.9 percent in 2008 compared to 8.7 percent in 2007 .
germany 's jobless rate stood at 10.3 percent last year .
apart from the rwi , the german institutes involved in drawing up the report included the kiel institute for the world economy -lrb- ifw -rrb- , halle institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- and the munich- based ifo institute for economic research . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a leading jewish organization called the findings " ugly , disastrous and sad . " a popular german talk show host was recently fired for praising hitler 's family policies . the nazis encouraged women to stay at home , look after their husbands , and produce and rear children .
the incident has sparked a debate in germany over whether it is acceptable to say anything positive about the nazis , 62 years after the end of world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva herman got fired for her comments a recent poll shows that a quarter of germans agree that nazi rule had some positive aspects .
the weekly stern magazine commissioned the forsa agency to conduct the poll after talk show host eva herman was fired from germany 's ndr public broadcaster last month for her comments on the third reich and motherhood .
pollsters asked whether national socialism had any good points .
twenty-five percent of the respondents said " yes , " citing the construction of the famous autobahn or network of highways , low unemployment and crime rate and a strong sense of family as examples .
" the insecurity about how to deal with nazism is huge .
as is ignorance .
eva herman has unwittingly kicked off a long-neglected debate , " stern magazine wrote in a cover story .
the poll , released wednesday , oct .
17 , was conducted a week earlier .
poll should be a " warning sign " the poll results have sparked condemnation from the central council of jews in germany .
dieter graumann , vice president of the council , said that the poll should be considered a " warning sign . "
" the result of the poll is ugly , disastrous and makes me sad and angry , " he told the netzeitung online newspaper .
still , he cautioned against " alarmism " and called for more education about the nazi period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis wanted to create a " master race " the blue-eyed , blonde-haired herman got into trouble while presenting her latest book .
news reports quoted her as saying that while adolf hitler was very bad , there were good things about nazi rule as well .
she cited " the high regard for the mother " as an example and said she regretted that family values nurtured by the nazis had been swept away .
she was recently thrown off a talk show after refusing to apologize for her comments .
the nazis offered incentives to child-bearing women .
yet their family policies were part of a racist ideology whose goal was the creation of a master race .
it 's not the first time the 48-year-old herman has ruffled feathers .
she angered feminists last year when she said women should raise children rather than pursue careers of their own .

after ruling out top secret cloaking devices and the possibility of magic , the authorities are slowly coming to the conclusion that a long line of education ministry officials in the city state have been guilty of incompetence on a major scale .

disgruntled parents opted out of state system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : invisible children learning in a non-existant school in a reaction to the rigid pedagogical practices of the state system , the parents set up the school in an old villa where pupils attended mixed and same-sex classes , combining all age groups , in a relaxed and fun atmosphere .
the kids then went on to high schools in the area with forged education certificates .
many of them excelled , attended university and went on to build successful careers . renate jürgens-pieper , the social democrat education minister for the state of bremen , attempted to deflect the accusations of incompetence by accusing the parents of deception .

the school in the district of steintor , organized by disgruntled leftwing , mainly academic parents , taught several hundred children aged between four and ten right under the noses of the state education ministry for nearly three decades .
disgruntled parents opted out of state system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : invisible children learning in a non-existant school in a reaction to the rigid pedagogical practices of the state system , the parents set up the school in an old villa where pupils attended mixed and same-sex classes , combining all age groups , in a relaxed and fun atmosphere .
the kids then went on to high schools in the area with forged education certificates .
many of them excelled , attended university and went on to build successful careers . renate jürgens-pieper , the social democrat education minister for the state of bremen , attempted to deflect the accusations of incompetence by accusing the parents of deception .
" they have been cheating us for years , " she said in a report published by british newspaper the guardian .
as an unregistered institution run by parents , she added , the school failed to abide by basic health and safety standards such as stair rails , separate toilets for pupils and teachers , and fire regulations .
school raided by cops but remained unseen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i see no school " what is unusual is that the authorities claim not to have been aware of the existence of the unregistered alternative primary school despite it being raided by police on one occasion in the past , suggesting that rather than not knowing it was there , state officials in the past had turned a blind eye to the school .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 18.10.2007 us official : missile shield plans for europe dependent on iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the iranian nuclear threat recedes , the us could rethink its defense shield plans for europe the future of bases for the proposed us missile shield in europe is dependent on whether iran gives up its controversial uranium enrichment program , a senior us state department official suggested . assistant secretary of state daniel fried told reporters in brussels on wednesday , oct .
17 , after meeting with nato and russian officials that washington 's missile shield plans could be changed should iran suspend its nuclear program .
the shield is " intended against the major problem we see developing , which is iran , and if that problem went away or attenuated we would obviously draw conclusions , " said fried .
" this is a threat-based system , and we would be affected if iran gave up its -lsb- uranium -rsb- enrichment and worked with the international community , and had a different approach to things . "
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own defenses .
shield plans could slow down under " right conditions " while fried ruled out any immediate halt , he did suggest that the development of the shield might slow down under the right conditions .
" our position is that our negotiations with the poles and the czechs will continue , but we do n't feel the need to spend money at quite as fast a rate for a threat that is attenuated , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fried assured russia that it was not a target fried also reiterated that the defense shield was needed to guard against threats from " rogue states " like iran or north korea and assured russia once again that it was not a target .
" our real concern is not russia , " he said .
" we are advancing a missile defense program in response to what we see as an iranian ballistic missile and nuclear weapons threat .
" we want -lsb- russia 's -rsb- help , and the help of all responsible nations , to work with iran so this problem is attenuated and goes away , " fried said and added that us officials had explained their stance on iran to the russians , and that " they seemed interested in the concept . "
polish election could affect us relations another factor which may force washington 's hand in adapting its plan for european bases is poland 's parliamentary election on sunday .
poland 's ties with the united states , its cooperation on the defense shield and the presence of polish troops in iraq could all change if prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski loses power .
the centrist civic platform party , the main opposition to kaczynski 's ruling conservatives , is mounting a strong challenge to the current leadership and is gaining support through its leader donald tusk 's assertions that a government under his authority would not want so close a relationship with washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister kaczynski faces a challenge in the polls surveys show most poles want their troops out of iraq and oppose the missile shield .
recent events , including an attack on the polish ambassador in iraq last week , have brought these topics and poland 's foreign policy as a whole to the forefront of the civic platform party 's agenda .
prime minister kaczynski and his twin brother lech , the polish president , have put close ties with the us at the center of poland 's foreign policy alongside a distrust of the eu .
since coming to power in 2005 , the brothers have maintained the country 's military presence in iraq , increased polish forces in afghanistan and have all but pledged to host the anti-missile shield . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own defenses .
shield plans could slow down under " right conditions " while fried ruled out any immediate halt , he did suggest that the development of the shield might slow down under the right conditions .
" our position is that our negotiations with the poles and the czechs will continue , but we do n't feel the need to spend money at quite as fast a rate for a threat that is attenuated , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fried assured russia that it was not a target fried also reiterated that the defense shield was needed to guard against threats from " rogue states " like iran or north korea and assured russia once again that it was not a target .
" our real concern is not russia , " he said .
" we are advancing a missile defense program in response to what we see as an iranian ballistic missile and nuclear weapons threat .
" we want -lsb- russia 's -rsb- help , and the help of all responsible nations , to work with iran so this problem is attenuated and goes away , " fried said and added that us officials had explained their stance on iran to the russians , and that " they seemed interested in the concept . "
polish election could affect us relations another factor which may force washington 's hand in adapting its plan for european bases is poland 's parliamentary election on sunday .
poland 's ties with the united states , its cooperation on the defense shield and the presence of polish troops in iraq could all change if prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski loses power .
the centrist civic platform party , the main opposition to kaczynski 's ruling conservatives , is mounting a strong challenge to the current leadership and is gaining support through its leader donald tusk 's assertions that a government under his authority would not want so close a relationship with washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister kaczynski faces a challenge in the polls surveys show most poles want their troops out of iraq and oppose the missile shield .
recent events , including an attack on the polish ambassador in iraq last week , have brought these topics and poland 's foreign policy as a whole to the forefront of the civic platform party 's agenda .
prime minister kaczynski and his twin brother lech , the polish president , have put close ties with the us at the center of poland 's foreign policy alongside a distrust of the eu .

17 , after meeting with nato and russian officials that washington 's missile shield plans could be changed should iran suspend its nuclear program .
the shield is " intended against the major problem we see developing , which is iran , and if that problem went away or attenuated we would obviously draw conclusions , " said fried .
" this is a threat-based system , and we would be affected if iran gave up its -lsb- uranium -rsb- enrichment and worked with the international community , and had a different approach to things . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 18.10.2007 russian-american author sees bleak future for democracy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shteyngart describes russia and the us as dying and soon-to-be-dead empires novelist gary shteyngart was born in russia but moved to the us at age seven .
currently in berlin , he took time off from writing to discuss his latest work and what 's going wrong in both of his home countries . with his 2003 debut " the russian debutante 's handbook " and the follow-up " absurdistan " from 2006 , gary shteyngart established his credentials as one of the english language 's best young writers and a satirist with a talent for highlighting the absurdities of both the east and the west after the cold war .
now he 's trying something a bit different .
dw-world.de : your books have been read and marketed as part of a new immigrant literature in the us , but they 're not at all earnest or politically correct .
why is that ?
gary shteyngart : well , first of all , because i was very unlucky and got sent to this horrible hebrew school .
if it was n't for those eight years being told by rabbis that the holocaust happened because i ate a piece of pork salami , i do n't think you would have had books like " absurdistan . "
that took away any sense i might have had about anything being sacred .
unless you were an idiot , you could see from a mile away that a lot of things were just plain stupid and very coercive .
then i went to a really great high school in manhattan that was a true melting pot , a holding pen for multinational nerds .
it was a place where chinese , russian and indian people gathered together , and it was a real free-for-all .
then i went to oberlin college , and that was the final straw .
from the moment i got there i just wanted to make fun of it .
the first week i was there , i got chewed out for calling some a freshman instead of a " fresh person , " and there was a professor who had devoted his life to translating brezhnev 's works into yiddish .
so that was maybe the best part of my education since it gave me such wonderful targets to go after .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of " absurdistan " is called " snack daddy 's adventurous trip " you 're working on a new book as a fellow of the american academy here in berlin .
what 's the novel about ?
it 's the first book i 've set almost entirely in america , and it takes place - god help me because the phrase " speculative fiction " makes my skin crawl - in the near future .
it follows the love affair of two immigrants , as america slowly disintegrates .
new york and los angeles have become two heavily guarded areas , or what i call " cooperative exclusion zones . "
a small group of rich shareholders achieve immortality , while the vast majority of the population loses the ability to speak , read and write in english .
and that 's what happens to one of the two lovers .
that 's very different from your first two books , which feature unscrupulous us-immigrant protagonists forced to go back to an absurd , violent and materialistic eastern europe .
one sets up a pyramid scheme in prague , while the other tries to procure a fake passport amidst a halliburton-sponsored war in the caucasus .
why the change in the emphasis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of eastern european oil is a shteyngart speciality well , i ca n't do the same story over and over again .
the first book , " the russian debutante 's handbook , " dealt with the rise of turbo-capitalism in eastern europe , and the second , " absurdistan , " took that further by bringing in us foreign policy , specifically the politics of the oil industry .
the third one deals with the fact that we in the us have become " absurdistan " in some respects , for instance , in our approach to human rights issues , privacy and upholding the constitution .
one of the worst outcomes of 9/11 is that many of the people who traditionally came to america are now having second thoughts about that .
i also wanted to write about the baby boomers ' inability to come to terms with their own mortality .
and lastly , this book features a love affair that runs from page one to page 350 or whatever .
i 've never done that before .
why come to berlin if the book is set almost entirely in america ?
i work a lot better off-shore , so to speak , than in america .
there 's something about being in countries where i do n't speak the language .
most of " absurdistan " was written in italy .
and i 'm working much faster here than i ever have before .
like in new york , there 's both an excitement and a gloom about the city , but what interests me is that , unlike new york , there 's a real collision of east and west here .
to think that we 're only an hour and a half from poland here is really amazing .
what do you think then about the latest developments in eastern europe , in particular vladimir putin 's russia ?
some of them resemble the fictional scenarios you created in " absurdistan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shteyngart says both bush and putin have betrayed the ideals of democracy i began writing that book before 9/11 and before halliburton got so involved in iraq .
but i was observing events in azerbaijan and georgia , and the path looked very clear .
in the book i 'm writing now , russia is called " petro-state russia . "
and that 's exactly what russia is - a state run on the profits of natural gas , oil and a couple of other commodities .
putin has done it .
there 's a chance that there will be no opposition parties whatsoever in the next russian election .
there 's not even a pretense of democracy .
basically , putin can have power for life if he wants it .
he can just say : " now i 'm going to be the president , now i 'm going to be the prime minister . "
he 'll just take the power with him from office to office like a traveling bag .
the country has sold out any ideals of democracy it ever had for the idea some sort of stability .
and there 's a huge gap between rich and poor - in my third book , i 'm calling that up and bringing it back to america .
it does n't sound as though you have high hopes for either russia or the us .
i was brought up between these two empires , one of which died and the other of which is dying in its own way .
as far as russia goes , there 's a restaurant in st. petersburg that 's called " 1913 , " which is known as the only good year in russian history .
it 's an autocratic country with an autocratic tradition and an autocratic church .
with america , i feel very much an american these days , because something i love is being destroyed .
for those of us who were displaced at an early age , america was always the place to go to , and the worst result of 9/11 would be that it stops being that . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 the european treaty : frequently asked questions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu be hanging out the decorations in celebration of the treaty come december ?
the european treaty has loomed large on the horizon of the eu political landscape for the past few weeks as eu leaders prepare to agree on the its final text on oct .
18-19 . this week 's eu summit in lisbon is an informal meeting for heads of state to see the results of legal work carried out on the european treaty over the autumn .
if the reformed treaty text is approved it will then go forward to a formal heads of state meeting in brussels in december .
if the treat receives the leaders ' approval again it will then be sent for ratification by all 27 eu member states . but what is the european treaty and what is all the fuss about ?
dw-world.de answers some of the most pertinent questions . what is the european reform treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution has made way for the treaty after the failure of its forerunner , the european constitution , which was rejected in 2005 by voters in france and the netherlands , the european reform treaty was conceived as an alternative series of amendments to two existing eu treaties , the treaty on the european union -lrb- maastricht -rrb- and the treaty establishing the european community -lrb- rome -rrb- . the idea is that the reform treaty will be a blueprint for running the expanded european union more efficiently .
the reform treaty was presented to the eu leaders in brussels in july by the portuguese presidency , after an initial hard-fought agreement on its text was hammered out in under berlin 's leadership in june . what will the european reform treaty do ? the eu leaders will decide on the final draft for the european reform treaty in lisbon on oct .
18-19 and so the precise wording of the treaty has yet to be agreed .
however , the document is expected to include the following : create the role of european president this is one of the most controversial proposals as the idea was initially opposed by smaller eu nations but was forced through by the larger member states .
the presidential role has official backing but opposition and resentment remain .
the president would serve a two-and-a half-year term , replacing the current system of a rotating six-month presidency , and will not be allowed to serve more than two terms . create the role of eu high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy essentially the eu 's foreign minister -lrb- as proposed in the constitution -rrb- , this role will combine the posts of current foreign affairs chief javier solana , and the external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and will be the eu 's point person for world affairs .
reduce the size of the european commission just as the european parliament recently announced that the number of parliamentarians would be capped at 750 regardless of new countries joining the bloc , the eu commission will reduce the number of its commissioners .
there will be fewer commissioners than member states by 2014 , with only two-thirds of countries supplying a commissioner on a rotational basis . redistribute voting weights among member states this is another controversial aspect that has had many member states , particularly poland and britain , up in arms .
the treaty intends to introduce majority voting , which will allow votes to be carried on a 55 percent majority as long as that majority also represent 65 percent of the european population .
this would be phased in between 2014 and 2017 . give new powers to the european commission , european parliament and european court of justice , in areas such as justice and domestic affairs remove the national veto in a number of areas is the reform treaty just the failed european constitution under a different name ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french , along with the dutch , gave a resounding " non " originally , the reform treaty was described as having " no constitutional characteristics , " but investigations by a number of international analysis groups have noted that only two of the 440 provisions in the reform treaty differ from the original constitution .
the constitution 's references to european flags and anthems , which proved unpopular with voters , have been left out .
however , the existing flag , anthem and european motto - " united in diversity " - will remain . the role of european foreign minister included in the constitution text has also been replaced by the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , and the use of the term " european laws " has been dropped in favor of " european regulations . " what is likely to happen in lisbon and in the future ? the representatives from the 27 eu member states are expected to agree on the final text of the treaty in lisbon and then sign off on the treaty at a summit of european leaders in brussels in december .
much like the process used for the doomed constitution , the treaty will then have to be ratified by all the eu 's member states .
if this is completed , the treaty will come into force in 2009 . ratification was the process that spelled the end of the constitution .
some countries chose to put the constitution to the people in a referendum .
it was killed off by two " no " votes , from france and the netherlands .
to avoid this , most countries are expected to leave the ratification of the treaty to their parliaments , who are expected to back the deal . however , ireland plans to hold a referendum , the danes want one too and so do quite a few dutch , despite their government taking a huge risk by holding out against the will of the people .
the british government promised a referendum on the constitution but never got the chance to hold one as the french and dutch votes made it unnecessary . what could go wrong ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things may not be so clear if some nations cause trouble for the treaty to come into being , all the decisions surrounding it have to be unanimous .
there are a number of wrenches that could potentially end up in the works , specifically those lobbed in from poland and the uk . poland is threatening to block the treaty unless it includes an agreement - known as the ioannina compromise - to allow countries to defer unpalatable decisions that have been agreed by a narrow majority . the british have a number of " red lines " regarding issues of sovereignty in which the uk has an opt-out clause .
the exceptions were agreed to principle in discussions under german leadership in june .
however , britain could pull the treaty plug if the legal work carried out on the treaty text since june adapts or removes any of these " red lines . " while these two offer the greatest threats to the treaty , the most bizarre arguably comes from bulgaria .

dw-world.de answers some of the most pertinent questions . what is the european reform treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution has made way for the treaty after the failure of its forerunner , the european constitution , which was rejected in 2005 by voters in france and the netherlands , the european reform treaty was conceived as an alternative series of amendments to two existing eu treaties , the treaty on the european union -lrb- maastricht -rrb- and the treaty establishing the european community -lrb- rome -rrb- . the idea is that the reform treaty will be a blueprint for running the expanded european union more efficiently .
the reform treaty was presented to the eu leaders in brussels in july by the portuguese presidency , after an initial hard-fought agreement on its text was hammered out in under berlin 's leadership in june . what will the european reform treaty do ? the eu leaders will decide on the final draft for the european reform treaty in lisbon on oct .
18-19 and so the precise wording of the treaty has yet to be agreed .
however , the document is expected to include the following : create the role of european president this is one of the most controversial proposals as the idea was initially opposed by smaller eu nations but was forced through by the larger member states .
the presidential role has official backing but opposition and resentment remain .
the president would serve a two-and-a half-year term , replacing the current system of a rotating six-month presidency , and will not be allowed to serve more than two terms . create the role of eu high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy essentially the eu 's foreign minister -lrb- as proposed in the constitution -rrb- , this role will combine the posts of current foreign affairs chief javier solana , and the external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and will be the eu 's point person for world affairs .
reduce the size of the european commission just as the european parliament recently announced that the number of parliamentarians would be capped at 750 regardless of new countries joining the bloc , the eu commission will reduce the number of its commissioners .
there will be fewer commissioners than member states by 2014 , with only two-thirds of countries supplying a commissioner on a rotational basis . redistribute voting weights among member states this is another controversial aspect that has had many member states , particularly poland and britain , up in arms .
the treaty intends to introduce majority voting , which will allow votes to be carried on a 55 percent majority as long as that majority also represent 65 percent of the european population .
this would be phased in between 2014 and 2017 . give new powers to the european commission , european parliament and european court of justice , in areas such as justice and domestic affairs remove the national veto in a number of areas is the reform treaty just the failed european constitution under a different name ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french , along with the dutch , gave a resounding " non " originally , the reform treaty was described as having " no constitutional characteristics , " but investigations by a number of international analysis groups have noted that only two of the 440 provisions in the reform treaty differ from the original constitution .
the constitution 's references to european flags and anthems , which proved unpopular with voters , have been left out .
however , the existing flag , anthem and european motto - " united in diversity " - will remain . the role of european foreign minister included in the constitution text has also been replaced by the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , and the use of the term " european laws " has been dropped in favor of " european regulations . " what is likely to happen in lisbon and in the future ? the representatives from the 27 eu member states are expected to agree on the final text of the treaty in lisbon and then sign off on the treaty at a summit of european leaders in brussels in december .
much like the process used for the doomed constitution , the treaty will then have to be ratified by all the eu 's member states .
if this is completed , the treaty will come into force in 2009 . ratification was the process that spelled the end of the constitution .
some countries chose to put the constitution to the people in a referendum .
it was killed off by two " no " votes , from france and the netherlands .
to avoid this , most countries are expected to leave the ratification of the treaty to their parliaments , who are expected to back the deal . however , ireland plans to hold a referendum , the danes want one too and so do quite a few dutch , despite their government taking a huge risk by holding out against the will of the people .
the british government promised a referendum on the constitution but never got the chance to hold one as the french and dutch votes made it unnecessary . what could go wrong ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things may not be so clear if some nations cause trouble for the treaty to come into being , all the decisions surrounding it have to be unanimous .
there are a number of wrenches that could potentially end up in the works , specifically those lobbed in from poland and the uk . poland is threatening to block the treaty unless it includes an agreement - known as the ioannina compromise - to allow countries to defer unpalatable decisions that have been agreed by a narrow majority . the british have a number of " red lines " regarding issues of sovereignty in which the uk has an opt-out clause .
the exceptions were agreed to principle in discussions under german leadership in june .
however , britain could pull the treaty plug if the legal work carried out on the treaty text since june adapts or removes any of these " red lines . " while these two offer the greatest threats to the treaty , the most bizarre arguably comes from bulgaria .

hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon the european treaty : frequently asked questions reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's kaczynski brothers want more power for the ioannina delaying tactic poland is a big fan , although it wants it to go further , and yet it has only been invoked once to resolve a dispute over sardines .
what exactly is the ioannina compromise and why is it so important to the eu treaty ? the so-called " ioannina compromise " is one of the most talked-about and perhaps least well-understood issues relating to the ongoing reform treaty negotiations .
the term was coined after an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers which took place in ioannina , a greek city north of athens , in 1994 .
broadly speaking , the ioannina compromise is a gentlemen 's agreement , a time-out or emergency break designed to reassure individual member states who fear fellow eu members may cut deals which they strongly dislike .
ioannina gives countries a pause to find a solution in essence , if a country feels that its vital interests are threatened but can not muster a blocking minority , the decision is delayed while attempts to find a satisfactory solution are made .
the ioannina mechanism was first proposed when foreign ministers from the then 15-member union were called to discuss how voting rules should change if norway joined the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the initial compromise was lost when the eu signed nice at the meeting , ministers agreed that if eu members wished to oppose a measure but could not muster enough support to block it , they could ask the bloc 's council of member states to do " all within its power , within a reasonable space of time , to reach a satisfactory solution " that would be acceptable to a qualified majority .
norway eventually decided not to join the union , and the " gentlemen 's agreement " remained little more than a curious appendix to the eu decision-making process .
it was superseded by the nice treaty of 2000 , which established new voting rules for the eu ahead of the entry in 2004 of 10 new member states .
poland 's fight over voting rights resurrects ioannina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels agreed on a draft inclusion for the compromise but one of those newcomers - poland - fought hard to resurrect it this year during bitter negotiations over national voting rights in the reform treaty .
and in a bid to find a satisfactory compromise , the then german presidency of the eu in june included a reference to ioannina in an annex of the treaty .
according to the draft agreed last june in brussels , the eu council is forced to freeze decisions if : " -lrb- a -rrb- at least three quarters of the population , or -lrb- b -rrb- at least three quarters of the number of member states necessary to constitute a blocking minority ... indicate their opposition to the council adopting an act by a qualified majority . "
the annex does not place any formal time limits , saying that member states should spend " a reasonable time " looking for an acceptable solution .
kaczynskis want more time and legal framework but poland is campaigning for a " reinforced " ioannina mechanism and argues that two years constitutes a " reasonable time . "
moreover , poland wants the council to make an official decision on ioannina in lisbon and make it legally binding in some form or other .
because the council normally tries to reach decisions by consensus , the original ioannina compromise has been rarely invoked .
experts say there was only one unsuccessful attempt to use it during its limited lifespan : a case involving portuguese sardines . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what exactly is the ioannina compromise and why is it so important to the eu treaty ? the so-called " ioannina compromise " is one of the most talked-about and perhaps least well-understood issues relating to the ongoing reform treaty negotiations .
the term was coined after an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers which took place in ioannina , a greek city north of athens , in 1994 .
broadly speaking , the ioannina compromise is a gentlemen 's agreement , a time-out or emergency break designed to reassure individual member states who fear fellow eu members may cut deals which they strongly dislike .
ioannina gives countries a pause to find a solution in essence , if a country feels that its vital interests are threatened but can not muster a blocking minority , the decision is delayed while attempts to find a satisfactory solution are made .
the ioannina mechanism was first proposed when foreign ministers from the then 15-member union were called to discuss how voting rules should change if norway joined the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the initial compromise was lost when the eu signed nice at the meeting , ministers agreed that if eu members wished to oppose a measure but could not muster enough support to block it , they could ask the bloc 's council of member states to do " all within its power , within a reasonable space of time , to reach a satisfactory solution " that would be acceptable to a qualified majority .
norway eventually decided not to join the union , and the " gentlemen 's agreement " remained little more than a curious appendix to the eu decision-making process .
it was superseded by the nice treaty of 2000 , which established new voting rules for the eu ahead of the entry in 2004 of 10 new member states .
poland 's fight over voting rights resurrects ioannina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels agreed on a draft inclusion for the compromise but one of those newcomers - poland - fought hard to resurrect it this year during bitter negotiations over national voting rights in the reform treaty .
and in a bid to find a satisfactory compromise , the then german presidency of the eu in june included a reference to ioannina in an annex of the treaty .
according to the draft agreed last june in brussels , the eu council is forced to freeze decisions if : " -lrb- a -rrb- at least three quarters of the population , or -lrb- b -rrb- at least three quarters of the number of member states necessary to constitute a blocking minority ... indicate their opposition to the council adopting an act by a qualified majority . "
the annex does not place any formal time limits , saying that member states should spend " a reasonable time " looking for an acceptable solution .
kaczynskis want more time and legal framework but poland is campaigning for a " reinforced " ioannina mechanism and argues that two years constitutes a " reasonable time . "
moreover , poland wants the council to make an official decision on ioannina in lisbon and make it legally binding in some form or other .
because the council normally tries to reach decisions by consensus , the original ioannina compromise has been rarely invoked .

a leading jewish organization called the findings " ugly , disastrous and sad . " a popular german talk show host was recently fired for praising hitler 's family policies . the nazis encouraged women to stay at home , look after their husbands , and produce and rear children .
the incident has sparked a debate in germany over whether it is acceptable to say anything positive about the nazis , 62 years after the end of world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva herman got fired for her comments a recent poll shows that a quarter of germans agree that nazi rule had some positive aspects .
the weekly stern magazine commissioned the forsa agency to conduct the poll after talk show host eva herman was fired from germany 's ndr public broadcaster last month for her comments on the third reich and motherhood .
pollsters asked whether national socialism had any good points .
twenty-five percent of the respondents said " yes , " citing the construction of the famous autobahn or network of highways , low unemployment and crime rate and a strong sense of family as examples .
" the insecurity about how to deal with nazism is huge .
as is ignorance .
eva herman has unwittingly kicked off a long-neglected debate , " stern magazine wrote in a cover story .
the poll , released wednesday , oct .
17 , was conducted a week earlier .
poll should be a " warning sign " the poll results have sparked condemnation from the central council of jews in germany .
dieter graumann , vice president of the council , said that the poll should be considered a " warning sign . "
" the result of the poll is ugly , disastrous and makes me sad and angry , " he told the netzeitung online newspaper .
still , he cautioned against " alarmism " and called for more education about the nazi period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis wanted to create a " master race " the blue-eyed , blonde-haired herman got into trouble while presenting her latest book .
news reports quoted her as saying that while adolf hitler was very bad , there were good things about nazi rule as well .
she cited " the high regard for the mother " as an example and said she regretted that family values nurtured by the nazis had been swept away .
she was recently thrown off a talk show after refusing to apologize for her comments .
the nazis offered incentives to child-bearing women .
yet their family policies were part of a racist ideology whose goal was the creation of a master race .
it 's not the first time the 48-year-old herman has ruffled feathers .
she angered feminists last year when she said women should raise children rather than pursue careers of their own .
herman insists that her latest comments were taken out of context . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with the treaty relying on unanimity to get through to the final stage at a summit in brussels in december , any one country , if dissatisfied , could send the eu planners back to the drawing board .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 18.10.2007 russian-american author sees bleak future for democracy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shteyngart describes russia and the us as dying and soon-to-be-dead empires novelist gary shteyngart was born in russia but moved to the us at age seven .
currently in berlin , he took time off from writing to discuss his latest work and what 's going wrong in both of his home countries . with his 2003 debut " the russian debutante 's handbook " and the follow-up " absurdistan " from 2006 , gary shteyngart established his credentials as one of the english language 's best young writers and a satirist with a talent for highlighting the absurdities of both the east and the west after the cold war .
now he 's trying something a bit different .
dw-world.de : your books have been read and marketed as part of a new immigrant literature in the us , but they 're not at all earnest or politically correct .
why is that ?
gary shteyngart : well , first of all , because i was very unlucky and got sent to this horrible hebrew school .
if it was n't for those eight years being told by rabbis that the holocaust happened because i ate a piece of pork salami , i do n't think you would have had books like " absurdistan . "
that took away any sense i might have had about anything being sacred .
unless you were an idiot , you could see from a mile away that a lot of things were just plain stupid and very coercive .
then i went to a really great high school in manhattan that was a true melting pot , a holding pen for multinational nerds .
it was a place where chinese , russian and indian people gathered together , and it was a real free-for-all .
then i went to oberlin college , and that was the final straw .
from the moment i got there i just wanted to make fun of it .
the first week i was there , i got chewed out for calling some a freshman instead of a " fresh person , " and there was a professor who had devoted his life to translating brezhnev 's works into yiddish .
so that was maybe the best part of my education since it gave me such wonderful targets to go after .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of " absurdistan " is called " snack daddy 's adventurous trip " you 're working on a new book as a fellow of the american academy here in berlin .
what 's the novel about ?
it 's the first book i 've set almost entirely in america , and it takes place - god help me because the phrase " speculative fiction " makes my skin crawl - in the near future .
it follows the love affair of two immigrants , as america slowly disintegrates .
new york and los angeles have become two heavily guarded areas , or what i call " cooperative exclusion zones . "
a small group of rich shareholders achieve immortality , while the vast majority of the population loses the ability to speak , read and write in english .
and that 's what happens to one of the two lovers .
that 's very different from your first two books , which feature unscrupulous us-immigrant protagonists forced to go back to an absurd , violent and materialistic eastern europe .
one sets up a pyramid scheme in prague , while the other tries to procure a fake passport amidst a halliburton-sponsored war in the caucasus .
why the change in the emphasis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of eastern european oil is a shteyngart speciality well , i ca n't do the same story over and over again .
the first book , " the russian debutante 's handbook , " dealt with the rise of turbo-capitalism in eastern europe , and the second , " absurdistan , " took that further by bringing in us foreign policy , specifically the politics of the oil industry .
the third one deals with the fact that we in the us have become " absurdistan " in some respects , for instance , in our approach to human rights issues , privacy and upholding the constitution .
one of the worst outcomes of 9/11 is that many of the people who traditionally came to america are now having second thoughts about that .
i also wanted to write about the baby boomers ' inability to come to terms with their own mortality .
and lastly , this book features a love affair that runs from page one to page 350 or whatever .
i 've never done that before .
why come to berlin if the book is set almost entirely in america ?
i work a lot better off-shore , so to speak , than in america .
there 's something about being in countries where i do n't speak the language .
most of " absurdistan " was written in italy .
and i 'm working much faster here than i ever have before .
like in new york , there 's both an excitement and a gloom about the city , but what interests me is that , unlike new york , there 's a real collision of east and west here .
to think that we 're only an hour and a half from poland here is really amazing .
what do you think then about the latest developments in eastern europe , in particular vladimir putin 's russia ?
some of them resemble the fictional scenarios you created in " absurdistan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shteyngart says both bush and putin have betrayed the ideals of democracy i began writing that book before 9/11 and before halliburton got so involved in iraq .
but i was observing events in azerbaijan and georgia , and the path looked very clear .
in the book i 'm writing now , russia is called " petro-state russia . "
and that 's exactly what russia is - a state run on the profits of natural gas , oil and a couple of other commodities .
putin has done it .
there 's a chance that there will be no opposition parties whatsoever in the next russian election .
there 's not even a pretense of democracy .
basically , putin can have power for life if he wants it .
he can just say : " now i 'm going to be the president , now i 'm going to be the prime minister . "
he 'll just take the power with him from office to office like a traveling bag .
the country has sold out any ideals of democracy it ever had for the idea some sort of stability .
and there 's a huge gap between rich and poor - in my third book , i 'm calling that up and bringing it back to america .
it does n't sound as though you have high hopes for either russia or the us .
i was brought up between these two empires , one of which died and the other of which is dying in its own way .
as far as russia goes , there 's a restaurant in st. petersburg that 's called " 1913 , " which is known as the only good year in russian history .
it 's an autocratic country with an autocratic tradition and an autocratic church .
with america , i feel very much an american these days , because something i love is being destroyed .
for those of us who were displaced at an early age , america was always the place to go to , and the worst result of 9/11 would be that it stops being that . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 18.10.2007 russian-american author sees bleak future for democracy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shteyngart describes russia and the us as dying and soon-to-be-dead empires novelist gary shteyngart was born in russia but moved to the us at age seven .
currently in berlin , he took time off from writing to discuss his latest work and what 's going wrong in both of his home countries . with his 2003 debut " the russian debutante 's handbook " and the follow-up " absurdistan " from 2006 , gary shteyngart established his credentials as one of the english language 's best young writers and a satirist with a talent for highlighting the absurdities of both the east and the west after the cold war .
now he 's trying something a bit different .
dw-world.de : your books have been read and marketed as part of a new immigrant literature in the us , but they 're not at all earnest or politically correct .
why is that ?
gary shteyngart : well , first of all , because i was very unlucky and got sent to this horrible hebrew school .
if it was n't for those eight years being told by rabbis that the holocaust happened because i ate a piece of pork salami , i do n't think you would have had books like " absurdistan . "
that took away any sense i might have had about anything being sacred .
unless you were an idiot , you could see from a mile away that a lot of things were just plain stupid and very coercive .
then i went to a really great high school in manhattan that was a true melting pot , a holding pen for multinational nerds .
it was a place where chinese , russian and indian people gathered together , and it was a real free-for-all .
then i went to oberlin college , and that was the final straw .
from the moment i got there i just wanted to make fun of it .
the first week i was there , i got chewed out for calling some a freshman instead of a " fresh person , " and there was a professor who had devoted his life to translating brezhnev 's works into yiddish .
so that was maybe the best part of my education since it gave me such wonderful targets to go after .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of " absurdistan " is called " snack daddy 's adventurous trip " you 're working on a new book as a fellow of the american academy here in berlin .
what 's the novel about ?
it 's the first book i 've set almost entirely in america , and it takes place - god help me because the phrase " speculative fiction " makes my skin crawl - in the near future .
it follows the love affair of two immigrants , as america slowly disintegrates .
new york and los angeles have become two heavily guarded areas , or what i call " cooperative exclusion zones . "
a small group of rich shareholders achieve immortality , while the vast majority of the population loses the ability to speak , read and write in english .
and that 's what happens to one of the two lovers .
that 's very different from your first two books , which feature unscrupulous us-immigrant protagonists forced to go back to an absurd , violent and materialistic eastern europe .
one sets up a pyramid scheme in prague , while the other tries to procure a fake passport amidst a halliburton-sponsored war in the caucasus .
why the change in the emphasis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of eastern european oil is a shteyngart speciality well , i ca n't do the same story over and over again .
the first book , " the russian debutante 's handbook , " dealt with the rise of turbo-capitalism in eastern europe , and the second , " absurdistan , " took that further by bringing in us foreign policy , specifically the politics of the oil industry .
the third one deals with the fact that we in the us have become " absurdistan " in some respects , for instance , in our approach to human rights issues , privacy and upholding the constitution .
one of the worst outcomes of 9/11 is that many of the people who traditionally came to america are now having second thoughts about that .
i also wanted to write about the baby boomers ' inability to come to terms with their own mortality .
and lastly , this book features a love affair that runs from page one to page 350 or whatever .
i 've never done that before .
why come to berlin if the book is set almost entirely in america ?
i work a lot better off-shore , so to speak , than in america .
there 's something about being in countries where i do n't speak the language .
most of " absurdistan " was written in italy .
and i 'm working much faster here than i ever have before .
like in new york , there 's both an excitement and a gloom about the city , but what interests me is that , unlike new york , there 's a real collision of east and west here .
to think that we 're only an hour and a half from poland here is really amazing .
what do you think then about the latest developments in eastern europe , in particular vladimir putin 's russia ?
some of them resemble the fictional scenarios you created in " absurdistan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shteyngart says both bush and putin have betrayed the ideals of democracy i began writing that book before 9/11 and before halliburton got so involved in iraq .
but i was observing events in azerbaijan and georgia , and the path looked very clear .
in the book i 'm writing now , russia is called " petro-state russia . "
and that 's exactly what russia is - a state run on the profits of natural gas , oil and a couple of other commodities .
putin has done it .
there 's a chance that there will be no opposition parties whatsoever in the next russian election .
there 's not even a pretense of democracy .
basically , putin can have power for life if he wants it .
he can just say : " now i 'm going to be the president , now i 'm going to be the prime minister . "
he 'll just take the power with him from office to office like a traveling bag .
the country has sold out any ideals of democracy it ever had for the idea some sort of stability .
and there 's a huge gap between rich and poor - in my third book , i 'm calling that up and bringing it back to america .
it does n't sound as though you have high hopes for either russia or the us .
i was brought up between these two empires , one of which died and the other of which is dying in its own way .
as far as russia goes , there 's a restaurant in st. petersburg that 's called " 1913 , " which is known as the only good year in russian history .
it 's an autocratic country with an autocratic tradition and an autocratic church .
with america , i feel very much an american these days , because something i love is being destroyed .
for those of us who were displaced at an early age , america was always the place to go to , and the worst result of 9/11 would be that it stops being that . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
domestic pressures weigh heavily on the leaders of poland , britain and italy as they gather in lisbon for an eu summit which hopes to finalize the charter to reform the bloc 's institutions . as representatives from the 27 eu members states converged on the portuguese capital on thursday , oct .
18 , for crunch talks to approve a new treaty , the leaders of poland , italy and britain came armed with issues that could torpedo the charter at the eleventh hour . in poland , where a closely-contested parliamentary election is to take place on sunday , nationalists who support the government want their country to be granted more power to delay eu decisions that it dislikes .
polish president lech kaczynski is thus insisting that the so-called " ioannina compromise " - a gentlemen 's agreement that allows eu members that can not muster a blocking minority to delay a decision while attempts to find a satisfactory solution are made - to be made legally binding .
polish president reiterates treaty delay threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president kaczynski wants what poland deserves before leaving for lisbon , the president reiterated his threat to delay the charter .
" we do n't want anything more than is our right , " president lech kaczynski told polish radio before leaving for the summit .
asked what would happen if polish demands were not met , kaczynski replied : " we will have to delay the discussion " .
any delay would be a huge blow for the treaty and the eu which has been plagued by in-fighting over the text of this charter and its predecessor , the doomed eu constitution which was derailed by referendums in france and the netherlands in 2005 .
with summits with russia and china on the horizon , the eu would face a crisis of credibility and confidence if it was to meet these powers without an agreement on the treaty behind it .
britain 's brown under domestic pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown will halt the treaty talks if need be eurosceptic britain could also throw a spanner in the works if the legal work which has been done on the draft treaty since an initial agreement in berlin in june changes or removes any of the " red lines " - areas of national sovereignty where britain would hold a veto - which the uk had asked to be included .
with public opinion showing huge opposition to any increased eu influence over british domestic politics , prime minister gordon brown will be under pressure to ensure that britain 's toes are not trodden on .
if he feels that the uk is getting a raw deal , brown may delay the treaty to get what he - and the people who will decide his fate at the next general election - wants .
prodi smarting from parliament decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's prodi has not accepted parliament 's decision meanwhile , italy is still smarting from last week 's announcement that the reduction of seats in the european parliament will mean fewer italian representatives , a decision prime minister romano prodi said he was not ready to accept .
while the issue is not directly linked to the treaty , the subject may be included in the agenda for the summit and prodi hinted that he may make it a treaty problem unless italy 's demands on the composition of the future european parliament are met .
" we can not accept a solution ... based on the number of residents rather than citizens because that does not agree with either the spirit or the letter of the new treaty , " prodi said .
the european parliament has adopted a new plan for allocating seats starting with the next legislature -lrb- 2009-14 -rrb- under which for the first time italy would have less meps -lrb- 72 -rrb- than either france -lrb- 74 -rrb- or britain -lrb- 73 -rrb- .
italy has so far refused the plan .
rome argues that it is not the total population resident in each country that should form the basis of the calculation , but rather the number of european citizens .
observers suspect that the unusually tough line taken by prodi , a former eu commission head , has a lot to do with the difficulties his fragile centre-left coalition is facing back home .
notwithstanding the many obstacles , portuguese prime minister jose socrates whose country currently heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency said he 's optimistic of reaching a deal .

"
domestic pressures weigh heavily on the leaders of poland , britain and italy as they gather in lisbon for an eu summit which hopes to finalize the charter to reform the bloc 's institutions . as representatives from the 27 eu members states converged on the portuguese capital on thursday , oct .
18 , for crunch talks to approve a new treaty , the leaders of poland , italy and britain came armed with issues that could torpedo the charter at the eleventh hour . in poland , where a closely-contested parliamentary election is to take place on sunday , nationalists who support the government want their country to be granted more power to delay eu decisions that it dislikes .
polish president lech kaczynski is thus insisting that the so-called " ioannina compromise " - a gentlemen 's agreement that allows eu members that can not muster a blocking minority to delay a decision while attempts to find a satisfactory solution are made - to be made legally binding .
polish president reiterates treaty delay threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president kaczynski wants what poland deserves before leaving for lisbon , the president reiterated his threat to delay the charter .
" we do n't want anything more than is our right , " president lech kaczynski told polish radio before leaving for the summit .
asked what would happen if polish demands were not met , kaczynski replied : " we will have to delay the discussion " .
any delay would be a huge blow for the treaty and the eu which has been plagued by in-fighting over the text of this charter and its predecessor , the doomed eu constitution which was derailed by referendums in france and the netherlands in 2005 .
with summits with russia and china on the horizon , the eu would face a crisis of credibility and confidence if it was to meet these powers without an agreement on the treaty behind it .
britain 's brown under domestic pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown will halt the treaty talks if need be eurosceptic britain could also throw a spanner in the works if the legal work which has been done on the draft treaty since an initial agreement in berlin in june changes or removes any of the " red lines " - areas of national sovereignty where britain would hold a veto - which the uk had asked to be included .
with public opinion showing huge opposition to any increased eu influence over british domestic politics , prime minister gordon brown will be under pressure to ensure that britain 's toes are not trodden on .
if he feels that the uk is getting a raw deal , brown may delay the treaty to get what he - and the people who will decide his fate at the next general election - wants .
prodi smarting from parliament decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's prodi has not accepted parliament 's decision meanwhile , italy is still smarting from last week 's announcement that the reduction of seats in the european parliament will mean fewer italian representatives , a decision prime minister romano prodi said he was not ready to accept .
while the issue is not directly linked to the treaty , the subject may be included in the agenda for the summit and prodi hinted that he may make it a treaty problem unless italy 's demands on the composition of the future european parliament are met .
" we can not accept a solution ... based on the number of residents rather than citizens because that does not agree with either the spirit or the letter of the new treaty , " prodi said .
the european parliament has adopted a new plan for allocating seats starting with the next legislature -lrb- 2009-14 -rrb- under which for the first time italy would have less meps -lrb- 72 -rrb- than either france -lrb- 74 -rrb- or britain -lrb- 73 -rrb- .
italy has so far refused the plan .
rome argues that it is not the total population resident in each country that should form the basis of the calculation , but rather the number of european citizens .
observers suspect that the unusually tough line taken by prodi , a former eu commission head , has a lot to do with the difficulties his fragile centre-left coalition is facing back home .
notwithstanding the many obstacles , portuguese prime minister jose socrates whose country currently heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency said he 's optimistic of reaching a deal .

he ’ s 25 years old and frankfurt 's new captain for this season .
things are going well for the striker at the moment .
his team is seventh on the table and he just shot greece into euro 2008 . dw-tv : first of all : should we refer to each other formally or by first name ?
ioannis amanatidis : using first names is fine .
okay , that 's good .
my name 's andré ...
i 'm ianni .
ianni , i 'm from australia and as an australian i 've spent the last months watching the cricket world cup and rugby world cup .
it was great .
why should i come down on a saturday afternoon and watch frankfurt play ?
i think in europe , and especially germany , football really is the number one sport .
you can see that when you go to a game .
the stadium here is fantastic , with a great atmosphere .
every week we have basically a sell out crowd .
the feeling is indescribable .
you just have to be there yourself and experience it .
you 've played with a few teams in germany : fürth , kaiserslautern , stuttgart .
what 's so special about frankfurt ?
i 've been pretty much everywhere in southern germany , that 's true .
but somehow i just could n't leave frankfurt .
i just like it here i suppose .
i 've played the majority of my bundesliga games for frankfurt , scored most of my goals here and when i 'm moving around the city i feel comfortable .
if i go away and visit friends - to stuttgart or wherever - then i immediately feel at home when i drive back in to the city .
that 's a satisfying feeling .
you mention feeling at home here ... but you were born in kozani , in northern greece .
what was life like back then ?
it was a simple village life .
i lived there until i was 9 years old and went to school there .
well actually as soon as i got home from school i went and played football on the street with my friends .
sometimes i got in trouble because there was homework that needed doing ... other times i just slipped off without anyone noticing .
i suppose you could say that greek village life is a bit more relaxed than living here .
then my family decided that we were going to move to germany .
you are now in the greek international side , have been for a while in fact .
do you have goals at that level ?
of course .
i want to play for greece as much as i can .
when i first came in to the national team i was 21 or 22 and was playing only irregularly .
now i have established myself .
if i stay fit and perform at my best , i should be playing .
and that 's the goal .
and if i am on the field then i want to show what i can do - for my country and for our fans , my countrymen , who always come and support us .
speaking of countrymen : there is another greek player at frankfurt , sotirios kyrgiakos .
what 's it like having him on the pitch for you as captain ? he 's still having difficulties with his german , probably because he does n't want to speak the language .
but that 's not important because we all speak a type of football language with each other anyway .
for that reason language is n't so important and he does n't have to learn german , but it might help him in his private life .
he helps our team immensely on the field .
i help him in training and on the field to understand what 's going on .
it 's good that he 's here in frankfurt - he strengthens our team and that 's the most important thing .
you must have personal goals though at frankfurt .
what do you aim for yourself at the start of each season ?
do you say : i want 20 goals ?
no , i do n't believe in that .
i put the team first and its success .
if we are successful , if we play well and develop our game , then each one of us will develop individually anyway .
that 's a basic principle but you have to understand it .
i will never say : i want 10 , 15 or 20 goals in a season .
i 've scored three thus far , that 's okay .
i would certainly like to score a few more this season .
but the specific number is unimportant .
let 's say , hypothetically , you are playing for frankfurt in the german cup and you score a goal .
two months later you score a goal for greece in the european championships .
what 's more important for you , personally ?
well , it depends .
if it was the third or fourth goal in a game then it 's not so important as when it is a tight 1-0 win .
if it was the 1-0 for greece then i would prefer to score that than the 4-0 for frankfurt because there the game has already been won !
a very diplomatic answer .
okay , ianni , thanks for your time .
no worries .

he ’ s 25 years old and frankfurt 's new captain for this season .
things are going well for the striker at the moment .
his team is seventh on the table and he just shot greece into euro 2008 . dw-tv : first of all : should we refer to each other formally or by first name ?
ioannis amanatidis : using first names is fine .
okay , that 's good .
my name 's andré ...
i 'm ianni .
ianni , i 'm from australia and as an australian i 've spent the last months watching the cricket world cup and rugby world cup .
it was great .
why should i come down on a saturday afternoon and watch frankfurt play ?
i think in europe , and especially germany , football really is the number one sport .
you can see that when you go to a game .
the stadium here is fantastic , with a great atmosphere .
every week we have basically a sell out crowd .
the feeling is indescribable .
you just have to be there yourself and experience it .
you 've played with a few teams in germany : fürth , kaiserslautern , stuttgart .
what 's so special about frankfurt ?
i 've been pretty much everywhere in southern germany , that 's true .
but somehow i just could n't leave frankfurt .
i just like it here i suppose .
i 've played the majority of my bundesliga games for frankfurt , scored most of my goals here and when i 'm moving around the city i feel comfortable .
if i go away and visit friends - to stuttgart or wherever - then i immediately feel at home when i drive back in to the city .
that 's a satisfying feeling .
you mention feeling at home here ... but you were born in kozani , in northern greece .
what was life like back then ?
it was a simple village life .
i lived there until i was 9 years old and went to school there .
well actually as soon as i got home from school i went and played football on the street with my friends .
sometimes i got in trouble because there was homework that needed doing ... other times i just slipped off without anyone noticing .
i suppose you could say that greek village life is a bit more relaxed than living here .
then my family decided that we were going to move to germany .
you are now in the greek international side , have been for a while in fact .
do you have goals at that level ?
of course .
i want to play for greece as much as i can .
when i first came in to the national team i was 21 or 22 and was playing only irregularly .
now i have established myself .
if i stay fit and perform at my best , i should be playing .
and that 's the goal .
and if i am on the field then i want to show what i can do - for my country and for our fans , my countrymen , who always come and support us .
speaking of countrymen : there is another greek player at frankfurt , sotirios kyrgiakos .
what 's it like having him on the pitch for you as captain ? he 's still having difficulties with his german , probably because he does n't want to speak the language .
but that 's not important because we all speak a type of football language with each other anyway .
for that reason language is n't so important and he does n't have to learn german , but it might help him in his private life .
he helps our team immensely on the field .
i help him in training and on the field to understand what 's going on .
it 's good that he 's here in frankfurt - he strengthens our team and that 's the most important thing .
you must have personal goals though at frankfurt .
what do you aim for yourself at the start of each season ?
do you say : i want 20 goals ?
no , i do n't believe in that .
i put the team first and its success .
if we are successful , if we play well and develop our game , then each one of us will develop individually anyway .
that 's a basic principle but you have to understand it .
i will never say : i want 10 , 15 or 20 goals in a season .
i 've scored three thus far , that 's okay .
i would certainly like to score a few more this season .
but the specific number is unimportant .
let 's say , hypothetically , you are playing for frankfurt in the german cup and you score a goal .
two months later you score a goal for greece in the european championships .
what 's more important for you , personally ?
well , it depends .
if it was the third or fourth goal in a game then it 's not so important as when it is a tight 1-0 win .
if it was the 1-0 for greece then i would prefer to score that than the 4-0 for frankfurt because there the game has already been won !
a very diplomatic answer .
okay , ianni , thanks for your time .
no worries .

for that reason language is n't so important and he does n't have to learn german , but it might help him in his private life .
he helps our team immensely on the field .
i help him in training and on the field to understand what 's going on .
it 's good that he 's here in frankfurt - he strengthens our team and that 's the most important thing .
you must have personal goals though at frankfurt .
what do you aim for yourself at the start of each season ?
do you say : i want 20 goals ?
no , i do n't believe in that .
i put the team first and its success .
if we are successful , if we play well and develop our game , then each one of us will develop individually anyway .
that 's a basic principle but you have to understand it .
i will never say : i want 10 , 15 or 20 goals in a season .
i 've scored three thus far , that 's okay .
i would certainly like to score a few more this season .
but the specific number is unimportant .
let 's say , hypothetically , you are playing for frankfurt in the german cup and you score a goal .
two months later you score a goal for greece in the european championships .
what 's more important for you , personally ?
well , it depends .
if it was the third or fourth goal in a game then it 's not so important as when it is a tight 1-0 win .
if it was the 1-0 for greece then i would prefer to score that than the 4-0 for frankfurt because there the game has already been won !
a very diplomatic answer .
okay , ianni , thanks for your time .
no worries .

18 , to step up reform and warned that europe 's biggest economy faced slowing growth next year . the institutes told the government in their autumn report presented in berlin on thursday that german growth will slip back to 2.2 percent in 2008 from 2.6 percent this year , with a soaring euro , the global credit crunch and surging oil prices undercutting the nation 's expansion rate .
some economists are more pessimistic and believe germany will be lucky to reach a growth rate next year of 2 percent .
the international monetary fund said this week it expects german growth will slip to 2 percent next year from 2.4 percent for 2007 .
thursday 's report was drawn up by four leading german economic institutes in conjunction with research groups from other european nations .
criticism of ineffective reforms coming in the wake of criticism by german business about the failure of angela merkel 's government coalition to press on with economic reform , the institutes said : " much more additional work needs to be done rather than roll back the reforms so far discussed .
" the labor market reform course of the last few years has not progressed , " the institutes added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us housing market crisis had a knock-on effect the report comes as economists attempt to size up the ramifications of the shakeout in global share prices in august following the credit crunch triggered by the us housing market crisis .
at the same time , the institutes joined a growing list of forecasters who have revised down their growth outlook for germany .
high oil prices , the strong euro and financial market uncertainty will " dampen growth , " roland döhrn , an economist with the essen-based institute for scientific research -lrb- rwi -rrb- , told a press conference following the release of the report .
in their last report in the spring , the institutes projected a growth rate for germany of 2.4 percent in both 2007 and 2008 , with strong export demand powering the nation 's economic performance .
export growth likely to decline since then , however , the euro has climbed to an all-time high of $ 1.43 as fears have set in about the us economic outlook , consequently fuelling concerns about the prospects for germany 's key export machine .
the institutes predict german export growth will decline to 3 percent in 2008 from 3.5 percent this year , with stronger private consumption emerging as a key pillar of growth .
the institutes are also forecasting private consumption to grow by 1.5 percent next year compared to just 0.2 percent in 2007 .
the release of the institutes ' report is expected to lead to the german government also scaling back its growth projections for the nation .
germany emerged last year from a protracted period of stagnation , with a recent solid growth rate helping to ease the nation 's high unemployment .
larger reduction in unemployment that expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german unemployment dropped in september the number of people out of work in germany fell more than expected in september , data released last month showed , with employers continuing to hire on the back of the economic upswing and years of wage restraint .
the institutes expect unemployment to continue falling to average 7.9 percent in 2008 compared to 8.7 percent in 2007 .
germany 's jobless rate stood at 10.3 percent last year .
apart from the rwi , the german institutes involved in drawing up the report included the kiel institute for the world economy -lrb- ifw -rrb- , halle institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- and the munich- based ifo institute for economic research . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the labor market reform course of the last few years has not progressed , " the institutes added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us housing market crisis had a knock-on effect the report comes as economists attempt to size up the ramifications of the shakeout in global share prices in august following the credit crunch triggered by the us housing market crisis .
at the same time , the institutes joined a growing list of forecasters who have revised down their growth outlook for germany .
high oil prices , the strong euro and financial market uncertainty will " dampen growth , " roland döhrn , an economist with the essen-based institute for scientific research -lrb- rwi -rrb- , told a press conference following the release of the report .
in their last report in the spring , the institutes projected a growth rate for germany of 2.4 percent in both 2007 and 2008 , with strong export demand powering the nation 's economic performance .
export growth likely to decline since then , however , the euro has climbed to an all-time high of $ 1.43 as fears have set in about the us economic outlook , consequently fuelling concerns about the prospects for germany 's key export machine .
the institutes predict german export growth will decline to 3 percent in 2008 from 3.5 percent this year , with stronger private consumption emerging as a key pillar of growth .
the institutes are also forecasting private consumption to grow by 1.5 percent next year compared to just 0.2 percent in 2007 .
the release of the institutes ' report is expected to lead to the german government also scaling back its growth projections for the nation .
germany emerged last year from a protracted period of stagnation , with a recent solid growth rate helping to ease the nation 's high unemployment .
larger reduction in unemployment that expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german unemployment dropped in september the number of people out of work in germany fell more than expected in september , data released last month showed , with employers continuing to hire on the back of the economic upswing and years of wage restraint .
the institutes expect unemployment to continue falling to average 7.9 percent in 2008 compared to 8.7 percent in 2007 .
germany 's jobless rate stood at 10.3 percent last year .
apart from the rwi , the german institutes involved in drawing up the report included the kiel institute for the world economy -lrb- ifw -rrb- , halle institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- and the munich- based ifo institute for economic research . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 the european treaty : frequently asked questions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu be hanging out the decorations in celebration of the treaty come december ?
the european treaty has loomed large on the horizon of the eu political landscape for the past few weeks as eu leaders prepare to agree on the its final text on oct .
18-19 . this week 's eu summit in lisbon is an informal meeting for heads of state to see the results of legal work carried out on the european treaty over the autumn .
if the reformed treaty text is approved it will then go forward to a formal heads of state meeting in brussels in december .
if the treat receives the leaders ' approval again it will then be sent for ratification by all 27 eu member states . but what is the european treaty and what is all the fuss about ?
dw-world.de answers some of the most pertinent questions . what is the european reform treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution has made way for the treaty after the failure of its forerunner , the european constitution , which was rejected in 2005 by voters in france and the netherlands , the european reform treaty was conceived as an alternative series of amendments to two existing eu treaties , the treaty on the european union -lrb- maastricht -rrb- and the treaty establishing the european community -lrb- rome -rrb- . the idea is that the reform treaty will be a blueprint for running the expanded european union more efficiently .
the reform treaty was presented to the eu leaders in brussels in july by the portuguese presidency , after an initial hard-fought agreement on its text was hammered out in under berlin 's leadership in june . what will the european reform treaty do ? the eu leaders will decide on the final draft for the european reform treaty in lisbon on oct .
18-19 and so the precise wording of the treaty has yet to be agreed .
however , the document is expected to include the following : create the role of european president this is one of the most controversial proposals as the idea was initially opposed by smaller eu nations but was forced through by the larger member states .
the presidential role has official backing but opposition and resentment remain .
the president would serve a two-and-a half-year term , replacing the current system of a rotating six-month presidency , and will not be allowed to serve more than two terms . create the role of eu high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy essentially the eu 's foreign minister -lrb- as proposed in the constitution -rrb- , this role will combine the posts of current foreign affairs chief javier solana , and the external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and will be the eu 's point person for world affairs .
reduce the size of the european commission just as the european parliament recently announced that the number of parliamentarians would be capped at 750 regardless of new countries joining the bloc , the eu commission will reduce the number of its commissioners .
there will be fewer commissioners than member states by 2014 , with only two-thirds of countries supplying a commissioner on a rotational basis . redistribute voting weights among member states this is another controversial aspect that has had many member states , particularly poland and britain , up in arms .
the treaty intends to introduce majority voting , which will allow votes to be carried on a 55 percent majority as long as that majority also represent 65 percent of the european population .
this would be phased in between 2014 and 2017 . give new powers to the european commission , european parliament and european court of justice , in areas such as justice and domestic affairs remove the national veto in a number of areas is the reform treaty just the failed european constitution under a different name ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french , along with the dutch , gave a resounding " non " originally , the reform treaty was described as having " no constitutional characteristics , " but investigations by a number of international analysis groups have noted that only two of the 440 provisions in the reform treaty differ from the original constitution .
the constitution 's references to european flags and anthems , which proved unpopular with voters , have been left out .
however , the existing flag , anthem and european motto - " united in diversity " - will remain . the role of european foreign minister included in the constitution text has also been replaced by the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , and the use of the term " european laws " has been dropped in favor of " european regulations . " what is likely to happen in lisbon and in the future ? the representatives from the 27 eu member states are expected to agree on the final text of the treaty in lisbon and then sign off on the treaty at a summit of european leaders in brussels in december .
much like the process used for the doomed constitution , the treaty will then have to be ratified by all the eu 's member states .
if this is completed , the treaty will come into force in 2009 . ratification was the process that spelled the end of the constitution .
some countries chose to put the constitution to the people in a referendum .
it was killed off by two " no " votes , from france and the netherlands .
to avoid this , most countries are expected to leave the ratification of the treaty to their parliaments , who are expected to back the deal . however , ireland plans to hold a referendum , the danes want one too and so do quite a few dutch , despite their government taking a huge risk by holding out against the will of the people .
the british government promised a referendum on the constitution but never got the chance to hold one as the french and dutch votes made it unnecessary . what could go wrong ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things may not be so clear if some nations cause trouble for the treaty to come into being , all the decisions surrounding it have to be unanimous .
there are a number of wrenches that could potentially end up in the works , specifically those lobbed in from poland and the uk . poland is threatening to block the treaty unless it includes an agreement - known as the ioannina compromise - to allow countries to defer unpalatable decisions that have been agreed by a narrow majority . the british have a number of " red lines " regarding issues of sovereignty in which the uk has an opt-out clause .
the exceptions were agreed to principle in discussions under german leadership in june .
however , britain could pull the treaty plug if the legal work carried out on the treaty text since june adapts or removes any of these " red lines . " while these two offer the greatest threats to the treaty , the most bizarre arguably comes from bulgaria .
sofia is threatening to derail the treaty over the spelling of euro currency , which it insists should be " evro " in its cyrillic alphabet . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

currently in berlin , he took time off from writing to discuss his latest work and what 's going wrong in both of his home countries . with his 2003 debut " the russian debutante 's handbook " and the follow-up " absurdistan " from 2006 , gary shteyngart established his credentials as one of the english language 's best young writers and a satirist with a talent for highlighting the absurdities of both the east and the west after the cold war .
now he 's trying something a bit different .
dw-world.de : your books have been read and marketed as part of a new immigrant literature in the us , but they 're not at all earnest or politically correct .
why is that ?
gary shteyngart : well , first of all , because i was very unlucky and got sent to this horrible hebrew school .
if it was n't for those eight years being told by rabbis that the holocaust happened because i ate a piece of pork salami , i do n't think you would have had books like " absurdistan . "
that took away any sense i might have had about anything being sacred .
unless you were an idiot , you could see from a mile away that a lot of things were just plain stupid and very coercive .
then i went to a really great high school in manhattan that was a true melting pot , a holding pen for multinational nerds .
it was a place where chinese , russian and indian people gathered together , and it was a real free-for-all .
then i went to oberlin college , and that was the final straw .
from the moment i got there i just wanted to make fun of it .
the first week i was there , i got chewed out for calling some a freshman instead of a " fresh person , " and there was a professor who had devoted his life to translating brezhnev 's works into yiddish .
so that was maybe the best part of my education since it gave me such wonderful targets to go after .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of " absurdistan " is called " snack daddy 's adventurous trip " you 're working on a new book as a fellow of the american academy here in berlin .
what 's the novel about ?
it 's the first book i 've set almost entirely in america , and it takes place - god help me because the phrase " speculative fiction " makes my skin crawl - in the near future .
it follows the love affair of two immigrants , as america slowly disintegrates .
new york and los angeles have become two heavily guarded areas , or what i call " cooperative exclusion zones . "
a small group of rich shareholders achieve immortality , while the vast majority of the population loses the ability to speak , read and write in english .
and that 's what happens to one of the two lovers .
that 's very different from your first two books , which feature unscrupulous us-immigrant protagonists forced to go back to an absurd , violent and materialistic eastern europe .
one sets up a pyramid scheme in prague , while the other tries to procure a fake passport amidst a halliburton-sponsored war in the caucasus .
why the change in the emphasis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of eastern european oil is a shteyngart speciality well , i ca n't do the same story over and over again .
the first book , " the russian debutante 's handbook , " dealt with the rise of turbo-capitalism in eastern europe , and the second , " absurdistan , " took that further by bringing in us foreign policy , specifically the politics of the oil industry .
the third one deals with the fact that we in the us have become " absurdistan " in some respects , for instance , in our approach to human rights issues , privacy and upholding the constitution .
one of the worst outcomes of 9/11 is that many of the people who traditionally came to america are now having second thoughts about that .
i also wanted to write about the baby boomers ' inability to come to terms with their own mortality .
and lastly , this book features a love affair that runs from page one to page 350 or whatever .
i 've never done that before .
why come to berlin if the book is set almost entirely in america ?
i work a lot better off-shore , so to speak , than in america .
there 's something about being in countries where i do n't speak the language .
most of " absurdistan " was written in italy .
and i 'm working much faster here than i ever have before .
like in new york , there 's both an excitement and a gloom about the city , but what interests me is that , unlike new york , there 's a real collision of east and west here .
to think that we 're only an hour and a half from poland here is really amazing .
what do you think then about the latest developments in eastern europe , in particular vladimir putin 's russia ?
some of them resemble the fictional scenarios you created in " absurdistan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shteyngart says both bush and putin have betrayed the ideals of democracy i began writing that book before 9/11 and before halliburton got so involved in iraq .
but i was observing events in azerbaijan and georgia , and the path looked very clear .
in the book i 'm writing now , russia is called " petro-state russia . "
and that 's exactly what russia is - a state run on the profits of natural gas , oil and a couple of other commodities .
putin has done it .
there 's a chance that there will be no opposition parties whatsoever in the next russian election .
there 's not even a pretense of democracy .
basically , putin can have power for life if he wants it .
he can just say : " now i 'm going to be the president , now i 'm going to be the prime minister . "
he 'll just take the power with him from office to office like a traveling bag .
the country has sold out any ideals of democracy it ever had for the idea some sort of stability .
and there 's a huge gap between rich and poor - in my third book , i 'm calling that up and bringing it back to america .
it does n't sound as though you have high hopes for either russia or the us .
i was brought up between these two empires , one of which died and the other of which is dying in its own way .
as far as russia goes , there 's a restaurant in st. petersburg that 's called " 1913 , " which is known as the only good year in russian history .
it 's an autocratic country with an autocratic tradition and an autocratic church .
with america , i feel very much an american these days , because something i love is being destroyed .
for those of us who were displaced at an early age , america was always the place to go to , and the worst result of 9/11 would be that it stops being that . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , to step up reform and warned that europe 's biggest economy faced slowing growth next year . the institutes told the government in their autumn report presented in berlin on thursday that german growth will slip back to 2.2 percent in 2008 from 2.6 percent this year , with a soaring euro , the global credit crunch and surging oil prices undercutting the nation 's expansion rate .
some economists are more pessimistic and believe germany will be lucky to reach a growth rate next year of 2 percent .
the international monetary fund said this week it expects german growth will slip to 2 percent next year from 2.4 percent for 2007 .
thursday 's report was drawn up by four leading german economic institutes in conjunction with research groups from other european nations .
criticism of ineffective reforms coming in the wake of criticism by german business about the failure of angela merkel 's government coalition to press on with economic reform , the institutes said : " much more additional work needs to be done rather than roll back the reforms so far discussed .

currently in berlin , he took time off from writing to discuss his latest work and what 's going wrong in both of his home countries . with his 2003 debut " the russian debutante 's handbook " and the follow-up " absurdistan " from 2006 , gary shteyngart established his credentials as one of the english language 's best young writers and a satirist with a talent for highlighting the absurdities of both the east and the west after the cold war .
now he 's trying something a bit different .
dw-world.de : your books have been read and marketed as part of a new immigrant literature in the us , but they 're not at all earnest or politically correct .
why is that ?
gary shteyngart : well , first of all , because i was very unlucky and got sent to this horrible hebrew school .
if it was n't for those eight years being told by rabbis that the holocaust happened because i ate a piece of pork salami , i do n't think you would have had books like " absurdistan . "
that took away any sense i might have had about anything being sacred .
unless you were an idiot , you could see from a mile away that a lot of things were just plain stupid and very coercive .
then i went to a really great high school in manhattan that was a true melting pot , a holding pen for multinational nerds .
it was a place where chinese , russian and indian people gathered together , and it was a real free-for-all .
then i went to oberlin college , and that was the final straw .
from the moment i got there i just wanted to make fun of it .
the first week i was there , i got chewed out for calling some a freshman instead of a " fresh person , " and there was a professor who had devoted his life to translating brezhnev 's works into yiddish .
so that was maybe the best part of my education since it gave me such wonderful targets to go after .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of " absurdistan " is called " snack daddy 's adventurous trip " you 're working on a new book as a fellow of the american academy here in berlin .
what 's the novel about ?
it 's the first book i 've set almost entirely in america , and it takes place - god help me because the phrase " speculative fiction " makes my skin crawl - in the near future .
it follows the love affair of two immigrants , as america slowly disintegrates .
new york and los angeles have become two heavily guarded areas , or what i call " cooperative exclusion zones . "
a small group of rich shareholders achieve immortality , while the vast majority of the population loses the ability to speak , read and write in english .
and that 's what happens to one of the two lovers .
that 's very different from your first two books , which feature unscrupulous us-immigrant protagonists forced to go back to an absurd , violent and materialistic eastern europe .
one sets up a pyramid scheme in prague , while the other tries to procure a fake passport amidst a halliburton-sponsored war in the caucasus .
why the change in the emphasis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of eastern european oil is a shteyngart speciality well , i ca n't do the same story over and over again .
the first book , " the russian debutante 's handbook , " dealt with the rise of turbo-capitalism in eastern europe , and the second , " absurdistan , " took that further by bringing in us foreign policy , specifically the politics of the oil industry .
the third one deals with the fact that we in the us have become " absurdistan " in some respects , for instance , in our approach to human rights issues , privacy and upholding the constitution .
one of the worst outcomes of 9/11 is that many of the people who traditionally came to america are now having second thoughts about that .
i also wanted to write about the baby boomers ' inability to come to terms with their own mortality .
and lastly , this book features a love affair that runs from page one to page 350 or whatever .
i 've never done that before .
why come to berlin if the book is set almost entirely in america ?
i work a lot better off-shore , so to speak , than in america .
there 's something about being in countries where i do n't speak the language .
most of " absurdistan " was written in italy .
and i 'm working much faster here than i ever have before .
like in new york , there 's both an excitement and a gloom about the city , but what interests me is that , unlike new york , there 's a real collision of east and west here .
to think that we 're only an hour and a half from poland here is really amazing .
what do you think then about the latest developments in eastern europe , in particular vladimir putin 's russia ?
some of them resemble the fictional scenarios you created in " absurdistan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shteyngart says both bush and putin have betrayed the ideals of democracy i began writing that book before 9/11 and before halliburton got so involved in iraq .
but i was observing events in azerbaijan and georgia , and the path looked very clear .
in the book i 'm writing now , russia is called " petro-state russia . "
and that 's exactly what russia is - a state run on the profits of natural gas , oil and a couple of other commodities .
putin has done it .
there 's a chance that there will be no opposition parties whatsoever in the next russian election .
there 's not even a pretense of democracy .
basically , putin can have power for life if he wants it .
he can just say : " now i 'm going to be the president , now i 'm going to be the prime minister . "
he 'll just take the power with him from office to office like a traveling bag .
the country has sold out any ideals of democracy it ever had for the idea some sort of stability .
and there 's a huge gap between rich and poor - in my third book , i 'm calling that up and bringing it back to america .
it does n't sound as though you have high hopes for either russia or the us .
i was brought up between these two empires , one of which died and the other of which is dying in its own way .
as far as russia goes , there 's a restaurant in st. petersburg that 's called " 1913 , " which is known as the only good year in russian history .
it 's an autocratic country with an autocratic tradition and an autocratic church .
with america , i feel very much an american these days , because something i love is being destroyed .
for those of us who were displaced at an early age , america was always the place to go to , and the worst result of 9/11 would be that it stops being that . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon the european treaty : frequently asked questions reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's kaczynski brothers want more power for the ioannina delaying tactic poland is a big fan , although it wants it to go further , and yet it has only been invoked once to resolve a dispute over sardines .
what exactly is the ioannina compromise and why is it so important to the eu treaty ? the so-called " ioannina compromise " is one of the most talked-about and perhaps least well-understood issues relating to the ongoing reform treaty negotiations .
the term was coined after an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers which took place in ioannina , a greek city north of athens , in 1994 .
broadly speaking , the ioannina compromise is a gentlemen 's agreement , a time-out or emergency break designed to reassure individual member states who fear fellow eu members may cut deals which they strongly dislike .
ioannina gives countries a pause to find a solution in essence , if a country feels that its vital interests are threatened but can not muster a blocking minority , the decision is delayed while attempts to find a satisfactory solution are made .
the ioannina mechanism was first proposed when foreign ministers from the then 15-member union were called to discuss how voting rules should change if norway joined the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the initial compromise was lost when the eu signed nice at the meeting , ministers agreed that if eu members wished to oppose a measure but could not muster enough support to block it , they could ask the bloc 's council of member states to do " all within its power , within a reasonable space of time , to reach a satisfactory solution " that would be acceptable to a qualified majority .
norway eventually decided not to join the union , and the " gentlemen 's agreement " remained little more than a curious appendix to the eu decision-making process .
it was superseded by the nice treaty of 2000 , which established new voting rules for the eu ahead of the entry in 2004 of 10 new member states .
poland 's fight over voting rights resurrects ioannina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels agreed on a draft inclusion for the compromise but one of those newcomers - poland - fought hard to resurrect it this year during bitter negotiations over national voting rights in the reform treaty .
and in a bid to find a satisfactory compromise , the then german presidency of the eu in june included a reference to ioannina in an annex of the treaty .
according to the draft agreed last june in brussels , the eu council is forced to freeze decisions if : " -lrb- a -rrb- at least three quarters of the population , or -lrb- b -rrb- at least three quarters of the number of member states necessary to constitute a blocking minority ... indicate their opposition to the council adopting an act by a qualified majority . "
the annex does not place any formal time limits , saying that member states should spend " a reasonable time " looking for an acceptable solution .
kaczynskis want more time and legal framework but poland is campaigning for a " reinforced " ioannina mechanism and argues that two years constitutes a " reasonable time . "
moreover , poland wants the council to make an official decision on ioannina in lisbon and make it legally binding in some form or other .
because the council normally tries to reach decisions by consensus , the original ioannina compromise has been rarely invoked .
experts say there was only one unsuccessful attempt to use it during its limited lifespan : a case involving portuguese sardines . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one which has been around for three decades and which has taught hundreds of kids may not even feature at all . officials in the north german city of bremen have been left searching for an explanation as to how a ' secret ' primary school managed to operate for 30 years and send hundreds of children on to secondary education and beyond without anyone apparently noticing .
after ruling out top secret cloaking devices and the possibility of magic , the authorities are slowly coming to the conclusion that a long line of education ministry officials in the city state have been guilty of incompetence on a major scale .

hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon the european treaty : frequently asked questions reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's kaczynski brothers want more power for the ioannina delaying tactic poland is a big fan , although it wants it to go further , and yet it has only been invoked once to resolve a dispute over sardines .
what exactly is the ioannina compromise and why is it so important to the eu treaty ? the so-called " ioannina compromise " is one of the most talked-about and perhaps least well-understood issues relating to the ongoing reform treaty negotiations .
the term was coined after an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers which took place in ioannina , a greek city north of athens , in 1994 .
broadly speaking , the ioannina compromise is a gentlemen 's agreement , a time-out or emergency break designed to reassure individual member states who fear fellow eu members may cut deals which they strongly dislike .
ioannina gives countries a pause to find a solution in essence , if a country feels that its vital interests are threatened but can not muster a blocking minority , the decision is delayed while attempts to find a satisfactory solution are made .
the ioannina mechanism was first proposed when foreign ministers from the then 15-member union were called to discuss how voting rules should change if norway joined the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the initial compromise was lost when the eu signed nice at the meeting , ministers agreed that if eu members wished to oppose a measure but could not muster enough support to block it , they could ask the bloc 's council of member states to do " all within its power , within a reasonable space of time , to reach a satisfactory solution " that would be acceptable to a qualified majority .
norway eventually decided not to join the union , and the " gentlemen 's agreement " remained little more than a curious appendix to the eu decision-making process .
it was superseded by the nice treaty of 2000 , which established new voting rules for the eu ahead of the entry in 2004 of 10 new member states .
poland 's fight over voting rights resurrects ioannina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels agreed on a draft inclusion for the compromise but one of those newcomers - poland - fought hard to resurrect it this year during bitter negotiations over national voting rights in the reform treaty .
and in a bid to find a satisfactory compromise , the then german presidency of the eu in june included a reference to ioannina in an annex of the treaty .
according to the draft agreed last june in brussels , the eu council is forced to freeze decisions if : " -lrb- a -rrb- at least three quarters of the population , or -lrb- b -rrb- at least three quarters of the number of member states necessary to constitute a blocking minority ... indicate their opposition to the council adopting an act by a qualified majority . "
the annex does not place any formal time limits , saying that member states should spend " a reasonable time " looking for an acceptable solution .
kaczynskis want more time and legal framework but poland is campaigning for a " reinforced " ioannina mechanism and argues that two years constitutes a " reasonable time . "
moreover , poland wants the council to make an official decision on ioannina in lisbon and make it legally binding in some form or other .
because the council normally tries to reach decisions by consensus , the original ioannina compromise has been rarely invoked .
experts say there was only one unsuccessful attempt to use it during its limited lifespan : a case involving portuguese sardines . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 18.10.2007 russian-american author sees bleak future for democracy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shteyngart describes russia and the us as dying and soon-to-be-dead empires novelist gary shteyngart was born in russia but moved to the us at age seven .
currently in berlin , he took time off from writing to discuss his latest work and what 's going wrong in both of his home countries . with his 2003 debut " the russian debutante 's handbook " and the follow-up " absurdistan " from 2006 , gary shteyngart established his credentials as one of the english language 's best young writers and a satirist with a talent for highlighting the absurdities of both the east and the west after the cold war .
now he 's trying something a bit different .
dw-world.de : your books have been read and marketed as part of a new immigrant literature in the us , but they 're not at all earnest or politically correct .
why is that ?
gary shteyngart : well , first of all , because i was very unlucky and got sent to this horrible hebrew school .
if it was n't for those eight years being told by rabbis that the holocaust happened because i ate a piece of pork salami , i do n't think you would have had books like " absurdistan . "
that took away any sense i might have had about anything being sacred .
unless you were an idiot , you could see from a mile away that a lot of things were just plain stupid and very coercive .
then i went to a really great high school in manhattan that was a true melting pot , a holding pen for multinational nerds .
it was a place where chinese , russian and indian people gathered together , and it was a real free-for-all .
then i went to oberlin college , and that was the final straw .
from the moment i got there i just wanted to make fun of it .
the first week i was there , i got chewed out for calling some a freshman instead of a " fresh person , " and there was a professor who had devoted his life to translating brezhnev 's works into yiddish .
so that was maybe the best part of my education since it gave me such wonderful targets to go after .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of " absurdistan " is called " snack daddy 's adventurous trip " you 're working on a new book as a fellow of the american academy here in berlin .
what 's the novel about ?
it 's the first book i 've set almost entirely in america , and it takes place - god help me because the phrase " speculative fiction " makes my skin crawl - in the near future .
it follows the love affair of two immigrants , as america slowly disintegrates .
new york and los angeles have become two heavily guarded areas , or what i call " cooperative exclusion zones . "
a small group of rich shareholders achieve immortality , while the vast majority of the population loses the ability to speak , read and write in english .
and that 's what happens to one of the two lovers .
that 's very different from your first two books , which feature unscrupulous us-immigrant protagonists forced to go back to an absurd , violent and materialistic eastern europe .
one sets up a pyramid scheme in prague , while the other tries to procure a fake passport amidst a halliburton-sponsored war in the caucasus .
why the change in the emphasis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of eastern european oil is a shteyngart speciality well , i ca n't do the same story over and over again .
the first book , " the russian debutante 's handbook , " dealt with the rise of turbo-capitalism in eastern europe , and the second , " absurdistan , " took that further by bringing in us foreign policy , specifically the politics of the oil industry .
the third one deals with the fact that we in the us have become " absurdistan " in some respects , for instance , in our approach to human rights issues , privacy and upholding the constitution .
one of the worst outcomes of 9/11 is that many of the people who traditionally came to america are now having second thoughts about that .
i also wanted to write about the baby boomers ' inability to come to terms with their own mortality .
and lastly , this book features a love affair that runs from page one to page 350 or whatever .
i 've never done that before .
why come to berlin if the book is set almost entirely in america ?
i work a lot better off-shore , so to speak , than in america .
there 's something about being in countries where i do n't speak the language .
most of " absurdistan " was written in italy .
and i 'm working much faster here than i ever have before .
like in new york , there 's both an excitement and a gloom about the city , but what interests me is that , unlike new york , there 's a real collision of east and west here .
to think that we 're only an hour and a half from poland here is really amazing .
what do you think then about the latest developments in eastern europe , in particular vladimir putin 's russia ?
some of them resemble the fictional scenarios you created in " absurdistan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shteyngart says both bush and putin have betrayed the ideals of democracy i began writing that book before 9/11 and before halliburton got so involved in iraq .
but i was observing events in azerbaijan and georgia , and the path looked very clear .
in the book i 'm writing now , russia is called " petro-state russia . "
and that 's exactly what russia is - a state run on the profits of natural gas , oil and a couple of other commodities .
putin has done it .
there 's a chance that there will be no opposition parties whatsoever in the next russian election .
there 's not even a pretense of democracy .
basically , putin can have power for life if he wants it .
he can just say : " now i 'm going to be the president , now i 'm going to be the prime minister . "
he 'll just take the power with him from office to office like a traveling bag .
the country has sold out any ideals of democracy it ever had for the idea some sort of stability .
and there 's a huge gap between rich and poor - in my third book , i 'm calling that up and bringing it back to america .
it does n't sound as though you have high hopes for either russia or the us .
i was brought up between these two empires , one of which died and the other of which is dying in its own way .
as far as russia goes , there 's a restaurant in st. petersburg that 's called " 1913 , " which is known as the only good year in russian history .
it 's an autocratic country with an autocratic tradition and an autocratic church .
with america , i feel very much an american these days , because something i love is being destroyed .
for those of us who were displaced at an early age , america was always the place to go to , and the worst result of 9/11 would be that it stops being that . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , to step up reform and warned that europe 's biggest economy faced slowing growth next year . the institutes told the government in their autumn report presented in berlin on thursday that german growth will slip back to 2.2 percent in 2008 from 2.6 percent this year , with a soaring euro , the global credit crunch and surging oil prices undercutting the nation 's expansion rate .
some economists are more pessimistic and believe germany will be lucky to reach a growth rate next year of 2 percent .
the international monetary fund said this week it expects german growth will slip to 2 percent next year from 2.4 percent for 2007 .
thursday 's report was drawn up by four leading german economic institutes in conjunction with research groups from other european nations .
criticism of ineffective reforms coming in the wake of criticism by german business about the failure of angela merkel 's government coalition to press on with economic reform , the institutes said : " much more additional work needs to be done rather than roll back the reforms so far discussed .
" the labor market reform course of the last few years has not progressed , " the institutes added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us housing market crisis had a knock-on effect the report comes as economists attempt to size up the ramifications of the shakeout in global share prices in august following the credit crunch triggered by the us housing market crisis .
at the same time , the institutes joined a growing list of forecasters who have revised down their growth outlook for germany .
high oil prices , the strong euro and financial market uncertainty will " dampen growth , " roland döhrn , an economist with the essen-based institute for scientific research -lrb- rwi -rrb- , told a press conference following the release of the report .
in their last report in the spring , the institutes projected a growth rate for germany of 2.4 percent in both 2007 and 2008 , with strong export demand powering the nation 's economic performance .
export growth likely to decline since then , however , the euro has climbed to an all-time high of $ 1.43 as fears have set in about the us economic outlook , consequently fuelling concerns about the prospects for germany 's key export machine .
the institutes predict german export growth will decline to 3 percent in 2008 from 3.5 percent this year , with stronger private consumption emerging as a key pillar of growth .
the institutes are also forecasting private consumption to grow by 1.5 percent next year compared to just 0.2 percent in 2007 .
the release of the institutes ' report is expected to lead to the german government also scaling back its growth projections for the nation .
germany emerged last year from a protracted period of stagnation , with a recent solid growth rate helping to ease the nation 's high unemployment .
larger reduction in unemployment that expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german unemployment dropped in september the number of people out of work in germany fell more than expected in september , data released last month showed , with employers continuing to hire on the back of the economic upswing and years of wage restraint .
the institutes expect unemployment to continue falling to average 7.9 percent in 2008 compared to 8.7 percent in 2007 .
germany 's jobless rate stood at 10.3 percent last year .
apart from the rwi , the german institutes involved in drawing up the report included the kiel institute for the world economy -lrb- ifw -rrb- , halle institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- and the munich- based ifo institute for economic research . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

currently in berlin , he took time off from writing to discuss his latest work and what 's going wrong in both of his home countries . with his 2003 debut " the russian debutante 's handbook " and the follow-up " absurdistan " from 2006 , gary shteyngart established his credentials as one of the english language 's best young writers and a satirist with a talent for highlighting the absurdities of both the east and the west after the cold war .
now he 's trying something a bit different .
dw-world.de : your books have been read and marketed as part of a new immigrant literature in the us , but they 're not at all earnest or politically correct .
why is that ?
gary shteyngart : well , first of all , because i was very unlucky and got sent to this horrible hebrew school .
if it was n't for those eight years being told by rabbis that the holocaust happened because i ate a piece of pork salami , i do n't think you would have had books like " absurdistan . "
that took away any sense i might have had about anything being sacred .
unless you were an idiot , you could see from a mile away that a lot of things were just plain stupid and very coercive .
then i went to a really great high school in manhattan that was a true melting pot , a holding pen for multinational nerds .
it was a place where chinese , russian and indian people gathered together , and it was a real free-for-all .
then i went to oberlin college , and that was the final straw .
from the moment i got there i just wanted to make fun of it .
the first week i was there , i got chewed out for calling some a freshman instead of a " fresh person , " and there was a professor who had devoted his life to translating brezhnev 's works into yiddish .
so that was maybe the best part of my education since it gave me such wonderful targets to go after .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of " absurdistan " is called " snack daddy 's adventurous trip " you 're working on a new book as a fellow of the american academy here in berlin .
what 's the novel about ?
it 's the first book i 've set almost entirely in america , and it takes place - god help me because the phrase " speculative fiction " makes my skin crawl - in the near future .
it follows the love affair of two immigrants , as america slowly disintegrates .
new york and los angeles have become two heavily guarded areas , or what i call " cooperative exclusion zones . "
a small group of rich shareholders achieve immortality , while the vast majority of the population loses the ability to speak , read and write in english .
and that 's what happens to one of the two lovers .
that 's very different from your first two books , which feature unscrupulous us-immigrant protagonists forced to go back to an absurd , violent and materialistic eastern europe .
one sets up a pyramid scheme in prague , while the other tries to procure a fake passport amidst a halliburton-sponsored war in the caucasus .
why the change in the emphasis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of eastern european oil is a shteyngart speciality well , i ca n't do the same story over and over again .
the first book , " the russian debutante 's handbook , " dealt with the rise of turbo-capitalism in eastern europe , and the second , " absurdistan , " took that further by bringing in us foreign policy , specifically the politics of the oil industry .
the third one deals with the fact that we in the us have become " absurdistan " in some respects , for instance , in our approach to human rights issues , privacy and upholding the constitution .
one of the worst outcomes of 9/11 is that many of the people who traditionally came to america are now having second thoughts about that .
i also wanted to write about the baby boomers ' inability to come to terms with their own mortality .
and lastly , this book features a love affair that runs from page one to page 350 or whatever .
i 've never done that before .
why come to berlin if the book is set almost entirely in america ?
i work a lot better off-shore , so to speak , than in america .
there 's something about being in countries where i do n't speak the language .
most of " absurdistan " was written in italy .
and i 'm working much faster here than i ever have before .
like in new york , there 's both an excitement and a gloom about the city , but what interests me is that , unlike new york , there 's a real collision of east and west here .
to think that we 're only an hour and a half from poland here is really amazing .
what do you think then about the latest developments in eastern europe , in particular vladimir putin 's russia ?
some of them resemble the fictional scenarios you created in " absurdistan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shteyngart says both bush and putin have betrayed the ideals of democracy i began writing that book before 9/11 and before halliburton got so involved in iraq .
but i was observing events in azerbaijan and georgia , and the path looked very clear .
in the book i 'm writing now , russia is called " petro-state russia . "
and that 's exactly what russia is - a state run on the profits of natural gas , oil and a couple of other commodities .
putin has done it .
there 's a chance that there will be no opposition parties whatsoever in the next russian election .
there 's not even a pretense of democracy .
basically , putin can have power for life if he wants it .
he can just say : " now i 'm going to be the president , now i 'm going to be the prime minister . "
he 'll just take the power with him from office to office like a traveling bag .
the country has sold out any ideals of democracy it ever had for the idea some sort of stability .
and there 's a huge gap between rich and poor - in my third book , i 'm calling that up and bringing it back to america .
it does n't sound as though you have high hopes for either russia or the us .
i was brought up between these two empires , one of which died and the other of which is dying in its own way .
as far as russia goes , there 's a restaurant in st. petersburg that 's called " 1913 , " which is known as the only good year in russian history .
it 's an autocratic country with an autocratic tradition and an autocratic church .
with america , i feel very much an american these days , because something i love is being destroyed .
for those of us who were displaced at an early age , america was always the place to go to , and the worst result of 9/11 would be that it stops being that . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what exactly is the ioannina compromise and why is it so important to the eu treaty ? the so-called " ioannina compromise " is one of the most talked-about and perhaps least well-understood issues relating to the ongoing reform treaty negotiations .
the term was coined after an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers which took place in ioannina , a greek city north of athens , in 1994 .
broadly speaking , the ioannina compromise is a gentlemen 's agreement , a time-out or emergency break designed to reassure individual member states who fear fellow eu members may cut deals which they strongly dislike .
ioannina gives countries a pause to find a solution in essence , if a country feels that its vital interests are threatened but can not muster a blocking minority , the decision is delayed while attempts to find a satisfactory solution are made .
the ioannina mechanism was first proposed when foreign ministers from the then 15-member union were called to discuss how voting rules should change if norway joined the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the initial compromise was lost when the eu signed nice at the meeting , ministers agreed that if eu members wished to oppose a measure but could not muster enough support to block it , they could ask the bloc 's council of member states to do " all within its power , within a reasonable space of time , to reach a satisfactory solution " that would be acceptable to a qualified majority .
norway eventually decided not to join the union , and the " gentlemen 's agreement " remained little more than a curious appendix to the eu decision-making process .
it was superseded by the nice treaty of 2000 , which established new voting rules for the eu ahead of the entry in 2004 of 10 new member states .
poland 's fight over voting rights resurrects ioannina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels agreed on a draft inclusion for the compromise but one of those newcomers - poland - fought hard to resurrect it this year during bitter negotiations over national voting rights in the reform treaty .
and in a bid to find a satisfactory compromise , the then german presidency of the eu in june included a reference to ioannina in an annex of the treaty .
according to the draft agreed last june in brussels , the eu council is forced to freeze decisions if : " -lrb- a -rrb- at least three quarters of the population , or -lrb- b -rrb- at least three quarters of the number of member states necessary to constitute a blocking minority ... indicate their opposition to the council adopting an act by a qualified majority . "
the annex does not place any formal time limits , saying that member states should spend " a reasonable time " looking for an acceptable solution .
kaczynskis want more time and legal framework but poland is campaigning for a " reinforced " ioannina mechanism and argues that two years constitutes a " reasonable time . "
moreover , poland wants the council to make an official decision on ioannina in lisbon and make it legally binding in some form or other .
because the council normally tries to reach decisions by consensus , the original ioannina compromise has been rarely invoked .
experts say there was only one unsuccessful attempt to use it during its limited lifespan : a case involving portuguese sardines . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he ’ s 25 years old and frankfurt 's new captain for this season .
things are going well for the striker at the moment .
his team is seventh on the table and he just shot greece into euro 2008 . dw-tv : first of all : should we refer to each other formally or by first name ?
ioannis amanatidis : using first names is fine .
okay , that 's good .
my name 's andré ...
i 'm ianni .
ianni , i 'm from australia and as an australian i 've spent the last months watching the cricket world cup and rugby world cup .
it was great .
why should i come down on a saturday afternoon and watch frankfurt play ?
i think in europe , and especially germany , football really is the number one sport .
you can see that when you go to a game .
the stadium here is fantastic , with a great atmosphere .
every week we have basically a sell out crowd .
the feeling is indescribable .
you just have to be there yourself and experience it .
you 've played with a few teams in germany : fürth , kaiserslautern , stuttgart .
what 's so special about frankfurt ?
i 've been pretty much everywhere in southern germany , that 's true .
but somehow i just could n't leave frankfurt .
i just like it here i suppose .
i 've played the majority of my bundesliga games for frankfurt , scored most of my goals here and when i 'm moving around the city i feel comfortable .
if i go away and visit friends - to stuttgart or wherever - then i immediately feel at home when i drive back in to the city .
that 's a satisfying feeling .
you mention feeling at home here ... but you were born in kozani , in northern greece .
what was life like back then ?
it was a simple village life .
i lived there until i was 9 years old and went to school there .
well actually as soon as i got home from school i went and played football on the street with my friends .
sometimes i got in trouble because there was homework that needed doing ... other times i just slipped off without anyone noticing .
i suppose you could say that greek village life is a bit more relaxed than living here .
then my family decided that we were going to move to germany .
you are now in the greek international side , have been for a while in fact .
do you have goals at that level ?
of course .
i want to play for greece as much as i can .
when i first came in to the national team i was 21 or 22 and was playing only irregularly .
now i have established myself .
if i stay fit and perform at my best , i should be playing .
and that 's the goal .
and if i am on the field then i want to show what i can do - for my country and for our fans , my countrymen , who always come and support us .
speaking of countrymen : there is another greek player at frankfurt , sotirios kyrgiakos .
what 's it like having him on the pitch for you as captain ? he 's still having difficulties with his german , probably because he does n't want to speak the language .
but that 's not important because we all speak a type of football language with each other anyway .
for that reason language is n't so important and he does n't have to learn german , but it might help him in his private life .
he helps our team immensely on the field .
i help him in training and on the field to understand what 's going on .
it 's good that he 's here in frankfurt - he strengthens our team and that 's the most important thing .
you must have personal goals though at frankfurt .
what do you aim for yourself at the start of each season ?
do you say : i want 20 goals ?
no , i do n't believe in that .
i put the team first and its success .
if we are successful , if we play well and develop our game , then each one of us will develop individually anyway .
that 's a basic principle but you have to understand it .
i will never say : i want 10 , 15 or 20 goals in a season .
i 've scored three thus far , that 's okay .
i would certainly like to score a few more this season .
but the specific number is unimportant .
let 's say , hypothetically , you are playing for frankfurt in the german cup and you score a goal .
two months later you score a goal for greece in the european championships .
what 's more important for you , personally ?
well , it depends .
if it was the third or fourth goal in a game then it 's not so important as when it is a tight 1-0 win .
if it was the 1-0 for greece then i would prefer to score that than the 4-0 for frankfurt because there the game has already been won !
a very diplomatic answer .
okay , ianni , thanks for your time .
no worries .

a leading jewish organization called the findings " ugly , disastrous and sad . " a popular german talk show host was recently fired for praising hitler 's family policies . the nazis encouraged women to stay at home , look after their husbands , and produce and rear children .
the incident has sparked a debate in germany over whether it is acceptable to say anything positive about the nazis , 62 years after the end of world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva herman got fired for her comments a recent poll shows that a quarter of germans agree that nazi rule had some positive aspects .
the weekly stern magazine commissioned the forsa agency to conduct the poll after talk show host eva herman was fired from germany 's ndr public broadcaster last month for her comments on the third reich and motherhood .
pollsters asked whether national socialism had any good points .
twenty-five percent of the respondents said " yes , " citing the construction of the famous autobahn or network of highways , low unemployment and crime rate and a strong sense of family as examples .
" the insecurity about how to deal with nazism is huge .
as is ignorance .
eva herman has unwittingly kicked off a long-neglected debate , " stern magazine wrote in a cover story .
the poll , released wednesday , oct .
17 , was conducted a week earlier .
poll should be a " warning sign " the poll results have sparked condemnation from the central council of jews in germany .
dieter graumann , vice president of the council , said that the poll should be considered a " warning sign . "
" the result of the poll is ugly , disastrous and makes me sad and angry , " he told the netzeitung online newspaper .
still , he cautioned against " alarmism " and called for more education about the nazi period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis wanted to create a " master race " the blue-eyed , blonde-haired herman got into trouble while presenting her latest book .
news reports quoted her as saying that while adolf hitler was very bad , there were good things about nazi rule as well .
she cited " the high regard for the mother " as an example and said she regretted that family values nurtured by the nazis had been swept away .
she was recently thrown off a talk show after refusing to apologize for her comments .
the nazis offered incentives to child-bearing women .
yet their family policies were part of a racist ideology whose goal was the creation of a master race .
it 's not the first time the 48-year-old herman has ruffled feathers .
she angered feminists last year when she said women should raise children rather than pursue careers of their own .
herman insists that her latest comments were taken out of context . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained the european treaty : frequently asked questions the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 eu treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european union edges closer to a treaty that could make it more efficient after months of political skirmishes , eu leaders are expected to clinch a long-awaited deal on the european treaty , a document many claim will make the eu more efficient and give it more credibility . despite the assertions that the eu will finally get a new treaty which will make it easier for the bloc to manage itself , there are still some who harbor reservations .
the two-day informal summit beginning in lisbon on thursday , oct .
18 , will bring the reformed treaty one step closer to a final agreement , with representatives of the 27 eu member states expected to agree on the final text .
but failure is still possible for the document . the issues of a polish request for a mechanism allowing minorities to delay decisions that they do not like to be made legally binding and british demands to be granted an opt-out on european policies in the field of justice and domestic affairs are expected to dominate the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will gordon brown 's " red lines " be responsible for axing the reform treaty ?
however , a number of countries , including austria , britain , denmark and italy , have also expressed concerns - not all of them strictly connected to the treaty 's contents .
with the treaty relying on unanimity to get through to the final stage at a summit in brussels in december , any one country , if dissatisfied , could send the eu planners back to the drawing board .
on the positive side , the treaty has the strong backing of eu heavyweights germany and france , in contrast to the constitution draft that preceded it and was rejected by dutch and french voters in 2005 .
opposition getting quieter and quieter as the lisbon meeting gets closer , fewer and fewer dissenting voices can be heard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski has been more positive of late the czech republic , whose euroskeptic governing coalition had previously warned that the treaty would devolve too much power to brussels , recently described it as " a reasonable compromise . "
even poland , by far the most critical voice , has been scaling down its objections in the run-up to the meeting . " i am convinced it will be a success , " polish president lech kaczynski said ahead of a meeting with german chancellor angela merkel in berlin last friday .
comments of this nature have encouraged diplomats and experts in brussels to become " quietly optimistic " that community spirit will prevail over national interests once leaders gather in the portuguese capital .
eu 's size necessitates reform if a deal is indeed clinched in lisbon , it will represent a key step forward in giving the world 's biggest economic entity a much-needed political boost .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu table creaks under the weight of enlargement eu leaders first realized they would have to improve the bloc 's laborious decision-making process in view of its enlargement to 27 member states at the beginning of the new millennium .

a leading jewish organization called the findings " ugly , disastrous and sad . " a popular german talk show host was recently fired for praising hitler 's family policies . the nazis encouraged women to stay at home , look after their husbands , and produce and rear children .
the incident has sparked a debate in germany over whether it is acceptable to say anything positive about the nazis , 62 years after the end of world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva herman got fired for her comments a recent poll shows that a quarter of germans agree that nazi rule had some positive aspects .
the weekly stern magazine commissioned the forsa agency to conduct the poll after talk show host eva herman was fired from germany 's ndr public broadcaster last month for her comments on the third reich and motherhood .
pollsters asked whether national socialism had any good points .
twenty-five percent of the respondents said " yes , " citing the construction of the famous autobahn or network of highways , low unemployment and crime rate and a strong sense of family as examples .
" the insecurity about how to deal with nazism is huge .
as is ignorance .
eva herman has unwittingly kicked off a long-neglected debate , " stern magazine wrote in a cover story .
the poll , released wednesday , oct .
17 , was conducted a week earlier .
poll should be a " warning sign " the poll results have sparked condemnation from the central council of jews in germany .
dieter graumann , vice president of the council , said that the poll should be considered a " warning sign . "
" the result of the poll is ugly , disastrous and makes me sad and angry , " he told the netzeitung online newspaper .
still , he cautioned against " alarmism " and called for more education about the nazi period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis wanted to create a " master race " the blue-eyed , blonde-haired herman got into trouble while presenting her latest book .
news reports quoted her as saying that while adolf hitler was very bad , there were good things about nazi rule as well .
she cited " the high regard for the mother " as an example and said she regretted that family values nurtured by the nazis had been swept away .
she was recently thrown off a talk show after refusing to apologize for her comments .
the nazis offered incentives to child-bearing women .
yet their family policies were part of a racist ideology whose goal was the creation of a master race .
it 's not the first time the 48-year-old herman has ruffled feathers .
she angered feminists last year when she said women should raise children rather than pursue careers of their own .
herman insists that her latest comments were taken out of context . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nazis offered incentives to child-bearing women .

hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 the european treaty : frequently asked questions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu be hanging out the decorations in celebration of the treaty come december ?
the european treaty has loomed large on the horizon of the eu political landscape for the past few weeks as eu leaders prepare to agree on the its final text on oct .
18-19 . this week 's eu summit in lisbon is an informal meeting for heads of state to see the results of legal work carried out on the european treaty over the autumn .
if the reformed treaty text is approved it will then go forward to a formal heads of state meeting in brussels in december .
if the treat receives the leaders ' approval again it will then be sent for ratification by all 27 eu member states . but what is the european treaty and what is all the fuss about ?
dw-world.de answers some of the most pertinent questions . what is the european reform treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution has made way for the treaty after the failure of its forerunner , the european constitution , which was rejected in 2005 by voters in france and the netherlands , the european reform treaty was conceived as an alternative series of amendments to two existing eu treaties , the treaty on the european union -lrb- maastricht -rrb- and the treaty establishing the european community -lrb- rome -rrb- . the idea is that the reform treaty will be a blueprint for running the expanded european union more efficiently .
the reform treaty was presented to the eu leaders in brussels in july by the portuguese presidency , after an initial hard-fought agreement on its text was hammered out in under berlin 's leadership in june . what will the european reform treaty do ? the eu leaders will decide on the final draft for the european reform treaty in lisbon on oct .
18-19 and so the precise wording of the treaty has yet to be agreed .
however , the document is expected to include the following : create the role of european president this is one of the most controversial proposals as the idea was initially opposed by smaller eu nations but was forced through by the larger member states .
the presidential role has official backing but opposition and resentment remain .
the president would serve a two-and-a half-year term , replacing the current system of a rotating six-month presidency , and will not be allowed to serve more than two terms . create the role of eu high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy essentially the eu 's foreign minister -lrb- as proposed in the constitution -rrb- , this role will combine the posts of current foreign affairs chief javier solana , and the external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and will be the eu 's point person for world affairs .
reduce the size of the european commission just as the european parliament recently announced that the number of parliamentarians would be capped at 750 regardless of new countries joining the bloc , the eu commission will reduce the number of its commissioners .
there will be fewer commissioners than member states by 2014 , with only two-thirds of countries supplying a commissioner on a rotational basis . redistribute voting weights among member states this is another controversial aspect that has had many member states , particularly poland and britain , up in arms .
the treaty intends to introduce majority voting , which will allow votes to be carried on a 55 percent majority as long as that majority also represent 65 percent of the european population .
this would be phased in between 2014 and 2017 . give new powers to the european commission , european parliament and european court of justice , in areas such as justice and domestic affairs remove the national veto in a number of areas is the reform treaty just the failed european constitution under a different name ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french , along with the dutch , gave a resounding " non " originally , the reform treaty was described as having " no constitutional characteristics , " but investigations by a number of international analysis groups have noted that only two of the 440 provisions in the reform treaty differ from the original constitution .
the constitution 's references to european flags and anthems , which proved unpopular with voters , have been left out .
however , the existing flag , anthem and european motto - " united in diversity " - will remain . the role of european foreign minister included in the constitution text has also been replaced by the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , and the use of the term " european laws " has been dropped in favor of " european regulations . " what is likely to happen in lisbon and in the future ? the representatives from the 27 eu member states are expected to agree on the final text of the treaty in lisbon and then sign off on the treaty at a summit of european leaders in brussels in december .
much like the process used for the doomed constitution , the treaty will then have to be ratified by all the eu 's member states .
if this is completed , the treaty will come into force in 2009 . ratification was the process that spelled the end of the constitution .
some countries chose to put the constitution to the people in a referendum .
it was killed off by two " no " votes , from france and the netherlands .
to avoid this , most countries are expected to leave the ratification of the treaty to their parliaments , who are expected to back the deal . however , ireland plans to hold a referendum , the danes want one too and so do quite a few dutch , despite their government taking a huge risk by holding out against the will of the people .
the british government promised a referendum on the constitution but never got the chance to hold one as the french and dutch votes made it unnecessary . what could go wrong ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things may not be so clear if some nations cause trouble for the treaty to come into being , all the decisions surrounding it have to be unanimous .
there are a number of wrenches that could potentially end up in the works , specifically those lobbed in from poland and the uk . poland is threatening to block the treaty unless it includes an agreement - known as the ioannina compromise - to allow countries to defer unpalatable decisions that have been agreed by a narrow majority . the british have a number of " red lines " regarding issues of sovereignty in which the uk has an opt-out clause .
the exceptions were agreed to principle in discussions under german leadership in june .
however , britain could pull the treaty plug if the legal work carried out on the treaty text since june adapts or removes any of these " red lines . " while these two offer the greatest threats to the treaty , the most bizarre arguably comes from bulgaria .
sofia is threatening to derail the treaty over the spelling of euro currency , which it insists should be " evro " in its cyrillic alphabet . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , after meeting with nato and russian officials that washington 's missile shield plans could be changed should iran suspend its nuclear program .
the shield is " intended against the major problem we see developing , which is iran , and if that problem went away or attenuated we would obviously draw conclusions , " said fried .
" this is a threat-based system , and we would be affected if iran gave up its -lsb- uranium -rsb- enrichment and worked with the international community , and had a different approach to things . "
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own defenses .
shield plans could slow down under " right conditions " while fried ruled out any immediate halt , he did suggest that the development of the shield might slow down under the right conditions .
" our position is that our negotiations with the poles and the czechs will continue , but we do n't feel the need to spend money at quite as fast a rate for a threat that is attenuated , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fried assured russia that it was not a target fried also reiterated that the defense shield was needed to guard against threats from " rogue states " like iran or north korea and assured russia once again that it was not a target .
" our real concern is not russia , " he said .
" we are advancing a missile defense program in response to what we see as an iranian ballistic missile and nuclear weapons threat .
" we want -lsb- russia 's -rsb- help , and the help of all responsible nations , to work with iran so this problem is attenuated and goes away , " fried said and added that us officials had explained their stance on iran to the russians , and that " they seemed interested in the concept . "
polish election could affect us relations another factor which may force washington 's hand in adapting its plan for european bases is poland 's parliamentary election on sunday .
poland 's ties with the united states , its cooperation on the defense shield and the presence of polish troops in iraq could all change if prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski loses power .
the centrist civic platform party , the main opposition to kaczynski 's ruling conservatives , is mounting a strong challenge to the current leadership and is gaining support through its leader donald tusk 's assertions that a government under his authority would not want so close a relationship with washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister kaczynski faces a challenge in the polls surveys show most poles want their troops out of iraq and oppose the missile shield .
recent events , including an attack on the polish ambassador in iraq last week , have brought these topics and poland 's foreign policy as a whole to the forefront of the civic platform party 's agenda .
prime minister kaczynski and his twin brother lech , the polish president , have put close ties with the us at the center of poland 's foreign policy alongside a distrust of the eu .

currently in berlin , he took time off from writing to discuss his latest work and what 's going wrong in both of his home countries . with his 2003 debut " the russian debutante 's handbook " and the follow-up " absurdistan " from 2006 , gary shteyngart established his credentials as one of the english language 's best young writers and a satirist with a talent for highlighting the absurdities of both the east and the west after the cold war .
now he 's trying something a bit different .
dw-world.de : your books have been read and marketed as part of a new immigrant literature in the us , but they 're not at all earnest or politically correct .
why is that ?
gary shteyngart : well , first of all , because i was very unlucky and got sent to this horrible hebrew school .
if it was n't for those eight years being told by rabbis that the holocaust happened because i ate a piece of pork salami , i do n't think you would have had books like " absurdistan . "
that took away any sense i might have had about anything being sacred .
unless you were an idiot , you could see from a mile away that a lot of things were just plain stupid and very coercive .
then i went to a really great high school in manhattan that was a true melting pot , a holding pen for multinational nerds .
it was a place where chinese , russian and indian people gathered together , and it was a real free-for-all .
then i went to oberlin college , and that was the final straw .
from the moment i got there i just wanted to make fun of it .
the first week i was there , i got chewed out for calling some a freshman instead of a " fresh person , " and there was a professor who had devoted his life to translating brezhnev 's works into yiddish .
so that was maybe the best part of my education since it gave me such wonderful targets to go after .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of " absurdistan " is called " snack daddy 's adventurous trip " you 're working on a new book as a fellow of the american academy here in berlin .
what 's the novel about ?
it 's the first book i 've set almost entirely in america , and it takes place - god help me because the phrase " speculative fiction " makes my skin crawl - in the near future .
it follows the love affair of two immigrants , as america slowly disintegrates .
new york and los angeles have become two heavily guarded areas , or what i call " cooperative exclusion zones . "
a small group of rich shareholders achieve immortality , while the vast majority of the population loses the ability to speak , read and write in english .
and that 's what happens to one of the two lovers .
that 's very different from your first two books , which feature unscrupulous us-immigrant protagonists forced to go back to an absurd , violent and materialistic eastern europe .
one sets up a pyramid scheme in prague , while the other tries to procure a fake passport amidst a halliburton-sponsored war in the caucasus .
why the change in the emphasis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of eastern european oil is a shteyngart speciality well , i ca n't do the same story over and over again .
the first book , " the russian debutante 's handbook , " dealt with the rise of turbo-capitalism in eastern europe , and the second , " absurdistan , " took that further by bringing in us foreign policy , specifically the politics of the oil industry .
the third one deals with the fact that we in the us have become " absurdistan " in some respects , for instance , in our approach to human rights issues , privacy and upholding the constitution .
one of the worst outcomes of 9/11 is that many of the people who traditionally came to america are now having second thoughts about that .
i also wanted to write about the baby boomers ' inability to come to terms with their own mortality .
and lastly , this book features a love affair that runs from page one to page 350 or whatever .
i 've never done that before .
why come to berlin if the book is set almost entirely in america ?
i work a lot better off-shore , so to speak , than in america .
there 's something about being in countries where i do n't speak the language .
most of " absurdistan " was written in italy .
and i 'm working much faster here than i ever have before .
like in new york , there 's both an excitement and a gloom about the city , but what interests me is that , unlike new york , there 's a real collision of east and west here .
to think that we 're only an hour and a half from poland here is really amazing .
what do you think then about the latest developments in eastern europe , in particular vladimir putin 's russia ?
some of them resemble the fictional scenarios you created in " absurdistan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shteyngart says both bush and putin have betrayed the ideals of democracy i began writing that book before 9/11 and before halliburton got so involved in iraq .
but i was observing events in azerbaijan and georgia , and the path looked very clear .
in the book i 'm writing now , russia is called " petro-state russia . "
and that 's exactly what russia is - a state run on the profits of natural gas , oil and a couple of other commodities .
putin has done it .
there 's a chance that there will be no opposition parties whatsoever in the next russian election .
there 's not even a pretense of democracy .
basically , putin can have power for life if he wants it .
he can just say : " now i 'm going to be the president , now i 'm going to be the prime minister . "
he 'll just take the power with him from office to office like a traveling bag .
the country has sold out any ideals of democracy it ever had for the idea some sort of stability .
and there 's a huge gap between rich and poor - in my third book , i 'm calling that up and bringing it back to america .
it does n't sound as though you have high hopes for either russia or the us .
i was brought up between these two empires , one of which died and the other of which is dying in its own way .
as far as russia goes , there 's a restaurant in st. petersburg that 's called " 1913 , " which is known as the only good year in russian history .
it 's an autocratic country with an autocratic tradition and an autocratic church .
with america , i feel very much an american these days , because something i love is being destroyed .
for those of us who were displaced at an early age , america was always the place to go to , and the worst result of 9/11 would be that it stops being that . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon the european treaty : frequently asked questions reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's kaczynski brothers want more power for the ioannina delaying tactic poland is a big fan , although it wants it to go further , and yet it has only been invoked once to resolve a dispute over sardines .
what exactly is the ioannina compromise and why is it so important to the eu treaty ? the so-called " ioannina compromise " is one of the most talked-about and perhaps least well-understood issues relating to the ongoing reform treaty negotiations .
the term was coined after an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers which took place in ioannina , a greek city north of athens , in 1994 .
broadly speaking , the ioannina compromise is a gentlemen 's agreement , a time-out or emergency break designed to reassure individual member states who fear fellow eu members may cut deals which they strongly dislike .
ioannina gives countries a pause to find a solution in essence , if a country feels that its vital interests are threatened but can not muster a blocking minority , the decision is delayed while attempts to find a satisfactory solution are made .
the ioannina mechanism was first proposed when foreign ministers from the then 15-member union were called to discuss how voting rules should change if norway joined the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the initial compromise was lost when the eu signed nice at the meeting , ministers agreed that if eu members wished to oppose a measure but could not muster enough support to block it , they could ask the bloc 's council of member states to do " all within its power , within a reasonable space of time , to reach a satisfactory solution " that would be acceptable to a qualified majority .
norway eventually decided not to join the union , and the " gentlemen 's agreement " remained little more than a curious appendix to the eu decision-making process .
it was superseded by the nice treaty of 2000 , which established new voting rules for the eu ahead of the entry in 2004 of 10 new member states .
poland 's fight over voting rights resurrects ioannina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels agreed on a draft inclusion for the compromise but one of those newcomers - poland - fought hard to resurrect it this year during bitter negotiations over national voting rights in the reform treaty .
and in a bid to find a satisfactory compromise , the then german presidency of the eu in june included a reference to ioannina in an annex of the treaty .
according to the draft agreed last june in brussels , the eu council is forced to freeze decisions if : " -lrb- a -rrb- at least three quarters of the population , or -lrb- b -rrb- at least three quarters of the number of member states necessary to constitute a blocking minority ... indicate their opposition to the council adopting an act by a qualified majority . "
the annex does not place any formal time limits , saying that member states should spend " a reasonable time " looking for an acceptable solution .
kaczynskis want more time and legal framework but poland is campaigning for a " reinforced " ioannina mechanism and argues that two years constitutes a " reasonable time . "
moreover , poland wants the council to make an official decision on ioannina in lisbon and make it legally binding in some form or other .
because the council normally tries to reach decisions by consensus , the original ioannina compromise has been rarely invoked .
experts say there was only one unsuccessful attempt to use it during its limited lifespan : a case involving portuguese sardines . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he ’ s 25 years old and frankfurt 's new captain for this season .
things are going well for the striker at the moment .
his team is seventh on the table and he just shot greece into euro 2008 . dw-tv : first of all : should we refer to each other formally or by first name ?
ioannis amanatidis : using first names is fine .
okay , that 's good .
my name 's andré ...
i 'm ianni .
ianni , i 'm from australia and as an australian i 've spent the last months watching the cricket world cup and rugby world cup .
it was great .
why should i come down on a saturday afternoon and watch frankfurt play ?
i think in europe , and especially germany , football really is the number one sport .
you can see that when you go to a game .
the stadium here is fantastic , with a great atmosphere .
every week we have basically a sell out crowd .
the feeling is indescribable .
you just have to be there yourself and experience it .
you 've played with a few teams in germany : fürth , kaiserslautern , stuttgart .
what 's so special about frankfurt ?
i 've been pretty much everywhere in southern germany , that 's true .
but somehow i just could n't leave frankfurt .
i just like it here i suppose .
i 've played the majority of my bundesliga games for frankfurt , scored most of my goals here and when i 'm moving around the city i feel comfortable .
if i go away and visit friends - to stuttgart or wherever - then i immediately feel at home when i drive back in to the city .
that 's a satisfying feeling .
you mention feeling at home here ... but you were born in kozani , in northern greece .
what was life like back then ?
it was a simple village life .
i lived there until i was 9 years old and went to school there .
well actually as soon as i got home from school i went and played football on the street with my friends .
sometimes i got in trouble because there was homework that needed doing ... other times i just slipped off without anyone noticing .
i suppose you could say that greek village life is a bit more relaxed than living here .
then my family decided that we were going to move to germany .
you are now in the greek international side , have been for a while in fact .
do you have goals at that level ?
of course .
i want to play for greece as much as i can .
when i first came in to the national team i was 21 or 22 and was playing only irregularly .
now i have established myself .
if i stay fit and perform at my best , i should be playing .
and that 's the goal .
and if i am on the field then i want to show what i can do - for my country and for our fans , my countrymen , who always come and support us .
speaking of countrymen : there is another greek player at frankfurt , sotirios kyrgiakos .
what 's it like having him on the pitch for you as captain ? he 's still having difficulties with his german , probably because he does n't want to speak the language .
but that 's not important because we all speak a type of football language with each other anyway .
for that reason language is n't so important and he does n't have to learn german , but it might help him in his private life .
he helps our team immensely on the field .
i help him in training and on the field to understand what 's going on .
it 's good that he 's here in frankfurt - he strengthens our team and that 's the most important thing .
you must have personal goals though at frankfurt .
what do you aim for yourself at the start of each season ?
do you say : i want 20 goals ?
no , i do n't believe in that .
i put the team first and its success .
if we are successful , if we play well and develop our game , then each one of us will develop individually anyway .
that 's a basic principle but you have to understand it .
i will never say : i want 10 , 15 or 20 goals in a season .
i 've scored three thus far , that 's okay .
i would certainly like to score a few more this season .
but the specific number is unimportant .
let 's say , hypothetically , you are playing for frankfurt in the german cup and you score a goal .
two months later you score a goal for greece in the european championships .
what 's more important for you , personally ?
well , it depends .
if it was the third or fourth goal in a game then it 's not so important as when it is a tight 1-0 win .
if it was the 1-0 for greece then i would prefer to score that than the 4-0 for frankfurt because there the game has already been won !
a very diplomatic answer .
okay , ianni , thanks for your time .

18 , to step up reform and warned that europe 's biggest economy faced slowing growth next year . the institutes told the government in their autumn report presented in berlin on thursday that german growth will slip back to 2.2 percent in 2008 from 2.6 percent this year , with a soaring euro , the global credit crunch and surging oil prices undercutting the nation 's expansion rate .
some economists are more pessimistic and believe germany will be lucky to reach a growth rate next year of 2 percent .
the international monetary fund said this week it expects german growth will slip to 2 percent next year from 2.4 percent for 2007 .
thursday 's report was drawn up by four leading german economic institutes in conjunction with research groups from other european nations .
criticism of ineffective reforms coming in the wake of criticism by german business about the failure of angela merkel 's government coalition to press on with economic reform , the institutes said : " much more additional work needs to be done rather than roll back the reforms so far discussed .
" the labor market reform course of the last few years has not progressed , " the institutes added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us housing market crisis had a knock-on effect the report comes as economists attempt to size up the ramifications of the shakeout in global share prices in august following the credit crunch triggered by the us housing market crisis .
at the same time , the institutes joined a growing list of forecasters who have revised down their growth outlook for germany .
high oil prices , the strong euro and financial market uncertainty will " dampen growth , " roland döhrn , an economist with the essen-based institute for scientific research -lrb- rwi -rrb- , told a press conference following the release of the report .
in their last report in the spring , the institutes projected a growth rate for germany of 2.4 percent in both 2007 and 2008 , with strong export demand powering the nation 's economic performance .
export growth likely to decline since then , however , the euro has climbed to an all-time high of $ 1.43 as fears have set in about the us economic outlook , consequently fuelling concerns about the prospects for germany 's key export machine .
the institutes predict german export growth will decline to 3 percent in 2008 from 3.5 percent this year , with stronger private consumption emerging as a key pillar of growth .
the institutes are also forecasting private consumption to grow by 1.5 percent next year compared to just 0.2 percent in 2007 .
the release of the institutes ' report is expected to lead to the german government also scaling back its growth projections for the nation .
germany emerged last year from a protracted period of stagnation , with a recent solid growth rate helping to ease the nation 's high unemployment .
larger reduction in unemployment that expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german unemployment dropped in september the number of people out of work in germany fell more than expected in september , data released last month showed , with employers continuing to hire on the back of the economic upswing and years of wage restraint .
the institutes expect unemployment to continue falling to average 7.9 percent in 2008 compared to 8.7 percent in 2007 .
germany 's jobless rate stood at 10.3 percent last year .
apart from the rwi , the german institutes involved in drawing up the report included the kiel institute for the world economy -lrb- ifw -rrb- , halle institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- and the munich- based ifo institute for economic research . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 the european treaty : frequently asked questions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu be hanging out the decorations in celebration of the treaty come december ?
the european treaty has loomed large on the horizon of the eu political landscape for the past few weeks as eu leaders prepare to agree on the its final text on oct .
18-19 . this week 's eu summit in lisbon is an informal meeting for heads of state to see the results of legal work carried out on the european treaty over the autumn .
if the reformed treaty text is approved it will then go forward to a formal heads of state meeting in brussels in december .
if the treat receives the leaders ' approval again it will then be sent for ratification by all 27 eu member states . but what is the european treaty and what is all the fuss about ?
dw-world.de answers some of the most pertinent questions . what is the european reform treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution has made way for the treaty after the failure of its forerunner , the european constitution , which was rejected in 2005 by voters in france and the netherlands , the european reform treaty was conceived as an alternative series of amendments to two existing eu treaties , the treaty on the european union -lrb- maastricht -rrb- and the treaty establishing the european community -lrb- rome -rrb- . the idea is that the reform treaty will be a blueprint for running the expanded european union more efficiently .
the reform treaty was presented to the eu leaders in brussels in july by the portuguese presidency , after an initial hard-fought agreement on its text was hammered out in under berlin 's leadership in june . what will the european reform treaty do ? the eu leaders will decide on the final draft for the european reform treaty in lisbon on oct .
18-19 and so the precise wording of the treaty has yet to be agreed .
however , the document is expected to include the following : create the role of european president this is one of the most controversial proposals as the idea was initially opposed by smaller eu nations but was forced through by the larger member states .
the presidential role has official backing but opposition and resentment remain .
the president would serve a two-and-a half-year term , replacing the current system of a rotating six-month presidency , and will not be allowed to serve more than two terms . create the role of eu high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy essentially the eu 's foreign minister -lrb- as proposed in the constitution -rrb- , this role will combine the posts of current foreign affairs chief javier solana , and the external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and will be the eu 's point person for world affairs .
reduce the size of the european commission just as the european parliament recently announced that the number of parliamentarians would be capped at 750 regardless of new countries joining the bloc , the eu commission will reduce the number of its commissioners .
there will be fewer commissioners than member states by 2014 , with only two-thirds of countries supplying a commissioner on a rotational basis . redistribute voting weights among member states this is another controversial aspect that has had many member states , particularly poland and britain , up in arms .
the treaty intends to introduce majority voting , which will allow votes to be carried on a 55 percent majority as long as that majority also represent 65 percent of the european population .
this would be phased in between 2014 and 2017 . give new powers to the european commission , european parliament and european court of justice , in areas such as justice and domestic affairs remove the national veto in a number of areas is the reform treaty just the failed european constitution under a different name ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french , along with the dutch , gave a resounding " non " originally , the reform treaty was described as having " no constitutional characteristics , " but investigations by a number of international analysis groups have noted that only two of the 440 provisions in the reform treaty differ from the original constitution .
the constitution 's references to european flags and anthems , which proved unpopular with voters , have been left out .
however , the existing flag , anthem and european motto - " united in diversity " - will remain . the role of european foreign minister included in the constitution text has also been replaced by the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , and the use of the term " european laws " has been dropped in favor of " european regulations . " what is likely to happen in lisbon and in the future ? the representatives from the 27 eu member states are expected to agree on the final text of the treaty in lisbon and then sign off on the treaty at a summit of european leaders in brussels in december .
much like the process used for the doomed constitution , the treaty will then have to be ratified by all the eu 's member states .
if this is completed , the treaty will come into force in 2009 . ratification was the process that spelled the end of the constitution .
some countries chose to put the constitution to the people in a referendum .
it was killed off by two " no " votes , from france and the netherlands .
to avoid this , most countries are expected to leave the ratification of the treaty to their parliaments , who are expected to back the deal . however , ireland plans to hold a referendum , the danes want one too and so do quite a few dutch , despite their government taking a huge risk by holding out against the will of the people .
the british government promised a referendum on the constitution but never got the chance to hold one as the french and dutch votes made it unnecessary . what could go wrong ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things may not be so clear if some nations cause trouble for the treaty to come into being , all the decisions surrounding it have to be unanimous .
there are a number of wrenches that could potentially end up in the works , specifically those lobbed in from poland and the uk . poland is threatening to block the treaty unless it includes an agreement - known as the ioannina compromise - to allow countries to defer unpalatable decisions that have been agreed by a narrow majority . the british have a number of " red lines " regarding issues of sovereignty in which the uk has an opt-out clause .
the exceptions were agreed to principle in discussions under german leadership in june .
however , britain could pull the treaty plug if the legal work carried out on the treaty text since june adapts or removes any of these " red lines . " while these two offer the greatest threats to the treaty , the most bizarre arguably comes from bulgaria .
sofia is threatening to derail the treaty over the spelling of euro currency , which it insists should be " evro " in its cyrillic alphabet . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a leading jewish organization called the findings " ugly , disastrous and sad . " a popular german talk show host was recently fired for praising hitler 's family policies . the nazis encouraged women to stay at home , look after their husbands , and produce and rear children .
the incident has sparked a debate in germany over whether it is acceptable to say anything positive about the nazis , 62 years after the end of world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva herman got fired for her comments a recent poll shows that a quarter of germans agree that nazi rule had some positive aspects .
the weekly stern magazine commissioned the forsa agency to conduct the poll after talk show host eva herman was fired from germany 's ndr public broadcaster last month for her comments on the third reich and motherhood .
pollsters asked whether national socialism had any good points .
twenty-five percent of the respondents said " yes , " citing the construction of the famous autobahn or network of highways , low unemployment and crime rate and a strong sense of family as examples .
" the insecurity about how to deal with nazism is huge .
as is ignorance .
eva herman has unwittingly kicked off a long-neglected debate , " stern magazine wrote in a cover story .
the poll , released wednesday , oct .
17 , was conducted a week earlier .
poll should be a " warning sign " the poll results have sparked condemnation from the central council of jews in germany .
dieter graumann , vice president of the council , said that the poll should be considered a " warning sign . "
" the result of the poll is ugly , disastrous and makes me sad and angry , " he told the netzeitung online newspaper .
still , he cautioned against " alarmism " and called for more education about the nazi period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis wanted to create a " master race " the blue-eyed , blonde-haired herman got into trouble while presenting her latest book .
news reports quoted her as saying that while adolf hitler was very bad , there were good things about nazi rule as well .
she cited " the high regard for the mother " as an example and said she regretted that family values nurtured by the nazis had been swept away .
she was recently thrown off a talk show after refusing to apologize for her comments .
the nazis offered incentives to child-bearing women .
yet their family policies were part of a racist ideology whose goal was the creation of a master race .
it 's not the first time the 48-year-old herman has ruffled feathers .
she angered feminists last year when she said women should raise children rather than pursue careers of their own .
herman insists that her latest comments were taken out of context . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , after meeting with nato and russian officials that washington 's missile shield plans could be changed should iran suspend its nuclear program .
the shield is " intended against the major problem we see developing , which is iran , and if that problem went away or attenuated we would obviously draw conclusions , " said fried .
" this is a threat-based system , and we would be affected if iran gave up its -lsb- uranium -rsb- enrichment and worked with the international community , and had a different approach to things . "
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own defenses .
shield plans could slow down under " right conditions " while fried ruled out any immediate halt , he did suggest that the development of the shield might slow down under the right conditions .
" our position is that our negotiations with the poles and the czechs will continue , but we do n't feel the need to spend money at quite as fast a rate for a threat that is attenuated , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fried assured russia that it was not a target fried also reiterated that the defense shield was needed to guard against threats from " rogue states " like iran or north korea and assured russia once again that it was not a target .
" our real concern is not russia , " he said .
" we are advancing a missile defense program in response to what we see as an iranian ballistic missile and nuclear weapons threat .
" we want -lsb- russia 's -rsb- help , and the help of all responsible nations , to work with iran so this problem is attenuated and goes away , " fried said and added that us officials had explained their stance on iran to the russians , and that " they seemed interested in the concept . "
polish election could affect us relations another factor which may force washington 's hand in adapting its plan for european bases is poland 's parliamentary election on sunday .
poland 's ties with the united states , its cooperation on the defense shield and the presence of polish troops in iraq could all change if prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski loses power .
the centrist civic platform party , the main opposition to kaczynski 's ruling conservatives , is mounting a strong challenge to the current leadership and is gaining support through its leader donald tusk 's assertions that a government under his authority would not want so close a relationship with washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister kaczynski faces a challenge in the polls surveys show most poles want their troops out of iraq and oppose the missile shield .
recent events , including an attack on the polish ambassador in iraq last week , have brought these topics and poland 's foreign policy as a whole to the forefront of the civic platform party 's agenda .
prime minister kaczynski and his twin brother lech , the polish president , have put close ties with the us at the center of poland 's foreign policy alongside a distrust of the eu .
since coming to power in 2005 , the brothers have maintained the country 's military presence in iraq , increased polish forces in afghanistan and have all but pledged to host the anti-missile shield . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he ’ s 25 years old and frankfurt 's new captain for this season .
things are going well for the striker at the moment .
his team is seventh on the table and he just shot greece into euro 2008 . dw-tv : first of all : should we refer to each other formally or by first name ?
ioannis amanatidis : using first names is fine .
okay , that 's good .
my name 's andré ...
i 'm ianni .
ianni , i 'm from australia and as an australian i 've spent the last months watching the cricket world cup and rugby world cup .
it was great .
why should i come down on a saturday afternoon and watch frankfurt play ?
i think in europe , and especially germany , football really is the number one sport .
you can see that when you go to a game .
the stadium here is fantastic , with a great atmosphere .
every week we have basically a sell out crowd .
the feeling is indescribable .
you just have to be there yourself and experience it .
you 've played with a few teams in germany : fürth , kaiserslautern , stuttgart .
what 's so special about frankfurt ?
i 've been pretty much everywhere in southern germany , that 's true .
but somehow i just could n't leave frankfurt .
i just like it here i suppose .
i 've played the majority of my bundesliga games for frankfurt , scored most of my goals here and when i 'm moving around the city i feel comfortable .
if i go away and visit friends - to stuttgart or wherever - then i immediately feel at home when i drive back in to the city .
that 's a satisfying feeling .
you mention feeling at home here ... but you were born in kozani , in northern greece .
what was life like back then ?
it was a simple village life .
i lived there until i was 9 years old and went to school there .
well actually as soon as i got home from school i went and played football on the street with my friends .
sometimes i got in trouble because there was homework that needed doing ... other times i just slipped off without anyone noticing .
i suppose you could say that greek village life is a bit more relaxed than living here .
then my family decided that we were going to move to germany .
you are now in the greek international side , have been for a while in fact .
do you have goals at that level ?
of course .
i want to play for greece as much as i can .
when i first came in to the national team i was 21 or 22 and was playing only irregularly .
now i have established myself .
if i stay fit and perform at my best , i should be playing .
and that 's the goal .
and if i am on the field then i want to show what i can do - for my country and for our fans , my countrymen , who always come and support us .
speaking of countrymen : there is another greek player at frankfurt , sotirios kyrgiakos .
what 's it like having him on the pitch for you as captain ? he 's still having difficulties with his german , probably because he does n't want to speak the language .
but that 's not important because we all speak a type of football language with each other anyway .
for that reason language is n't so important and he does n't have to learn german , but it might help him in his private life .
he helps our team immensely on the field .
i help him in training and on the field to understand what 's going on .
it 's good that he 's here in frankfurt - he strengthens our team and that 's the most important thing .
you must have personal goals though at frankfurt .
what do you aim for yourself at the start of each season ?
do you say : i want 20 goals ?
no , i do n't believe in that .
i put the team first and its success .
if we are successful , if we play well and develop our game , then each one of us will develop individually anyway .
that 's a basic principle but you have to understand it .
i will never say : i want 10 , 15 or 20 goals in a season .
i 've scored three thus far , that 's okay .
i would certainly like to score a few more this season .
but the specific number is unimportant .
let 's say , hypothetically , you are playing for frankfurt in the german cup and you score a goal .
two months later you score a goal for greece in the european championships .
what 's more important for you , personally ?
well , it depends .
if it was the third or fourth goal in a game then it 's not so important as when it is a tight 1-0 win .
if it was the 1-0 for greece then i would prefer to score that than the 4-0 for frankfurt because there the game has already been won !
a very diplomatic answer .
okay , ianni , thanks for your time .
no worries .

hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 the european treaty : frequently asked questions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu be hanging out the decorations in celebration of the treaty come december ?
the european treaty has loomed large on the horizon of the eu political landscape for the past few weeks as eu leaders prepare to agree on the its final text on oct .
18-19 . this week 's eu summit in lisbon is an informal meeting for heads of state to see the results of legal work carried out on the european treaty over the autumn .
if the reformed treaty text is approved it will then go forward to a formal heads of state meeting in brussels in december .
if the treat receives the leaders ' approval again it will then be sent for ratification by all 27 eu member states . but what is the european treaty and what is all the fuss about ?
dw-world.de answers some of the most pertinent questions . what is the european reform treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution has made way for the treaty after the failure of its forerunner , the european constitution , which was rejected in 2005 by voters in france and the netherlands , the european reform treaty was conceived as an alternative series of amendments to two existing eu treaties , the treaty on the european union -lrb- maastricht -rrb- and the treaty establishing the european community -lrb- rome -rrb- . the idea is that the reform treaty will be a blueprint for running the expanded european union more efficiently .
the reform treaty was presented to the eu leaders in brussels in july by the portuguese presidency , after an initial hard-fought agreement on its text was hammered out in under berlin 's leadership in june . what will the european reform treaty do ? the eu leaders will decide on the final draft for the european reform treaty in lisbon on oct .
18-19 and so the precise wording of the treaty has yet to be agreed .
however , the document is expected to include the following : create the role of european president this is one of the most controversial proposals as the idea was initially opposed by smaller eu nations but was forced through by the larger member states .
the presidential role has official backing but opposition and resentment remain .
the president would serve a two-and-a half-year term , replacing the current system of a rotating six-month presidency , and will not be allowed to serve more than two terms . create the role of eu high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy essentially the eu 's foreign minister -lrb- as proposed in the constitution -rrb- , this role will combine the posts of current foreign affairs chief javier solana , and the external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and will be the eu 's point person for world affairs .
reduce the size of the european commission just as the european parliament recently announced that the number of parliamentarians would be capped at 750 regardless of new countries joining the bloc , the eu commission will reduce the number of its commissioners .
there will be fewer commissioners than member states by 2014 , with only two-thirds of countries supplying a commissioner on a rotational basis . redistribute voting weights among member states this is another controversial aspect that has had many member states , particularly poland and britain , up in arms .
the treaty intends to introduce majority voting , which will allow votes to be carried on a 55 percent majority as long as that majority also represent 65 percent of the european population .
this would be phased in between 2014 and 2017 . give new powers to the european commission , european parliament and european court of justice , in areas such as justice and domestic affairs remove the national veto in a number of areas is the reform treaty just the failed european constitution under a different name ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french , along with the dutch , gave a resounding " non " originally , the reform treaty was described as having " no constitutional characteristics , " but investigations by a number of international analysis groups have noted that only two of the 440 provisions in the reform treaty differ from the original constitution .
the constitution 's references to european flags and anthems , which proved unpopular with voters , have been left out .
however , the existing flag , anthem and european motto - " united in diversity " - will remain . the role of european foreign minister included in the constitution text has also been replaced by the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , and the use of the term " european laws " has been dropped in favor of " european regulations . " what is likely to happen in lisbon and in the future ? the representatives from the 27 eu member states are expected to agree on the final text of the treaty in lisbon and then sign off on the treaty at a summit of european leaders in brussels in december .
much like the process used for the doomed constitution , the treaty will then have to be ratified by all the eu 's member states .
if this is completed , the treaty will come into force in 2009 . ratification was the process that spelled the end of the constitution .
some countries chose to put the constitution to the people in a referendum .
it was killed off by two " no " votes , from france and the netherlands .
to avoid this , most countries are expected to leave the ratification of the treaty to their parliaments , who are expected to back the deal . however , ireland plans to hold a referendum , the danes want one too and so do quite a few dutch , despite their government taking a huge risk by holding out against the will of the people .
the british government promised a referendum on the constitution but never got the chance to hold one as the french and dutch votes made it unnecessary . what could go wrong ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things may not be so clear if some nations cause trouble for the treaty to come into being , all the decisions surrounding it have to be unanimous .
there are a number of wrenches that could potentially end up in the works , specifically those lobbed in from poland and the uk . poland is threatening to block the treaty unless it includes an agreement - known as the ioannina compromise - to allow countries to defer unpalatable decisions that have been agreed by a narrow majority . the british have a number of " red lines " regarding issues of sovereignty in which the uk has an opt-out clause .
the exceptions were agreed to principle in discussions under german leadership in june .
however , britain could pull the treaty plug if the legal work carried out on the treaty text since june adapts or removes any of these " red lines . " while these two offer the greatest threats to the treaty , the most bizarre arguably comes from bulgaria .
sofia is threatening to derail the treaty over the spelling of euro currency , which it insists should be " evro " in its cyrillic alphabet . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 the european treaty : frequently asked questions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu be hanging out the decorations in celebration of the treaty come december ?
the european treaty has loomed large on the horizon of the eu political landscape for the past few weeks as eu leaders prepare to agree on the its final text on oct .
18-19 . this week 's eu summit in lisbon is an informal meeting for heads of state to see the results of legal work carried out on the european treaty over the autumn .
if the reformed treaty text is approved it will then go forward to a formal heads of state meeting in brussels in december .
if the treat receives the leaders ' approval again it will then be sent for ratification by all 27 eu member states . but what is the european treaty and what is all the fuss about ?
dw-world.de answers some of the most pertinent questions . what is the european reform treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution has made way for the treaty after the failure of its forerunner , the european constitution , which was rejected in 2005 by voters in france and the netherlands , the european reform treaty was conceived as an alternative series of amendments to two existing eu treaties , the treaty on the european union -lrb- maastricht -rrb- and the treaty establishing the european community -lrb- rome -rrb- . the idea is that the reform treaty will be a blueprint for running the expanded european union more efficiently .
the reform treaty was presented to the eu leaders in brussels in july by the portuguese presidency , after an initial hard-fought agreement on its text was hammered out in under berlin 's leadership in june . what will the european reform treaty do ? the eu leaders will decide on the final draft for the european reform treaty in lisbon on oct .
18-19 and so the precise wording of the treaty has yet to be agreed .
however , the document is expected to include the following : create the role of european president this is one of the most controversial proposals as the idea was initially opposed by smaller eu nations but was forced through by the larger member states .
the presidential role has official backing but opposition and resentment remain .
the president would serve a two-and-a half-year term , replacing the current system of a rotating six-month presidency , and will not be allowed to serve more than two terms . create the role of eu high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy essentially the eu 's foreign minister -lrb- as proposed in the constitution -rrb- , this role will combine the posts of current foreign affairs chief javier solana , and the external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and will be the eu 's point person for world affairs .
reduce the size of the european commission just as the european parliament recently announced that the number of parliamentarians would be capped at 750 regardless of new countries joining the bloc , the eu commission will reduce the number of its commissioners .
there will be fewer commissioners than member states by 2014 , with only two-thirds of countries supplying a commissioner on a rotational basis . redistribute voting weights among member states this is another controversial aspect that has had many member states , particularly poland and britain , up in arms .
the treaty intends to introduce majority voting , which will allow votes to be carried on a 55 percent majority as long as that majority also represent 65 percent of the european population .
this would be phased in between 2014 and 2017 . give new powers to the european commission , european parliament and european court of justice , in areas such as justice and domestic affairs remove the national veto in a number of areas is the reform treaty just the failed european constitution under a different name ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french , along with the dutch , gave a resounding " non " originally , the reform treaty was described as having " no constitutional characteristics , " but investigations by a number of international analysis groups have noted that only two of the 440 provisions in the reform treaty differ from the original constitution .
the constitution 's references to european flags and anthems , which proved unpopular with voters , have been left out .
however , the existing flag , anthem and european motto - " united in diversity " - will remain . the role of european foreign minister included in the constitution text has also been replaced by the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , and the use of the term " european laws " has been dropped in favor of " european regulations . " what is likely to happen in lisbon and in the future ? the representatives from the 27 eu member states are expected to agree on the final text of the treaty in lisbon and then sign off on the treaty at a summit of european leaders in brussels in december .
much like the process used for the doomed constitution , the treaty will then have to be ratified by all the eu 's member states .
if this is completed , the treaty will come into force in 2009 . ratification was the process that spelled the end of the constitution .
some countries chose to put the constitution to the people in a referendum .
it was killed off by two " no " votes , from france and the netherlands .
to avoid this , most countries are expected to leave the ratification of the treaty to their parliaments , who are expected to back the deal . however , ireland plans to hold a referendum , the danes want one too and so do quite a few dutch , despite their government taking a huge risk by holding out against the will of the people .
the british government promised a referendum on the constitution but never got the chance to hold one as the french and dutch votes made it unnecessary . what could go wrong ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things may not be so clear if some nations cause trouble for the treaty to come into being , all the decisions surrounding it have to be unanimous .
there are a number of wrenches that could potentially end up in the works , specifically those lobbed in from poland and the uk . poland is threatening to block the treaty unless it includes an agreement - known as the ioannina compromise - to allow countries to defer unpalatable decisions that have been agreed by a narrow majority . the british have a number of " red lines " regarding issues of sovereignty in which the uk has an opt-out clause .
the exceptions were agreed to principle in discussions under german leadership in june .
however , britain could pull the treaty plug if the legal work carried out on the treaty text since june adapts or removes any of these " red lines . " while these two offer the greatest threats to the treaty , the most bizarre arguably comes from bulgaria .
sofia is threatening to derail the treaty over the spelling of euro currency , which it insists should be " evro " in its cyrillic alphabet . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
domestic pressures weigh heavily on the leaders of poland , britain and italy as they gather in lisbon for an eu summit which hopes to finalize the charter to reform the bloc 's institutions . as representatives from the 27 eu members states converged on the portuguese capital on thursday , oct .
18 , for crunch talks to approve a new treaty , the leaders of poland , italy and britain came armed with issues that could torpedo the charter at the eleventh hour . in poland , where a closely-contested parliamentary election is to take place on sunday , nationalists who support the government want their country to be granted more power to delay eu decisions that it dislikes .
polish president lech kaczynski is thus insisting that the so-called " ioannina compromise " - a gentlemen 's agreement that allows eu members that can not muster a blocking minority to delay a decision while attempts to find a satisfactory solution are made - to be made legally binding .
polish president reiterates treaty delay threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president kaczynski wants what poland deserves before leaving for lisbon , the president reiterated his threat to delay the charter .
" we do n't want anything more than is our right , " president lech kaczynski told polish radio before leaving for the summit .
asked what would happen if polish demands were not met , kaczynski replied : " we will have to delay the discussion " .
any delay would be a huge blow for the treaty and the eu which has been plagued by in-fighting over the text of this charter and its predecessor , the doomed eu constitution which was derailed by referendums in france and the netherlands in 2005 .
with summits with russia and china on the horizon , the eu would face a crisis of credibility and confidence if it was to meet these powers without an agreement on the treaty behind it .
britain 's brown under domestic pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown will halt the treaty talks if need be eurosceptic britain could also throw a spanner in the works if the legal work which has been done on the draft treaty since an initial agreement in berlin in june changes or removes any of the " red lines " - areas of national sovereignty where britain would hold a veto - which the uk had asked to be included .
with public opinion showing huge opposition to any increased eu influence over british domestic politics , prime minister gordon brown will be under pressure to ensure that britain 's toes are not trodden on .
if he feels that the uk is getting a raw deal , brown may delay the treaty to get what he - and the people who will decide his fate at the next general election - wants .
prodi smarting from parliament decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's prodi has not accepted parliament 's decision meanwhile , italy is still smarting from last week 's announcement that the reduction of seats in the european parliament will mean fewer italian representatives , a decision prime minister romano prodi said he was not ready to accept .
while the issue is not directly linked to the treaty , the subject may be included in the agenda for the summit and prodi hinted that he may make it a treaty problem unless italy 's demands on the composition of the future european parliament are met .
" we can not accept a solution ... based on the number of residents rather than citizens because that does not agree with either the spirit or the letter of the new treaty , " prodi said .
the european parliament has adopted a new plan for allocating seats starting with the next legislature -lrb- 2009-14 -rrb- under which for the first time italy would have less meps -lrb- 72 -rrb- than either france -lrb- 74 -rrb- or britain -lrb- 73 -rrb- .
italy has so far refused the plan .
rome argues that it is not the total population resident in each country that should form the basis of the calculation , but rather the number of european citizens .
observers suspect that the unusually tough line taken by prodi , a former eu commission head , has a lot to do with the difficulties his fragile centre-left coalition is facing back home .
notwithstanding the many obstacles , portuguese prime minister jose socrates whose country currently heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency said he 's optimistic of reaching a deal .

"
domestic pressures weigh heavily on the leaders of poland , britain and italy as they gather in lisbon for an eu summit which hopes to finalize the charter to reform the bloc 's institutions . as representatives from the 27 eu members states converged on the portuguese capital on thursday , oct .
18 , for crunch talks to approve a new treaty , the leaders of poland , italy and britain came armed with issues that could torpedo the charter at the eleventh hour . in poland , where a closely-contested parliamentary election is to take place on sunday , nationalists who support the government want their country to be granted more power to delay eu decisions that it dislikes .
polish president lech kaczynski is thus insisting that the so-called " ioannina compromise " - a gentlemen 's agreement that allows eu members that can not muster a blocking minority to delay a decision while attempts to find a satisfactory solution are made - to be made legally binding .
polish president reiterates treaty delay threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president kaczynski wants what poland deserves before leaving for lisbon , the president reiterated his threat to delay the charter .
" we do n't want anything more than is our right , " president lech kaczynski told polish radio before leaving for the summit .
asked what would happen if polish demands were not met , kaczynski replied : " we will have to delay the discussion " .
any delay would be a huge blow for the treaty and the eu which has been plagued by in-fighting over the text of this charter and its predecessor , the doomed eu constitution which was derailed by referendums in france and the netherlands in 2005 .
with summits with russia and china on the horizon , the eu would face a crisis of credibility and confidence if it was to meet these powers without an agreement on the treaty behind it .
britain 's brown under domestic pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown will halt the treaty talks if need be eurosceptic britain could also throw a spanner in the works if the legal work which has been done on the draft treaty since an initial agreement in berlin in june changes or removes any of the " red lines " - areas of national sovereignty where britain would hold a veto - which the uk had asked to be included .
with public opinion showing huge opposition to any increased eu influence over british domestic politics , prime minister gordon brown will be under pressure to ensure that britain 's toes are not trodden on .
if he feels that the uk is getting a raw deal , brown may delay the treaty to get what he - and the people who will decide his fate at the next general election - wants .
prodi smarting from parliament decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's prodi has not accepted parliament 's decision meanwhile , italy is still smarting from last week 's announcement that the reduction of seats in the european parliament will mean fewer italian representatives , a decision prime minister romano prodi said he was not ready to accept .
while the issue is not directly linked to the treaty , the subject may be included in the agenda for the summit and prodi hinted that he may make it a treaty problem unless italy 's demands on the composition of the future european parliament are met .
" we can not accept a solution ... based on the number of residents rather than citizens because that does not agree with either the spirit or the letter of the new treaty , " prodi said .
the european parliament has adopted a new plan for allocating seats starting with the next legislature -lrb- 2009-14 -rrb- under which for the first time italy would have less meps -lrb- 72 -rrb- than either france -lrb- 74 -rrb- or britain -lrb- 73 -rrb- .
italy has so far refused the plan .
rome argues that it is not the total population resident in each country that should form the basis of the calculation , but rather the number of european citizens .
observers suspect that the unusually tough line taken by prodi , a former eu commission head , has a lot to do with the difficulties his fragile centre-left coalition is facing back home .
notwithstanding the many obstacles , portuguese prime minister jose socrates whose country currently heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency said he 's optimistic of reaching a deal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 18.10.2007 us official : missile shield plans for europe dependent on iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the iranian nuclear threat recedes , the us could rethink its defense shield plans for europe the future of bases for the proposed us missile shield in europe is dependent on whether iran gives up its controversial uranium enrichment program , a senior us state department official suggested . assistant secretary of state daniel fried told reporters in brussels on wednesday , oct .
17 , after meeting with nato and russian officials that washington 's missile shield plans could be changed should iran suspend its nuclear program .
the shield is " intended against the major problem we see developing , which is iran , and if that problem went away or attenuated we would obviously draw conclusions , " said fried .
" this is a threat-based system , and we would be affected if iran gave up its -lsb- uranium -rsb- enrichment and worked with the international community , and had a different approach to things . "
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own defenses .
shield plans could slow down under " right conditions " while fried ruled out any immediate halt , he did suggest that the development of the shield might slow down under the right conditions .
" our position is that our negotiations with the poles and the czechs will continue , but we do n't feel the need to spend money at quite as fast a rate for a threat that is attenuated , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fried assured russia that it was not a target fried also reiterated that the defense shield was needed to guard against threats from " rogue states " like iran or north korea and assured russia once again that it was not a target .
" our real concern is not russia , " he said .
" we are advancing a missile defense program in response to what we see as an iranian ballistic missile and nuclear weapons threat .
" we want -lsb- russia 's -rsb- help , and the help of all responsible nations , to work with iran so this problem is attenuated and goes away , " fried said and added that us officials had explained their stance on iran to the russians , and that " they seemed interested in the concept . "
polish election could affect us relations another factor which may force washington 's hand in adapting its plan for european bases is poland 's parliamentary election on sunday .
poland 's ties with the united states , its cooperation on the defense shield and the presence of polish troops in iraq could all change if prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski loses power .
the centrist civic platform party , the main opposition to kaczynski 's ruling conservatives , is mounting a strong challenge to the current leadership and is gaining support through its leader donald tusk 's assertions that a government under his authority would not want so close a relationship with washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister kaczynski faces a challenge in the polls surveys show most poles want their troops out of iraq and oppose the missile shield .
recent events , including an attack on the polish ambassador in iraq last week , have brought these topics and poland 's foreign policy as a whole to the forefront of the civic platform party 's agenda .
prime minister kaczynski and his twin brother lech , the polish president , have put close ties with the us at the center of poland 's foreign policy alongside a distrust of the eu .
since coming to power in 2005 , the brothers have maintained the country 's military presence in iraq , increased polish forces in afghanistan and have all but pledged to host the anti-missile shield . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a leading jewish organization called the findings " ugly , disastrous and sad . " a popular german talk show host was recently fired for praising hitler 's family policies . the nazis encouraged women to stay at home , look after their husbands , and produce and rear children .
the incident has sparked a debate in germany over whether it is acceptable to say anything positive about the nazis , 62 years after the end of world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva herman got fired for her comments a recent poll shows that a quarter of germans agree that nazi rule had some positive aspects .
the weekly stern magazine commissioned the forsa agency to conduct the poll after talk show host eva herman was fired from germany 's ndr public broadcaster last month for her comments on the third reich and motherhood .
pollsters asked whether national socialism had any good points .
twenty-five percent of the respondents said " yes , " citing the construction of the famous autobahn or network of highways , low unemployment and crime rate and a strong sense of family as examples .
" the insecurity about how to deal with nazism is huge .
as is ignorance .
eva herman has unwittingly kicked off a long-neglected debate , " stern magazine wrote in a cover story .
the poll , released wednesday , oct .
17 , was conducted a week earlier .
poll should be a " warning sign " the poll results have sparked condemnation from the central council of jews in germany .
dieter graumann , vice president of the council , said that the poll should be considered a " warning sign . "
" the result of the poll is ugly , disastrous and makes me sad and angry , " he told the netzeitung online newspaper .
still , he cautioned against " alarmism " and called for more education about the nazi period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis wanted to create a " master race " the blue-eyed , blonde-haired herman got into trouble while presenting her latest book .
news reports quoted her as saying that while adolf hitler was very bad , there were good things about nazi rule as well .
she cited " the high regard for the mother " as an example and said she regretted that family values nurtured by the nazis had been swept away .
she was recently thrown off a talk show after refusing to apologize for her comments .
the nazis offered incentives to child-bearing women .
yet their family policies were part of a racist ideology whose goal was the creation of a master race .
it 's not the first time the 48-year-old herman has ruffled feathers .
she angered feminists last year when she said women should raise children rather than pursue careers of their own .
herman insists that her latest comments were taken out of context . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 the european treaty : frequently asked questions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu be hanging out the decorations in celebration of the treaty come december ?
the european treaty has loomed large on the horizon of the eu political landscape for the past few weeks as eu leaders prepare to agree on the its final text on oct .
18-19 . this week 's eu summit in lisbon is an informal meeting for heads of state to see the results of legal work carried out on the european treaty over the autumn .
if the reformed treaty text is approved it will then go forward to a formal heads of state meeting in brussels in december .
if the treat receives the leaders ' approval again it will then be sent for ratification by all 27 eu member states . but what is the european treaty and what is all the fuss about ?
dw-world.de answers some of the most pertinent questions . what is the european reform treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution has made way for the treaty after the failure of its forerunner , the european constitution , which was rejected in 2005 by voters in france and the netherlands , the european reform treaty was conceived as an alternative series of amendments to two existing eu treaties , the treaty on the european union -lrb- maastricht -rrb- and the treaty establishing the european community -lrb- rome -rrb- . the idea is that the reform treaty will be a blueprint for running the expanded european union more efficiently .
the reform treaty was presented to the eu leaders in brussels in july by the portuguese presidency , after an initial hard-fought agreement on its text was hammered out in under berlin 's leadership in june . what will the european reform treaty do ? the eu leaders will decide on the final draft for the european reform treaty in lisbon on oct .
18-19 and so the precise wording of the treaty has yet to be agreed .
however , the document is expected to include the following : create the role of european president this is one of the most controversial proposals as the idea was initially opposed by smaller eu nations but was forced through by the larger member states .
the presidential role has official backing but opposition and resentment remain .
the president would serve a two-and-a half-year term , replacing the current system of a rotating six-month presidency , and will not be allowed to serve more than two terms . create the role of eu high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy essentially the eu 's foreign minister -lrb- as proposed in the constitution -rrb- , this role will combine the posts of current foreign affairs chief javier solana , and the external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and will be the eu 's point person for world affairs .
reduce the size of the european commission just as the european parliament recently announced that the number of parliamentarians would be capped at 750 regardless of new countries joining the bloc , the eu commission will reduce the number of its commissioners .
there will be fewer commissioners than member states by 2014 , with only two-thirds of countries supplying a commissioner on a rotational basis . redistribute voting weights among member states this is another controversial aspect that has had many member states , particularly poland and britain , up in arms .
the treaty intends to introduce majority voting , which will allow votes to be carried on a 55 percent majority as long as that majority also represent 65 percent of the european population .
this would be phased in between 2014 and 2017 . give new powers to the european commission , european parliament and european court of justice , in areas such as justice and domestic affairs remove the national veto in a number of areas is the reform treaty just the failed european constitution under a different name ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french , along with the dutch , gave a resounding " non " originally , the reform treaty was described as having " no constitutional characteristics , " but investigations by a number of international analysis groups have noted that only two of the 440 provisions in the reform treaty differ from the original constitution .
the constitution 's references to european flags and anthems , which proved unpopular with voters , have been left out .
however , the existing flag , anthem and european motto - " united in diversity " - will remain . the role of european foreign minister included in the constitution text has also been replaced by the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , and the use of the term " european laws " has been dropped in favor of " european regulations . " what is likely to happen in lisbon and in the future ? the representatives from the 27 eu member states are expected to agree on the final text of the treaty in lisbon and then sign off on the treaty at a summit of european leaders in brussels in december .
much like the process used for the doomed constitution , the treaty will then have to be ratified by all the eu 's member states .
if this is completed , the treaty will come into force in 2009 . ratification was the process that spelled the end of the constitution .
some countries chose to put the constitution to the people in a referendum .
it was killed off by two " no " votes , from france and the netherlands .
to avoid this , most countries are expected to leave the ratification of the treaty to their parliaments , who are expected to back the deal . however , ireland plans to hold a referendum , the danes want one too and so do quite a few dutch , despite their government taking a huge risk by holding out against the will of the people .
the british government promised a referendum on the constitution but never got the chance to hold one as the french and dutch votes made it unnecessary . what could go wrong ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things may not be so clear if some nations cause trouble for the treaty to come into being , all the decisions surrounding it have to be unanimous .
there are a number of wrenches that could potentially end up in the works , specifically those lobbed in from poland and the uk . poland is threatening to block the treaty unless it includes an agreement - known as the ioannina compromise - to allow countries to defer unpalatable decisions that have been agreed by a narrow majority . the british have a number of " red lines " regarding issues of sovereignty in which the uk has an opt-out clause .
the exceptions were agreed to principle in discussions under german leadership in june .
however , britain could pull the treaty plug if the legal work carried out on the treaty text since june adapts or removes any of these " red lines . " while these two offer the greatest threats to the treaty , the most bizarre arguably comes from bulgaria .
sofia is threatening to derail the treaty over the spelling of euro currency , which it insists should be " evro " in its cyrillic alphabet . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

currently in berlin , he took time off from writing to discuss his latest work and what 's going wrong in both of his home countries . with his 2003 debut " the russian debutante 's handbook " and the follow-up " absurdistan " from 2006 , gary shteyngart established his credentials as one of the english language 's best young writers and a satirist with a talent for highlighting the absurdities of both the east and the west after the cold war .
now he 's trying something a bit different .
dw-world.de : your books have been read and marketed as part of a new immigrant literature in the us , but they 're not at all earnest or politically correct .
why is that ?
gary shteyngart : well , first of all , because i was very unlucky and got sent to this horrible hebrew school .
if it was n't for those eight years being told by rabbis that the holocaust happened because i ate a piece of pork salami , i do n't think you would have had books like " absurdistan . "
that took away any sense i might have had about anything being sacred .
unless you were an idiot , you could see from a mile away that a lot of things were just plain stupid and very coercive .
then i went to a really great high school in manhattan that was a true melting pot , a holding pen for multinational nerds .
it was a place where chinese , russian and indian people gathered together , and it was a real free-for-all .
then i went to oberlin college , and that was the final straw .
from the moment i got there i just wanted to make fun of it .
the first week i was there , i got chewed out for calling some a freshman instead of a " fresh person , " and there was a professor who had devoted his life to translating brezhnev 's works into yiddish .
so that was maybe the best part of my education since it gave me such wonderful targets to go after .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of " absurdistan " is called " snack daddy 's adventurous trip " you 're working on a new book as a fellow of the american academy here in berlin .
what 's the novel about ?
it 's the first book i 've set almost entirely in america , and it takes place - god help me because the phrase " speculative fiction " makes my skin crawl - in the near future .
it follows the love affair of two immigrants , as america slowly disintegrates .
new york and los angeles have become two heavily guarded areas , or what i call " cooperative exclusion zones . "
a small group of rich shareholders achieve immortality , while the vast majority of the population loses the ability to speak , read and write in english .
and that 's what happens to one of the two lovers .
that 's very different from your first two books , which feature unscrupulous us-immigrant protagonists forced to go back to an absurd , violent and materialistic eastern europe .
one sets up a pyramid scheme in prague , while the other tries to procure a fake passport amidst a halliburton-sponsored war in the caucasus .
why the change in the emphasis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of eastern european oil is a shteyngart speciality well , i ca n't do the same story over and over again .
the first book , " the russian debutante 's handbook , " dealt with the rise of turbo-capitalism in eastern europe , and the second , " absurdistan , " took that further by bringing in us foreign policy , specifically the politics of the oil industry .
the third one deals with the fact that we in the us have become " absurdistan " in some respects , for instance , in our approach to human rights issues , privacy and upholding the constitution .
one of the worst outcomes of 9/11 is that many of the people who traditionally came to america are now having second thoughts about that .
i also wanted to write about the baby boomers ' inability to come to terms with their own mortality .
and lastly , this book features a love affair that runs from page one to page 350 or whatever .
i 've never done that before .
why come to berlin if the book is set almost entirely in america ?
i work a lot better off-shore , so to speak , than in america .
there 's something about being in countries where i do n't speak the language .
most of " absurdistan " was written in italy .
and i 'm working much faster here than i ever have before .
like in new york , there 's both an excitement and a gloom about the city , but what interests me is that , unlike new york , there 's a real collision of east and west here .
to think that we 're only an hour and a half from poland here is really amazing .
what do you think then about the latest developments in eastern europe , in particular vladimir putin 's russia ?
some of them resemble the fictional scenarios you created in " absurdistan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shteyngart says both bush and putin have betrayed the ideals of democracy i began writing that book before 9/11 and before halliburton got so involved in iraq .
but i was observing events in azerbaijan and georgia , and the path looked very clear .
in the book i 'm writing now , russia is called " petro-state russia . "
and that 's exactly what russia is - a state run on the profits of natural gas , oil and a couple of other commodities .
putin has done it .
there 's a chance that there will be no opposition parties whatsoever in the next russian election .
there 's not even a pretense of democracy .
basically , putin can have power for life if he wants it .
he can just say : " now i 'm going to be the president , now i 'm going to be the prime minister . "
he 'll just take the power with him from office to office like a traveling bag .
the country has sold out any ideals of democracy it ever had for the idea some sort of stability .
and there 's a huge gap between rich and poor - in my third book , i 'm calling that up and bringing it back to america .
it does n't sound as though you have high hopes for either russia or the us .
i was brought up between these two empires , one of which died and the other of which is dying in its own way .
as far as russia goes , there 's a restaurant in st. petersburg that 's called " 1913 , " which is known as the only good year in russian history .
it 's an autocratic country with an autocratic tradition and an autocratic church .
with america , i feel very much an american these days , because something i love is being destroyed .
for those of us who were displaced at an early age , america was always the place to go to , and the worst result of 9/11 would be that it stops being that . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he ’ s 25 years old and frankfurt 's new captain for this season .
things are going well for the striker at the moment .
his team is seventh on the table and he just shot greece into euro 2008 . dw-tv : first of all : should we refer to each other formally or by first name ?
ioannis amanatidis : using first names is fine .
okay , that 's good .
my name 's andré ...
i 'm ianni .
ianni , i 'm from australia and as an australian i 've spent the last months watching the cricket world cup and rugby world cup .
it was great .
why should i come down on a saturday afternoon and watch frankfurt play ?
i think in europe , and especially germany , football really is the number one sport .
you can see that when you go to a game .
the stadium here is fantastic , with a great atmosphere .
every week we have basically a sell out crowd .
the feeling is indescribable .
you just have to be there yourself and experience it .
you 've played with a few teams in germany : fürth , kaiserslautern , stuttgart .
what 's so special about frankfurt ?
i 've been pretty much everywhere in southern germany , that 's true .
but somehow i just could n't leave frankfurt .
i just like it here i suppose .
i 've played the majority of my bundesliga games for frankfurt , scored most of my goals here and when i 'm moving around the city i feel comfortable .
if i go away and visit friends - to stuttgart or wherever - then i immediately feel at home when i drive back in to the city .
that 's a satisfying feeling .
you mention feeling at home here ... but you were born in kozani , in northern greece .
what was life like back then ?
it was a simple village life .
i lived there until i was 9 years old and went to school there .
well actually as soon as i got home from school i went and played football on the street with my friends .
sometimes i got in trouble because there was homework that needed doing ... other times i just slipped off without anyone noticing .
i suppose you could say that greek village life is a bit more relaxed than living here .
then my family decided that we were going to move to germany .
you are now in the greek international side , have been for a while in fact .
do you have goals at that level ?
of course .
i want to play for greece as much as i can .
when i first came in to the national team i was 21 or 22 and was playing only irregularly .
now i have established myself .
if i stay fit and perform at my best , i should be playing .
and that 's the goal .
and if i am on the field then i want to show what i can do - for my country and for our fans , my countrymen , who always come and support us .
speaking of countrymen : there is another greek player at frankfurt , sotirios kyrgiakos .
what 's it like having him on the pitch for you as captain ? he 's still having difficulties with his german , probably because he does n't want to speak the language .
but that 's not important because we all speak a type of football language with each other anyway .
for that reason language is n't so important and he does n't have to learn german , but it might help him in his private life .
he helps our team immensely on the field .
i help him in training and on the field to understand what 's going on .
it 's good that he 's here in frankfurt - he strengthens our team and that 's the most important thing .
you must have personal goals though at frankfurt .
what do you aim for yourself at the start of each season ?
do you say : i want 20 goals ?
no , i do n't believe in that .
i put the team first and its success .
if we are successful , if we play well and develop our game , then each one of us will develop individually anyway .
that 's a basic principle but you have to understand it .
i will never say : i want 10 , 15 or 20 goals in a season .
i 've scored three thus far , that 's okay .
i would certainly like to score a few more this season .
but the specific number is unimportant .
let 's say , hypothetically , you are playing for frankfurt in the german cup and you score a goal .
two months later you score a goal for greece in the european championships .
what 's more important for you , personally ?
well , it depends .
if it was the third or fourth goal in a game then it 's not so important as when it is a tight 1-0 win .
if it was the 1-0 for greece then i would prefer to score that than the 4-0 for frankfurt because there the game has already been won !
a very diplomatic answer .
okay , ianni , thanks for your time .
no worries .

hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon the european treaty : frequently asked questions reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's kaczynski brothers want more power for the ioannina delaying tactic poland is a big fan , although it wants it to go further , and yet it has only been invoked once to resolve a dispute over sardines .
what exactly is the ioannina compromise and why is it so important to the eu treaty ? the so-called " ioannina compromise " is one of the most talked-about and perhaps least well-understood issues relating to the ongoing reform treaty negotiations .
the term was coined after an informal meeting of eu foreign ministers which took place in ioannina , a greek city north of athens , in 1994 .
broadly speaking , the ioannina compromise is a gentlemen 's agreement , a time-out or emergency break designed to reassure individual member states who fear fellow eu members may cut deals which they strongly dislike .
ioannina gives countries a pause to find a solution in essence , if a country feels that its vital interests are threatened but can not muster a blocking minority , the decision is delayed while attempts to find a satisfactory solution are made .
the ioannina mechanism was first proposed when foreign ministers from the then 15-member union were called to discuss how voting rules should change if norway joined the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the initial compromise was lost when the eu signed nice at the meeting , ministers agreed that if eu members wished to oppose a measure but could not muster enough support to block it , they could ask the bloc 's council of member states to do " all within its power , within a reasonable space of time , to reach a satisfactory solution " that would be acceptable to a qualified majority .
norway eventually decided not to join the union , and the " gentlemen 's agreement " remained little more than a curious appendix to the eu decision-making process .
it was superseded by the nice treaty of 2000 , which established new voting rules for the eu ahead of the entry in 2004 of 10 new member states .
poland 's fight over voting rights resurrects ioannina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels agreed on a draft inclusion for the compromise but one of those newcomers - poland - fought hard to resurrect it this year during bitter negotiations over national voting rights in the reform treaty .
and in a bid to find a satisfactory compromise , the then german presidency of the eu in june included a reference to ioannina in an annex of the treaty .
according to the draft agreed last june in brussels , the eu council is forced to freeze decisions if : " -lrb- a -rrb- at least three quarters of the population , or -lrb- b -rrb- at least three quarters of the number of member states necessary to constitute a blocking minority ... indicate their opposition to the council adopting an act by a qualified majority . "
the annex does not place any formal time limits , saying that member states should spend " a reasonable time " looking for an acceptable solution .
kaczynskis want more time and legal framework but poland is campaigning for a " reinforced " ioannina mechanism and argues that two years constitutes a " reasonable time . "
moreover , poland wants the council to make an official decision on ioannina in lisbon and make it legally binding in some form or other .
because the council normally tries to reach decisions by consensus , the original ioannina compromise has been rarely invoked .
experts say there was only one unsuccessful attempt to use it during its limited lifespan : a case involving portuguese sardines . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 the european treaty : frequently asked questions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu be hanging out the decorations in celebration of the treaty come december ?
the european treaty has loomed large on the horizon of the eu political landscape for the past few weeks as eu leaders prepare to agree on the its final text on oct .
18-19 . this week 's eu summit in lisbon is an informal meeting for heads of state to see the results of legal work carried out on the european treaty over the autumn .
if the reformed treaty text is approved it will then go forward to a formal heads of state meeting in brussels in december .
if the treat receives the leaders ' approval again it will then be sent for ratification by all 27 eu member states . but what is the european treaty and what is all the fuss about ?
dw-world.de answers some of the most pertinent questions . what is the european reform treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution has made way for the treaty after the failure of its forerunner , the european constitution , which was rejected in 2005 by voters in france and the netherlands , the european reform treaty was conceived as an alternative series of amendments to two existing eu treaties , the treaty on the european union -lrb- maastricht -rrb- and the treaty establishing the european community -lrb- rome -rrb- . the idea is that the reform treaty will be a blueprint for running the expanded european union more efficiently .
the reform treaty was presented to the eu leaders in brussels in july by the portuguese presidency , after an initial hard-fought agreement on its text was hammered out in under berlin 's leadership in june . what will the european reform treaty do ? the eu leaders will decide on the final draft for the european reform treaty in lisbon on oct .
18-19 and so the precise wording of the treaty has yet to be agreed .
however , the document is expected to include the following : create the role of european president this is one of the most controversial proposals as the idea was initially opposed by smaller eu nations but was forced through by the larger member states .
the presidential role has official backing but opposition and resentment remain .
the president would serve a two-and-a half-year term , replacing the current system of a rotating six-month presidency , and will not be allowed to serve more than two terms . create the role of eu high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy essentially the eu 's foreign minister -lrb- as proposed in the constitution -rrb- , this role will combine the posts of current foreign affairs chief javier solana , and the external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and will be the eu 's point person for world affairs .
reduce the size of the european commission just as the european parliament recently announced that the number of parliamentarians would be capped at 750 regardless of new countries joining the bloc , the eu commission will reduce the number of its commissioners .
there will be fewer commissioners than member states by 2014 , with only two-thirds of countries supplying a commissioner on a rotational basis . redistribute voting weights among member states this is another controversial aspect that has had many member states , particularly poland and britain , up in arms .
the treaty intends to introduce majority voting , which will allow votes to be carried on a 55 percent majority as long as that majority also represent 65 percent of the european population .
this would be phased in between 2014 and 2017 . give new powers to the european commission , european parliament and european court of justice , in areas such as justice and domestic affairs remove the national veto in a number of areas is the reform treaty just the failed european constitution under a different name ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french , along with the dutch , gave a resounding " non " originally , the reform treaty was described as having " no constitutional characteristics , " but investigations by a number of international analysis groups have noted that only two of the 440 provisions in the reform treaty differ from the original constitution .
the constitution 's references to european flags and anthems , which proved unpopular with voters , have been left out .
however , the existing flag , anthem and european motto - " united in diversity " - will remain . the role of european foreign minister included in the constitution text has also been replaced by the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , and the use of the term " european laws " has been dropped in favor of " european regulations . " what is likely to happen in lisbon and in the future ? the representatives from the 27 eu member states are expected to agree on the final text of the treaty in lisbon and then sign off on the treaty at a summit of european leaders in brussels in december .
much like the process used for the doomed constitution , the treaty will then have to be ratified by all the eu 's member states .
if this is completed , the treaty will come into force in 2009 . ratification was the process that spelled the end of the constitution .
some countries chose to put the constitution to the people in a referendum .
it was killed off by two " no " votes , from france and the netherlands .
to avoid this , most countries are expected to leave the ratification of the treaty to their parliaments , who are expected to back the deal . however , ireland plans to hold a referendum , the danes want one too and so do quite a few dutch , despite their government taking a huge risk by holding out against the will of the people .
the british government promised a referendum on the constitution but never got the chance to hold one as the french and dutch votes made it unnecessary . what could go wrong ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things may not be so clear if some nations cause trouble for the treaty to come into being , all the decisions surrounding it have to be unanimous .
there are a number of wrenches that could potentially end up in the works , specifically those lobbed in from poland and the uk . poland is threatening to block the treaty unless it includes an agreement - known as the ioannina compromise - to allow countries to defer unpalatable decisions that have been agreed by a narrow majority . the british have a number of " red lines " regarding issues of sovereignty in which the uk has an opt-out clause .
the exceptions were agreed to principle in discussions under german leadership in june .
however , britain could pull the treaty plug if the legal work carried out on the treaty text since june adapts or removes any of these " red lines . " while these two offer the greatest threats to the treaty , the most bizarre arguably comes from bulgaria .

he ’ s 25 years old and frankfurt 's new captain for this season .
things are going well for the striker at the moment .
his team is seventh on the table and he just shot greece into euro 2008 . dw-tv : first of all : should we refer to each other formally or by first name ?
ioannis amanatidis : using first names is fine .
okay , that 's good .
my name 's andré ...
i 'm ianni .
ianni , i 'm from australia and as an australian i 've spent the last months watching the cricket world cup and rugby world cup .
it was great .
why should i come down on a saturday afternoon and watch frankfurt play ?
i think in europe , and especially germany , football really is the number one sport .
you can see that when you go to a game .
the stadium here is fantastic , with a great atmosphere .
every week we have basically a sell out crowd .
the feeling is indescribable .
you just have to be there yourself and experience it .
you 've played with a few teams in germany : fürth , kaiserslautern , stuttgart .
what 's so special about frankfurt ?
i 've been pretty much everywhere in southern germany , that 's true .
but somehow i just could n't leave frankfurt .
i just like it here i suppose .
i 've played the majority of my bundesliga games for frankfurt , scored most of my goals here and when i 'm moving around the city i feel comfortable .
if i go away and visit friends - to stuttgart or wherever - then i immediately feel at home when i drive back in to the city .
that 's a satisfying feeling .
you mention feeling at home here ... but you were born in kozani , in northern greece .
what was life like back then ?
it was a simple village life .
i lived there until i was 9 years old and went to school there .
well actually as soon as i got home from school i went and played football on the street with my friends .
sometimes i got in trouble because there was homework that needed doing ... other times i just slipped off without anyone noticing .
i suppose you could say that greek village life is a bit more relaxed than living here .
then my family decided that we were going to move to germany .
you are now in the greek international side , have been for a while in fact .
do you have goals at that level ?
of course .
i want to play for greece as much as i can .
when i first came in to the national team i was 21 or 22 and was playing only irregularly .
now i have established myself .
if i stay fit and perform at my best , i should be playing .
and that 's the goal .
and if i am on the field then i want to show what i can do - for my country and for our fans , my countrymen , who always come and support us .
speaking of countrymen : there is another greek player at frankfurt , sotirios kyrgiakos .
what 's it like having him on the pitch for you as captain ? he 's still having difficulties with his german , probably because he does n't want to speak the language .
but that 's not important because we all speak a type of football language with each other anyway .
for that reason language is n't so important and he does n't have to learn german , but it might help him in his private life .
he helps our team immensely on the field .
i help him in training and on the field to understand what 's going on .
it 's good that he 's here in frankfurt - he strengthens our team and that 's the most important thing .
you must have personal goals though at frankfurt .
what do you aim for yourself at the start of each season ?
do you say : i want 20 goals ?
no , i do n't believe in that .
i put the team first and its success .
if we are successful , if we play well and develop our game , then each one of us will develop individually anyway .
that 's a basic principle but you have to understand it .
i will never say : i want 10 , 15 or 20 goals in a season .
i 've scored three thus far , that 's okay .
i would certainly like to score a few more this season .
but the specific number is unimportant .
let 's say , hypothetically , you are playing for frankfurt in the german cup and you score a goal .
two months later you score a goal for greece in the european championships .
what 's more important for you , personally ?
well , it depends .
if it was the third or fourth goal in a game then it 's not so important as when it is a tight 1-0 win .
if it was the 1-0 for greece then i would prefer to score that than the 4-0 for frankfurt because there the game has already been won !
a very diplomatic answer .
okay , ianni , thanks for your time .
no worries .

this would be phased in between 2014 and 2017 . give new powers to the european commission , european parliament and european court of justice , in areas such as justice and domestic affairs remove the national veto in a number of areas is the reform treaty just the failed european constitution under a different name ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french , along with the dutch , gave a resounding " non " originally , the reform treaty was described as having " no constitutional characteristics , " but investigations by a number of international analysis groups have noted that only two of the 440 provisions in the reform treaty differ from the original constitution .
the constitution 's references to european flags and anthems , which proved unpopular with voters , have been left out .
however , the existing flag , anthem and european motto - " united in diversity " - will remain . the role of european foreign minister included in the constitution text has also been replaced by the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , and the use of the term " european laws " has been dropped in favor of " european regulations . " what is likely to happen in lisbon and in the future ? the representatives from the 27 eu member states are expected to agree on the final text of the treaty in lisbon and then sign off on the treaty at a summit of european leaders in brussels in december .
much like the process used for the doomed constitution , the treaty will then have to be ratified by all the eu 's member states .
if this is completed , the treaty will come into force in 2009 . ratification was the process that spelled the end of the constitution .
some countries chose to put the constitution to the people in a referendum .
it was killed off by two " no " votes , from france and the netherlands .
to avoid this , most countries are expected to leave the ratification of the treaty to their parliaments , who are expected to back the deal . however , ireland plans to hold a referendum , the danes want one too and so do quite a few dutch , despite their government taking a huge risk by holding out against the will of the people .
the british government promised a referendum on the constitution but never got the chance to hold one as the french and dutch votes made it unnecessary . what could go wrong ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things may not be so clear if some nations cause trouble for the treaty to come into being , all the decisions surrounding it have to be unanimous .
there are a number of wrenches that could potentially end up in the works , specifically those lobbed in from poland and the uk . poland is threatening to block the treaty unless it includes an agreement - known as the ioannina compromise - to allow countries to defer unpalatable decisions that have been agreed by a narrow majority . the british have a number of " red lines " regarding issues of sovereignty in which the uk has an opt-out clause .
the exceptions were agreed to principle in discussions under german leadership in june .
however , britain could pull the treaty plug if the legal work carried out on the treaty text since june adapts or removes any of these " red lines . " while these two offer the greatest threats to the treaty , the most bizarre arguably comes from bulgaria .
sofia is threatening to derail the treaty over the spelling of euro currency , which it insists should be " evro " in its cyrillic alphabet . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , to step up reform and warned that europe 's biggest economy faced slowing growth next year . the institutes told the government in their autumn report presented in berlin on thursday that german growth will slip back to 2.2 percent in 2008 from 2.6 percent this year , with a soaring euro , the global credit crunch and surging oil prices undercutting the nation 's expansion rate .
some economists are more pessimistic and believe germany will be lucky to reach a growth rate next year of 2 percent .
the international monetary fund said this week it expects german growth will slip to 2 percent next year from 2.4 percent for 2007 .
thursday 's report was drawn up by four leading german economic institutes in conjunction with research groups from other european nations .
criticism of ineffective reforms coming in the wake of criticism by german business about the failure of angela merkel 's government coalition to press on with economic reform , the institutes said : " much more additional work needs to be done rather than roll back the reforms so far discussed .
" the labor market reform course of the last few years has not progressed , " the institutes added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us housing market crisis had a knock-on effect the report comes as economists attempt to size up the ramifications of the shakeout in global share prices in august following the credit crunch triggered by the us housing market crisis .
at the same time , the institutes joined a growing list of forecasters who have revised down their growth outlook for germany .
high oil prices , the strong euro and financial market uncertainty will " dampen growth , " roland döhrn , an economist with the essen-based institute for scientific research -lrb- rwi -rrb- , told a press conference following the release of the report .
in their last report in the spring , the institutes projected a growth rate for germany of 2.4 percent in both 2007 and 2008 , with strong export demand powering the nation 's economic performance .
export growth likely to decline since then , however , the euro has climbed to an all-time high of $ 1.43 as fears have set in about the us economic outlook , consequently fuelling concerns about the prospects for germany 's key export machine .
the institutes predict german export growth will decline to 3 percent in 2008 from 3.5 percent this year , with stronger private consumption emerging as a key pillar of growth .
the institutes are also forecasting private consumption to grow by 1.5 percent next year compared to just 0.2 percent in 2007 .
the release of the institutes ' report is expected to lead to the german government also scaling back its growth projections for the nation .
germany emerged last year from a protracted period of stagnation , with a recent solid growth rate helping to ease the nation 's high unemployment .
larger reduction in unemployment that expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german unemployment dropped in september the number of people out of work in germany fell more than expected in september , data released last month showed , with employers continuing to hire on the back of the economic upswing and years of wage restraint .
the institutes expect unemployment to continue falling to average 7.9 percent in 2008 compared to 8.7 percent in 2007 .
germany 's jobless rate stood at 10.3 percent last year .
apart from the rwi , the german institutes involved in drawing up the report included the kiel institute for the world economy -lrb- ifw -rrb- , halle institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- and the munich- based ifo institute for economic research . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

currently in berlin , he took time off from writing to discuss his latest work and what 's going wrong in both of his home countries . with his 2003 debut " the russian debutante 's handbook " and the follow-up " absurdistan " from 2006 , gary shteyngart established his credentials as one of the english language 's best young writers and a satirist with a talent for highlighting the absurdities of both the east and the west after the cold war .
now he 's trying something a bit different .
dw-world.de : your books have been read and marketed as part of a new immigrant literature in the us , but they 're not at all earnest or politically correct .
why is that ?
gary shteyngart : well , first of all , because i was very unlucky and got sent to this horrible hebrew school .
if it was n't for those eight years being told by rabbis that the holocaust happened because i ate a piece of pork salami , i do n't think you would have had books like " absurdistan . "
that took away any sense i might have had about anything being sacred .
unless you were an idiot , you could see from a mile away that a lot of things were just plain stupid and very coercive .
then i went to a really great high school in manhattan that was a true melting pot , a holding pen for multinational nerds .
it was a place where chinese , russian and indian people gathered together , and it was a real free-for-all .
then i went to oberlin college , and that was the final straw .
from the moment i got there i just wanted to make fun of it .
the first week i was there , i got chewed out for calling some a freshman instead of a " fresh person , " and there was a professor who had devoted his life to translating brezhnev 's works into yiddish .
so that was maybe the best part of my education since it gave me such wonderful targets to go after .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of " absurdistan " is called " snack daddy 's adventurous trip " you 're working on a new book as a fellow of the american academy here in berlin .
what 's the novel about ?
it 's the first book i 've set almost entirely in america , and it takes place - god help me because the phrase " speculative fiction " makes my skin crawl - in the near future .
it follows the love affair of two immigrants , as america slowly disintegrates .
new york and los angeles have become two heavily guarded areas , or what i call " cooperative exclusion zones . "
a small group of rich shareholders achieve immortality , while the vast majority of the population loses the ability to speak , read and write in english .
and that 's what happens to one of the two lovers .
that 's very different from your first two books , which feature unscrupulous us-immigrant protagonists forced to go back to an absurd , violent and materialistic eastern europe .
one sets up a pyramid scheme in prague , while the other tries to procure a fake passport amidst a halliburton-sponsored war in the caucasus .
why the change in the emphasis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of eastern european oil is a shteyngart speciality well , i ca n't do the same story over and over again .
the first book , " the russian debutante 's handbook , " dealt with the rise of turbo-capitalism in eastern europe , and the second , " absurdistan , " took that further by bringing in us foreign policy , specifically the politics of the oil industry .
the third one deals with the fact that we in the us have become " absurdistan " in some respects , for instance , in our approach to human rights issues , privacy and upholding the constitution .
one of the worst outcomes of 9/11 is that many of the people who traditionally came to america are now having second thoughts about that .
i also wanted to write about the baby boomers ' inability to come to terms with their own mortality .
and lastly , this book features a love affair that runs from page one to page 350 or whatever .
i 've never done that before .
why come to berlin if the book is set almost entirely in america ?
i work a lot better off-shore , so to speak , than in america .
there 's something about being in countries where i do n't speak the language .
most of " absurdistan " was written in italy .
and i 'm working much faster here than i ever have before .
like in new york , there 's both an excitement and a gloom about the city , but what interests me is that , unlike new york , there 's a real collision of east and west here .
to think that we 're only an hour and a half from poland here is really amazing .
what do you think then about the latest developments in eastern europe , in particular vladimir putin 's russia ?
some of them resemble the fictional scenarios you created in " absurdistan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shteyngart says both bush and putin have betrayed the ideals of democracy i began writing that book before 9/11 and before halliburton got so involved in iraq .
but i was observing events in azerbaijan and georgia , and the path looked very clear .
in the book i 'm writing now , russia is called " petro-state russia . "
and that 's exactly what russia is - a state run on the profits of natural gas , oil and a couple of other commodities .
putin has done it .
there 's a chance that there will be no opposition parties whatsoever in the next russian election .
there 's not even a pretense of democracy .
basically , putin can have power for life if he wants it .
he can just say : " now i 'm going to be the president , now i 'm going to be the prime minister . "
he 'll just take the power with him from office to office like a traveling bag .
the country has sold out any ideals of democracy it ever had for the idea some sort of stability .
and there 's a huge gap between rich and poor - in my third book , i 'm calling that up and bringing it back to america .
it does n't sound as though you have high hopes for either russia or the us .
i was brought up between these two empires , one of which died and the other of which is dying in its own way .
as far as russia goes , there 's a restaurant in st. petersburg that 's called " 1913 , " which is known as the only good year in russian history .
it 's an autocratic country with an autocratic tradition and an autocratic church .
with america , i feel very much an american these days , because something i love is being destroyed .
for those of us who were displaced at an early age , america was always the place to go to , and the worst result of 9/11 would be that it stops being that . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 18.10.2007 russian-american author sees bleak future for democracy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shteyngart describes russia and the us as dying and soon-to-be-dead empires novelist gary shteyngart was born in russia but moved to the us at age seven .
currently in berlin , he took time off from writing to discuss his latest work and what 's going wrong in both of his home countries . with his 2003 debut " the russian debutante 's handbook " and the follow-up " absurdistan " from 2006 , gary shteyngart established his credentials as one of the english language 's best young writers and a satirist with a talent for highlighting the absurdities of both the east and the west after the cold war .
now he 's trying something a bit different .
dw-world.de : your books have been read and marketed as part of a new immigrant literature in the us , but they 're not at all earnest or politically correct .
why is that ?
gary shteyngart : well , first of all , because i was very unlucky and got sent to this horrible hebrew school .
if it was n't for those eight years being told by rabbis that the holocaust happened because i ate a piece of pork salami , i do n't think you would have had books like " absurdistan . "
that took away any sense i might have had about anything being sacred .
unless you were an idiot , you could see from a mile away that a lot of things were just plain stupid and very coercive .
then i went to a really great high school in manhattan that was a true melting pot , a holding pen for multinational nerds .
it was a place where chinese , russian and indian people gathered together , and it was a real free-for-all .
then i went to oberlin college , and that was the final straw .
from the moment i got there i just wanted to make fun of it .
the first week i was there , i got chewed out for calling some a freshman instead of a " fresh person , " and there was a professor who had devoted his life to translating brezhnev 's works into yiddish .
so that was maybe the best part of my education since it gave me such wonderful targets to go after .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of " absurdistan " is called " snack daddy 's adventurous trip " you 're working on a new book as a fellow of the american academy here in berlin .
what 's the novel about ?
it 's the first book i 've set almost entirely in america , and it takes place - god help me because the phrase " speculative fiction " makes my skin crawl - in the near future .
it follows the love affair of two immigrants , as america slowly disintegrates .
new york and los angeles have become two heavily guarded areas , or what i call " cooperative exclusion zones . "
a small group of rich shareholders achieve immortality , while the vast majority of the population loses the ability to speak , read and write in english .
and that 's what happens to one of the two lovers .
that 's very different from your first two books , which feature unscrupulous us-immigrant protagonists forced to go back to an absurd , violent and materialistic eastern europe .
one sets up a pyramid scheme in prague , while the other tries to procure a fake passport amidst a halliburton-sponsored war in the caucasus .
why the change in the emphasis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of eastern european oil is a shteyngart speciality well , i ca n't do the same story over and over again .
the first book , " the russian debutante 's handbook , " dealt with the rise of turbo-capitalism in eastern europe , and the second , " absurdistan , " took that further by bringing in us foreign policy , specifically the politics of the oil industry .
the third one deals with the fact that we in the us have become " absurdistan " in some respects , for instance , in our approach to human rights issues , privacy and upholding the constitution .
one of the worst outcomes of 9/11 is that many of the people who traditionally came to america are now having second thoughts about that .
i also wanted to write about the baby boomers ' inability to come to terms with their own mortality .
and lastly , this book features a love affair that runs from page one to page 350 or whatever .
i 've never done that before .
why come to berlin if the book is set almost entirely in america ?
i work a lot better off-shore , so to speak , than in america .
there 's something about being in countries where i do n't speak the language .
most of " absurdistan " was written in italy .
and i 'm working much faster here than i ever have before .
like in new york , there 's both an excitement and a gloom about the city , but what interests me is that , unlike new york , there 's a real collision of east and west here .
to think that we 're only an hour and a half from poland here is really amazing .
what do you think then about the latest developments in eastern europe , in particular vladimir putin 's russia ?
some of them resemble the fictional scenarios you created in " absurdistan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shteyngart says both bush and putin have betrayed the ideals of democracy i began writing that book before 9/11 and before halliburton got so involved in iraq .
but i was observing events in azerbaijan and georgia , and the path looked very clear .
in the book i 'm writing now , russia is called " petro-state russia . "
and that 's exactly what russia is - a state run on the profits of natural gas , oil and a couple of other commodities .
putin has done it .
there 's a chance that there will be no opposition parties whatsoever in the next russian election .
there 's not even a pretense of democracy .
basically , putin can have power for life if he wants it .
he can just say : " now i 'm going to be the president , now i 'm going to be the prime minister . "
he 'll just take the power with him from office to office like a traveling bag .
the country has sold out any ideals of democracy it ever had for the idea some sort of stability .
and there 's a huge gap between rich and poor - in my third book , i 'm calling that up and bringing it back to america .
it does n't sound as though you have high hopes for either russia or the us .
i was brought up between these two empires , one of which died and the other of which is dying in its own way .
as far as russia goes , there 's a restaurant in st. petersburg that 's called " 1913 , " which is known as the only good year in russian history .
it 's an autocratic country with an autocratic tradition and an autocratic church .
with america , i feel very much an american these days , because something i love is being destroyed .
for those of us who were displaced at an early age , america was always the place to go to , and the worst result of 9/11 would be that it stops being that . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , to step up reform and warned that europe 's biggest economy faced slowing growth next year . the institutes told the government in their autumn report presented in berlin on thursday that german growth will slip back to 2.2 percent in 2008 from 2.6 percent this year , with a soaring euro , the global credit crunch and surging oil prices undercutting the nation 's expansion rate .
some economists are more pessimistic and believe germany will be lucky to reach a growth rate next year of 2 percent .
the international monetary fund said this week it expects german growth will slip to 2 percent next year from 2.4 percent for 2007 .
thursday 's report was drawn up by four leading german economic institutes in conjunction with research groups from other european nations .
criticism of ineffective reforms coming in the wake of criticism by german business about the failure of angela merkel 's government coalition to press on with economic reform , the institutes said : " much more additional work needs to be done rather than roll back the reforms so far discussed .
" the labor market reform course of the last few years has not progressed , " the institutes added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us housing market crisis had a knock-on effect the report comes as economists attempt to size up the ramifications of the shakeout in global share prices in august following the credit crunch triggered by the us housing market crisis .
at the same time , the institutes joined a growing list of forecasters who have revised down their growth outlook for germany .
high oil prices , the strong euro and financial market uncertainty will " dampen growth , " roland döhrn , an economist with the essen-based institute for scientific research -lrb- rwi -rrb- , told a press conference following the release of the report .
in their last report in the spring , the institutes projected a growth rate for germany of 2.4 percent in both 2007 and 2008 , with strong export demand powering the nation 's economic performance .
export growth likely to decline since then , however , the euro has climbed to an all-time high of $ 1.43 as fears have set in about the us economic outlook , consequently fuelling concerns about the prospects for germany 's key export machine .
the institutes predict german export growth will decline to 3 percent in 2008 from 3.5 percent this year , with stronger private consumption emerging as a key pillar of growth .
the institutes are also forecasting private consumption to grow by 1.5 percent next year compared to just 0.2 percent in 2007 .
the release of the institutes ' report is expected to lead to the german government also scaling back its growth projections for the nation .
germany emerged last year from a protracted period of stagnation , with a recent solid growth rate helping to ease the nation 's high unemployment .
larger reduction in unemployment that expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german unemployment dropped in september the number of people out of work in germany fell more than expected in september , data released last month showed , with employers continuing to hire on the back of the economic upswing and years of wage restraint .
the institutes expect unemployment to continue falling to average 7.9 percent in 2008 compared to 8.7 percent in 2007 .
germany 's jobless rate stood at 10.3 percent last year .
apart from the rwi , the german institutes involved in drawing up the report included the kiel institute for the world economy -lrb- ifw -rrb- , halle institute for economic research -lrb- iwh -rrb- and the munich- based ifo institute for economic research . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de europeans upbeat about economic outlook despite clouds cast by the us real estate crisis , europeans are still optimistic about the current economic situation , according to a continent-wide survey published on thursday .

one which has been around for three decades and which has taught hundreds of kids may not even feature at all . officials in the north german city of bremen have been left searching for an explanation as to how a ' secret ' primary school managed to operate for 30 years and send hundreds of children on to secondary education and beyond without anyone apparently noticing .
after ruling out top secret cloaking devices and the possibility of magic , the authorities are slowly coming to the conclusion that a long line of education ministry officials in the city state have been guilty of incompetence on a major scale .
the school in the district of steintor , organized by disgruntled leftwing , mainly academic parents , taught several hundred children aged between four and ten right under the noses of the state education ministry for nearly three decades .
disgruntled parents opted out of state system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : invisible children learning in a non-existant school in a reaction to the rigid pedagogical practices of the state system , the parents set up the school in an old villa where pupils attended mixed and same-sex classes , combining all age groups , in a relaxed and fun atmosphere .
the kids then went on to high schools in the area with forged education certificates .
many of them excelled , attended university and went on to build successful careers . renate jürgens-pieper , the social democrat education minister for the state of bremen , attempted to deflect the accusations of incompetence by accusing the parents of deception .
" they have been cheating us for years , " she said in a report published by british newspaper the guardian .
as an unregistered institution run by parents , she added , the school failed to abide by basic health and safety standards such as stair rails , separate toilets for pupils and teachers , and fire regulations .
school raided by cops but remained unseen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i see no school " what is unusual is that the authorities claim not to have been aware of the existence of the unregistered alternative primary school despite it being raided by police on one occasion in the past , suggesting that rather than not knowing it was there , state officials in the past had turned a blind eye to the school .
the school is now set to close and the children will be moved on to established and presumably visible schools in the area while the parents will be fined . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he ’ s 25 years old and frankfurt 's new captain for this season .
things are going well for the striker at the moment .
his team is seventh on the table and he just shot greece into euro 2008 . dw-tv : first of all : should we refer to each other formally or by first name ?
ioannis amanatidis : using first names is fine .
okay , that 's good .
my name 's andré ...
i 'm ianni .
ianni , i 'm from australia and as an australian i 've spent the last months watching the cricket world cup and rugby world cup .
it was great .
why should i come down on a saturday afternoon and watch frankfurt play ?
i think in europe , and especially germany , football really is the number one sport .
you can see that when you go to a game .
the stadium here is fantastic , with a great atmosphere .
every week we have basically a sell out crowd .
the feeling is indescribable .
you just have to be there yourself and experience it .
you 've played with a few teams in germany : fürth , kaiserslautern , stuttgart .
what 's so special about frankfurt ?
i 've been pretty much everywhere in southern germany , that 's true .
but somehow i just could n't leave frankfurt .
i just like it here i suppose .
i 've played the majority of my bundesliga games for frankfurt , scored most of my goals here and when i 'm moving around the city i feel comfortable .
if i go away and visit friends - to stuttgart or wherever - then i immediately feel at home when i drive back in to the city .
that 's a satisfying feeling .
you mention feeling at home here ... but you were born in kozani , in northern greece .
what was life like back then ?
it was a simple village life .
i lived there until i was 9 years old and went to school there .
well actually as soon as i got home from school i went and played football on the street with my friends .
sometimes i got in trouble because there was homework that needed doing ... other times i just slipped off without anyone noticing .
i suppose you could say that greek village life is a bit more relaxed than living here .
then my family decided that we were going to move to germany .
you are now in the greek international side , have been for a while in fact .
do you have goals at that level ?
of course .
i want to play for greece as much as i can .
when i first came in to the national team i was 21 or 22 and was playing only irregularly .
now i have established myself .
if i stay fit and perform at my best , i should be playing .
and that 's the goal .
and if i am on the field then i want to show what i can do - for my country and for our fans , my countrymen , who always come and support us .
speaking of countrymen : there is another greek player at frankfurt , sotirios kyrgiakos .
what 's it like having him on the pitch for you as captain ? he 's still having difficulties with his german , probably because he does n't want to speak the language .
but that 's not important because we all speak a type of football language with each other anyway .
for that reason language is n't so important and he does n't have to learn german , but it might help him in his private life .
he helps our team immensely on the field .
i help him in training and on the field to understand what 's going on .
it 's good that he 's here in frankfurt - he strengthens our team and that 's the most important thing .
you must have personal goals though at frankfurt .
what do you aim for yourself at the start of each season ?
do you say : i want 20 goals ?
no , i do n't believe in that .
i put the team first and its success .
if we are successful , if we play well and develop our game , then each one of us will develop individually anyway .
that 's a basic principle but you have to understand it .
i will never say : i want 10 , 15 or 20 goals in a season .
i 've scored three thus far , that 's okay .
i would certainly like to score a few more this season .
but the specific number is unimportant .
let 's say , hypothetically , you are playing for frankfurt in the german cup and you score a goal .
two months later you score a goal for greece in the european championships .
what 's more important for you , personally ?
well , it depends .
if it was the third or fourth goal in a game then it 's not so important as when it is a tight 1-0 win .
if it was the 1-0 for greece then i would prefer to score that than the 4-0 for frankfurt because there the game has already been won !
a very diplomatic answer .
okay , ianni , thanks for your time .
no worries .

17 , after meeting with nato and russian officials that washington 's missile shield plans could be changed should iran suspend its nuclear program .
the shield is " intended against the major problem we see developing , which is iran , and if that problem went away or attenuated we would obviously draw conclusions , " said fried .
" this is a threat-based system , and we would be affected if iran gave up its -lsb- uranium -rsb- enrichment and worked with the international community , and had a different approach to things . "
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own defenses .
shield plans could slow down under " right conditions " while fried ruled out any immediate halt , he did suggest that the development of the shield might slow down under the right conditions .
" our position is that our negotiations with the poles and the czechs will continue , but we do n't feel the need to spend money at quite as fast a rate for a threat that is attenuated , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fried assured russia that it was not a target fried also reiterated that the defense shield was needed to guard against threats from " rogue states " like iran or north korea and assured russia once again that it was not a target .
" our real concern is not russia , " he said .
" we are advancing a missile defense program in response to what we see as an iranian ballistic missile and nuclear weapons threat .
" we want -lsb- russia 's -rsb- help , and the help of all responsible nations , to work with iran so this problem is attenuated and goes away , " fried said and added that us officials had explained their stance on iran to the russians , and that " they seemed interested in the concept . "
polish election could affect us relations another factor which may force washington 's hand in adapting its plan for european bases is poland 's parliamentary election on sunday .
poland 's ties with the united states , its cooperation on the defense shield and the presence of polish troops in iraq could all change if prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski loses power .
the centrist civic platform party , the main opposition to kaczynski 's ruling conservatives , is mounting a strong challenge to the current leadership and is gaining support through its leader donald tusk 's assertions that a government under his authority would not want so close a relationship with washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister kaczynski faces a challenge in the polls surveys show most poles want their troops out of iraq and oppose the missile shield .
recent events , including an attack on the polish ambassador in iraq last week , have brought these topics and poland 's foreign policy as a whole to the forefront of the civic platform party 's agenda .
prime minister kaczynski and his twin brother lech , the polish president , have put close ties with the us at the center of poland 's foreign policy alongside a distrust of the eu .
since coming to power in 2005 , the brothers have maintained the country 's military presence in iraq , increased polish forces in afghanistan and have all but pledged to host the anti-missile shield . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
domestic pressures weigh heavily on the leaders of poland , britain and italy as they gather in lisbon for an eu summit which hopes to finalize the charter to reform the bloc 's institutions . as representatives from the 27 eu members states converged on the portuguese capital on thursday , oct .
18 , for crunch talks to approve a new treaty , the leaders of poland , italy and britain came armed with issues that could torpedo the charter at the eleventh hour . in poland , where a closely-contested parliamentary election is to take place on sunday , nationalists who support the government want their country to be granted more power to delay eu decisions that it dislikes .
polish president lech kaczynski is thus insisting that the so-called " ioannina compromise " - a gentlemen 's agreement that allows eu members that can not muster a blocking minority to delay a decision while attempts to find a satisfactory solution are made - to be made legally binding .
polish president reiterates treaty delay threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president kaczynski wants what poland deserves before leaving for lisbon , the president reiterated his threat to delay the charter .
" we do n't want anything more than is our right , " president lech kaczynski told polish radio before leaving for the summit .
asked what would happen if polish demands were not met , kaczynski replied : " we will have to delay the discussion " .
any delay would be a huge blow for the treaty and the eu which has been plagued by in-fighting over the text of this charter and its predecessor , the doomed eu constitution which was derailed by referendums in france and the netherlands in 2005 .
with summits with russia and china on the horizon , the eu would face a crisis of credibility and confidence if it was to meet these powers without an agreement on the treaty behind it .
britain 's brown under domestic pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown will halt the treaty talks if need be eurosceptic britain could also throw a spanner in the works if the legal work which has been done on the draft treaty since an initial agreement in berlin in june changes or removes any of the " red lines " - areas of national sovereignty where britain would hold a veto - which the uk had asked to be included .
with public opinion showing huge opposition to any increased eu influence over british domestic politics , prime minister gordon brown will be under pressure to ensure that britain 's toes are not trodden on .
if he feels that the uk is getting a raw deal , brown may delay the treaty to get what he - and the people who will decide his fate at the next general election - wants .
prodi smarting from parliament decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's prodi has not accepted parliament 's decision meanwhile , italy is still smarting from last week 's announcement that the reduction of seats in the european parliament will mean fewer italian representatives , a decision prime minister romano prodi said he was not ready to accept .
while the issue is not directly linked to the treaty , the subject may be included in the agenda for the summit and prodi hinted that he may make it a treaty problem unless italy 's demands on the composition of the future european parliament are met .
" we can not accept a solution ... based on the number of residents rather than citizens because that does not agree with either the spirit or the letter of the new treaty , " prodi said .
the european parliament has adopted a new plan for allocating seats starting with the next legislature -lrb- 2009-14 -rrb- under which for the first time italy would have less meps -lrb- 72 -rrb- than either france -lrb- 74 -rrb- or britain -lrb- 73 -rrb- .
italy has so far refused the plan .
rome argues that it is not the total population resident in each country that should form the basis of the calculation , but rather the number of european citizens .
observers suspect that the unusually tough line taken by prodi , a former eu commission head , has a lot to do with the difficulties his fragile centre-left coalition is facing back home .
notwithstanding the many obstacles , portuguese prime minister jose socrates whose country currently heads the eu 's six-month rotating presidency said he 's optimistic of reaching a deal .

hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained the european treaty : frequently asked questions the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 18.10.2007 eu treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european union edges closer to a treaty that could make it more efficient after months of political skirmishes , eu leaders are expected to clinch a long-awaited deal on the european treaty , a document many claim will make the eu more efficient and give it more credibility . despite the assertions that the eu will finally get a new treaty which will make it easier for the bloc to manage itself , there are still some who harbor reservations .
the two-day informal summit beginning in lisbon on thursday , oct .
18 , will bring the reformed treaty one step closer to a final agreement , with representatives of the 27 eu member states expected to agree on the final text .
but failure is still possible for the document . the issues of a polish request for a mechanism allowing minorities to delay decisions that they do not like to be made legally binding and british demands to be granted an opt-out on european policies in the field of justice and domestic affairs are expected to dominate the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will gordon brown 's " red lines " be responsible for axing the reform treaty ?
however , a number of countries , including austria , britain , denmark and italy , have also expressed concerns - not all of them strictly connected to the treaty 's contents .
with the treaty relying on unanimity to get through to the final stage at a summit in brussels in december , any one country , if dissatisfied , could send the eu planners back to the drawing board .
on the positive side , the treaty has the strong backing of eu heavyweights germany and france , in contrast to the constitution draft that preceded it and was rejected by dutch and french voters in 2005 .
opposition getting quieter and quieter as the lisbon meeting gets closer , fewer and fewer dissenting voices can be heard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski has been more positive of late the czech republic , whose euroskeptic governing coalition had previously warned that the treaty would devolve too much power to brussels , recently described it as " a reasonable compromise . "
even poland , by far the most critical voice , has been scaling down its objections in the run-up to the meeting . " i am convinced it will be a success , " polish president lech kaczynski said ahead of a meeting with german chancellor angela merkel in berlin last friday .
comments of this nature have encouraged diplomats and experts in brussels to become " quietly optimistic " that community spirit will prevail over national interests once leaders gather in the portuguese capital .
eu 's size necessitates reform if a deal is indeed clinched in lisbon , it will represent a key step forward in giving the world 's biggest economic entity a much-needed political boost .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu table creaks under the weight of enlargement eu leaders first realized they would have to improve the bloc 's laborious decision-making process in view of its enlargement to 27 member states at the beginning of the new millennium .
before they can be put in place many decisions in the bloc require unanimity , which has become harder and harder to find in the expanding union .
in december 2001 , eu leaders meeting in laeken , belgium , agreed to set up a convention on the future of the eu chaired by former french president valery giscard d 'estaing .
the convention led to the constitutional treaty , which was signed in october 2004 , only to be ditched after it was given the thumbs-down by referendums held in france and the netherlands a year later .
there followed what came to be known as a " period of reflection , " until the german presidency of the eu , in the first half of 2007 , succeeded in reopening the debate , which ultimately led to the current draft .
shadow on constitution remains despite amendments the treaty under discussion in lisbon drops many of the symbolic references that were included in the proposed constitution , such as an eu flag and anthem , but preserves many of its key elements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jobs of ferrero-waldner -lrb- r . -rrb- and solana -lrb- l . -rrb- will merge these include simplifying the eu 's relations with non-members by creating a single foreign affairs chief and ending the system of a six-month rotating presidency in favor of an elected european council president . the treaty also preserves a complex double-majority rule for council decisions .
proposed eu legislation requiring a qualified majority would have to muster the support of 55 percent of member states representing 65 percent of the eu 's total population of nearly 500 million people . # b # if the draft text is approved , it will have to be formally signed at a ceremony tentatively scheduled for the end of the year and then ratified in all 27 member states before european parliament elections are held in 2009 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eight o ’ clock in the german capital – time for the news magazine of germany ’ s international television service : nearly 30 minutes of current affairs from all parts of the world , with a special focus on germany and europe and their view of the world .
it presents stories from politics and business , society , the arts , science and sport .
then , " in depth " and the " business review " provide viewers with detailed background information on the day ’ s most important events .
deutsche welle has focused its television activities at its address on voltastrasse in berlin .
dw-tv presents an information-centred television service that is available globally via satellite 24 hours a day – switching every hour from german to english , with two hours of spanish as well in america .
in mid-2002 , a programme slot in arabic was added , which is to be extended from three to eight hours in 2007 .
it can be viewed in more than 20 countries via the nilesat satellite – from morocco to saudi arabia , as well as in large parts of mali , niger , chad and sudan .
it is also broadcast via hotbird , making it available in europe as well .
opening regional windows is part of dw ’ s long-term strategy ; it increases acceptance of germany ’ s international television broadcaster .
increased cooperation with the regional broadcasters of ard and zdf will bring about a substantial expansion and enhancement of dw-tv ’ s programme , following the signing of an agreement at the end of 2006 .
new programmes for latin america and the us are already on air and new regional schedules for the rest of the world will follow in 2008 .
journal – the flagship journal , the half-hour news magazine , is dw-tv ’ s flagship : every hour , alternately in german and english .
in latin america , viewers can see two spanish editions of the programme per day , while for the arab world there are six broadcasts in arabic .
dw-tv also presents a range of other programmes providing even more in-depth information .

hundreds of partner stations rebroadcast it completely or in part .

every day , ten million people around the world watch deutsche welle ’ s television service .
a multitude of other programs and shows can also be seen as a live-stream on the internet -lrb- dw-world.de -rrb- , which are available as video on demand or podcast .
looking back dw-tv was launched in april 1992 .
germany ’ s international broadcaster evolved from rias tv during the course of german reunification .
initially , six hours of programming -lrb- german and english -rrb- went out to the world via satellite .
only a few months later , the programme was extended to 14 hours , and in july 1993 to 16 hours .
then spanish was added as a third language .
since 1995 , dw-tv has been broadcasting around the clock .
the content and structure of the programme have been adapted and updated a number of times – a process that has always been guided by an efficient overall concept of the way germany ’ s media image is presented to the outside world .
the most radical change was dw-tv ’ s repositioning as of 1 january , 1999 : since then , dw-tv has focused on news and information , with an additional spotlight on the arts and culture in general .
in 2002 , the arabic service was introduced , as well as a special service for the national afghan television service , rta : news in dari and pashto .
the dw-akademie trained staff and set up an editorial office for the partner station in kabul , which has produced this news programme on its own since the end of august 2006 .

17 , after meeting with nato and russian officials that washington 's missile shield plans could be changed should iran suspend its nuclear program .
the shield is " intended against the major problem we see developing , which is iran , and if that problem went away or attenuated we would obviously draw conclusions , " said fried .
" this is a threat-based system , and we would be affected if iran gave up its -lsb- uranium -rsb- enrichment and worked with the international community , and had a different approach to things . "
moscow has been highly critical of the us plans to place part of its missile defense system near russia 's european borders , specifically focusing on the proposed installation of 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
russia argues that iran does not have the long-range missiles necessary to pose any threat to europe , let alone the continental united states , and is unlikely to develop that capacity any time soon .
russia 's main concern is that the us shield would compromise its own defenses .
shield plans could slow down under " right conditions " while fried ruled out any immediate halt , he did suggest that the development of the shield might slow down under the right conditions .
" our position is that our negotiations with the poles and the czechs will continue , but we do n't feel the need to spend money at quite as fast a rate for a threat that is attenuated , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fried assured russia that it was not a target fried also reiterated that the defense shield was needed to guard against threats from " rogue states " like iran or north korea and assured russia once again that it was not a target .
" our real concern is not russia , " he said .
" we are advancing a missile defense program in response to what we see as an iranian ballistic missile and nuclear weapons threat .
" we want -lsb- russia 's -rsb- help , and the help of all responsible nations , to work with iran so this problem is attenuated and goes away , " fried said and added that us officials had explained their stance on iran to the russians , and that " they seemed interested in the concept . "
polish election could affect us relations another factor which may force washington 's hand in adapting its plan for european bases is poland 's parliamentary election on sunday .
poland 's ties with the united states , its cooperation on the defense shield and the presence of polish troops in iraq could all change if prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski loses power .
the centrist civic platform party , the main opposition to kaczynski 's ruling conservatives , is mounting a strong challenge to the current leadership and is gaining support through its leader donald tusk 's assertions that a government under his authority would not want so close a relationship with washington .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister kaczynski faces a challenge in the polls surveys show most poles want their troops out of iraq and oppose the missile shield .
recent events , including an attack on the polish ambassador in iraq last week , have brought these topics and poland 's foreign policy as a whole to the forefront of the civic platform party 's agenda .
prime minister kaczynski and his twin brother lech , the polish president , have put close ties with the us at the center of poland 's foreign policy alongside a distrust of the eu .
since coming to power in 2005 , the brothers have maintained the country 's military presence in iraq , increased polish forces in afghanistan and have all but pledged to host the anti-missile shield . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

currently in berlin , he took time off from writing to discuss his latest work and what 's going wrong in both of his home countries . with his 2003 debut " the russian debutante 's handbook " and the follow-up " absurdistan " from 2006 , gary shteyngart established his credentials as one of the english language 's best young writers and a satirist with a talent for highlighting the absurdities of both the east and the west after the cold war .
now he 's trying something a bit different .
dw-world.de : your books have been read and marketed as part of a new immigrant literature in the us , but they 're not at all earnest or politically correct .
why is that ?
gary shteyngart : well , first of all , because i was very unlucky and got sent to this horrible hebrew school .
if it was n't for those eight years being told by rabbis that the holocaust happened because i ate a piece of pork salami , i do n't think you would have had books like " absurdistan . "
that took away any sense i might have had about anything being sacred .
unless you were an idiot , you could see from a mile away that a lot of things were just plain stupid and very coercive .
then i went to a really great high school in manhattan that was a true melting pot , a holding pen for multinational nerds .
it was a place where chinese , russian and indian people gathered together , and it was a real free-for-all .
then i went to oberlin college , and that was the final straw .
from the moment i got there i just wanted to make fun of it .
the first week i was there , i got chewed out for calling some a freshman instead of a " fresh person , " and there was a professor who had devoted his life to translating brezhnev 's works into yiddish .
so that was maybe the best part of my education since it gave me such wonderful targets to go after .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of " absurdistan " is called " snack daddy 's adventurous trip " you 're working on a new book as a fellow of the american academy here in berlin .
what 's the novel about ?
it 's the first book i 've set almost entirely in america , and it takes place - god help me because the phrase " speculative fiction " makes my skin crawl - in the near future .
it follows the love affair of two immigrants , as america slowly disintegrates .
new york and los angeles have become two heavily guarded areas , or what i call " cooperative exclusion zones . "
a small group of rich shareholders achieve immortality , while the vast majority of the population loses the ability to speak , read and write in english .
and that 's what happens to one of the two lovers .
that 's very different from your first two books , which feature unscrupulous us-immigrant protagonists forced to go back to an absurd , violent and materialistic eastern europe .
one sets up a pyramid scheme in prague , while the other tries to procure a fake passport amidst a halliburton-sponsored war in the caucasus .
why the change in the emphasis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of eastern european oil is a shteyngart speciality well , i ca n't do the same story over and over again .
the first book , " the russian debutante 's handbook , " dealt with the rise of turbo-capitalism in eastern europe , and the second , " absurdistan , " took that further by bringing in us foreign policy , specifically the politics of the oil industry .
the third one deals with the fact that we in the us have become " absurdistan " in some respects , for instance , in our approach to human rights issues , privacy and upholding the constitution .
one of the worst outcomes of 9/11 is that many of the people who traditionally came to america are now having second thoughts about that .
i also wanted to write about the baby boomers ' inability to come to terms with their own mortality .
and lastly , this book features a love affair that runs from page one to page 350 or whatever .
i 've never done that before .
why come to berlin if the book is set almost entirely in america ?
i work a lot better off-shore , so to speak , than in america .
there 's something about being in countries where i do n't speak the language .
most of " absurdistan " was written in italy .
and i 'm working much faster here than i ever have before .
like in new york , there 's both an excitement and a gloom about the city , but what interests me is that , unlike new york , there 's a real collision of east and west here .
to think that we 're only an hour and a half from poland here is really amazing .
what do you think then about the latest developments in eastern europe , in particular vladimir putin 's russia ?
some of them resemble the fictional scenarios you created in " absurdistan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shteyngart says both bush and putin have betrayed the ideals of democracy i began writing that book before 9/11 and before halliburton got so involved in iraq .
but i was observing events in azerbaijan and georgia , and the path looked very clear .
in the book i 'm writing now , russia is called " petro-state russia . "
and that 's exactly what russia is - a state run on the profits of natural gas , oil and a couple of other commodities .
putin has done it .
there 's a chance that there will be no opposition parties whatsoever in the next russian election .
there 's not even a pretense of democracy .
basically , putin can have power for life if he wants it .
he can just say : " now i 'm going to be the president , now i 'm going to be the prime minister . "
he 'll just take the power with him from office to office like a traveling bag .
the country has sold out any ideals of democracy it ever had for the idea some sort of stability .
and there 's a huge gap between rich and poor - in my third book , i 'm calling that up and bringing it back to america .
it does n't sound as though you have high hopes for either russia or the us .
i was brought up between these two empires , one of which died and the other of which is dying in its own way .
as far as russia goes , there 's a restaurant in st. petersburg that 's called " 1913 , " which is known as the only good year in russian history .
it 's an autocratic country with an autocratic tradition and an autocratic church .
with america , i feel very much an american these days , because something i love is being destroyed .
for those of us who were displaced at an early age , america was always the place to go to , and the worst result of 9/11 would be that it stops being that . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

george w bush attended the ceremony in washington , the first time a sitting us president has appeared in public with the exiled tibetan leader .
chinese state media had warned it would " cast a shadow " over ties with the us .
beijing has been accused of human rights abuses in tibet , which its communist troops occupied in 1951 .
' man of peace ' mr bush led the 72-year-old buddhist leader into the capitol rotunda , holding his hand as they entered before sitting side-by-side .
congressional gold medal top us civilian award originally awarded to soldiers for achievement in battle , but became civilian award with introduction of medal of honor first awarded in 1776 to general george washington two-third majority required to approve each candidate each medal uniquely designed and created by the us mint over 100 medals awarded previous winners include mother teresa , nelson mandela tony blair , winston churchill and pope john paul ii as he presented the medal , mr bush hailed the nobel peace prize winner as a " universal symbol of peace and tolerance " .
" i will continue to urge the leaders of china to welcome the dalai lama to china , " mr bush said .
" they will find this good man to be a man of peace and reconciliation . "
he said the us could not close its eyes to the plight of the religiously oppressed .
the tibetan leader said he was " deeply touched " to receive such a " great honour " .
" i believe that this award also sends a powerful message to those individuals who are dedicated to promoting peace , " the dalai lama said .
' gross interference ' mr bush met the dalai lama behind closed doors on tuesday in the white house residence , rather than the oval office , out of deference to china .
it was their third private meeting in six years .
but wednesday 's elaborate ceremony was a much more public affair .
beijing described it as a " gross interference in china 's internal affairs " .
" china is strongly resentful of this and resolutely opposes it , " foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao was quoted by the official xinhua news agency as saying .
an editorial in the official china daily newspaper said : " this event will certainly cast a shadow over the relations . "
beijing has long argued the dalai lama is seeking to destroy china 's sovereignty by pushing for independence for devoutly buddhist tibet .
he insists he wants " real autonomy " , not independence for the region , which beijing claims is an " inalienable " part of china .
balancing act analysts say it is a delicate diplomatic balancing act for mr bush , who needs china 's help to manage nuclear standoffs with iran and north korea .
it was the first time a us president had appeared with the dalai lama in public meanwhile , china 's communist party , which is holding its 17th congress this week , is highly sensitive to potential embarrassment as it prepares to stage next year 's olympics .
us lawmakers regularly accuse beijing of turning a blind eye to alleged human rights abuses in burma and sudan in its pursuit of energy and business deals .
recently , world leaders have grown more vocal in their concern for human rights in tibet .
in september , german chancellor angela merkel met the dalai lama , incurring beijing 's wrath .
the dalai lama has also met austrian chancellor alfred gusenbauer and australian prime minister john howard this year , and is due to meet canadian prime minister stephen harper later this month .

research for the bbc two series , the truth about property , found 53 % of respondents believed owning property was safer than cash .
the poll took place in the aftermath of the northern rock crisis , the first run on a british bank in nearly 150 years .
the findings come despite mounting evidence of a slowing housing market .
' extreme measures ' prices have fallen in many parts of the uk in the past few months , prompting some analysts to question whether the decade-long housing boom is coming to an end .
in order to gauge how record house prices were affecting people 's lives , the bbc commissioned nop to conduct research on the issue at the end of last month .
asked which they thought was a safer investment at the moment , 53 % of those surveyed said buying property was safer than cash .
that belief is directly at odds with the view accepted by the overwhelming majority of investment professionals .
they regard cash as safer than property because as long as the bank is solvent , there is no risk to your capital .
it will also raise questions about the success of the government 's attempts to reassure the public following the run on northern rock .
the programme also discovered that first-time buyers , fearing the first rung of the property ladder is drifting out of reach , are taking extreme steps to obtain a property .

forty-four trusts were not complying with one or all aspects of the hygiene code , standards seen as key after the recent deaths from hospital infections .
the general picture in the watchdog 's annual health check of england 's trusts was , however , one of improvement .
but regional divides persist , with the north performing better than the south .
trusts were rated on two principle categories : quality of services and how they had managed their finances .
nhs ratings 2007 to find out more healthcare commission information for england enter your full postcode goes to external site nineteen trusts scored " excellent " on both parts of the rating , up from two last year .
but 20 were deemed " weak " - the lowest scoring - on both counts , four of these for two years in a row .
health secretary alan johnson said he had asked the commission to re-inspect the 44 trusts failing on infection .
he also said that if the chief executive of the nhs was unable to resolve the situation through talks with the boards at the four weakest hospitals , one option would be a takeover by a well performing trust .
the four comprise west hertfordshire hospitals nhs trust , surrey and sussex healthcare trust , northern devon healthcare trust and royal cornwall hospitals nhs trust .
target time health minister ben bradshaw told bbc breakfast that the situation was " not acceptable " but that progress was being made .

"
every trust achieved the target for cancer patients waiting no more than a month between diagnosis and treatment , except for sound clinical reasons .
despite increases in patient numbers , a & e waiting times were met nationally , with 98 % of 18 million patients receiving care within four hours .

but there were targets not being met : some 70 % were failing on " convenience and choice " , which says patients should be able to choose from four different nhs providers .
this , the commission said , was primarily because gps were not contractually obliged to offer the choice , and technical problems with the computer booking system were not uncommon .
the disappointing findings on infection control were partially mitigated by the fact that new and more rigorous standards were introduced in october 2006 , the commission said .
" the bar was raised dramatically on infection control and that explains why trusts seem to be performing worse than in the past , " said chief executive anna walker .

north and south the trust was one of the 20 which scored poorly in both categories , the majority of which were found in the south of the country .
overall , the south west strategic health authority -lrb- sha -rrb- , one of the 10 covering the country , had the highest proportion of weak trusts .

the commission said the division was a long-standing one which was only starting to come to light as a result of the surveys it carried out .
" there has been historic poor performance in these areas , but it 's only now there 's been a spotlight on them , " said ms walker .
" hopefully now that it 's out in the open improvements will be made , and trusts in the south can look at what they can learn from the north . "
health secretary alan johnson said : " this independent verdict on the nhs shows clear improvement .
" the well-performing and improving trusts are to be congratulated , but we need to see more improvement from those classed as weak . "
dr hamish meldrum , british medical association chairman , welcomed the general improvement .

forty-four trusts were not complying with one or all aspects of the hygiene code , standards seen as key after the recent deaths from hospital infections .
the general picture in the watchdog 's annual health check of england 's trusts was , however , one of improvement .
but regional divides persist , with the north performing better than the south .
trusts were rated on two principle categories : quality of services and how they had managed their finances .
nhs ratings 2007 to find out more healthcare commission information for england enter your full postcode goes to external site nineteen trusts scored " excellent " on both parts of the rating , up from two last year .
but 20 were deemed " weak " - the lowest scoring - on both counts , four of these for two years in a row .
health secretary alan johnson said he had asked the commission to re-inspect the 44 trusts failing on infection .
he also said that if the chief executive of the nhs was unable to resolve the situation through talks with the boards at the four weakest hospitals , one option would be a takeover by a well performing trust .
the four comprise west hertfordshire hospitals nhs trust , surrey and sussex healthcare trust , northern devon healthcare trust and royal cornwall hospitals nhs trust .
target time health minister ben bradshaw told bbc breakfast that the situation was " not acceptable " but that progress was being made .
read the findings health check : national overview -lsb- 1.41mb -rsb- most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need adobe reader download the reader here he added : " just because these trusts do not meet one of these codes does not mean that their treatment or the hospitals are unsafe , or that patients need to worry about them . "
every trust achieved the target for cancer patients waiting no more than a month between diagnosis and treatment , except for sound clinical reasons .
despite increases in patient numbers , a & e waiting times were met nationally , with 98 % of 18 million patients receiving care within four hours .
weakest trusts northern devon healthcare royal cornwall hospitals surrey and sussex healthcare west hertfordshire hospitals trusts rated weak in major categories for second year royal cornwall under the spotlight nhs health check in graphics meanwhile , the proportion of operations which were cancelled fell for the third year in a row .
but there were targets not being met : some 70 % were failing on " convenience and choice " , which says patients should be able to choose from four different nhs providers .
this , the commission said , was primarily because gps were not contractually obliged to offer the choice , and technical problems with the computer booking system were not uncommon .
the disappointing findings on infection control were partially mitigated by the fact that new and more rigorous standards were introduced in october 2006 , the commission said .
" the bar was raised dramatically on infection control and that explains why trusts seem to be performing worse than in the past , " said chief executive anna walker .
have your say i 'm fed up with hospitals continually blaming patients for spreading infections andrew , devon send us your comments but the findings on the failure of some trusts to ensure hygiene standards - including cleaning hands and instruments - comes just a week after serious such shortcomings at the maidstone and tunbridge wells nhs trust were blamed for the deaths of up to 90 patients from c. difficile .
north and south the trust was one of the 20 which scored poorly in both categories , the majority of which were found in the south of the country .
overall , the south west strategic health authority -lrb- sha -rrb- , one of the 10 covering the country , had the highest proportion of weak trusts .
the south east coast sha had the lowest proportion of " excellent " trusts and the highest combination of " weak " and " fair " .

the flats at the end of harpsden road and war memorial place in henley-on-thames have been targeted by burglars and high pressure salespeople .
signs warning against canvassing for business in the area are being put up by police and the local councils .
police claim other ' no cold calling ' zones have reduced burglaries by 40 % .
julia wheeler , crime reduction advisor from thames valley police , said : " some cold callers prey on residents , particularly the vulnerable and elderly in order to trick money out of them and there is a clear link between bogus callers and burglaries .
" results of other ' no cold calling ' zones around the country have shown a reduction in both burglaries and fear of crime . "
the scheme will be introduced on 30 october and follows several other areas of oxfordshire , where doorstep callers have already been banned .

about 150 million migrant workers sent more than $ 300bn -lrb- £ 147.3bn -rrb- home in 2006 , says the international fund for agricultural development -lrb- ifad -rrb- .
that compared with $ 104bn in aid from donor nations and direct foreign investment of $ 167bn .
asia led the remittance table , receiving $ 114bn , followed by latin america and the caribbean .
the report , compiled in collaboration with the inter-american development bank -lrb- idb -rrb- , based its findings on official data from governments , banks and money transfer operators .
poverty concerns hailed as the first study to quantify both formal and informal remittance channels , it also examined informal cash flows such as money carried home .
see where world remittances are paid ifad said about a third of the cash sent home by migrants went to rural areas , where poverty tends to be worse than in cities .
most remittances are used to buy basic necessities , such as food , clothes and medicine , the study found .
however , of the 10 % to 20 % that is saved , most is hidden away in the home - in cooking pots and under mattresses - rather than put to work in savings accounts .
ifad warned this " missed opportunity " meant that local communities failed to benefit from opportunities for economic development .
competition call " one of our priorities is to improve poor people 's options by finding ways to cut transaction costs and link remittances to other financial services , such as savings , investments and loans , " said ifad assistant president kevin cleaver .
while more companies are trying to get a slice of the business of sending remittances overseas , few banks are offering recipients the chance to make the most from their money , the report added .
with approximately 10 % of the world population receiving remittances , the idb has been encouraging microfinance institutions , credit unions and banks to provide lower-cost remittance services .
remittance destinations asia : more than $ 114bn latin america & the caribbean : $ 68bn eastern europe : $ 51bn africa : $ 39bn near east : $ 29bn source : ifad & idb report , figures for 2006 both the idb and ifad ague that by offering more detailed data on the practice , more " players " will be attracted to the market , thereby increasing competition and driving down costs .
latin america and the caribbean consumers have benefited from such developments in the remittance market , but mainly in major urban areas , the idb said .
elsewhere , new technology is helping to change the sector .
for example , mobile phone technology is increasingly used for money transfers to india and the philippines and is " growing exponentially " .
" for ifad , the most important thing is to look at how to channel this money so that it contributes to prosperity in rural areas , " added mr cleaver .
" it 's always been harder to expand financial services beyond cities , " said donald f terry , the report 's co-author and assistant general manager of idb 's multilateral investment fund .
he added the group was examining ways to improve poorer people 's access to such services and to cut their costs .

the move to digital broadcasting , which is roughly six times more efficient than analogue , means that a large amount of spectrum will be released for completely new services once digital switchover is complete in 2012 .
the battle for spectrum has become a kind of digital gold rush as mobile operators , broadcasters and broadband providers all put their cases for how the spectrum should be used .
these three lobby groups want different things from the spectrum : mobile firms could use it to add high quality video to existing services broadcasters want to keep the tv airwaves to roll out high definition -lrb- hd -rrb- channels internet providers are keen to see at least some of the spectrum used for wireless broadband services .
sought-after spectrum there 's spectrum in them there hills ..
regulator ofcom is in charge of deciding how the spectrum will be allocated and has made it clear that it favours a market-led approach which could see the spectrum sold off to the highest bidder .
historically governments have taken a more rigid approach to spectrum allocation , dictating what the uses would be .
see what is carried on our airwaves the spectrum in question would see up to 112 megahertz -lrb- mhz -rrb- of spectrum in the ultra high frequency band up for grabs , which equates to about 30 % of the traditional tv airwaves .
this spectrum is particularly sought-after because of its capacity and its range .
" if you think of it as spectrum real-estate then this is mayfair and park lane , " commented richard allen , head of government affairs for giant network firm cisco .
his feet are firmly in the wireless broadband camp when it comes to what use to put the spectrum to .
" it would provide an alternative to those areas that are poorly serviced by wired services .
the big advantage of broadband is that , unlike tv , it is a two-way service which means interactivity .
that seems to be the kind of model that society is moving towards , " he said .
pressure group ofcom thinks hdtv services could come from existing spectrum ultimately the decision about how to use the spectrum will be a political one , thinks ian fogg , an analyst with research firm jupiter .
" the real debate is whether this spectrum should be kept for tv or something else .
if it is sold to the highest bidder , which seems to be the direction ofcom is leaning towards , then it probably would n't go to the broadcasters , " he said .
the voice of the public broadcasters has been getting louder and in spring of this year the bbc , itv , channel 4 along with sony , samsung and dixons , joined forces to form a pressure group dubbed hdforall .
they want to see the freed-up spectrum ring-fenced for high definition tv on the freeview platform .
according to ofcom , more than one in four of the uk 's television sets are now connected to a freeview box .
" high definition is already a consumer reality , and it 's one that really adds value for audiences .
it 's a technological advance we think can and should be available as far as possible to all viewers , " said a bbc spokesperson .
" without some intervention to allocate additional spectrum it is very unlikely that sufficient hd channels could be launched to ensure that freeview keeps pace with changing consumer expectations , " she said .
viewers of satellite and cable services already have access to hdtv .
generation gap ofcom is looking at the possibility of using new broadcasting technology to free up extra capacity for both hd and standard definition tv services from existing tv spectrum .
it is due to publish its recommendations shortly and , if this is a viable option , would mean the rest of the spectrum would be available for other uses .
the bbc welcomed ofcom 's relook at how to allocate spectrum but remained concerned that " practical , legal and economic issues could ultimately prove insurmountable " in the option currently on the table .
" it could necessitate such significant sacrifices across either existing services or existing programme budgets that it is hard , in the interest of viewers , to justify pursuing the option , " read a bbc statement .
" we remain concerned that the once in a generation decision to auction off spectrum released by digital switchover to the highest bidder might well result in freeview being able to offer little in the way of hd for a generation , " the statement continued .
it is not the only criticism ofcom has faced .
lobbying from radio mic users saw it ring-fence a portion of the spectrum to ensure that live broadcasts and west end shows are unaffected by the sell-off .
it also plans to parcel up some spectrum for local tv services .
national resource the debate about how to use spectrum is also raging across europe where it is fast becoming a political hot potato .
in france , for example , there are indications that the government favours using its freed-up spectrum for hd tv the european commission will publish its proposals in mid-november and , like ofcom , it seems at the moment to be favouring service neutrality .
for mobile operators , new spectrum would be a chance to increase their coverage as well as add tv services to their portfolios .
but with mobile tv very much in its infancy , some think it unlikely that mobile operators will be at the front of the queue when it comes to handing out spectrum .
" it may be that they carry on servicing mobile tv via their 3g networks .
there is a question over whether they definitely need broadcast services , " said david mcqueen , an analyst at research firm informa .
t-mobile said it would be interested in the uhf channels for mobile multimedia services but also called on ofcom to work with europe to ensure a harmonised band is available in all countries .
ofcom has described the spectrum as a " finite national resource " and , as digital switchover spreads , it seems inevitable that the different lobbies will continue to lay claim to the limited airwaves .

the move to digital broadcasting , which is roughly six times more efficient than analogue , means that a large amount of spectrum will be released for completely new services once digital switchover is complete in 2012 .
the battle for spectrum has become a kind of digital gold rush as mobile operators , broadcasters and broadband providers all put their cases for how the spectrum should be used .
these three lobby groups want different things from the spectrum : mobile firms could use it to add high quality video to existing services broadcasters want to keep the tv airwaves to roll out high definition -lrb- hd -rrb- channels internet providers are keen to see at least some of the spectrum used for wireless broadband services .
sought-after spectrum there 's spectrum in them there hills ..
regulator ofcom is in charge of deciding how the spectrum will be allocated and has made it clear that it favours a market-led approach which could see the spectrum sold off to the highest bidder .
historically governments have taken a more rigid approach to spectrum allocation , dictating what the uses would be .
see what is carried on our airwaves the spectrum in question would see up to 112 megahertz -lrb- mhz -rrb- of spectrum in the ultra high frequency band up for grabs , which equates to about 30 % of the traditional tv airwaves .
this spectrum is particularly sought-after because of its capacity and its range .
" if you think of it as spectrum real-estate then this is mayfair and park lane , " commented richard allen , head of government affairs for giant network firm cisco .
his feet are firmly in the wireless broadband camp when it comes to what use to put the spectrum to .

the voice of the public broadcasters has been getting louder and in spring of this year the bbc , itv , channel 4 along with sony , samsung and dixons , joined forces to form a pressure group dubbed hdforall .
they want to see the freed-up spectrum ring-fenced for high definition tv on the freeview platform .

the move to digital broadcasting , which is roughly six times more efficient than analogue , means that a large amount of spectrum will be released for completely new services once digital switchover is complete in 2012 .
the battle for spectrum has become a kind of digital gold rush as mobile operators , broadcasters and broadband providers all put their cases for how the spectrum should be used .
these three lobby groups want different things from the spectrum : mobile firms could use it to add high quality video to existing services broadcasters want to keep the tv airwaves to roll out high definition -lrb- hd -rrb- channels internet providers are keen to see at least some of the spectrum used for wireless broadband services .
sought-after spectrum there 's spectrum in them there hills ..
regulator ofcom is in charge of deciding how the spectrum will be allocated and has made it clear that it favours a market-led approach which could see the spectrum sold off to the highest bidder .
historically governments have taken a more rigid approach to spectrum allocation , dictating what the uses would be .
see what is carried on our airwaves the spectrum in question would see up to 112 megahertz -lrb- mhz -rrb- of spectrum in the ultra high frequency band up for grabs , which equates to about 30 % of the traditional tv airwaves .
this spectrum is particularly sought-after because of its capacity and its range .
" if you think of it as spectrum real-estate then this is mayfair and park lane , " commented richard allen , head of government affairs for giant network firm cisco .
his feet are firmly in the wireless broadband camp when it comes to what use to put the spectrum to .
" it would provide an alternative to those areas that are poorly serviced by wired services .
the big advantage of broadband is that , unlike tv , it is a two-way service which means interactivity .
that seems to be the kind of model that society is moving towards , " he said .
pressure group ofcom thinks hdtv services could come from existing spectrum ultimately the decision about how to use the spectrum will be a political one , thinks ian fogg , an analyst with research firm jupiter .
" the real debate is whether this spectrum should be kept for tv or something else .
if it is sold to the highest bidder , which seems to be the direction ofcom is leaning towards , then it probably would n't go to the broadcasters , " he said .
the voice of the public broadcasters has been getting louder and in spring of this year the bbc , itv , channel 4 along with sony , samsung and dixons , joined forces to form a pressure group dubbed hdforall .
they want to see the freed-up spectrum ring-fenced for high definition tv on the freeview platform .
according to ofcom , more than one in four of the uk 's television sets are now connected to a freeview box .
" high definition is already a consumer reality , and it 's one that really adds value for audiences .
it 's a technological advance we think can and should be available as far as possible to all viewers , " said a bbc spokesperson .
" without some intervention to allocate additional spectrum it is very unlikely that sufficient hd channels could be launched to ensure that freeview keeps pace with changing consumer expectations , " she said .
viewers of satellite and cable services already have access to hdtv .
generation gap ofcom is looking at the possibility of using new broadcasting technology to free up extra capacity for both hd and standard definition tv services from existing tv spectrum .
it is due to publish its recommendations shortly and , if this is a viable option , would mean the rest of the spectrum would be available for other uses .
the bbc welcomed ofcom 's relook at how to allocate spectrum but remained concerned that " practical , legal and economic issues could ultimately prove insurmountable " in the option currently on the table .
" it could necessitate such significant sacrifices across either existing services or existing programme budgets that it is hard , in the interest of viewers , to justify pursuing the option , " read a bbc statement .
" we remain concerned that the once in a generation decision to auction off spectrum released by digital switchover to the highest bidder might well result in freeview being able to offer little in the way of hd for a generation , " the statement continued .
it is not the only criticism ofcom has faced .
lobbying from radio mic users saw it ring-fence a portion of the spectrum to ensure that live broadcasts and west end shows are unaffected by the sell-off .
it also plans to parcel up some spectrum for local tv services .
national resource the debate about how to use spectrum is also raging across europe where it is fast becoming a political hot potato .
in france , for example , there are indications that the government favours using its freed-up spectrum for hd tv the european commission will publish its proposals in mid-november and , like ofcom , it seems at the moment to be favouring service neutrality .
for mobile operators , new spectrum would be a chance to increase their coverage as well as add tv services to their portfolios .
but with mobile tv very much in its infancy , some think it unlikely that mobile operators will be at the front of the queue when it comes to handing out spectrum .
" it may be that they carry on servicing mobile tv via their 3g networks .
there is a question over whether they definitely need broadcast services , " said david mcqueen , an analyst at research firm informa .
t-mobile said it would be interested in the uhf channels for mobile multimedia services but also called on ofcom to work with europe to ensure a harmonised band is available in all countries .
ofcom has described the spectrum as a " finite national resource " and , as digital switchover spreads , it seems inevitable that the different lobbies will continue to lay claim to the limited airwaves .

these three lobby groups want different things from the spectrum : mobile firms could use it to add high quality video to existing services broadcasters want to keep the tv airwaves to roll out high definition -lrb- hd -rrb- channels internet providers are keen to see at least some of the spectrum used for wireless broadband services .
sought-after spectrum there 's spectrum in them there hills ..

see what is carried on our airwaves the spectrum in question would see up to 112 megahertz -lrb- mhz -rrb- of spectrum in the ultra high frequency band up for grabs , which equates to about 30 % of the traditional tv airwaves .
this spectrum is particularly sought-after because of its capacity and its range .
" if you think of it as spectrum real-estate then this is mayfair and park lane , " commented richard allen , head of government affairs for giant network firm cisco .
his feet are firmly in the wireless broadband camp when it comes to what use to put the spectrum to .

pressure group ofcom thinks hdtv services could come from existing spectrum ultimately the decision about how to use the spectrum will be a political one , thinks ian fogg , an analyst with research firm jupiter .
" the real debate is whether this spectrum should be kept for tv or something else .
if it is sold to the highest bidder , which seems to be the direction ofcom is leaning towards , then it probably would n't go to the broadcasters , " he said .
the voice of the public broadcasters has been getting louder and in spring of this year the bbc , itv , channel 4 along with sony , samsung and dixons , joined forces to form a pressure group dubbed hdforall .
they want to see the freed-up spectrum ring-fenced for high definition tv on the freeview platform .
according to ofcom , more than one in four of the uk 's television sets are now connected to a freeview box .
" high definition is already a consumer reality , and it 's one that really adds value for audiences .
it 's a technological advance we think can and should be available as far as possible to all viewers , " said a bbc spokesperson .
" without some intervention to allocate additional spectrum it is very unlikely that sufficient hd channels could be launched to ensure that freeview keeps pace with changing consumer expectations , " she said .
viewers of satellite and cable services already have access to hdtv .
generation gap ofcom is looking at the possibility of using new broadcasting technology to free up extra capacity for both hd and standard definition tv services from existing tv spectrum .
it is due to publish its recommendations shortly and , if this is a viable option , would mean the rest of the spectrum would be available for other uses .
the bbc welcomed ofcom 's relook at how to allocate spectrum but remained concerned that " practical , legal and economic issues could ultimately prove insurmountable " in the option currently on the table .
" it could necessitate such significant sacrifices across either existing services or existing programme budgets that it is hard , in the interest of viewers , to justify pursuing the option , " read a bbc statement .
" we remain concerned that the once in a generation decision to auction off spectrum released by digital switchover to the highest bidder might well result in freeview being able to offer little in the way of hd for a generation , " the statement continued .
it is not the only criticism ofcom has faced .
lobbying from radio mic users saw it ring-fence a portion of the spectrum to ensure that live broadcasts and west end shows are unaffected by the sell-off .
it also plans to parcel up some spectrum for local tv services .
national resource the debate about how to use spectrum is also raging across europe where it is fast becoming a political hot potato .
in france , for example , there are indications that the government favours using its freed-up spectrum for hd tv the european commission will publish its proposals in mid-november and , like ofcom , it seems at the moment to be favouring service neutrality .
for mobile operators , new spectrum would be a chance to increase their coverage as well as add tv services to their portfolios .
but with mobile tv very much in its infancy , some think it unlikely that mobile operators will be at the front of the queue when it comes to handing out spectrum .
" it may be that they carry on servicing mobile tv via their 3g networks .
there is a question over whether they definitely need broadcast services , " said david mcqueen , an analyst at research firm informa .
t-mobile said it would be interested in the uhf channels for mobile multimedia services but also called on ofcom to work with europe to ensure a harmonised band is available in all countries .
ofcom has described the spectrum as a " finite national resource " and , as digital switchover spreads , it seems inevitable that the different lobbies will continue to lay claim to the limited airwaves .

"
music industry lobby groups have long been among the most vocal advocates of copyright reform , urging governments worldwide to prioritise intellectual property protection .
led by the international federation of the phonographic industry and its sister national organisations , these groups frequently blame government inaction for recent sales declines , arguing that legal reforms are needed to support music industry innovation .
while the data suggests that peer-to-peer file sharing is at best only a minor reason for the decline -lrb- more significant is competition from dvd and video game sales and the emergence of big box retailers such as wal-mart who have pushed down retail prices and decimated sales of older titles -rrb- , events over the past month have provided the clearest indication yet that musicians and music sellers are charting a new course that is leaving the major record labels behind .
in the mid-1990s , the industry focused on retaining its core business model by relying on copy-control technologies , supported by additional legal measures , to curtail unauthorised copying .
ten years later , that strategy is now in tatters .
the use of copy-controls have proven to be an abject failure - not only do they do little to stem the tide of unauthorised copying , but they ultimately punish the industry 's best customers who face a barrage of interoperability problems , security threats , and limitations on their personal property . "
digital music sellers are now virtually unanimous in their rejection of these technologies " michael geist in response , digital music sellers are now virtually unanimous in their rejection of these technologies .
leading online music retailers such as apple , amazon , puretracks , emusic , and yahoo , have all rushed to assure consumers that a growing percentage of their offerings are free from copy-controls .
in fact , a yahoo executive recently brashly proclaimed that his company will not " invest any more money in consumer inconvenience . "
some music labels , including emi and universal , appear to have got the message as they have joined most independent labels in dropping copy-controls for some of their releases .
as the industry dithers with its failed strategy , musicians have begun to take matters into their own hands .
last year , the canadian music creators coalition , which includes some of canada 's most acclaimed musicians such as avril lavigne , sarah mclachlan , feist , sam roberts , billy talent , sloan , sum 41 , and barenaked ladies , spoke out openly against suing fans and the use of copy-controls .

last week , radiohead released its latest cd without copy-controls on its website under a pay-as-you like system -lrb- canada 's issa - formerly known as jane siberry - has successfully employed a similar approach for many years -rrb- .
the radiohead announcement has unleashed a stunning series of follow-up moves - reports indicate that nine inch nails , oasis , jamiroquai , the charlatans , and madonna have either left or are ready to leave their record labels in search of greater commercial success through live performances , merchandise sales , and other online innovation that may include free distribution of their music .
other artists are exploring new distribution partnerships - the eagles are selling their latest cd directly to wal-mart , prince distributed millions of copies of his latest cd for free in the uk in a newspaper promotion , former kinks lead singer ray davies plans to do the same , and nettwerk records , one of canada 's leading indie labels , combined with a newspaper to offer free downloads of some of its most popular artists .
the rapid pace of innovation highlights the fact that artists and consumers are responding to the new digital reality .
as the digital music market continues to grow , politicians and policy makers ought to remind lobby groups that it is the lack of innovation - not government intervention - that lies at the heart of their tales of woe . "
