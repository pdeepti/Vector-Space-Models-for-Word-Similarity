germany , who hit a record 11 goals in their first match against argentina , took control of the game in the opening minutes , cutting through japan 's defense and bombarding the goal with shots .
forward petra wimbersky should have scored in the third minute , latching onto a pass inside the area , but goalkeeper miho fukumoto just tipped the thundering shot over the bar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prinz grabbed a hat-trick in the 11-0 win over argentina kerstin garefrekes fired off a missile two minutes later that went high , and came close near half-time when her shot was blocked by a charging fukumoto , who was under pressure to keep her team in the match .
but it was prinz who did the damage , lurking on the edge of the penalty box to meet renate lingor 's corner which she rifled into the net on her second touch with 21 minutes gone . the goal propelled prinz , playing in her fourth world cup , into the history books by surpassing retired american player michelle akers as the most prolific world cup scorer with 13 goals .

the second goal came just three minutes from the end .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de design -pipe- 17.09.2007 german design guru discusses peace , purpose and pollution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rams : " design carries responsibility " as the head designer at german electronics and household appliance manufacturer braun from the early-1960s until 1995 , dieter rams was one of the most influential product designers in the 20th century . rams created a functionalist language based on ten principles of good design , which he summed up in the credo " less but better . "
many of the elegant , rigorous objects he created for braun were iconic ; their success helped cement germany 's reputation as a maker of sleek , well-crafted electronics and household goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers compare the braun et 44 calculator to the iphone even today , young designers continue to copy rams ' products and adhere to his design principles . industry watchers of late have enjoyed pointing out similarities between rams ' creations in the 1960s and 70s , and consumer electronics created by apple - another company that places a strong emphasis on product design . dw-world.de spoke with rams , now 75 , when he attended the 16th braun prize awards , a biennial contest honoring young design talent . dw-world.de : mr. rams , what do you think about all the claims that apple is using your designs as inspiration for some of its most popular products , like the ipod , iphone , or g5 ? dieter rams : i like to take it as a compliment ! many people consider your designs for braun the epitome of ‘ german design . '
is there still a german design language ? i have always said , there is no explicit german design .
german design always wanted to be international design .
starting with bauhaus , they called it international design .
the ulm school of design called their style international design .
in contrast to scandinavia , where they talked about scandinavian design , we did n't want our design to be connected with the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even pre-rams , braun had a modern look .
the sk-sk 2/1 radio , 1955 .
and especially at braun , from the beginning , -lsb- company founders -rsb- erwin and arthur braun did n't want a particularly " german " design .
we fought for it to be known as braun design .
it was supposed to be general . are you saying you consider yourself more european than german ? i 've never seen myself as really german .
i mean , germany is my homeland , ok .
but i 'm neither nationalistic nor any " istic " i 'm against all " isms . " we have to start thinking about how to work together - and not only in europe .
it 's hard , because each country wants to put its own interests in the foreground .
but we have to hold together worldwide .
otherwise i do n't see any other possibility for us to achieve a unified culture , not to mention a unified , peaceful world . but some people say it is important for german business to play up its design reputation , as a way of standing out in the international economy .
the country even funds federal and state design centers to promote the field … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lighter , designed by rams of course , it is important .
i was president of the german design council myself , for a long time .
and i always fought for political support for design in germany . … if you had this political background , then of course you could establish an identity - the way companies have a visual identity . countries are , in a sense , companies .
they compete against one another , they have rivalries .
sadly , we still can not manage to find a common denominator , or even to agree on which direction we should start moving in .
and i hope , very much , that it will be possible someday , through design . world peace through design ? design in terms of industrial design , and not where it is sort of heading now , as a lifestyle instrument .
good design has nothing to do with lifestyle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plexiglas covered hi-fis were a famous rams innovation i do n't want to criticize living well - i 'm glad to be doing well .
but " lifestyle " and " wellness " have nothing to do with our day-to-day culture .
our everyday culture should be taken more seriously .
and design has - or should have - the responsibility of taking our culture , responsibly , out into the wider world . the people who are in charge of doing this are product designers , together with the companies they work for , and - although that is the part i really think is missing - politicians .
especially if we see individual countries as businesses .
which , in effect , they are . how much is personal contentment related to the objects that surround us ? i 'm happy if i get a good night 's sleep , have positive thoughts , and stay healthy .
at my age you have to think about these things a bit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braun clock designed by dietrich lubs but of course , lots of things bother me , and i have overlooked a lot of them intentionally .
it 's funny , the psychological chaos and destruction in our world is widely recognized .
it is constantly discussed , mulled over , described , written about .
what never gets discussed or written about is the visual destruction of our environment . for example , do we need windmills littering the countryside , when we do n't even know if they could still be technically improved ?
they make a lot of noise .
or trash removal , with all the green , blue , yellow bags that litter the streets .
these things are visual pollution .
and we do n't deal with it . one of your famous design principles is that design should be concerned with the environment .
how so ? it may sound a bit banal , but i would love to see the day when the world is a more beautiful place , when we honor the nature around us .
but we are stomping on it .
we are ruining our host , mother earth .
and we are n't even aware we are doing it .
we 're leaving it to the next generation to take care of it .
and i think that 's the place we need to start … i do n't know if humanity will make it , ultimately .
i can only say that perhaps design - with the few nice things that are sometimes created - can offer a few rays of hope so that things can look better for this planet we are just visiting . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
many of the elegant , rigorous objects he created for braun were iconic ; their success helped cement germany 's reputation as a maker of sleek , well-crafted electronics and household goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers compare the braun et 44 calculator to the iphone even today , young designers continue to copy rams ' products and adhere to his design principles . industry watchers of late have enjoyed pointing out similarities between rams ' creations in the 1960s and 70s , and consumer electronics created by apple - another company that places a strong emphasis on product design . dw-world.de spoke with rams , now 75 , when he attended the 16th braun prize awards , a biennial contest honoring young design talent . dw-world.de : mr. rams , what do you think about all the claims that apple is using your designs as inspiration for some of its most popular products , like the ipod , iphone , or g5 ? dieter rams : i like to take it as a compliment ! many people consider your designs for braun the epitome of ‘ german design . '
is there still a german design language ? i have always said , there is no explicit german design .
german design always wanted to be international design .
starting with bauhaus , they called it international design .
the ulm school of design called their style international design .
in contrast to scandinavia , where they talked about scandinavian design , we did n't want our design to be connected with the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even pre-rams , braun had a modern look .
the sk-sk 2/1 radio , 1955 .
and especially at braun , from the beginning , -lsb- company founders -rsb- erwin and arthur braun did n't want a particularly " german " design .
we fought for it to be known as braun design .
it was supposed to be general . are you saying you consider yourself more european than german ? i 've never seen myself as really german .
i mean , germany is my homeland , ok .
but i 'm neither nationalistic nor any " istic " i 'm against all " isms . " we have to start thinking about how to work together - and not only in europe .
it 's hard , because each country wants to put its own interests in the foreground .
but we have to hold together worldwide .
otherwise i do n't see any other possibility for us to achieve a unified culture , not to mention a unified , peaceful world . but some people say it is important for german business to play up its design reputation , as a way of standing out in the international economy .
the country even funds federal and state design centers to promote the field … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lighter , designed by rams of course , it is important .
i was president of the german design council myself , for a long time .
and i always fought for political support for design in germany . … if you had this political background , then of course you could establish an identity - the way companies have a visual identity . countries are , in a sense , companies .
they compete against one another , they have rivalries .
sadly , we still can not manage to find a common denominator , or even to agree on which direction we should start moving in .
and i hope , very much , that it will be possible someday , through design . world peace through design ? design in terms of industrial design , and not where it is sort of heading now , as a lifestyle instrument .
good design has nothing to do with lifestyle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plexiglas covered hi-fis were a famous rams innovation i do n't want to criticize living well - i 'm glad to be doing well .
but " lifestyle " and " wellness " have nothing to do with our day-to-day culture .
our everyday culture should be taken more seriously .
and design has - or should have - the responsibility of taking our culture , responsibly , out into the wider world . the people who are in charge of doing this are product designers , together with the companies they work for , and - although that is the part i really think is missing - politicians .
especially if we see individual countries as businesses .
which , in effect , they are . how much is personal contentment related to the objects that surround us ? i 'm happy if i get a good night 's sleep , have positive thoughts , and stay healthy .
at my age you have to think about these things a bit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braun clock designed by dietrich lubs but of course , lots of things bother me , and i have overlooked a lot of them intentionally .
it 's funny , the psychological chaos and destruction in our world is widely recognized .
it is constantly discussed , mulled over , described , written about .
what never gets discussed or written about is the visual destruction of our environment . for example , do we need windmills littering the countryside , when we do n't even know if they could still be technically improved ?
they make a lot of noise .
or trash removal , with all the green , blue , yellow bags that litter the streets .
these things are visual pollution .
and we do n't deal with it . one of your famous design principles is that design should be concerned with the environment .
how so ? it may sound a bit banal , but i would love to see the day when the world is a more beautiful place , when we honor the nature around us .
but we are stomping on it .
we are ruining our host , mother earth .
and we are n't even aware we are doing it .
we 're leaving it to the next generation to take care of it .
and i think that 's the place we need to start … i do n't know if humanity will make it , ultimately .
i can only say that perhaps design - with the few nice things that are sometimes created - can offer a few rays of hope so that things can look better for this planet we are just visiting . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , and played a crucial role in the second as germany picked themselves up from the disappointing 0-0 draw against england on friday to make it into the last eight .
germany , who hit a record 11 goals in their first match against argentina , took control of the game in the opening minutes , cutting through japan 's defense and bombarding the goal with shots .
forward petra wimbersky should have scored in the third minute , latching onto a pass inside the area , but goalkeeper miho fukumoto just tipped the thundering shot over the bar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prinz grabbed a hat-trick in the 11-0 win over argentina kerstin garefrekes fired off a missile two minutes later that went high , and came close near half-time when her shot was blocked by a charging fukumoto , who was under pressure to keep her team in the match .
but it was prinz who did the damage , lurking on the edge of the penalty box to meet renate lingor 's corner which she rifled into the net on her second touch with 21 minutes gone . the goal propelled prinz , playing in her fourth world cup , into the history books by surpassing retired american player michelle akers as the most prolific world cup scorer with 13 goals .
german coach silvia neid brought on 19-year-old sensation fatmire bajramaj to add penetration in the second half , but the germans could not break down japan 's increasingly dogged defense .
the second goal came just three minutes from the end .
a flowing move from germany ended in a foul on martina müller in the penalty box and lingor secured victory by coolly converting the resulting penalty .

" we played well against a strong opponent and we created a lot of chances .
nevertheless , in the quarter-final , we have to add a little bit to our performance , because we will face a very tough opponent . "
germany ended the cup 's first stage on top of group a with seven points and will play the runner-up in group b , likely to be north korea , on saturday .
england add more misery to argentina germany were joined in the last eight by england , who thumped south american champions argentina 6-1 .
kelly smith scored twice in the rout which signaled the end of a nightmare tournament for argentina , who conceded 18 goals in total and scored just one .
star striker smith pounced in the 64th and the 77th minute to bring her world cup tally to four goals in three games and ensure england made the last eight for the first time since 1995 .
the game got off to the worst possible start for argentina when captain eva gonzalez scored an own goal in the ninth minute .
then jill scott pounced barely 60 seconds later with a long-range effort to put england a well-deserved 2-0 up at half time .
the south americans then gave away two penalties and had catalina perez sent off - the first red card of the championships - leaving them in all sorts of trouble .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 17.09.2007 political wrangling at heart of german terror debate , critics say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung said he would give the order to shoot down a passenger plane if necessary the german defense minister 's comments about shooting down hijacked planes set off a burst of political squabbling .
but the debate raises important issues , even if it 's motivated by political maneuvering , observers say . politicians of all stripes have taken the opportunity to comment on german defense minster franz josef jung 's statement to focus magazine on sunday , sept .
16 , that he would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane , though such an order has been ruled illegal by germany 's highest court . leaders from the opposition greens have called for his dismissal or at least for public chastisement while his colleagues in christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have tended to back him up by calling for a re-examination of constitutional questions in the face of a modern terrorist threat . also on sunday , interior minister wolfgang schäuble said the risk of a terror attack remains high in germany , and that the country is " in the sights of islamist terrorism . " berlin senator urges end to ' ghost debate ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military jets forced a small plane circiling downtown frankfurt to land safely in 2003 schäuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung that experts were convinced extremists would one day attack with nuclear weapons . " many experts are convinced that it is a question of when , not if , " he said . his comments came in the wake of events of the past weeks , after security officials arrested three men who apparently were planning terror attacks on the us ramstein air base and other targets .
the suspects were not found to be in possession of any radioactive material . schäuble has recently called for added power to be given to police in the fight against terrorism , including the right for authorities to conduct covert online searches of terror suspects ' computers . despite this month 's terror arrests , berlin interior senator erhart körting called the cacophony of remarks for stricter antiterrorism measures , particularly shooting down hijacked planes , to be a " ghost debate . " the german constitutional court 's decision in 2006 outlawing such an action made jung 's point moot , he said . " we should concentrate on what is possible under our constitution , " he said in an interview with the dpa news agency . real issue more politics than security ? guido steinberg , a senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs , agreed that the media discussion involved more political jockeying ahead of elections in 2009 than any real changes to german security policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble reminded germans of the terror threat posed to the country " the debate has more to do with the coalition than with the topic itself , " he said .
" i think the -lsb- cdu politicians -rsb- are trying to push the spd to get into position for the next election . they are provoking them . " the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and cdu have been partners in a " grand coalition " since 2005 , when angela merkel took germany 's helm as the head of the cdu .
both jung and schäuble are cdu members . that the spd and greens were initially responsible for the law they 've recently come out against " makes their response right now all the more interesting , " steinberg said .
germany enacted the now-repealed law under former chancellor gerhard schröder after the sept .
11 , 2001 terror attacks in the united states . " no pilot would shoot down a plane " despite jung 's comments , a defense minister no longer has the right to decide whether to shoot down a hijacked aircraft , steinberg said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers agreed that pilots would not follow an order to shoot down a passenger plane " since the law was deemed unconstitutional , the pilot knows shooting down such a plane would be illegal - even if he were following orders , " steinberg said .
" so now he would be assuming legal responsibility himself .
no pilot would do this . " that 's the reason the head of the german federal armed forces association , bernhard gertz , warned pilots against pulling the trigger . " i advise -lsb- pilots -rsb- not to carry out an order to shoot , no matter who gives it , " he said in an interview with the tagesspeigel newspaper . a question of ideology if the minister ca n't give the order and no pilot would follow it , why raise the issue at all ?
according to steinberg , the parties have a long-term ideological motive .
the christian conservatives would like to see the armed forces become involved in fighting terrorism within the country - a stance the spd opposes and is currently not permitted by the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a construction flaw kept bombs from exploding on two german trains in august 2006 " this debate over how to fight terrorism has been going on , in earnest , since last winter or last spring , " steinberg said .
" it is ideological .
the spd believes in political approaches , the conservatives want the military to play a role . " germans not convinced of terror threat although there is no indication that terrorists are planning major attacks , steinberg said he thinks germans are not completely aware of the danger terrorists pose , and added that while schäuble 's warning of an eventual nuclear attack overdramatized the situation , it was not necessarily far off the mark . only luck has prevented a terrorist attack in germany and the possibility of a terror group trying to set off a radiation-carrying " dirty bomb " sometime in the future is not at all unlikely , he said . but future terrorist activity " is likely to be less sophisticated , " steinberg said .

not futuristic stuff . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.09.2007 microsoft loses eu antitrust appeal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court ruled that microsoft is not giving customers a choice europe 's second-highest court dismissed microsoft 's appeal against a 2004 eu antitrust decision in a landmark victory for the european antitrust regulator .
the us company said it 's still considering its next move . the 13 judges of the court of first instance , led by bo vesterdorf - on his last day on the job - upheld a european commission order from 2004 and a resulting fine of 497 million euros -lrb- $ 688.84 million -rrb- for the software giant . the court said monday , sept .
17 , that the commission was correct in concluding that microsoft was guilty of monopoly abuse and took advantage of its dominance in the desktop computer market to bundle other products with the ubiquitous windows operating system . " the court observes that it is beyond dispute that in consequence of the tying , consumers are unable to acquire the windows operating system without simultaneously acquiring windows media player , " the court said . " in that regard , the court considers that neither the fact that microsoft does not charge a separate price for windows media player nor the fact that consumers are not obliged to use that media player is relevant . " an ongoing saga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft founder and chairman bill gates is not going to be happy about the court 's decision microsoft is likely to lodge an appeal with the europe 's highest tribunal , the european court of justice , and prolong the saga for at least another year .
immediately after the court 's decision was announced , however , microsoft 's general counsel refused to speculate on this issue . " i do n't want to talk about what will come next , " said brad smith in answer to questions about the possibility of an appeal .
" we need to read the ruling before we make any decision . " the eu commission ruled in 2004 - after a five-year probe - that microsoft was abusing its 95-percent share of the computer operating system market . the commission ordered the us-based multinational corporation to sell a version of their flagship windows operating system without a media player and to share technical information with competitors so that they could more easily create windows-compatible programs . calling the ruling an " important precedent , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said she wanted to see microsoft quickly changes its business practices and " comply fully " with the court 's judgment . " the commission will do its utmost to ensure that microsoft complies swiftly ...
i will not tolerate continued noncompliance , " she said . eu scores an important victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling may have global implications on the it industry in its appeal , microsoft argued that it provided interoperability information that met current industry standards and that the commission was asking from it to divulge valuable trade secrets and copyrighted patents . the court 's unequivocal ruling against microsoft , however , may have important implications for the future operation of the global it industry . it is also an important validation for the european antitrust regulator , which prosecutes an increasing number of cases every year . european commission president jose manuel barroso said the ruling " confirms the objectivity and the credibility " of the eu 's approach to competition . in 2006 , the eu competition commission cached in a record amount of 1.85 billion euros in antitrust fines .
according to eu officials , the commission levied the same amount of fines against cartels in the first half of 2007 alone . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de design -pipe- 17.09.2007 german design guru discusses peace , purpose and pollution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rams : " design carries responsibility " as the head designer at german electronics and household appliance manufacturer braun from the early-1960s until 1995 , dieter rams was one of the most influential product designers in the 20th century . rams created a functionalist language based on ten principles of good design , which he summed up in the credo " less but better . "
many of the elegant , rigorous objects he created for braun were iconic ; their success helped cement germany 's reputation as a maker of sleek , well-crafted electronics and household goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers compare the braun et 44 calculator to the iphone even today , young designers continue to copy rams ' products and adhere to his design principles . industry watchers of late have enjoyed pointing out similarities between rams ' creations in the 1960s and 70s , and consumer electronics created by apple - another company that places a strong emphasis on product design . dw-world.de spoke with rams , now 75 , when he attended the 16th braun prize awards , a biennial contest honoring young design talent . dw-world.de : mr. rams , what do you think about all the claims that apple is using your designs as inspiration for some of its most popular products , like the ipod , iphone , or g5 ? dieter rams : i like to take it as a compliment ! many people consider your designs for braun the epitome of ‘ german design . '
is there still a german design language ? i have always said , there is no explicit german design .
german design always wanted to be international design .
starting with bauhaus , they called it international design .
the ulm school of design called their style international design .
in contrast to scandinavia , where they talked about scandinavian design , we did n't want our design to be connected with the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even pre-rams , braun had a modern look .
the sk-sk 2/1 radio , 1955 .
and especially at braun , from the beginning , -lsb- company founders -rsb- erwin and arthur braun did n't want a particularly " german " design .
we fought for it to be known as braun design .
it was supposed to be general . are you saying you consider yourself more european than german ? i 've never seen myself as really german .
i mean , germany is my homeland , ok .
but i 'm neither nationalistic nor any " istic " i 'm against all " isms . " we have to start thinking about how to work together - and not only in europe .
it 's hard , because each country wants to put its own interests in the foreground .
but we have to hold together worldwide .
otherwise i do n't see any other possibility for us to achieve a unified culture , not to mention a unified , peaceful world . but some people say it is important for german business to play up its design reputation , as a way of standing out in the international economy .
the country even funds federal and state design centers to promote the field … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lighter , designed by rams of course , it is important .
i was president of the german design council myself , for a long time .
and i always fought for political support for design in germany . … if you had this political background , then of course you could establish an identity - the way companies have a visual identity . countries are , in a sense , companies .
they compete against one another , they have rivalries .
sadly , we still can not manage to find a common denominator , or even to agree on which direction we should start moving in .
and i hope , very much , that it will be possible someday , through design . world peace through design ? design in terms of industrial design , and not where it is sort of heading now , as a lifestyle instrument .
good design has nothing to do with lifestyle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plexiglas covered hi-fis were a famous rams innovation i do n't want to criticize living well - i 'm glad to be doing well .
but " lifestyle " and " wellness " have nothing to do with our day-to-day culture .
our everyday culture should be taken more seriously .
and design has - or should have - the responsibility of taking our culture , responsibly , out into the wider world . the people who are in charge of doing this are product designers , together with the companies they work for , and - although that is the part i really think is missing - politicians .
especially if we see individual countries as businesses .
which , in effect , they are . how much is personal contentment related to the objects that surround us ? i 'm happy if i get a good night 's sleep , have positive thoughts , and stay healthy .
at my age you have to think about these things a bit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braun clock designed by dietrich lubs but of course , lots of things bother me , and i have overlooked a lot of them intentionally .
it 's funny , the psychological chaos and destruction in our world is widely recognized .
it is constantly discussed , mulled over , described , written about .
what never gets discussed or written about is the visual destruction of our environment . for example , do we need windmills littering the countryside , when we do n't even know if they could still be technically improved ?
they make a lot of noise .
or trash removal , with all the green , blue , yellow bags that litter the streets .
these things are visual pollution .
and we do n't deal with it . one of your famous design principles is that design should be concerned with the environment .
how so ? it may sound a bit banal , but i would love to see the day when the world is a more beautiful place , when we honor the nature around us .
but we are stomping on it .
we are ruining our host , mother earth .
and we are n't even aware we are doing it .
we 're leaving it to the next generation to take care of it .
and i think that 's the place we need to start … i do n't know if humanity will make it , ultimately .
i can only say that perhaps design - with the few nice things that are sometimes created - can offer a few rays of hope so that things can look better for this planet we are just visiting . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
many of the elegant , rigorous objects he created for braun were iconic ; their success helped cement germany 's reputation as a maker of sleek , well-crafted electronics and household goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers compare the braun et 44 calculator to the iphone even today , young designers continue to copy rams ' products and adhere to his design principles . industry watchers of late have enjoyed pointing out similarities between rams ' creations in the 1960s and 70s , and consumer electronics created by apple - another company that places a strong emphasis on product design . dw-world.de spoke with rams , now 75 , when he attended the 16th braun prize awards , a biennial contest honoring young design talent . dw-world.de : mr. rams , what do you think about all the claims that apple is using your designs as inspiration for some of its most popular products , like the ipod , iphone , or g5 ? dieter rams : i like to take it as a compliment ! many people consider your designs for braun the epitome of ‘ german design . '
is there still a german design language ? i have always said , there is no explicit german design .
german design always wanted to be international design .
starting with bauhaus , they called it international design .
the ulm school of design called their style international design .
in contrast to scandinavia , where they talked about scandinavian design , we did n't want our design to be connected with the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even pre-rams , braun had a modern look .
the sk-sk 2/1 radio , 1955 .
and especially at braun , from the beginning , -lsb- company founders -rsb- erwin and arthur braun did n't want a particularly " german " design .
we fought for it to be known as braun design .
it was supposed to be general . are you saying you consider yourself more european than german ? i 've never seen myself as really german .
i mean , germany is my homeland , ok .
but i 'm neither nationalistic nor any " istic " i 'm against all " isms . " we have to start thinking about how to work together - and not only in europe .
it 's hard , because each country wants to put its own interests in the foreground .
but we have to hold together worldwide .
otherwise i do n't see any other possibility for us to achieve a unified culture , not to mention a unified , peaceful world . but some people say it is important for german business to play up its design reputation , as a way of standing out in the international economy .
the country even funds federal and state design centers to promote the field … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lighter , designed by rams of course , it is important .
i was president of the german design council myself , for a long time .
and i always fought for political support for design in germany . … if you had this political background , then of course you could establish an identity - the way companies have a visual identity . countries are , in a sense , companies .
they compete against one another , they have rivalries .
sadly , we still can not manage to find a common denominator , or even to agree on which direction we should start moving in .
and i hope , very much , that it will be possible someday , through design . world peace through design ? design in terms of industrial design , and not where it is sort of heading now , as a lifestyle instrument .
good design has nothing to do with lifestyle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plexiglas covered hi-fis were a famous rams innovation i do n't want to criticize living well - i 'm glad to be doing well .
but " lifestyle " and " wellness " have nothing to do with our day-to-day culture .
our everyday culture should be taken more seriously .
and design has - or should have - the responsibility of taking our culture , responsibly , out into the wider world . the people who are in charge of doing this are product designers , together with the companies they work for , and - although that is the part i really think is missing - politicians .
especially if we see individual countries as businesses .
which , in effect , they are . how much is personal contentment related to the objects that surround us ? i 'm happy if i get a good night 's sleep , have positive thoughts , and stay healthy .
at my age you have to think about these things a bit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braun clock designed by dietrich lubs but of course , lots of things bother me , and i have overlooked a lot of them intentionally .
it 's funny , the psychological chaos and destruction in our world is widely recognized .
it is constantly discussed , mulled over , described , written about .
what never gets discussed or written about is the visual destruction of our environment . for example , do we need windmills littering the countryside , when we do n't even know if they could still be technically improved ?
they make a lot of noise .
or trash removal , with all the green , blue , yellow bags that litter the streets .
these things are visual pollution .
and we do n't deal with it . one of your famous design principles is that design should be concerned with the environment .
how so ? it may sound a bit banal , but i would love to see the day when the world is a more beautiful place , when we honor the nature around us .
but we are stomping on it .
we are ruining our host , mother earth .
and we are n't even aware we are doing it .
we 're leaving it to the next generation to take care of it .
and i think that 's the place we need to start … i do n't know if humanity will make it , ultimately .
i can only say that perhaps design - with the few nice things that are sometimes created - can offer a few rays of hope so that things can look better for this planet we are just visiting . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german defense minister franz josef jung said he would give the order to shoot down a plane that has been hijacked for an attack , despite a ruling by the country 's constitutional court banning such action .

it ruled that the law was an infringement on the right to life and the right to human dignity .
" but if there is a common danger or the democratic order is in danger , other rules apply , " jung said .
" i would like a clarification of the constitutional law , but there is still no consensus in the coalition -lrb- government -rrb- on this point .
therefore , in an emergency , i need to have recourse to a method that goes above the law . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 17.09.2007 funding rift expected as eu ministers tackle border security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers will discuss ways to prevent illegal immigrants entering the bloc the urgent need to reinforce border controls to prevent thousands of illegal immigrants from entering the european union will be at the top of the agenda when eu justice and interior ministers meet in brussels . the ministers are expected to agree tuesday , sept .
18 , on measures to strengthen border controls in a bid to reduce the number of illegal entries to the bloc each year , but the question of funding will be paramount to any decisions taken . according to a draft document by the portuguese presidency , the justice and home affairs -lrb- jha -rrb- council will " encourage " governments to " cooperate , " " share responsibilities " and provide " support " to fellow member states , such as malta , that are struggling to prevent the seemingly unstoppable tide of would-be immigrants who depart from ports in north africa and enter the eu after crossing the mediterranean sea . however , frontex , the recently-established eu agency tasked with coordinating member states ' border security , is unlikely to get any additional money to carry out its work . eu governments believe that the responsibility for the control of external borders lies with individual member states and have accordingly granted a budget of just 40 million euros -lrb- $ 55 million -rrb- to the warsaw-based agency . equipment received less than equipment pledged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontex could have even less funding in the future some of the eu 's 27 member states , including germany and italy , have pledged to provide equipment to frontex .
but many of the total of 21 airplanes , 27 helicopters and more than 100 boats pledged to frontex are assumed to not yet be at the agency 's disposal . the eu 's justice and interior ministers consider the reinforcing of the bloc 's southern maritime borders as a high priority because of the numerous reports over the summer months about would-be immigrants drowning during their ill-fated voyages across the mediterranean sea . experts say most of the illegal aliens who penetrate so-called " fortress europe " - possibly as many as 500,000 per year , according to the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- - are believed to do so through the bloc 's sketchily patrolled eastern land border or by simply catching a plane and entering the eu on a temporary tourist visa . schengen agreement topics also on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schengen is aimed at easing border controls within europe along with efforts to increase border controls in the fight against illegal immigrants , the day-long meeting will also involve discussions on the schengen agreement allowing the abolition of systematic border controls between participating countries , the state of play of shared data among participating countries - the so-called schengen information system - and on the exchange of people 's fingerprints and biometric data .
a total of 15 countries have so far implemented schengen - including non-eu states iceland , norway and switzerland .
nine new eu member states - the czech republic , estonia , latvia , lithuania , hungary , malta , poland , slovenia and slovakia - have started using the schengen information system as of sept .
1 , and the portuguese presidency hopes that ministers meeting in brussels will agree to abolish passport controls at airports for passengers traveling to and from these nine countries as of march 2008 .
unrelated thorny issues expected to feature issues that are not on tuesday 's official agenda , but which threaten to hijack it , include polish opposition to a european day against the death penalty , which has been scheduled for oct .
10 and which warsaw would like to widen to include abortion and euthanasia . the mandate and profile of a new eu anti-terrorism coordinator is also likely to be a hot topic at the meeting .
the coordinator post was created in 2004 , in response to that year 's train bombings in madrid , but has been left vacant since march , when gijs de vries of the netherlands resigned citing personal reasons . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but many of the total of 21 airplanes , 27 helicopters and more than 100 boats pledged to frontex are assumed to not yet be at the agency 's disposal . the eu 's justice and interior ministers consider the reinforcing of the bloc 's southern maritime borders as a high priority because of the numerous reports over the summer months about would-be immigrants drowning during their ill-fated voyages across the mediterranean sea . experts say most of the illegal aliens who penetrate so-called " fortress europe " - possibly as many as 500,000 per year , according to the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- - are believed to do so through the bloc 's sketchily patrolled eastern land border or by simply catching a plane and entering the eu on a temporary tourist visa . schengen agreement topics also on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schengen is aimed at easing border controls within europe along with efforts to increase border controls in the fight against illegal immigrants , the day-long meeting will also involve discussions on the schengen agreement allowing the abolition of systematic border controls between participating countries , the state of play of shared data among participating countries - the so-called schengen information system - and on the exchange of people 's fingerprints and biometric data .
a total of 15 countries have so far implemented schengen - including non-eu states iceland , norway and switzerland .
nine new eu member states - the czech republic , estonia , latvia , lithuania , hungary , malta , poland , slovenia and slovakia - have started using the schengen information system as of sept .
1 , and the portuguese presidency hopes that ministers meeting in brussels will agree to abolish passport controls at airports for passengers traveling to and from these nine countries as of march 2008 .
unrelated thorny issues expected to feature issues that are not on tuesday 's official agenda , but which threaten to hijack it , include polish opposition to a european day against the death penalty , which has been scheduled for oct .
10 and which warsaw would like to widen to include abortion and euthanasia . the mandate and profile of a new eu anti-terrorism coordinator is also likely to be a hot topic at the meeting .
the coordinator post was created in 2004 , in response to that year 's train bombings in madrid , but has been left vacant since march , when gijs de vries of the netherlands resigned citing personal reasons . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , and played a crucial role in the second as germany picked themselves up from the disappointing 0-0 draw against england on friday to make it into the last eight .
germany , who hit a record 11 goals in their first match against argentina , took control of the game in the opening minutes , cutting through japan 's defense and bombarding the goal with shots .
forward petra wimbersky should have scored in the third minute , latching onto a pass inside the area , but goalkeeper miho fukumoto just tipped the thundering shot over the bar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prinz grabbed a hat-trick in the 11-0 win over argentina kerstin garefrekes fired off a missile two minutes later that went high , and came close near half-time when her shot was blocked by a charging fukumoto , who was under pressure to keep her team in the match .
but it was prinz who did the damage , lurking on the edge of the penalty box to meet renate lingor 's corner which she rifled into the net on her second touch with 21 minutes gone . the goal propelled prinz , playing in her fourth world cup , into the history books by surpassing retired american player michelle akers as the most prolific world cup scorer with 13 goals .
german coach silvia neid brought on 19-year-old sensation fatmire bajramaj to add penetration in the second half , but the germans could not break down japan 's increasingly dogged defense .
the second goal came just three minutes from the end .
a flowing move from germany ended in a foul on martina müller in the penalty box and lingor secured victory by coolly converting the resulting penalty .
victorious germany looking for another level neid was full of praise for her players after the match . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's players march on into the last eight " i 'm very happy with the performance of our team , we reached the quarter finals and that 's what we were aiming for , " she told reporters .
" we played well against a strong opponent and we created a lot of chances .
nevertheless , in the quarter-final , we have to add a little bit to our performance , because we will face a very tough opponent . "
germany ended the cup 's first stage on top of group a with seven points and will play the runner-up in group b , likely to be north korea , on saturday .
england add more misery to argentina germany were joined in the last eight by england , who thumped south american champions argentina 6-1 .
kelly smith scored twice in the rout which signaled the end of a nightmare tournament for argentina , who conceded 18 goals in total and scored just one .
star striker smith pounced in the 64th and the 77th minute to bring her world cup tally to four goals in three games and ensure england made the last eight for the first time since 1995 .
the game got off to the worst possible start for argentina when captain eva gonzalez scored an own goal in the ninth minute .
then jill scott pounced barely 60 seconds later with a long-range effort to put england a well-deserved 2-0 up at half time .
the south americans then gave away two penalties and had catalina perez sent off - the first red card of the championships - leaving them in all sorts of trouble .
fara williams converted the first penalty kick in the 50th minute , smith scored her brace and then substitute vicky exley added another from the spot on 90 minutes .
" the girls were magnificent and we are really pleased , " said england coach hope powell .
" it was our target to get out of the group .
we have achieved that .
we now move on to the next stage . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
asked what the worst was , he replied , " it is war . "
kouchner said there was " no greater crisis today " than that over tehran 's developing nuclear program . " we will not accept that this -lrb- nuclear -rrb- bomb will be built , " he declared . " we must negotiate right to the end " with iran , kouchner added , but underlined that if tehran possessed an atomic weapon , it would represent " a real danger for the whole world . " room for negotiation remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner warned the world must be prepared for war in a bid to play down the controversy , french prime minister francois fillon said monday , sept .
17 , that tensions with iran were " extreme " but insisted there was still room for diplomacy in the nuclear stand-off . " everything must be done to avoid war , " fillon told reporters .
" the iranians must understand that tension has reached an extreme point . " while saying that kouchner was right to call the situation with iran dangerous , fillon added that a confrontation was " the last option that any political leader would want . " the french foreign minister called on the european union to impose economic sanctions on tehran outside of those imposed by the united nations . " these would be european sanctions that each country , individually , must put in place with its own banking , commercial and industrial system , " kouchner said .
france takes a hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fillon said tensions with iran were now " extreme " the french foreign minister 's statement follows what appears to be a new hard line from france on dealing with iran . as part of the eu troika along with germany and britain , france led europe 's diplomatic efforts to convince iran to stop its uranium enrichment program , which some believe is being used in the development of nuclear weapons .
while the troika suffered a number of setbacks at the negotiating table , it was seen as the main diplomatic front in averting conflict with iran .
however , since president nicolas sarkozy 's election victory in may , france has been keen to flex its muscles .
sarkozy himself warned in an aug .
27 speech that the iranian nuclear crisis presented the world with " a catastrophic alternative : an iranian bomb or the bombing of iran . " iran : west always chooses confrontation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aghazadeh condemned france 's behavior iran responded with outrage to kouchner 's statement . " it seems that the french foreign minister has forgotten the policy of the european union , " foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini said in a statement .
" the use of such words creates tensions and is contrary to the cultural history and civilization of france . " iranian vice-president reza aghazadeh , who is also the head of iran 's atomic energy organization , told the un 's international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- that western countries " have always chosen the path of confrontation instead of the path of understanding and cordial relations . " " the great nation of iran has recorded your discriminatory behavior and performance in its memory and will not forget , " he added . germany will continue to support france france 's european partners appeared divided over the french statement .
germany said monday that it would continue to work closely with france and its other allies to avert the threat of a nuclear-armed iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european governments want to prevent iran from building nuclear weapons the french government was correct in its assessment that " there are all the elements of a very serious obligation on the international community and that we must do everything possible to ensure that iran does not become nuclear armed , " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in berlin .
german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger added that he did not regard kouchner 's statements as a " threat of war . " germany and france were currently cooperating on a third resolution to be placed before the un security council on applying additional sanctions to iran to compel it to halt its nuclear weapons program , he said .
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said that the netherlands would support eu sanctions if the un security council failed to agree on new measures but would not be drawn on any talk of military intervention .
" the first effort should be to convince the security council to apply more sanctions , " verhagen said .
" but when the security council does n't agree , i am willing to apply european union sanctions in combination with the united states sanctions . "
iaea chief warns of iraq lessons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's elbaradei spoke of the tragedy of iraq iaea director general mohamed elbaradei urged countries to refrain from talking about an escalation of the iran nuclear crisis . " we need always to remember that use of force could only be resorted to when ... every other option has been exhausted .
i do n't think we are at all there , " elbaradei told reporters in vienna .
" there is no clear and present danger from iran .
" there are rules on how to use force , and i would hope that everybody would have gotten the lesson after the iraq situation , where 70,000 innocent civilians have lost their lives on the suspicion that a country has nuclear weapons , " he concluded . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

our everyday culture should be taken more seriously .

"
many of the elegant , rigorous objects he created for braun were iconic ; their success helped cement germany 's reputation as a maker of sleek , well-crafted electronics and household goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers compare the braun et 44 calculator to the iphone even today , young designers continue to copy rams ' products and adhere to his design principles . industry watchers of late have enjoyed pointing out similarities between rams ' creations in the 1960s and 70s , and consumer electronics created by apple - another company that places a strong emphasis on product design . dw-world.de spoke with rams , now 75 , when he attended the 16th braun prize awards , a biennial contest honoring young design talent . dw-world.de : mr. rams , what do you think about all the claims that apple is using your designs as inspiration for some of its most popular products , like the ipod , iphone , or g5 ? dieter rams : i like to take it as a compliment ! many people consider your designs for braun the epitome of ‘ german design . '
is there still a german design language ? i have always said , there is no explicit german design .
german design always wanted to be international design .
starting with bauhaus , they called it international design .
the ulm school of design called their style international design .
in contrast to scandinavia , where they talked about scandinavian design , we did n't want our design to be connected with the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even pre-rams , braun had a modern look .
the sk-sk 2/1 radio , 1955 .
and especially at braun , from the beginning , -lsb- company founders -rsb- erwin and arthur braun did n't want a particularly " german " design .
we fought for it to be known as braun design .
it was supposed to be general . are you saying you consider yourself more european than german ? i 've never seen myself as really german .
i mean , germany is my homeland , ok .
but i 'm neither nationalistic nor any " istic " i 'm against all " isms . " we have to start thinking about how to work together - and not only in europe .
it 's hard , because each country wants to put its own interests in the foreground .
but we have to hold together worldwide .
otherwise i do n't see any other possibility for us to achieve a unified culture , not to mention a unified , peaceful world . but some people say it is important for german business to play up its design reputation , as a way of standing out in the international economy .
the country even funds federal and state design centers to promote the field … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lighter , designed by rams of course , it is important .
i was president of the german design council myself , for a long time .
and i always fought for political support for design in germany . … if you had this political background , then of course you could establish an identity - the way companies have a visual identity . countries are , in a sense , companies .
they compete against one another , they have rivalries .
sadly , we still can not manage to find a common denominator , or even to agree on which direction we should start moving in .
and i hope , very much , that it will be possible someday , through design . world peace through design ? design in terms of industrial design , and not where it is sort of heading now , as a lifestyle instrument .

" but , instead , the party base decided that its representatives in the german parliament must vote against continued use of the army in afghanistan if fighting was involved . while the decision can not actually affect germany 's current foreign policy - since chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government does not need opposition votes for a renewal of the troop 's mandate next month - it is indicative of the deep split which has developed within the greens . traditionally pacifist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leader joschka fischer was germany 's foreign minister under gerhard schröder the traditionally pacifist greens made a u-turn when it comes to german military operations abroad during their time in a coalition with social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder from 1998 to 2005 . the decision to support german peacekeeping operations abroad has divided the party ever since . " i still believe this was the right thing to do and we will stand by our responsibility , " bütikofer said of the deployment at the congress , amid heckling and booing by delegates . a turning point for the greens rejecting the expected renewal of the troops ' mandate in afghanistan , the rank-and-file members of the green party effectively reversed the controversial changes in foreign policy that were ushered in by schröder 's foreign minister and former green party leader joschka fischer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's military presence in afghanistan has divided the green party " the result of the party congress marks the temporary end of a 10-year-long struggle over the pragmatist foreign policy course a la joschka fischer , " said political scientist hubert kleinert in an op-ed for the web site of the german weekly spiegel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.09.2007 microsoft loses eu antitrust appeal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court ruled that microsoft is not giving customers a choice europe 's second-highest court dismissed microsoft 's appeal against a 2004 eu antitrust decision in a landmark victory for the european antitrust regulator .
the us company said it 's still considering its next move . the 13 judges of the court of first instance , led by bo vesterdorf - on his last day on the job - upheld a european commission order from 2004 and a resulting fine of 497 million euros -lrb- $ 688.84 million -rrb- for the software giant . the court said monday , sept .
17 , that the commission was correct in concluding that microsoft was guilty of monopoly abuse and took advantage of its dominance in the desktop computer market to bundle other products with the ubiquitous windows operating system . " the court observes that it is beyond dispute that in consequence of the tying , consumers are unable to acquire the windows operating system without simultaneously acquiring windows media player , " the court said . " in that regard , the court considers that neither the fact that microsoft does not charge a separate price for windows media player nor the fact that consumers are not obliged to use that media player is relevant . " an ongoing saga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft founder and chairman bill gates is not going to be happy about the court 's decision microsoft is likely to lodge an appeal with the europe 's highest tribunal , the european court of justice , and prolong the saga for at least another year .
immediately after the court 's decision was announced , however , microsoft 's general counsel refused to speculate on this issue . " i do n't want to talk about what will come next , " said brad smith in answer to questions about the possibility of an appeal .
" we need to read the ruling before we make any decision . " the eu commission ruled in 2004 - after a five-year probe - that microsoft was abusing its 95-percent share of the computer operating system market . the commission ordered the us-based multinational corporation to sell a version of their flagship windows operating system without a media player and to share technical information with competitors so that they could more easily create windows-compatible programs . calling the ruling an " important precedent , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said she wanted to see microsoft quickly changes its business practices and " comply fully " with the court 's judgment . " the commission will do its utmost to ensure that microsoft complies swiftly ...
i will not tolerate continued noncompliance , " she said . eu scores an important victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling may have global implications on the it industry in its appeal , microsoft argued that it provided interoperability information that met current industry standards and that the commission was asking from it to divulge valuable trade secrets and copyrighted patents . the court 's unequivocal ruling against microsoft , however , may have important implications for the future operation of the global it industry . it is also an important validation for the european antitrust regulator , which prosecutes an increasing number of cases every year . european commission president jose manuel barroso said the ruling " confirms the objectivity and the credibility " of the eu 's approach to competition . in 2006 , the eu competition commission cached in a record amount of 1.85 billion euros in antitrust fines .
according to eu officials , the commission levied the same amount of fines against cartels in the first half of 2007 alone . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , on measures to strengthen border controls in a bid to reduce the number of illegal entries to the bloc each year , but the question of funding will be paramount to any decisions taken . according to a draft document by the portuguese presidency , the justice and home affairs -lrb- jha -rrb- council will " encourage " governments to " cooperate , " " share responsibilities " and provide " support " to fellow member states , such as malta , that are struggling to prevent the seemingly unstoppable tide of would-be immigrants who depart from ports in north africa and enter the eu after crossing the mediterranean sea . however , frontex , the recently-established eu agency tasked with coordinating member states ' border security , is unlikely to get any additional money to carry out its work . eu governments believe that the responsibility for the control of external borders lies with individual member states and have accordingly granted a budget of just 40 million euros -lrb- $ 55 million -rrb- to the warsaw-based agency . equipment received less than equipment pledged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontex could have even less funding in the future some of the eu 's 27 member states , including germany and italy , have pledged to provide equipment to frontex .
but many of the total of 21 airplanes , 27 helicopters and more than 100 boats pledged to frontex are assumed to not yet be at the agency 's disposal . the eu 's justice and interior ministers consider the reinforcing of the bloc 's southern maritime borders as a high priority because of the numerous reports over the summer months about would-be immigrants drowning during their ill-fated voyages across the mediterranean sea . experts say most of the illegal aliens who penetrate so-called " fortress europe " - possibly as many as 500,000 per year , according to the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- - are believed to do so through the bloc 's sketchily patrolled eastern land border or by simply catching a plane and entering the eu on a temporary tourist visa . schengen agreement topics also on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schengen is aimed at easing border controls within europe along with efforts to increase border controls in the fight against illegal immigrants , the day-long meeting will also involve discussions on the schengen agreement allowing the abolition of systematic border controls between participating countries , the state of play of shared data among participating countries - the so-called schengen information system - and on the exchange of people 's fingerprints and biometric data .
a total of 15 countries have so far implemented schengen - including non-eu states iceland , norway and switzerland .
nine new eu member states - the czech republic , estonia , latvia , lithuania , hungary , malta , poland , slovenia and slovakia - have started using the schengen information system as of sept .
1 , and the portuguese presidency hopes that ministers meeting in brussels will agree to abolish passport controls at airports for passengers traveling to and from these nine countries as of march 2008 .
unrelated thorny issues expected to feature issues that are not on tuesday 's official agenda , but which threaten to hijack it , include polish opposition to a european day against the death penalty , which has been scheduled for oct .
10 and which warsaw would like to widen to include abortion and euthanasia . the mandate and profile of a new eu anti-terrorism coordinator is also likely to be a hot topic at the meeting .
the coordinator post was created in 2004 , in response to that year 's train bombings in madrid , but has been left vacant since march , when gijs de vries of the netherlands resigned citing personal reasons . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the iranians must understand that tension has reached an extreme point . " while saying that kouchner was right to call the situation with iran dangerous , fillon added that a confrontation was " the last option that any political leader would want . " the french foreign minister called on the european union to impose economic sanctions on tehran outside of those imposed by the united nations .

while the troika suffered a number of setbacks at the negotiating table , it was seen as the main diplomatic front in averting conflict with iran .

17 , and played a crucial role in the second as germany picked themselves up from the disappointing 0-0 draw against england on friday to make it into the last eight .
germany , who hit a record 11 goals in their first match against argentina , took control of the game in the opening minutes , cutting through japan 's defense and bombarding the goal with shots .
forward petra wimbersky should have scored in the third minute , latching onto a pass inside the area , but goalkeeper miho fukumoto just tipped the thundering shot over the bar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prinz grabbed a hat-trick in the 11-0 win over argentina kerstin garefrekes fired off a missile two minutes later that went high , and came close near half-time when her shot was blocked by a charging fukumoto , who was under pressure to keep her team in the match .
but it was prinz who did the damage , lurking on the edge of the penalty box to meet renate lingor 's corner which she rifled into the net on her second touch with 21 minutes gone . the goal propelled prinz , playing in her fourth world cup , into the history books by surpassing retired american player michelle akers as the most prolific world cup scorer with 13 goals .
german coach silvia neid brought on 19-year-old sensation fatmire bajramaj to add penetration in the second half , but the germans could not break down japan 's increasingly dogged defense .
the second goal came just three minutes from the end .
a flowing move from germany ended in a foul on martina müller in the penalty box and lingor secured victory by coolly converting the resulting penalty .
victorious germany looking for another level neid was full of praise for her players after the match . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's players march on into the last eight " i 'm very happy with the performance of our team , we reached the quarter finals and that 's what we were aiming for , " she told reporters .
" we played well against a strong opponent and we created a lot of chances .
nevertheless , in the quarter-final , we have to add a little bit to our performance , because we will face a very tough opponent . "
germany ended the cup 's first stage on top of group a with seven points and will play the runner-up in group b , likely to be north korea , on saturday .
england add more misery to argentina germany were joined in the last eight by england , who thumped south american champions argentina 6-1 .
kelly smith scored twice in the rout which signaled the end of a nightmare tournament for argentina , who conceded 18 goals in total and scored just one .
star striker smith pounced in the 64th and the 77th minute to bring her world cup tally to four goals in three games and ensure england made the last eight for the first time since 1995 .
the game got off to the worst possible start for argentina when captain eva gonzalez scored an own goal in the ninth minute .
then jill scott pounced barely 60 seconds later with a long-range effort to put england a well-deserved 2-0 up at half time .
the south americans then gave away two penalties and had catalina perez sent off - the first red card of the championships - leaving them in all sorts of trouble .
fara williams converted the first penalty kick in the 50th minute , smith scored her brace and then substitute vicky exley added another from the spot on 90 minutes .
" the girls were magnificent and we are really pleased , " said england coach hope powell .
" it was our target to get out of the group .
we have achieved that .

germany , who hit a record 11 goals in their first match against argentina , took control of the game in the opening minutes , cutting through japan 's defense and bombarding the goal with shots .
forward petra wimbersky should have scored in the third minute , latching onto a pass inside the area , but goalkeeper miho fukumoto just tipped the thundering shot over the bar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prinz grabbed a hat-trick in the 11-0 win over argentina kerstin garefrekes fired off a missile two minutes later that went high , and came close near half-time when her shot was blocked by a charging fukumoto , who was under pressure to keep her team in the match .
but it was prinz who did the damage , lurking on the edge of the penalty box to meet renate lingor 's corner which she rifled into the net on her second touch with 21 minutes gone . the goal propelled prinz , playing in her fourth world cup , into the history books by surpassing retired american player michelle akers as the most prolific world cup scorer with 13 goals .
german coach silvia neid brought on 19-year-old sensation fatmire bajramaj to add penetration in the second half , but the germans could not break down japan 's increasingly dogged defense .
the second goal came just three minutes from the end .
a flowing move from germany ended in a foul on martina müller in the penalty box and lingor secured victory by coolly converting the resulting penalty .
victorious germany looking for another level neid was full of praise for her players after the match . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's players march on into the last eight " i 'm very happy with the performance of our team , we reached the quarter finals and that 's what we were aiming for , " she told reporters .
" we played well against a strong opponent and we created a lot of chances .
nevertheless , in the quarter-final , we have to add a little bit to our performance , because we will face a very tough opponent . "
germany ended the cup 's first stage on top of group a with seven points and will play the runner-up in group b , likely to be north korea , on saturday .
england add more misery to argentina germany were joined in the last eight by england , who thumped south american champions argentina 6-1 .
kelly smith scored twice in the rout which signaled the end of a nightmare tournament for argentina , who conceded 18 goals in total and scored just one .
star striker smith pounced in the 64th and the 77th minute to bring her world cup tally to four goals in three games and ensure england made the last eight for the first time since 1995 .
the game got off to the worst possible start for argentina when captain eva gonzalez scored an own goal in the ninth minute .
then jill scott pounced barely 60 seconds later with a long-range effort to put england a well-deserved 2-0 up at half time .
the south americans then gave away two penalties and had catalina perez sent off - the first red card of the championships - leaving them in all sorts of trouble .
fara williams converted the first penalty kick in the 50th minute , smith scored her brace and then substitute vicky exley added another from the spot on 90 minutes .

star striker smith pounced in the 64th and the 77th minute to bring her world cup tally to four goals in three games and ensure england made the last eight for the first time since 1995 .
the game got off to the worst possible start for argentina when captain eva gonzalez scored an own goal in the ninth minute .
then jill scott pounced barely 60 seconds later with a long-range effort to put england a well-deserved 2-0 up at half time .
the south americans then gave away two penalties and had catalina perez sent off - the first red card of the championships - leaving them in all sorts of trouble .
fara williams converted the first penalty kick in the 50th minute , smith scored her brace and then substitute vicky exley added another from the spot on 90 minutes .
" the girls were magnificent and we are really pleased , " said england coach hope powell .
" it was our target to get out of the group .
we have achieved that .
we now move on to the next stage . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german defense minister franz josef jung said he would give the order to shoot down a plane that has been hijacked for an attack , despite a ruling by the country 's constitutional court banning such action .

it ruled that the law was an infringement on the right to life and the right to human dignity .
" but if there is a common danger or the democratic order is in danger , other rules apply , " jung said .
" i would like a clarification of the constitutional law , but there is still no consensus in the coalition -lrb- government -rrb- on this point .
therefore , in an emergency , i need to have recourse to a method that goes above the law . "

"
asked what the worst was , he replied , " it is war . "
kouchner said there was " no greater crisis today " than that over tehran 's developing nuclear program . " we will not accept that this -lrb- nuclear -rrb- bomb will be built , " he declared . " we must negotiate right to the end " with iran , kouchner added , but underlined that if tehran possessed an atomic weapon , it would represent " a real danger for the whole world . " room for negotiation remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner warned the world must be prepared for war in a bid to play down the controversy , french prime minister francois fillon said monday , sept .
17 , that tensions with iran were " extreme " but insisted there was still room for diplomacy in the nuclear stand-off . " everything must be done to avoid war , " fillon told reporters .
" the iranians must understand that tension has reached an extreme point . " while saying that kouchner was right to call the situation with iran dangerous , fillon added that a confrontation was " the last option that any political leader would want . " the french foreign minister called on the european union to impose economic sanctions on tehran outside of those imposed by the united nations . " these would be european sanctions that each country , individually , must put in place with its own banking , commercial and industrial system , " kouchner said .
france takes a hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fillon said tensions with iran were now " extreme " the french foreign minister 's statement follows what appears to be a new hard line from france on dealing with iran . as part of the eu troika along with germany and britain , france led europe 's diplomatic efforts to convince iran to stop its uranium enrichment program , which some believe is being used in the development of nuclear weapons .
while the troika suffered a number of setbacks at the negotiating table , it was seen as the main diplomatic front in averting conflict with iran .
however , since president nicolas sarkozy 's election victory in may , france has been keen to flex its muscles .
sarkozy himself warned in an aug .

" iran : west always chooses confrontation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aghazadeh condemned france 's behavior iran responded with outrage to kouchner 's statement . " it seems that the french foreign minister has forgotten the policy of the european union , " foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini said in a statement .
" the use of such words creates tensions and is contrary to the cultural history and civilization of france . " iranian vice-president reza aghazadeh , who is also the head of iran 's atomic energy organization , told the un 's international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- that western countries " have always chosen the path of confrontation instead of the path of understanding and cordial relations . " " the great nation of iran has recorded your discriminatory behavior and performance in its memory and will not forget , " he added . germany will continue to support france france 's european partners appeared divided over the french statement .
germany said monday that it would continue to work closely with france and its other allies to avert the threat of a nuclear-armed iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european governments want to prevent iran from building nuclear weapons the french government was correct in its assessment that " there are all the elements of a very serious obligation on the international community and that we must do everything possible to ensure that iran does not become nuclear armed , " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in berlin .
german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger added that he did not regard kouchner 's statements as a " threat of war . " germany and france were currently cooperating on a third resolution to be placed before the un security council on applying additional sanctions to iran to compel it to halt its nuclear weapons program , he said .
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said that the netherlands would support eu sanctions if the un security council failed to agree on new measures but would not be drawn on any talk of military intervention .
" the first effort should be to convince the security council to apply more sanctions , " verhagen said .
" but when the security council does n't agree , i am willing to apply european union sanctions in combination with the united states sanctions . "

" we must negotiate right to the end " with iran , kouchner added , but underlined that if tehran possessed an atomic weapon , it would represent " a real danger for the whole world . " room for negotiation remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner warned the world must be prepared for war in a bid to play down the controversy , french prime minister francois fillon said monday , sept .
17 , that tensions with iran were " extreme " but insisted there was still room for diplomacy in the nuclear stand-off . " everything must be done to avoid war , " fillon told reporters .
" the iranians must understand that tension has reached an extreme point . " while saying that kouchner was right to call the situation with iran dangerous , fillon added that a confrontation was " the last option that any political leader would want . " the french foreign minister called on the european union to impose economic sanctions on tehran outside of those imposed by the united nations . " these would be european sanctions that each country , individually , must put in place with its own banking , commercial and industrial system , " kouchner said .
france takes a hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fillon said tensions with iran were now " extreme " the french foreign minister 's statement follows what appears to be a new hard line from france on dealing with iran . as part of the eu troika along with germany and britain , france led europe 's diplomatic efforts to convince iran to stop its uranium enrichment program , which some believe is being used in the development of nuclear weapons .
while the troika suffered a number of setbacks at the negotiating table , it was seen as the main diplomatic front in averting conflict with iran .
however , since president nicolas sarkozy 's election victory in may , france has been keen to flex its muscles .
sarkozy himself warned in an aug .
27 speech that the iranian nuclear crisis presented the world with " a catastrophic alternative : an iranian bomb or the bombing of iran . " iran : west always chooses confrontation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aghazadeh condemned france 's behavior iran responded with outrage to kouchner 's statement . " it seems that the french foreign minister has forgotten the policy of the european union , " foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini said in a statement .
" the use of such words creates tensions and is contrary to the cultural history and civilization of france . " iranian vice-president reza aghazadeh , who is also the head of iran 's atomic energy organization , told the un 's international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- that western countries " have always chosen the path of confrontation instead of the path of understanding and cordial relations . " " the great nation of iran has recorded your discriminatory behavior and performance in its memory and will not forget , " he added . germany will continue to support france france 's european partners appeared divided over the french statement .
germany said monday that it would continue to work closely with france and its other allies to avert the threat of a nuclear-armed iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european governments want to prevent iran from building nuclear weapons the french government was correct in its assessment that " there are all the elements of a very serious obligation on the international community and that we must do everything possible to ensure that iran does not become nuclear armed , " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in berlin .
german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger added that he did not regard kouchner 's statements as a " threat of war . " germany and france were currently cooperating on a third resolution to be placed before the un security council on applying additional sanctions to iran to compel it to halt its nuclear weapons program , he said .
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said that the netherlands would support eu sanctions if the un security council failed to agree on new measures but would not be drawn on any talk of military intervention .
" the first effort should be to convince the security council to apply more sanctions , " verhagen said .
" but when the security council does n't agree , i am willing to apply european union sanctions in combination with the united states sanctions . "
iaea chief warns of iraq lessons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's elbaradei spoke of the tragedy of iraq iaea director general mohamed elbaradei urged countries to refrain from talking about an escalation of the iran nuclear crisis . " we need always to remember that use of force could only be resorted to when ... every other option has been exhausted .
i do n't think we are at all there , " elbaradei told reporters in vienna .
" there is no clear and present danger from iran .
" there are rules on how to use force , and i would hope that everybody would have gotten the lesson after the iraq situation , where 70,000 innocent civilians have lost their lives on the suspicion that a country has nuclear weapons , " he concluded . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , on measures to strengthen border controls in a bid to reduce the number of illegal entries to the bloc each year , but the question of funding will be paramount to any decisions taken . according to a draft document by the portuguese presidency , the justice and home affairs -lrb- jha -rrb- council will " encourage " governments to " cooperate , " " share responsibilities " and provide " support " to fellow member states , such as malta , that are struggling to prevent the seemingly unstoppable tide of would-be immigrants who depart from ports in north africa and enter the eu after crossing the mediterranean sea . however , frontex , the recently-established eu agency tasked with coordinating member states ' border security , is unlikely to get any additional money to carry out its work . eu governments believe that the responsibility for the control of external borders lies with individual member states and have accordingly granted a budget of just 40 million euros -lrb- $ 55 million -rrb- to the warsaw-based agency . equipment received less than equipment pledged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontex could have even less funding in the future some of the eu 's 27 member states , including germany and italy , have pledged to provide equipment to frontex .
but many of the total of 21 airplanes , 27 helicopters and more than 100 boats pledged to frontex are assumed to not yet be at the agency 's disposal . the eu 's justice and interior ministers consider the reinforcing of the bloc 's southern maritime borders as a high priority because of the numerous reports over the summer months about would-be immigrants drowning during their ill-fated voyages across the mediterranean sea . experts say most of the illegal aliens who penetrate so-called " fortress europe " - possibly as many as 500,000 per year , according to the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- - are believed to do so through the bloc 's sketchily patrolled eastern land border or by simply catching a plane and entering the eu on a temporary tourist visa . schengen agreement topics also on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schengen is aimed at easing border controls within europe along with efforts to increase border controls in the fight against illegal immigrants , the day-long meeting will also involve discussions on the schengen agreement allowing the abolition of systematic border controls between participating countries , the state of play of shared data among participating countries - the so-called schengen information system - and on the exchange of people 's fingerprints and biometric data .
a total of 15 countries have so far implemented schengen - including non-eu states iceland , norway and switzerland .
nine new eu member states - the czech republic , estonia , latvia , lithuania , hungary , malta , poland , slovenia and slovakia - have started using the schengen information system as of sept .
1 , and the portuguese presidency hopes that ministers meeting in brussels will agree to abolish passport controls at airports for passengers traveling to and from these nine countries as of march 2008 .
unrelated thorny issues expected to feature issues that are not on tuesday 's official agenda , but which threaten to hijack it , include polish opposition to a european day against the death penalty , which has been scheduled for oct .
10 and which warsaw would like to widen to include abortion and euthanasia . the mandate and profile of a new eu anti-terrorism coordinator is also likely to be a hot topic at the meeting .
the coordinator post was created in 2004 , in response to that year 's train bombings in madrid , but has been left vacant since march , when gijs de vries of the netherlands resigned citing personal reasons . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german defense minister franz josef jung said he would give the order to shoot down a plane that has been hijacked for an attack , despite a ruling by the country 's constitutional court banning such action . " if there were no other way , i would give the order to shoot it down to protect our people , " jung told focus magazine , according to an advance extract from its monday , sept .
17 issue , which was made available on sunday .
in 2006 , germany 's highest court scrapped a controversial law allowing the military to shoot down civilian planes suspected of being hijacked for terrorist attacks .
it ruled that the law was an infringement on the right to life and the right to human dignity .
" but if there is a common danger or the democratic order is in danger , other rules apply , " jung said .
" i would like a clarification of the constitutional law , but there is still no consensus in the coalition -lrb- government -rrb- on this point .
therefore , in an emergency , i need to have recourse to a method that goes above the law . "
minister above the law ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earlier this month , germany arrested three islamic terrorists jung ' statements triggered a storm of criticism from other german politicians .
social democratic domestic policy expert dieter wiefelspütz criticized the minister for " openly counting on a breach of constitution " , while left party politician petra pau accused him of " playing god . "
a former vice president of the german parliament , burkhard hirsch , of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said " this was the first time in the history of the federal republic of germany that a minister openly declares he would disregard the ruling of the constitutional court and order that a crime be committed , if he deems it right . "
support for jung 's radical view came from members of his own - and chancellor merkel 's - conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" in our current legal situation , that is really in the end his decision , " cdu defense expert bernd siebert told kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
" and in the situation which he described , he would have to act accordingly .
" franz josef jung has our full support , " siebert said .
terrorist threats remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he wants tougher security measures : wolfgang schäuble earlier this month , germany arrested three men - two german converts to islam and a turkish muslim - accused of planning " massive " terrorist attacks , possibly on us military facilities in the country .
but interior minister wolfgang schäuble said in a sunday newspaper that the risk of a terrorist attack remained high despite the arrests of these men .
" the terrorist threat has not diminished , " schäuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper .
" i am no less worried since the arrests .
we know that we are in the sights of islamist terrorism . "
schäuble said experts were convinced that extremists would one day attack with nuclear weapons .
" many experts are convinced that it is a question of when , not if , " he said .
" there 's no point in spoiling the time that we have left by getting hysterical about the end of the world beforehand . "
schäuble has been under fire in germany for pushing for a tougher security policy that would allow the indefinite detention and " targeted killing " of terror suspects . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
many of the elegant , rigorous objects he created for braun were iconic ; their success helped cement germany 's reputation as a maker of sleek , well-crafted electronics and household goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers compare the braun et 44 calculator to the iphone even today , young designers continue to copy rams ' products and adhere to his design principles . industry watchers of late have enjoyed pointing out similarities between rams ' creations in the 1960s and 70s , and consumer electronics created by apple - another company that places a strong emphasis on product design . dw-world.de spoke with rams , now 75 , when he attended the 16th braun prize awards , a biennial contest honoring young design talent . dw-world.de : mr. rams , what do you think about all the claims that apple is using your designs as inspiration for some of its most popular products , like the ipod , iphone , or g5 ? dieter rams : i like to take it as a compliment ! many people consider your designs for braun the epitome of ‘ german design . '
is there still a german design language ? i have always said , there is no explicit german design .
german design always wanted to be international design .
starting with bauhaus , they called it international design .
the ulm school of design called their style international design .
in contrast to scandinavia , where they talked about scandinavian design , we did n't want our design to be connected with the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even pre-rams , braun had a modern look .
the sk-sk 2/1 radio , 1955 .
and especially at braun , from the beginning , -lsb- company founders -rsb- erwin and arthur braun did n't want a particularly " german " design .
we fought for it to be known as braun design .
it was supposed to be general . are you saying you consider yourself more european than german ? i 've never seen myself as really german .
i mean , germany is my homeland , ok .
but i 'm neither nationalistic nor any " istic " i 'm against all " isms . " we have to start thinking about how to work together - and not only in europe .
it 's hard , because each country wants to put its own interests in the foreground .
but we have to hold together worldwide .
otherwise i do n't see any other possibility for us to achieve a unified culture , not to mention a unified , peaceful world . but some people say it is important for german business to play up its design reputation , as a way of standing out in the international economy .
the country even funds federal and state design centers to promote the field … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lighter , designed by rams of course , it is important .
i was president of the german design council myself , for a long time .
and i always fought for political support for design in germany . … if you had this political background , then of course you could establish an identity - the way companies have a visual identity . countries are , in a sense , companies .
they compete against one another , they have rivalries .
sadly , we still can not manage to find a common denominator , or even to agree on which direction we should start moving in .
and i hope , very much , that it will be possible someday , through design . world peace through design ? design in terms of industrial design , and not where it is sort of heading now , as a lifestyle instrument .
good design has nothing to do with lifestyle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plexiglas covered hi-fis were a famous rams innovation i do n't want to criticize living well - i 'm glad to be doing well .
but " lifestyle " and " wellness " have nothing to do with our day-to-day culture .
our everyday culture should be taken more seriously .
and design has - or should have - the responsibility of taking our culture , responsibly , out into the wider world . the people who are in charge of doing this are product designers , together with the companies they work for , and - although that is the part i really think is missing - politicians .
especially if we see individual countries as businesses .

at my age you have to think about these things a bit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braun clock designed by dietrich lubs but of course , lots of things bother me , and i have overlooked a lot of them intentionally .
it 's funny , the psychological chaos and destruction in our world is widely recognized .
it is constantly discussed , mulled over , described , written about .
what never gets discussed or written about is the visual destruction of our environment . for example , do we need windmills littering the countryside , when we do n't even know if they could still be technically improved ?
they make a lot of noise .
or trash removal , with all the green , blue , yellow bags that litter the streets .
these things are visual pollution .
and we do n't deal with it . one of your famous design principles is that design should be concerned with the environment .
how so ? it may sound a bit banal , but i would love to see the day when the world is a more beautiful place , when we honor the nature around us .
but we are stomping on it .
we are ruining our host , mother earth .
and we are n't even aware we are doing it .
we 're leaving it to the next generation to take care of it .
and i think that 's the place we need to start … i do n't know if humanity will make it , ultimately .

"
many of the elegant , rigorous objects he created for braun were iconic ; their success helped cement germany 's reputation as a maker of sleek , well-crafted electronics and household goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers compare the braun et 44 calculator to the iphone even today , young designers continue to copy rams ' products and adhere to his design principles . industry watchers of late have enjoyed pointing out similarities between rams ' creations in the 1960s and 70s , and consumer electronics created by apple - another company that places a strong emphasis on product design . dw-world.de spoke with rams , now 75 , when he attended the 16th braun prize awards , a biennial contest honoring young design talent . dw-world.de : mr. rams , what do you think about all the claims that apple is using your designs as inspiration for some of its most popular products , like the ipod , iphone , or g5 ? dieter rams : i like to take it as a compliment ! many people consider your designs for braun the epitome of ‘ german design . '
is there still a german design language ? i have always said , there is no explicit german design .
german design always wanted to be international design .
starting with bauhaus , they called it international design .
the ulm school of design called their style international design .
in contrast to scandinavia , where they talked about scandinavian design , we did n't want our design to be connected with the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even pre-rams , braun had a modern look .
the sk-sk 2/1 radio , 1955 .
and especially at braun , from the beginning , -lsb- company founders -rsb- erwin and arthur braun did n't want a particularly " german " design .
we fought for it to be known as braun design .
it was supposed to be general . are you saying you consider yourself more european than german ? i 've never seen myself as really german .
i mean , germany is my homeland , ok .
but i 'm neither nationalistic nor any " istic " i 'm against all " isms . " we have to start thinking about how to work together - and not only in europe .
it 's hard , because each country wants to put its own interests in the foreground .
but we have to hold together worldwide .
otherwise i do n't see any other possibility for us to achieve a unified culture , not to mention a unified , peaceful world . but some people say it is important for german business to play up its design reputation , as a way of standing out in the international economy .
the country even funds federal and state design centers to promote the field … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lighter , designed by rams of course , it is important .
i was president of the german design council myself , for a long time .
and i always fought for political support for design in germany . … if you had this political background , then of course you could establish an identity - the way companies have a visual identity . countries are , in a sense , companies .
they compete against one another , they have rivalries .
sadly , we still can not manage to find a common denominator , or even to agree on which direction we should start moving in .
and i hope , very much , that it will be possible someday , through design . world peace through design ? design in terms of industrial design , and not where it is sort of heading now , as a lifestyle instrument .
good design has nothing to do with lifestyle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plexiglas covered hi-fis were a famous rams innovation i do n't want to criticize living well - i 'm glad to be doing well .
but " lifestyle " and " wellness " have nothing to do with our day-to-day culture .
our everyday culture should be taken more seriously .
and design has - or should have - the responsibility of taking our culture , responsibly , out into the wider world . the people who are in charge of doing this are product designers , together with the companies they work for , and - although that is the part i really think is missing - politicians .
especially if we see individual countries as businesses .
which , in effect , they are . how much is personal contentment related to the objects that surround us ? i 'm happy if i get a good night 's sleep , have positive thoughts , and stay healthy .
at my age you have to think about these things a bit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braun clock designed by dietrich lubs but of course , lots of things bother me , and i have overlooked a lot of them intentionally .

"
asked what the worst was , he replied , " it is war . "
kouchner said there was " no greater crisis today " than that over tehran 's developing nuclear program . " we will not accept that this -lrb- nuclear -rrb- bomb will be built , " he declared . " we must negotiate right to the end " with iran , kouchner added , but underlined that if tehran possessed an atomic weapon , it would represent " a real danger for the whole world . " room for negotiation remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner warned the world must be prepared for war in a bid to play down the controversy , french prime minister francois fillon said monday , sept .
17 , that tensions with iran were " extreme " but insisted there was still room for diplomacy in the nuclear stand-off . " everything must be done to avoid war , " fillon told reporters .
" the iranians must understand that tension has reached an extreme point . " while saying that kouchner was right to call the situation with iran dangerous , fillon added that a confrontation was " the last option that any political leader would want . " the french foreign minister called on the european union to impose economic sanctions on tehran outside of those imposed by the united nations . " these would be european sanctions that each country , individually , must put in place with its own banking , commercial and industrial system , " kouchner said .
france takes a hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fillon said tensions with iran were now " extreme " the french foreign minister 's statement follows what appears to be a new hard line from france on dealing with iran . as part of the eu troika along with germany and britain , france led europe 's diplomatic efforts to convince iran to stop its uranium enrichment program , which some believe is being used in the development of nuclear weapons .
while the troika suffered a number of setbacks at the negotiating table , it was seen as the main diplomatic front in averting conflict with iran .
however , since president nicolas sarkozy 's election victory in may , france has been keen to flex its muscles .
sarkozy himself warned in an aug .
27 speech that the iranian nuclear crisis presented the world with " a catastrophic alternative : an iranian bomb or the bombing of iran . " iran : west always chooses confrontation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aghazadeh condemned france 's behavior iran responded with outrage to kouchner 's statement . " it seems that the french foreign minister has forgotten the policy of the european union , " foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini said in a statement .
" the use of such words creates tensions and is contrary to the cultural history and civilization of france . " iranian vice-president reza aghazadeh , who is also the head of iran 's atomic energy organization , told the un 's international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- that western countries " have always chosen the path of confrontation instead of the path of understanding and cordial relations . " " the great nation of iran has recorded your discriminatory behavior and performance in its memory and will not forget , " he added . germany will continue to support france france 's european partners appeared divided over the french statement .
germany said monday that it would continue to work closely with france and its other allies to avert the threat of a nuclear-armed iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european governments want to prevent iran from building nuclear weapons the french government was correct in its assessment that " there are all the elements of a very serious obligation on the international community and that we must do everything possible to ensure that iran does not become nuclear armed , " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in berlin .
german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger added that he did not regard kouchner 's statements as a " threat of war . " germany and france were currently cooperating on a third resolution to be placed before the un security council on applying additional sanctions to iran to compel it to halt its nuclear weapons program , he said .
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said that the netherlands would support eu sanctions if the un security council failed to agree on new measures but would not be drawn on any talk of military intervention .
" the first effort should be to convince the security council to apply more sanctions , " verhagen said .
" but when the security council does n't agree , i am willing to apply european union sanctions in combination with the united states sanctions . "
iaea chief warns of iraq lessons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's elbaradei spoke of the tragedy of iraq iaea director general mohamed elbaradei urged countries to refrain from talking about an escalation of the iran nuclear crisis . " we need always to remember that use of force could only be resorted to when ... every other option has been exhausted .
i do n't think we are at all there , " elbaradei told reporters in vienna .
" there is no clear and present danger from iran .
" there are rules on how to use force , and i would hope that everybody would have gotten the lesson after the iraq situation , where 70,000 innocent civilians have lost their lives on the suspicion that a country has nuclear weapons , " he concluded . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , and played a crucial role in the second as germany picked themselves up from the disappointing 0-0 draw against england on friday to make it into the last eight .
germany , who hit a record 11 goals in their first match against argentina , took control of the game in the opening minutes , cutting through japan 's defense and bombarding the goal with shots .
forward petra wimbersky should have scored in the third minute , latching onto a pass inside the area , but goalkeeper miho fukumoto just tipped the thundering shot over the bar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prinz grabbed a hat-trick in the 11-0 win over argentina kerstin garefrekes fired off a missile two minutes later that went high , and came close near half-time when her shot was blocked by a charging fukumoto , who was under pressure to keep her team in the match .
but it was prinz who did the damage , lurking on the edge of the penalty box to meet renate lingor 's corner which she rifled into the net on her second touch with 21 minutes gone . the goal propelled prinz , playing in her fourth world cup , into the history books by surpassing retired american player michelle akers as the most prolific world cup scorer with 13 goals .
german coach silvia neid brought on 19-year-old sensation fatmire bajramaj to add penetration in the second half , but the germans could not break down japan 's increasingly dogged defense .
the second goal came just three minutes from the end .
a flowing move from germany ended in a foul on martina müller in the penalty box and lingor secured victory by coolly converting the resulting penalty .
victorious germany looking for another level neid was full of praise for her players after the match . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's players march on into the last eight " i 'm very happy with the performance of our team , we reached the quarter finals and that 's what we were aiming for , " she told reporters .
" we played well against a strong opponent and we created a lot of chances .
nevertheless , in the quarter-final , we have to add a little bit to our performance , because we will face a very tough opponent . "
germany ended the cup 's first stage on top of group a with seven points and will play the runner-up in group b , likely to be north korea , on saturday .
england add more misery to argentina germany were joined in the last eight by england , who thumped south american champions argentina 6-1 .
kelly smith scored twice in the rout which signaled the end of a nightmare tournament for argentina , who conceded 18 goals in total and scored just one .
star striker smith pounced in the 64th and the 77th minute to bring her world cup tally to four goals in three games and ensure england made the last eight for the first time since 1995 .
the game got off to the worst possible start for argentina when captain eva gonzalez scored an own goal in the ninth minute .
then jill scott pounced barely 60 seconds later with a long-range effort to put england a well-deserved 2-0 up at half time .
the south americans then gave away two penalties and had catalina perez sent off - the first red card of the championships - leaving them in all sorts of trouble .
fara williams converted the first penalty kick in the 50th minute , smith scored her brace and then substitute vicky exley added another from the spot on 90 minutes .
" the girls were magnificent and we are really pleased , " said england coach hope powell .
" it was our target to get out of the group .
we have achieved that .

" but , instead , the party base decided that its representatives in the german parliament must vote against continued use of the army in afghanistan if fighting was involved . while the decision can not actually affect germany 's current foreign policy - since chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government does not need opposition votes for a renewal of the troop 's mandate next month - it is indicative of the deep split which has developed within the greens . traditionally pacifist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leader joschka fischer was germany 's foreign minister under gerhard schröder the traditionally pacifist greens made a u-turn when it comes to german military operations abroad during their time in a coalition with social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder from 1998 to 2005 . the decision to support german peacekeeping operations abroad has divided the party ever since . " i still believe this was the right thing to do and we will stand by our responsibility , " bütikofer said of the deployment at the congress , amid heckling and booing by delegates . a turning point for the greens rejecting the expected renewal of the troops ' mandate in afghanistan , the rank-and-file members of the green party effectively reversed the controversial changes in foreign policy that were ushered in by schröder 's foreign minister and former green party leader joschka fischer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's military presence in afghanistan has divided the green party " the result of the party congress marks the temporary end of a 10-year-long struggle over the pragmatist foreign policy course a la joschka fischer , " said political scientist hubert kleinert in an op-ed for the web site of the german weekly spiegel . " on the other hand , this also means , for the time being , the end of all speculations about a possible sharing of power in the federal government beyond the red-green coalition , " kleinert said , alluding to the speculations that the green party might form a coalition with merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- after the next elections . fdp leader guido westerwelle said the green party discredited itself as a potential coalition member in the future . " to those in the -lsb- christian democratic -rsb- union , who are still hoping for a black-green coalition , i can only say : ' have fun ! "
westerwelle told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , referring to the traditional color of the cdu . confident merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel wants the troops to stay in afghanistan rejecting criticism by some political leaders and opinion polls showing waning support for the german military presence in afghanistan , merkel said on saturday she wanted the troops ' mandate to be extended . " there is no alternative , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
" this military commitment is important for those who live in afghanistan but also for the security and freedom of german citizens . " germany currently has some 3,000 troops deployed in northern afghanistan as part of the nato-lead international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
germany has also sent six reconnaissance tornado jets to afghanistan to assist isaf operations throughout the country . the german army 's mandate prevents it from being used in the south , where military casualties are higher . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
asked what the worst was , he replied , " it is war . "
kouchner said there was " no greater crisis today " than that over tehran 's developing nuclear program . " we will not accept that this -lrb- nuclear -rrb- bomb will be built , " he declared . " we must negotiate right to the end " with iran , kouchner added , but underlined that if tehran possessed an atomic weapon , it would represent " a real danger for the whole world . " room for negotiation remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner warned the world must be prepared for war in a bid to play down the controversy , french prime minister francois fillon said monday , sept .
17 , that tensions with iran were " extreme " but insisted there was still room for diplomacy in the nuclear stand-off . " everything must be done to avoid war , " fillon told reporters .
" the iranians must understand that tension has reached an extreme point . " while saying that kouchner was right to call the situation with iran dangerous , fillon added that a confrontation was " the last option that any political leader would want . " the french foreign minister called on the european union to impose economic sanctions on tehran outside of those imposed by the united nations . " these would be european sanctions that each country , individually , must put in place with its own banking , commercial and industrial system , " kouchner said .
france takes a hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fillon said tensions with iran were now " extreme " the french foreign minister 's statement follows what appears to be a new hard line from france on dealing with iran . as part of the eu troika along with germany and britain , france led europe 's diplomatic efforts to convince iran to stop its uranium enrichment program , which some believe is being used in the development of nuclear weapons .
while the troika suffered a number of setbacks at the negotiating table , it was seen as the main diplomatic front in averting conflict with iran .
however , since president nicolas sarkozy 's election victory in may , france has been keen to flex its muscles .
sarkozy himself warned in an aug .
27 speech that the iranian nuclear crisis presented the world with " a catastrophic alternative : an iranian bomb or the bombing of iran . " iran : west always chooses confrontation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aghazadeh condemned france 's behavior iran responded with outrage to kouchner 's statement . " it seems that the french foreign minister has forgotten the policy of the european union , " foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini said in a statement .
" the use of such words creates tensions and is contrary to the cultural history and civilization of france . " iranian vice-president reza aghazadeh , who is also the head of iran 's atomic energy organization , told the un 's international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- that western countries " have always chosen the path of confrontation instead of the path of understanding and cordial relations . " " the great nation of iran has recorded your discriminatory behavior and performance in its memory and will not forget , " he added . germany will continue to support france france 's european partners appeared divided over the french statement .
germany said monday that it would continue to work closely with france and its other allies to avert the threat of a nuclear-armed iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european governments want to prevent iran from building nuclear weapons the french government was correct in its assessment that " there are all the elements of a very serious obligation on the international community and that we must do everything possible to ensure that iran does not become nuclear armed , " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in berlin .
german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger added that he did not regard kouchner 's statements as a " threat of war . " germany and france were currently cooperating on a third resolution to be placed before the un security council on applying additional sanctions to iran to compel it to halt its nuclear weapons program , he said .
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said that the netherlands would support eu sanctions if the un security council failed to agree on new measures but would not be drawn on any talk of military intervention .
" the first effort should be to convince the security council to apply more sanctions , " verhagen said .
" but when the security council does n't agree , i am willing to apply european union sanctions in combination with the united states sanctions . "
iaea chief warns of iraq lessons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's elbaradei spoke of the tragedy of iraq iaea director general mohamed elbaradei urged countries to refrain from talking about an escalation of the iran nuclear crisis . " we need always to remember that use of force could only be resorted to when ... every other option has been exhausted .
i do n't think we are at all there , " elbaradei told reporters in vienna .
" there is no clear and present danger from iran .
" there are rules on how to use force , and i would hope that everybody would have gotten the lesson after the iraq situation , where 70,000 innocent civilians have lost their lives on the suspicion that a country has nuclear weapons , " he concluded . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the court observes that it is beyond dispute that in consequence of the tying , consumers are unable to acquire the windows operating system without simultaneously acquiring windows media player , " the court said . " in that regard , the court considers that neither the fact that microsoft does not charge a separate price for windows media player nor the fact that consumers are not obliged to use that media player is relevant .

" we need to read the ruling before we make any decision .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 17.09.2007 political wrangling at heart of german terror debate , critics say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung said he would give the order to shoot down a passenger plane if necessary the german defense minister 's comments about shooting down hijacked planes set off a burst of political squabbling .
but the debate raises important issues , even if it 's motivated by political maneuvering , observers say . politicians of all stripes have taken the opportunity to comment on german defense minster franz josef jung 's statement to focus magazine on sunday , sept .
16 , that he would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane , though such an order has been ruled illegal by germany 's highest court . leaders from the opposition greens have called for his dismissal or at least for public chastisement while his colleagues in christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have tended to back him up by calling for a re-examination of constitutional questions in the face of a modern terrorist threat . also on sunday , interior minister wolfgang schäuble said the risk of a terror attack remains high in germany , and that the country is " in the sights of islamist terrorism . " berlin senator urges end to ' ghost debate ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military jets forced a small plane circiling downtown frankfurt to land safely in 2003 schäuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung that experts were convinced extremists would one day attack with nuclear weapons . " many experts are convinced that it is a question of when , not if , " he said . his comments came in the wake of events of the past weeks , after security officials arrested three men who apparently were planning terror attacks on the us ramstein air base and other targets .
the suspects were not found to be in possession of any radioactive material . schäuble has recently called for added power to be given to police in the fight against terrorism , including the right for authorities to conduct covert online searches of terror suspects ' computers . despite this month 's terror arrests , berlin interior senator erhart körting called the cacophony of remarks for stricter antiterrorism measures , particularly shooting down hijacked planes , to be a " ghost debate . " the german constitutional court 's decision in 2006 outlawing such an action made jung 's point moot , he said . " we should concentrate on what is possible under our constitution , " he said in an interview with the dpa news agency . real issue more politics than security ? guido steinberg , a senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs , agreed that the media discussion involved more political jockeying ahead of elections in 2009 than any real changes to german security policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble reminded germans of the terror threat posed to the country " the debate has more to do with the coalition than with the topic itself , " he said .
" i think the -lsb- cdu politicians -rsb- are trying to push the spd to get into position for the next election . they are provoking them . " the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and cdu have been partners in a " grand coalition " since 2005 , when angela merkel took germany 's helm as the head of the cdu .
both jung and schäuble are cdu members . that the spd and greens were initially responsible for the law they 've recently come out against " makes their response right now all the more interesting , " steinberg said .
germany enacted the now-repealed law under former chancellor gerhard schröder after the sept .
11 , 2001 terror attacks in the united states . " no pilot would shoot down a plane " despite jung 's comments , a defense minister no longer has the right to decide whether to shoot down a hijacked aircraft , steinberg said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers agreed that pilots would not follow an order to shoot down a passenger plane " since the law was deemed unconstitutional , the pilot knows shooting down such a plane would be illegal - even if he were following orders , " steinberg said .
" so now he would be assuming legal responsibility himself .
no pilot would do this . " that 's the reason the head of the german federal armed forces association , bernhard gertz , warned pilots against pulling the trigger .

17 , and played a crucial role in the second as germany picked themselves up from the disappointing 0-0 draw against england on friday to make it into the last eight .
germany , who hit a record 11 goals in their first match against argentina , took control of the game in the opening minutes , cutting through japan 's defense and bombarding the goal with shots .
forward petra wimbersky should have scored in the third minute , latching onto a pass inside the area , but goalkeeper miho fukumoto just tipped the thundering shot over the bar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prinz grabbed a hat-trick in the 11-0 win over argentina kerstin garefrekes fired off a missile two minutes later that went high , and came close near half-time when her shot was blocked by a charging fukumoto , who was under pressure to keep her team in the match .
but it was prinz who did the damage , lurking on the edge of the penalty box to meet renate lingor 's corner which she rifled into the net on her second touch with 21 minutes gone . the goal propelled prinz , playing in her fourth world cup , into the history books by surpassing retired american player michelle akers as the most prolific world cup scorer with 13 goals .
german coach silvia neid brought on 19-year-old sensation fatmire bajramaj to add penetration in the second half , but the germans could not break down japan 's increasingly dogged defense .
the second goal came just three minutes from the end .
a flowing move from germany ended in a foul on martina müller in the penalty box and lingor secured victory by coolly converting the resulting penalty .
victorious germany looking for another level neid was full of praise for her players after the match . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's players march on into the last eight " i 'm very happy with the performance of our team , we reached the quarter finals and that 's what we were aiming for , " she told reporters .
" we played well against a strong opponent and we created a lot of chances .
nevertheless , in the quarter-final , we have to add a little bit to our performance , because we will face a very tough opponent . "
germany ended the cup 's first stage on top of group a with seven points and will play the runner-up in group b , likely to be north korea , on saturday .
england add more misery to argentina germany were joined in the last eight by england , who thumped south american champions argentina 6-1 .
kelly smith scored twice in the rout which signaled the end of a nightmare tournament for argentina , who conceded 18 goals in total and scored just one .
star striker smith pounced in the 64th and the 77th minute to bring her world cup tally to four goals in three games and ensure england made the last eight for the first time since 1995 .
the game got off to the worst possible start for argentina when captain eva gonzalez scored an own goal in the ninth minute .
then jill scott pounced barely 60 seconds later with a long-range effort to put england a well-deserved 2-0 up at half time .
the south americans then gave away two penalties and had catalina perez sent off - the first red card of the championships - leaving them in all sorts of trouble .
fara williams converted the first penalty kick in the 50th minute , smith scored her brace and then substitute vicky exley added another from the spot on 90 minutes .
" the girls were magnificent and we are really pleased , " said england coach hope powell .
" it was our target to get out of the group .
we have achieved that .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.09.2007 microsoft loses eu antitrust appeal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court ruled that microsoft is not giving customers a choice europe 's second-highest court dismissed microsoft 's appeal against a 2004 eu antitrust decision in a landmark victory for the european antitrust regulator .
the us company said it 's still considering its next move . the 13 judges of the court of first instance , led by bo vesterdorf - on his last day on the job - upheld a european commission order from 2004 and a resulting fine of 497 million euros -lrb- $ 688.84 million -rrb- for the software giant . the court said monday , sept .
17 , that the commission was correct in concluding that microsoft was guilty of monopoly abuse and took advantage of its dominance in the desktop computer market to bundle other products with the ubiquitous windows operating system . " the court observes that it is beyond dispute that in consequence of the tying , consumers are unable to acquire the windows operating system without simultaneously acquiring windows media player , " the court said . " in that regard , the court considers that neither the fact that microsoft does not charge a separate price for windows media player nor the fact that consumers are not obliged to use that media player is relevant . " an ongoing saga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft founder and chairman bill gates is not going to be happy about the court 's decision microsoft is likely to lodge an appeal with the europe 's highest tribunal , the european court of justice , and prolong the saga for at least another year .
immediately after the court 's decision was announced , however , microsoft 's general counsel refused to speculate on this issue . " i do n't want to talk about what will come next , " said brad smith in answer to questions about the possibility of an appeal .
" we need to read the ruling before we make any decision . " the eu commission ruled in 2004 - after a five-year probe - that microsoft was abusing its 95-percent share of the computer operating system market . the commission ordered the us-based multinational corporation to sell a version of their flagship windows operating system without a media player and to share technical information with competitors so that they could more easily create windows-compatible programs . calling the ruling an " important precedent , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said she wanted to see microsoft quickly changes its business practices and " comply fully " with the court 's judgment . " the commission will do its utmost to ensure that microsoft complies swiftly ...
i will not tolerate continued noncompliance , " she said . eu scores an important victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling may have global implications on the it industry in its appeal , microsoft argued that it provided interoperability information that met current industry standards and that the commission was asking from it to divulge valuable trade secrets and copyrighted patents . the court 's unequivocal ruling against microsoft , however , may have important implications for the future operation of the global it industry . it is also an important validation for the european antitrust regulator , which prosecutes an increasing number of cases every year . european commission president jose manuel barroso said the ruling " confirms the objectivity and the credibility " of the eu 's approach to competition . in 2006 , the eu competition commission cached in a record amount of 1.85 billion euros in antitrust fines .
according to eu officials , the commission levied the same amount of fines against cartels in the first half of 2007 alone . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.09.2007 microsoft loses eu antitrust appeal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court ruled that microsoft is not giving customers a choice europe 's second-highest court dismissed microsoft 's appeal against a 2004 eu antitrust decision in a landmark victory for the european antitrust regulator .
the us company said it 's still considering its next move . the 13 judges of the court of first instance , led by bo vesterdorf - on his last day on the job - upheld a european commission order from 2004 and a resulting fine of 497 million euros -lrb- $ 688.84 million -rrb- for the software giant . the court said monday , sept .
17 , that the commission was correct in concluding that microsoft was guilty of monopoly abuse and took advantage of its dominance in the desktop computer market to bundle other products with the ubiquitous windows operating system . " the court observes that it is beyond dispute that in consequence of the tying , consumers are unable to acquire the windows operating system without simultaneously acquiring windows media player , " the court said . " in that regard , the court considers that neither the fact that microsoft does not charge a separate price for windows media player nor the fact that consumers are not obliged to use that media player is relevant . " an ongoing saga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft founder and chairman bill gates is not going to be happy about the court 's decision microsoft is likely to lodge an appeal with the europe 's highest tribunal , the european court of justice , and prolong the saga for at least another year .
immediately after the court 's decision was announced , however , microsoft 's general counsel refused to speculate on this issue . " i do n't want to talk about what will come next , " said brad smith in answer to questions about the possibility of an appeal .
" we need to read the ruling before we make any decision . " the eu commission ruled in 2004 - after a five-year probe - that microsoft was abusing its 95-percent share of the computer operating system market . the commission ordered the us-based multinational corporation to sell a version of their flagship windows operating system without a media player and to share technical information with competitors so that they could more easily create windows-compatible programs . calling the ruling an " important precedent , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said she wanted to see microsoft quickly changes its business practices and " comply fully " with the court 's judgment . " the commission will do its utmost to ensure that microsoft complies swiftly ...
i will not tolerate continued noncompliance , " she said . eu scores an important victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling may have global implications on the it industry in its appeal , microsoft argued that it provided interoperability information that met current industry standards and that the commission was asking from it to divulge valuable trade secrets and copyrighted patents . the court 's unequivocal ruling against microsoft , however , may have important implications for the future operation of the global it industry . it is also an important validation for the european antitrust regulator , which prosecutes an increasing number of cases every year . european commission president jose manuel barroso said the ruling " confirms the objectivity and the credibility " of the eu 's approach to competition . in 2006 , the eu competition commission cached in a record amount of 1.85 billion euros in antitrust fines .
according to eu officials , the commission levied the same amount of fines against cartels in the first half of 2007 alone . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us company said it 's still considering its next move . the 13 judges of the court of first instance , led by bo vesterdorf - on his last day on the job - upheld a european commission order from 2004 and a resulting fine of 497 million euros -lrb- $ 688.84 million -rrb- for the software giant . the court said monday , sept .
17 , that the commission was correct in concluding that microsoft was guilty of monopoly abuse and took advantage of its dominance in the desktop computer market to bundle other products with the ubiquitous windows operating system . " the court observes that it is beyond dispute that in consequence of the tying , consumers are unable to acquire the windows operating system without simultaneously acquiring windows media player , " the court said . " in that regard , the court considers that neither the fact that microsoft does not charge a separate price for windows media player nor the fact that consumers are not obliged to use that media player is relevant . " an ongoing saga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft founder and chairman bill gates is not going to be happy about the court 's decision microsoft is likely to lodge an appeal with the europe 's highest tribunal , the european court of justice , and prolong the saga for at least another year .
immediately after the court 's decision was announced , however , microsoft 's general counsel refused to speculate on this issue . " i do n't want to talk about what will come next , " said brad smith in answer to questions about the possibility of an appeal .
" we need to read the ruling before we make any decision . " the eu commission ruled in 2004 - after a five-year probe - that microsoft was abusing its 95-percent share of the computer operating system market . the commission ordered the us-based multinational corporation to sell a version of their flagship windows operating system without a media player and to share technical information with competitors so that they could more easily create windows-compatible programs . calling the ruling an " important precedent , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said she wanted to see microsoft quickly changes its business practices and " comply fully " with the court 's judgment . " the commission will do its utmost to ensure that microsoft complies swiftly ...
i will not tolerate continued noncompliance , " she said . eu scores an important victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling may have global implications on the it industry in its appeal , microsoft argued that it provided interoperability information that met current industry standards and that the commission was asking from it to divulge valuable trade secrets and copyrighted patents . the court 's unequivocal ruling against microsoft , however , may have important implications for the future operation of the global it industry . it is also an important validation for the european antitrust regulator , which prosecutes an increasing number of cases every year . european commission president jose manuel barroso said the ruling " confirms the objectivity and the credibility " of the eu 's approach to competition . in 2006 , the eu competition commission cached in a record amount of 1.85 billion euros in antitrust fines .
according to eu officials , the commission levied the same amount of fines against cartels in the first half of 2007 alone . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the debate raises important issues , even if it 's motivated by political maneuvering , observers say . politicians of all stripes have taken the opportunity to comment on german defense minster franz josef jung 's statement to focus magazine on sunday , sept .
16 , that he would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane , though such an order has been ruled illegal by germany 's highest court . leaders from the opposition greens have called for his dismissal or at least for public chastisement while his colleagues in christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have tended to back him up by calling for a re-examination of constitutional questions in the face of a modern terrorist threat . also on sunday , interior minister wolfgang schäuble said the risk of a terror attack remains high in germany , and that the country is " in the sights of islamist terrorism . " berlin senator urges end to ' ghost debate ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military jets forced a small plane circiling downtown frankfurt to land safely in 2003 schäuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung that experts were convinced extremists would one day attack with nuclear weapons . " many experts are convinced that it is a question of when , not if , " he said . his comments came in the wake of events of the past weeks , after security officials arrested three men who apparently were planning terror attacks on the us ramstein air base and other targets .
the suspects were not found to be in possession of any radioactive material . schäuble has recently called for added power to be given to police in the fight against terrorism , including the right for authorities to conduct covert online searches of terror suspects ' computers . despite this month 's terror arrests , berlin interior senator erhart körting called the cacophony of remarks for stricter antiterrorism measures , particularly shooting down hijacked planes , to be a " ghost debate . " the german constitutional court 's decision in 2006 outlawing such an action made jung 's point moot , he said . " we should concentrate on what is possible under our constitution , " he said in an interview with the dpa news agency . real issue more politics than security ? guido steinberg , a senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs , agreed that the media discussion involved more political jockeying ahead of elections in 2009 than any real changes to german security policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble reminded germans of the terror threat posed to the country " the debate has more to do with the coalition than with the topic itself , " he said .
" i think the -lsb- cdu politicians -rsb- are trying to push the spd to get into position for the next election . they are provoking them . " the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and cdu have been partners in a " grand coalition " since 2005 , when angela merkel took germany 's helm as the head of the cdu .
both jung and schäuble are cdu members . that the spd and greens were initially responsible for the law they 've recently come out against " makes their response right now all the more interesting , " steinberg said .
germany enacted the now-repealed law under former chancellor gerhard schröder after the sept .
11 , 2001 terror attacks in the united states . " no pilot would shoot down a plane " despite jung 's comments , a defense minister no longer has the right to decide whether to shoot down a hijacked aircraft , steinberg said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers agreed that pilots would not follow an order to shoot down a passenger plane " since the law was deemed unconstitutional , the pilot knows shooting down such a plane would be illegal - even if he were following orders , " steinberg said .
" so now he would be assuming legal responsibility himself .
no pilot would do this . " that 's the reason the head of the german federal armed forces association , bernhard gertz , warned pilots against pulling the trigger . " i advise -lsb- pilots -rsb- not to carry out an order to shoot , no matter who gives it , " he said in an interview with the tagesspeigel newspaper . a question of ideology if the minister ca n't give the order and no pilot would follow it , why raise the issue at all ?
according to steinberg , the parties have a long-term ideological motive .
the christian conservatives would like to see the armed forces become involved in fighting terrorism within the country - a stance the spd opposes and is currently not permitted by the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a construction flaw kept bombs from exploding on two german trains in august 2006 " this debate over how to fight terrorism has been going on , in earnest , since last winter or last spring , " steinberg said .
" it is ideological .
the spd believes in political approaches , the conservatives want the military to play a role . " germans not convinced of terror threat although there is no indication that terrorists are planning major attacks , steinberg said he thinks germans are not completely aware of the danger terrorists pose , and added that while schäuble 's warning of an eventual nuclear attack overdramatized the situation , it was not necessarily far off the mark . only luck has prevented a terrorist attack in germany and the possibility of a terror group trying to set off a radiation-carrying " dirty bomb " sometime in the future is not at all unlikely , he said . but future terrorist activity " is likely to be less sophisticated , " steinberg said .
" attacks on subways , trains and so on .
not futuristic stuff . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but many of the total of 21 airplanes , 27 helicopters and more than 100 boats pledged to frontex are assumed to not yet be at the agency 's disposal . the eu 's justice and interior ministers consider the reinforcing of the bloc 's southern maritime borders as a high priority because of the numerous reports over the summer months about would-be immigrants drowning during their ill-fated voyages across the mediterranean sea . experts say most of the illegal aliens who penetrate so-called " fortress europe " - possibly as many as 500,000 per year , according to the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- - are believed to do so through the bloc 's sketchily patrolled eastern land border or by simply catching a plane and entering the eu on a temporary tourist visa . schengen agreement topics also on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schengen is aimed at easing border controls within europe along with efforts to increase border controls in the fight against illegal immigrants , the day-long meeting will also involve discussions on the schengen agreement allowing the abolition of systematic border controls between participating countries , the state of play of shared data among participating countries - the so-called schengen information system - and on the exchange of people 's fingerprints and biometric data .
a total of 15 countries have so far implemented schengen - including non-eu states iceland , norway and switzerland .
nine new eu member states - the czech republic , estonia , latvia , lithuania , hungary , malta , poland , slovenia and slovakia - have started using the schengen information system as of sept .
1 , and the portuguese presidency hopes that ministers meeting in brussels will agree to abolish passport controls at airports for passengers traveling to and from these nine countries as of march 2008 .
unrelated thorny issues expected to feature issues that are not on tuesday 's official agenda , but which threaten to hijack it , include polish opposition to a european day against the death penalty , which has been scheduled for oct .
10 and which warsaw would like to widen to include abortion and euthanasia . the mandate and profile of a new eu anti-terrorism coordinator is also likely to be a hot topic at the meeting .
the coordinator post was created in 2004 , in response to that year 's train bombings in madrid , but has been left vacant since march , when gijs de vries of the netherlands resigned citing personal reasons . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but , instead , the party base decided that its representatives in the german parliament must vote against continued use of the army in afghanistan if fighting was involved . while the decision can not actually affect germany 's current foreign policy - since chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government does not need opposition votes for a renewal of the troop 's mandate next month - it is indicative of the deep split which has developed within the greens . traditionally pacifist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leader joschka fischer was germany 's foreign minister under gerhard schröder the traditionally pacifist greens made a u-turn when it comes to german military operations abroad during their time in a coalition with social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder from 1998 to 2005 . the decision to support german peacekeeping operations abroad has divided the party ever since . " i still believe this was the right thing to do and we will stand by our responsibility , " bütikofer said of the deployment at the congress , amid heckling and booing by delegates . a turning point for the greens rejecting the expected renewal of the troops ' mandate in afghanistan , the rank-and-file members of the green party effectively reversed the controversial changes in foreign policy that were ushered in by schröder 's foreign minister and former green party leader joschka fischer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's military presence in afghanistan has divided the green party " the result of the party congress marks the temporary end of a 10-year-long struggle over the pragmatist foreign policy course a la joschka fischer , " said political scientist hubert kleinert in an op-ed for the web site of the german weekly spiegel . " on the other hand , this also means , for the time being , the end of all speculations about a possible sharing of power in the federal government beyond the red-green coalition , " kleinert said , alluding to the speculations that the green party might form a coalition with merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- after the next elections . fdp leader guido westerwelle said the green party discredited itself as a potential coalition member in the future . " to those in the -lsb- christian democratic -rsb- union , who are still hoping for a black-green coalition , i can only say : ' have fun ! "
westerwelle told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , referring to the traditional color of the cdu . confident merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel wants the troops to stay in afghanistan rejecting criticism by some political leaders and opinion polls showing waning support for the german military presence in afghanistan , merkel said on saturday she wanted the troops ' mandate to be extended . " there is no alternative , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
" this military commitment is important for those who live in afghanistan but also for the security and freedom of german citizens . " germany currently has some 3,000 troops deployed in northern afghanistan as part of the nato-lead international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
germany has also sent six reconnaissance tornado jets to afghanistan to assist isaf operations throughout the country . the german army 's mandate prevents it from being used in the south , where military casualties are higher . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
many of the elegant , rigorous objects he created for braun were iconic ; their success helped cement germany 's reputation as a maker of sleek , well-crafted electronics and household goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers compare the braun et 44 calculator to the iphone even today , young designers continue to copy rams ' products and adhere to his design principles . industry watchers of late have enjoyed pointing out similarities between rams ' creations in the 1960s and 70s , and consumer electronics created by apple - another company that places a strong emphasis on product design . dw-world.de spoke with rams , now 75 , when he attended the 16th braun prize awards , a biennial contest honoring young design talent . dw-world.de : mr. rams , what do you think about all the claims that apple is using your designs as inspiration for some of its most popular products , like the ipod , iphone , or g5 ? dieter rams : i like to take it as a compliment ! many people consider your designs for braun the epitome of ‘ german design . '
is there still a german design language ? i have always said , there is no explicit german design .
german design always wanted to be international design .
starting with bauhaus , they called it international design .
the ulm school of design called their style international design .
in contrast to scandinavia , where they talked about scandinavian design , we did n't want our design to be connected with the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even pre-rams , braun had a modern look .
the sk-sk 2/1 radio , 1955 .
and especially at braun , from the beginning , -lsb- company founders -rsb- erwin and arthur braun did n't want a particularly " german " design .
we fought for it to be known as braun design .
it was supposed to be general . are you saying you consider yourself more european than german ? i 've never seen myself as really german .
i mean , germany is my homeland , ok .
but i 'm neither nationalistic nor any " istic " i 'm against all " isms . " we have to start thinking about how to work together - and not only in europe .
it 's hard , because each country wants to put its own interests in the foreground .
but we have to hold together worldwide .
otherwise i do n't see any other possibility for us to achieve a unified culture , not to mention a unified , peaceful world . but some people say it is important for german business to play up its design reputation , as a way of standing out in the international economy .
the country even funds federal and state design centers to promote the field … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lighter , designed by rams of course , it is important .
i was president of the german design council myself , for a long time .
and i always fought for political support for design in germany . … if you had this political background , then of course you could establish an identity - the way companies have a visual identity . countries are , in a sense , companies .
they compete against one another , they have rivalries .
sadly , we still can not manage to find a common denominator , or even to agree on which direction we should start moving in .
and i hope , very much , that it will be possible someday , through design . world peace through design ? design in terms of industrial design , and not where it is sort of heading now , as a lifestyle instrument .
good design has nothing to do with lifestyle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plexiglas covered hi-fis were a famous rams innovation i do n't want to criticize living well - i 'm glad to be doing well .
but " lifestyle " and " wellness " have nothing to do with our day-to-day culture .
our everyday culture should be taken more seriously .
and design has - or should have - the responsibility of taking our culture , responsibly , out into the wider world . the people who are in charge of doing this are product designers , together with the companies they work for , and - although that is the part i really think is missing - politicians .
especially if we see individual countries as businesses .
which , in effect , they are . how much is personal contentment related to the objects that surround us ? i 'm happy if i get a good night 's sleep , have positive thoughts , and stay healthy .
at my age you have to think about these things a bit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braun clock designed by dietrich lubs but of course , lots of things bother me , and i have overlooked a lot of them intentionally .
it 's funny , the psychological chaos and destruction in our world is widely recognized .
it is constantly discussed , mulled over , described , written about .
what never gets discussed or written about is the visual destruction of our environment . for example , do we need windmills littering the countryside , when we do n't even know if they could still be technically improved ?
they make a lot of noise .
or trash removal , with all the green , blue , yellow bags that litter the streets .
these things are visual pollution .
and we do n't deal with it . one of your famous design principles is that design should be concerned with the environment .
how so ? it may sound a bit banal , but i would love to see the day when the world is a more beautiful place , when we honor the nature around us .
but we are stomping on it .
we are ruining our host , mother earth .
and we are n't even aware we are doing it .
we 're leaving it to the next generation to take care of it .
and i think that 's the place we need to start … i do n't know if humanity will make it , ultimately .
i can only say that perhaps design - with the few nice things that are sometimes created - can offer a few rays of hope so that things can look better for this planet we are just visiting . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de design -pipe- 17.09.2007 german design guru discusses peace , purpose and pollution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rams : " design carries responsibility " as the head designer at german electronics and household appliance manufacturer braun from the early-1960s until 1995 , dieter rams was one of the most influential product designers in the 20th century . rams created a functionalist language based on ten principles of good design , which he summed up in the credo " less but better . "
many of the elegant , rigorous objects he created for braun were iconic ; their success helped cement germany 's reputation as a maker of sleek , well-crafted electronics and household goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers compare the braun et 44 calculator to the iphone even today , young designers continue to copy rams ' products and adhere to his design principles . industry watchers of late have enjoyed pointing out similarities between rams ' creations in the 1960s and 70s , and consumer electronics created by apple - another company that places a strong emphasis on product design . dw-world.de spoke with rams , now 75 , when he attended the 16th braun prize awards , a biennial contest honoring young design talent . dw-world.de : mr. rams , what do you think about all the claims that apple is using your designs as inspiration for some of its most popular products , like the ipod , iphone , or g5 ? dieter rams : i like to take it as a compliment ! many people consider your designs for braun the epitome of ‘ german design . '
is there still a german design language ? i have always said , there is no explicit german design .
german design always wanted to be international design .
starting with bauhaus , they called it international design .
the ulm school of design called their style international design .
in contrast to scandinavia , where they talked about scandinavian design , we did n't want our design to be connected with the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even pre-rams , braun had a modern look .
the sk-sk 2/1 radio , 1955 .
and especially at braun , from the beginning , -lsb- company founders -rsb- erwin and arthur braun did n't want a particularly " german " design .
we fought for it to be known as braun design .
it was supposed to be general . are you saying you consider yourself more european than german ? i 've never seen myself as really german .
i mean , germany is my homeland , ok .
but i 'm neither nationalistic nor any " istic " i 'm against all " isms . " we have to start thinking about how to work together - and not only in europe .
it 's hard , because each country wants to put its own interests in the foreground .
but we have to hold together worldwide .
otherwise i do n't see any other possibility for us to achieve a unified culture , not to mention a unified , peaceful world . but some people say it is important for german business to play up its design reputation , as a way of standing out in the international economy .
the country even funds federal and state design centers to promote the field … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lighter , designed by rams of course , it is important .
i was president of the german design council myself , for a long time .
and i always fought for political support for design in germany . … if you had this political background , then of course you could establish an identity - the way companies have a visual identity . countries are , in a sense , companies .
they compete against one another , they have rivalries .
sadly , we still can not manage to find a common denominator , or even to agree on which direction we should start moving in .
and i hope , very much , that it will be possible someday , through design . world peace through design ? design in terms of industrial design , and not where it is sort of heading now , as a lifestyle instrument .
good design has nothing to do with lifestyle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plexiglas covered hi-fis were a famous rams innovation i do n't want to criticize living well - i 'm glad to be doing well .
but " lifestyle " and " wellness " have nothing to do with our day-to-day culture .
our everyday culture should be taken more seriously .
and design has - or should have - the responsibility of taking our culture , responsibly , out into the wider world . the people who are in charge of doing this are product designers , together with the companies they work for , and - although that is the part i really think is missing - politicians .
especially if we see individual countries as businesses .
which , in effect , they are . how much is personal contentment related to the objects that surround us ? i 'm happy if i get a good night 's sleep , have positive thoughts , and stay healthy .
at my age you have to think about these things a bit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braun clock designed by dietrich lubs but of course , lots of things bother me , and i have overlooked a lot of them intentionally .
it 's funny , the psychological chaos and destruction in our world is widely recognized .
it is constantly discussed , mulled over , described , written about .
what never gets discussed or written about is the visual destruction of our environment . for example , do we need windmills littering the countryside , when we do n't even know if they could still be technically improved ?
they make a lot of noise .
or trash removal , with all the green , blue , yellow bags that litter the streets .
these things are visual pollution .
and we do n't deal with it . one of your famous design principles is that design should be concerned with the environment .
how so ? it may sound a bit banal , but i would love to see the day when the world is a more beautiful place , when we honor the nature around us .
but we are stomping on it .
we are ruining our host , mother earth .
and we are n't even aware we are doing it .
we 're leaving it to the next generation to take care of it .
and i think that 's the place we need to start … i do n't know if humanity will make it , ultimately .
i can only say that perhaps design - with the few nice things that are sometimes created - can offer a few rays of hope so that things can look better for this planet we are just visiting . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german defense minister franz josef jung said he would give the order to shoot down a plane that has been hijacked for an attack , despite a ruling by the country 's constitutional court banning such action . " if there were no other way , i would give the order to shoot it down to protect our people , " jung told focus magazine , according to an advance extract from its monday , sept .
17 issue , which was made available on sunday .
in 2006 , germany 's highest court scrapped a controversial law allowing the military to shoot down civilian planes suspected of being hijacked for terrorist attacks .
it ruled that the law was an infringement on the right to life and the right to human dignity .
" but if there is a common danger or the democratic order is in danger , other rules apply , " jung said .
" i would like a clarification of the constitutional law , but there is still no consensus in the coalition -lrb- government -rrb- on this point .
therefore , in an emergency , i need to have recourse to a method that goes above the law . "
minister above the law ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earlier this month , germany arrested three islamic terrorists jung ' statements triggered a storm of criticism from other german politicians .
social democratic domestic policy expert dieter wiefelspütz criticized the minister for " openly counting on a breach of constitution " , while left party politician petra pau accused him of " playing god . "
a former vice president of the german parliament , burkhard hirsch , of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said " this was the first time in the history of the federal republic of germany that a minister openly declares he would disregard the ruling of the constitutional court and order that a crime be committed , if he deems it right . "
support for jung 's radical view came from members of his own - and chancellor merkel 's - conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" in our current legal situation , that is really in the end his decision , " cdu defense expert bernd siebert told kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
" and in the situation which he described , he would have to act accordingly .
" franz josef jung has our full support , " siebert said .
terrorist threats remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he wants tougher security measures : wolfgang schäuble earlier this month , germany arrested three men - two german converts to islam and a turkish muslim - accused of planning " massive " terrorist attacks , possibly on us military facilities in the country .
but interior minister wolfgang schäuble said in a sunday newspaper that the risk of a terrorist attack remained high despite the arrests of these men .
" the terrorist threat has not diminished , " schäuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper .
" i am no less worried since the arrests .
we know that we are in the sights of islamist terrorism . "
schäuble said experts were convinced that extremists would one day attack with nuclear weapons .
" many experts are convinced that it is a question of when , not if , " he said .
" there 's no point in spoiling the time that we have left by getting hysterical about the end of the world beforehand . "
schäuble has been under fire in germany for pushing for a tougher security policy that would allow the indefinite detention and " targeted killing " of terror suspects . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.09.2007 microsoft loses eu antitrust appeal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court ruled that microsoft is not giving customers a choice europe 's second-highest court dismissed microsoft 's appeal against a 2004 eu antitrust decision in a landmark victory for the european antitrust regulator .
the us company said it 's still considering its next move . the 13 judges of the court of first instance , led by bo vesterdorf - on his last day on the job - upheld a european commission order from 2004 and a resulting fine of 497 million euros -lrb- $ 688.84 million -rrb- for the software giant . the court said monday , sept .
17 , that the commission was correct in concluding that microsoft was guilty of monopoly abuse and took advantage of its dominance in the desktop computer market to bundle other products with the ubiquitous windows operating system . " the court observes that it is beyond dispute that in consequence of the tying , consumers are unable to acquire the windows operating system without simultaneously acquiring windows media player , " the court said . " in that regard , the court considers that neither the fact that microsoft does not charge a separate price for windows media player nor the fact that consumers are not obliged to use that media player is relevant . " an ongoing saga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft founder and chairman bill gates is not going to be happy about the court 's decision microsoft is likely to lodge an appeal with the europe 's highest tribunal , the european court of justice , and prolong the saga for at least another year .
immediately after the court 's decision was announced , however , microsoft 's general counsel refused to speculate on this issue . " i do n't want to talk about what will come next , " said brad smith in answer to questions about the possibility of an appeal .
" we need to read the ruling before we make any decision . " the eu commission ruled in 2004 - after a five-year probe - that microsoft was abusing its 95-percent share of the computer operating system market . the commission ordered the us-based multinational corporation to sell a version of their flagship windows operating system without a media player and to share technical information with competitors so that they could more easily create windows-compatible programs . calling the ruling an " important precedent , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said she wanted to see microsoft quickly changes its business practices and " comply fully " with the court 's judgment . " the commission will do its utmost to ensure that microsoft complies swiftly ...
i will not tolerate continued noncompliance , " she said . eu scores an important victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court 's ruling may have global implications on the it industry in its appeal , microsoft argued that it provided interoperability information that met current industry standards and that the commission was asking from it to divulge valuable trade secrets and copyrighted patents . the court 's unequivocal ruling against microsoft , however , may have important implications for the future operation of the global it industry . it is also an important validation for the european antitrust regulator , which prosecutes an increasing number of cases every year . european commission president jose manuel barroso said the ruling " confirms the objectivity and the credibility " of the eu 's approach to competition . in 2006 , the eu competition commission cached in a record amount of 1.85 billion euros in antitrust fines .
according to eu officials , the commission levied the same amount of fines against cartels in the first half of 2007 alone . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but , instead , the party base decided that its representatives in the german parliament must vote against continued use of the army in afghanistan if fighting was involved . while the decision can not actually affect germany 's current foreign policy - since chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government does not need opposition votes for a renewal of the troop 's mandate next month - it is indicative of the deep split which has developed within the greens . traditionally pacifist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leader joschka fischer was germany 's foreign minister under gerhard schröder the traditionally pacifist greens made a u-turn when it comes to german military operations abroad during their time in a coalition with social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder from 1998 to 2005 . the decision to support german peacekeeping operations abroad has divided the party ever since . " i still believe this was the right thing to do and we will stand by our responsibility , " bütikofer said of the deployment at the congress , amid heckling and booing by delegates . a turning point for the greens rejecting the expected renewal of the troops ' mandate in afghanistan , the rank-and-file members of the green party effectively reversed the controversial changes in foreign policy that were ushered in by schröder 's foreign minister and former green party leader joschka fischer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's military presence in afghanistan has divided the green party " the result of the party congress marks the temporary end of a 10-year-long struggle over the pragmatist foreign policy course a la joschka fischer , " said political scientist hubert kleinert in an op-ed for the web site of the german weekly spiegel . " on the other hand , this also means , for the time being , the end of all speculations about a possible sharing of power in the federal government beyond the red-green coalition , " kleinert said , alluding to the speculations that the green party might form a coalition with merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- after the next elections . fdp leader guido westerwelle said the green party discredited itself as a potential coalition member in the future . " to those in the -lsb- christian democratic -rsb- union , who are still hoping for a black-green coalition , i can only say : ' have fun ! "
westerwelle told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , referring to the traditional color of the cdu . confident merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel wants the troops to stay in afghanistan rejecting criticism by some political leaders and opinion polls showing waning support for the german military presence in afghanistan , merkel said on saturday she wanted the troops ' mandate to be extended . " there is no alternative , " merkel said in her weekly video podcast .
" this military commitment is important for those who live in afghanistan but also for the security and freedom of german citizens . " germany currently has some 3,000 troops deployed in northern afghanistan as part of the nato-lead international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de design -pipe- 17.09.2007 german design guru discusses peace , purpose and pollution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rams : " design carries responsibility " as the head designer at german electronics and household appliance manufacturer braun from the early-1960s until 1995 , dieter rams was one of the most influential product designers in the 20th century . rams created a functionalist language based on ten principles of good design , which he summed up in the credo " less but better . "
many of the elegant , rigorous objects he created for braun were iconic ; their success helped cement germany 's reputation as a maker of sleek , well-crafted electronics and household goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers compare the braun et 44 calculator to the iphone even today , young designers continue to copy rams ' products and adhere to his design principles . industry watchers of late have enjoyed pointing out similarities between rams ' creations in the 1960s and 70s , and consumer electronics created by apple - another company that places a strong emphasis on product design . dw-world.de spoke with rams , now 75 , when he attended the 16th braun prize awards , a biennial contest honoring young design talent . dw-world.de : mr. rams , what do you think about all the claims that apple is using your designs as inspiration for some of its most popular products , like the ipod , iphone , or g5 ? dieter rams : i like to take it as a compliment ! many people consider your designs for braun the epitome of ‘ german design . '
is there still a german design language ? i have always said , there is no explicit german design .
german design always wanted to be international design .
starting with bauhaus , they called it international design .
the ulm school of design called their style international design .
in contrast to scandinavia , where they talked about scandinavian design , we did n't want our design to be connected with the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even pre-rams , braun had a modern look .
the sk-sk 2/1 radio , 1955 .
and especially at braun , from the beginning , -lsb- company founders -rsb- erwin and arthur braun did n't want a particularly " german " design .
we fought for it to be known as braun design .
it was supposed to be general . are you saying you consider yourself more european than german ? i 've never seen myself as really german .
i mean , germany is my homeland , ok .
but i 'm neither nationalistic nor any " istic " i 'm against all " isms . " we have to start thinking about how to work together - and not only in europe .
it 's hard , because each country wants to put its own interests in the foreground .
but we have to hold together worldwide .
otherwise i do n't see any other possibility for us to achieve a unified culture , not to mention a unified , peaceful world . but some people say it is important for german business to play up its design reputation , as a way of standing out in the international economy .
the country even funds federal and state design centers to promote the field … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lighter , designed by rams of course , it is important .
i was president of the german design council myself , for a long time .
and i always fought for political support for design in germany . … if you had this political background , then of course you could establish an identity - the way companies have a visual identity . countries are , in a sense , companies .
they compete against one another , they have rivalries .
sadly , we still can not manage to find a common denominator , or even to agree on which direction we should start moving in .
and i hope , very much , that it will be possible someday , through design . world peace through design ? design in terms of industrial design , and not where it is sort of heading now , as a lifestyle instrument .
good design has nothing to do with lifestyle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plexiglas covered hi-fis were a famous rams innovation i do n't want to criticize living well - i 'm glad to be doing well .
but " lifestyle " and " wellness " have nothing to do with our day-to-day culture .
our everyday culture should be taken more seriously .
and design has - or should have - the responsibility of taking our culture , responsibly , out into the wider world . the people who are in charge of doing this are product designers , together with the companies they work for , and - although that is the part i really think is missing - politicians .
especially if we see individual countries as businesses .
which , in effect , they are . how much is personal contentment related to the objects that surround us ? i 'm happy if i get a good night 's sleep , have positive thoughts , and stay healthy .
at my age you have to think about these things a bit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braun clock designed by dietrich lubs but of course , lots of things bother me , and i have overlooked a lot of them intentionally .
it 's funny , the psychological chaos and destruction in our world is widely recognized .
it is constantly discussed , mulled over , described , written about .
what never gets discussed or written about is the visual destruction of our environment . for example , do we need windmills littering the countryside , when we do n't even know if they could still be technically improved ?
they make a lot of noise .
or trash removal , with all the green , blue , yellow bags that litter the streets .
these things are visual pollution .
and we do n't deal with it . one of your famous design principles is that design should be concerned with the environment .
how so ? it may sound a bit banal , but i would love to see the day when the world is a more beautiful place , when we honor the nature around us .
but we are stomping on it .
we are ruining our host , mother earth .
and we are n't even aware we are doing it .
we 're leaving it to the next generation to take care of it .
and i think that 's the place we need to start … i do n't know if humanity will make it , ultimately .
i can only say that perhaps design - with the few nice things that are sometimes created - can offer a few rays of hope so that things can look better for this planet we are just visiting . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the debate raises important issues , even if it 's motivated by political maneuvering , observers say . politicians of all stripes have taken the opportunity to comment on german defense minster franz josef jung 's statement to focus magazine on sunday , sept .
16 , that he would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane , though such an order has been ruled illegal by germany 's highest court . leaders from the opposition greens have called for his dismissal or at least for public chastisement while his colleagues in christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have tended to back him up by calling for a re-examination of constitutional questions in the face of a modern terrorist threat . also on sunday , interior minister wolfgang schäuble said the risk of a terror attack remains high in germany , and that the country is " in the sights of islamist terrorism . " berlin senator urges end to ' ghost debate ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military jets forced a small plane circiling downtown frankfurt to land safely in 2003 schäuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung that experts were convinced extremists would one day attack with nuclear weapons . " many experts are convinced that it is a question of when , not if , " he said . his comments came in the wake of events of the past weeks , after security officials arrested three men who apparently were planning terror attacks on the us ramstein air base and other targets .
the suspects were not found to be in possession of any radioactive material . schäuble has recently called for added power to be given to police in the fight against terrorism , including the right for authorities to conduct covert online searches of terror suspects ' computers . despite this month 's terror arrests , berlin interior senator erhart körting called the cacophony of remarks for stricter antiterrorism measures , particularly shooting down hijacked planes , to be a " ghost debate . " the german constitutional court 's decision in 2006 outlawing such an action made jung 's point moot , he said . " we should concentrate on what is possible under our constitution , " he said in an interview with the dpa news agency . real issue more politics than security ? guido steinberg , a senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs , agreed that the media discussion involved more political jockeying ahead of elections in 2009 than any real changes to german security policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble reminded germans of the terror threat posed to the country " the debate has more to do with the coalition than with the topic itself , " he said .
" i think the -lsb- cdu politicians -rsb- are trying to push the spd to get into position for the next election . they are provoking them . " the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and cdu have been partners in a " grand coalition " since 2005 , when angela merkel took germany 's helm as the head of the cdu .
both jung and schäuble are cdu members . that the spd and greens were initially responsible for the law they 've recently come out against " makes their response right now all the more interesting , " steinberg said .
germany enacted the now-repealed law under former chancellor gerhard schröder after the sept .
11 , 2001 terror attacks in the united states . " no pilot would shoot down a plane " despite jung 's comments , a defense minister no longer has the right to decide whether to shoot down a hijacked aircraft , steinberg said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers agreed that pilots would not follow an order to shoot down a passenger plane " since the law was deemed unconstitutional , the pilot knows shooting down such a plane would be illegal - even if he were following orders , " steinberg said .
" so now he would be assuming legal responsibility himself .
no pilot would do this . " that 's the reason the head of the german federal armed forces association , bernhard gertz , warned pilots against pulling the trigger . " i advise -lsb- pilots -rsb- not to carry out an order to shoot , no matter who gives it , " he said in an interview with the tagesspeigel newspaper . a question of ideology if the minister ca n't give the order and no pilot would follow it , why raise the issue at all ?
according to steinberg , the parties have a long-term ideological motive .
the christian conservatives would like to see the armed forces become involved in fighting terrorism within the country - a stance the spd opposes and is currently not permitted by the constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a construction flaw kept bombs from exploding on two german trains in august 2006 " this debate over how to fight terrorism has been going on , in earnest , since last winter or last spring , " steinberg said .
" it is ideological .
the spd believes in political approaches , the conservatives want the military to play a role . " germans not convinced of terror threat although there is no indication that terrorists are planning major attacks , steinberg said he thinks germans are not completely aware of the danger terrorists pose , and added that while schäuble 's warning of an eventual nuclear attack overdramatized the situation , it was not necessarily far off the mark . only luck has prevented a terrorist attack in germany and the possibility of a terror group trying to set off a radiation-carrying " dirty bomb " sometime in the future is not at all unlikely , he said . but future terrorist activity " is likely to be less sophisticated , " steinberg said .
" attacks on subways , trains and so on .
not futuristic stuff . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , and played a crucial role in the second as germany picked themselves up from the disappointing 0-0 draw against england on friday to make it into the last eight .
germany , who hit a record 11 goals in their first match against argentina , took control of the game in the opening minutes , cutting through japan 's defense and bombarding the goal with shots .
forward petra wimbersky should have scored in the third minute , latching onto a pass inside the area , but goalkeeper miho fukumoto just tipped the thundering shot over the bar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prinz grabbed a hat-trick in the 11-0 win over argentina kerstin garefrekes fired off a missile two minutes later that went high , and came close near half-time when her shot was blocked by a charging fukumoto , who was under pressure to keep her team in the match .
but it was prinz who did the damage , lurking on the edge of the penalty box to meet renate lingor 's corner which she rifled into the net on her second touch with 21 minutes gone . the goal propelled prinz , playing in her fourth world cup , into the history books by surpassing retired american player michelle akers as the most prolific world cup scorer with 13 goals .
german coach silvia neid brought on 19-year-old sensation fatmire bajramaj to add penetration in the second half , but the germans could not break down japan 's increasingly dogged defense .
the second goal came just three minutes from the end .
a flowing move from germany ended in a foul on martina müller in the penalty box and lingor secured victory by coolly converting the resulting penalty .
victorious germany looking for another level neid was full of praise for her players after the match . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's players march on into the last eight " i 'm very happy with the performance of our team , we reached the quarter finals and that 's what we were aiming for , " she told reporters .
" we played well against a strong opponent and we created a lot of chances .
nevertheless , in the quarter-final , we have to add a little bit to our performance , because we will face a very tough opponent . "
germany ended the cup 's first stage on top of group a with seven points and will play the runner-up in group b , likely to be north korea , on saturday .
england add more misery to argentina germany were joined in the last eight by england , who thumped south american champions argentina 6-1 .
kelly smith scored twice in the rout which signaled the end of a nightmare tournament for argentina , who conceded 18 goals in total and scored just one .
star striker smith pounced in the 64th and the 77th minute to bring her world cup tally to four goals in three games and ensure england made the last eight for the first time since 1995 .
the game got off to the worst possible start for argentina when captain eva gonzalez scored an own goal in the ninth minute .
then jill scott pounced barely 60 seconds later with a long-range effort to put england a well-deserved 2-0 up at half time .
the south americans then gave away two penalties and had catalina perez sent off - the first red card of the championships - leaving them in all sorts of trouble .
fara williams converted the first penalty kick in the 50th minute , smith scored her brace and then substitute vicky exley added another from the spot on 90 minutes .
" the girls were magnificent and we are really pleased , " said england coach hope powell .
" it was our target to get out of the group .
we have achieved that .
we now move on to the next stage . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
asked what the worst was , he replied , " it is war . "
kouchner said there was " no greater crisis today " than that over tehran 's developing nuclear program . " we will not accept that this -lrb- nuclear -rrb- bomb will be built , " he declared . " we must negotiate right to the end " with iran , kouchner added , but underlined that if tehran possessed an atomic weapon , it would represent " a real danger for the whole world . " room for negotiation remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner warned the world must be prepared for war in a bid to play down the controversy , french prime minister francois fillon said monday , sept .
17 , that tensions with iran were " extreme " but insisted there was still room for diplomacy in the nuclear stand-off . " everything must be done to avoid war , " fillon told reporters .
" the iranians must understand that tension has reached an extreme point . " while saying that kouchner was right to call the situation with iran dangerous , fillon added that a confrontation was " the last option that any political leader would want . " the french foreign minister called on the european union to impose economic sanctions on tehran outside of those imposed by the united nations . " these would be european sanctions that each country , individually , must put in place with its own banking , commercial and industrial system , " kouchner said .
france takes a hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fillon said tensions with iran were now " extreme " the french foreign minister 's statement follows what appears to be a new hard line from france on dealing with iran . as part of the eu troika along with germany and britain , france led europe 's diplomatic efforts to convince iran to stop its uranium enrichment program , which some believe is being used in the development of nuclear weapons .
while the troika suffered a number of setbacks at the negotiating table , it was seen as the main diplomatic front in averting conflict with iran .
however , since president nicolas sarkozy 's election victory in may , france has been keen to flex its muscles .
sarkozy himself warned in an aug .
27 speech that the iranian nuclear crisis presented the world with " a catastrophic alternative : an iranian bomb or the bombing of iran . " iran : west always chooses confrontation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aghazadeh condemned france 's behavior iran responded with outrage to kouchner 's statement . " it seems that the french foreign minister has forgotten the policy of the european union , " foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini said in a statement .
" the use of such words creates tensions and is contrary to the cultural history and civilization of france . " iranian vice-president reza aghazadeh , who is also the head of iran 's atomic energy organization , told the un 's international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- that western countries " have always chosen the path of confrontation instead of the path of understanding and cordial relations . " " the great nation of iran has recorded your discriminatory behavior and performance in its memory and will not forget , " he added . germany will continue to support france france 's european partners appeared divided over the french statement .
germany said monday that it would continue to work closely with france and its other allies to avert the threat of a nuclear-armed iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european governments want to prevent iran from building nuclear weapons the french government was correct in its assessment that " there are all the elements of a very serious obligation on the international community and that we must do everything possible to ensure that iran does not become nuclear armed , " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in berlin .

17 , and played a crucial role in the second as germany picked themselves up from the disappointing 0-0 draw against england on friday to make it into the last eight .
germany , who hit a record 11 goals in their first match against argentina , took control of the game in the opening minutes , cutting through japan 's defense and bombarding the goal with shots .
forward petra wimbersky should have scored in the third minute , latching onto a pass inside the area , but goalkeeper miho fukumoto just tipped the thundering shot over the bar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prinz grabbed a hat-trick in the 11-0 win over argentina kerstin garefrekes fired off a missile two minutes later that went high , and came close near half-time when her shot was blocked by a charging fukumoto , who was under pressure to keep her team in the match .
but it was prinz who did the damage , lurking on the edge of the penalty box to meet renate lingor 's corner which she rifled into the net on her second touch with 21 minutes gone . the goal propelled prinz , playing in her fourth world cup , into the history books by surpassing retired american player michelle akers as the most prolific world cup scorer with 13 goals .
german coach silvia neid brought on 19-year-old sensation fatmire bajramaj to add penetration in the second half , but the germans could not break down japan 's increasingly dogged defense .
the second goal came just three minutes from the end .
a flowing move from germany ended in a foul on martina müller in the penalty box and lingor secured victory by coolly converting the resulting penalty .
victorious germany looking for another level neid was full of praise for her players after the match . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's players march on into the last eight " i 'm very happy with the performance of our team , we reached the quarter finals and that 's what we were aiming for , " she told reporters .
" we played well against a strong opponent and we created a lot of chances .
nevertheless , in the quarter-final , we have to add a little bit to our performance , because we will face a very tough opponent . "
germany ended the cup 's first stage on top of group a with seven points and will play the runner-up in group b , likely to be north korea , on saturday .
england add more misery to argentina germany were joined in the last eight by england , who thumped south american champions argentina 6-1 .
kelly smith scored twice in the rout which signaled the end of a nightmare tournament for argentina , who conceded 18 goals in total and scored just one .
star striker smith pounced in the 64th and the 77th minute to bring her world cup tally to four goals in three games and ensure england made the last eight for the first time since 1995 .
the game got off to the worst possible start for argentina when captain eva gonzalez scored an own goal in the ninth minute .
then jill scott pounced barely 60 seconds later with a long-range effort to put england a well-deserved 2-0 up at half time .
the south americans then gave away two penalties and had catalina perez sent off - the first red card of the championships - leaving them in all sorts of trouble .
fara williams converted the first penalty kick in the 50th minute , smith scored her brace and then substitute vicky exley added another from the spot on 90 minutes .
" the girls were magnificent and we are really pleased , " said england coach hope powell .
" it was our target to get out of the group .

17 , and played a crucial role in the second as germany picked themselves up from the disappointing 0-0 draw against england on friday to make it into the last eight .
germany , who hit a record 11 goals in their first match against argentina , took control of the game in the opening minutes , cutting through japan 's defense and bombarding the goal with shots .
forward petra wimbersky should have scored in the third minute , latching onto a pass inside the area , but goalkeeper miho fukumoto just tipped the thundering shot over the bar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prinz grabbed a hat-trick in the 11-0 win over argentina kerstin garefrekes fired off a missile two minutes later that went high , and came close near half-time when her shot was blocked by a charging fukumoto , who was under pressure to keep her team in the match .
but it was prinz who did the damage , lurking on the edge of the penalty box to meet renate lingor 's corner which she rifled into the net on her second touch with 21 minutes gone . the goal propelled prinz , playing in her fourth world cup , into the history books by surpassing retired american player michelle akers as the most prolific world cup scorer with 13 goals .

the second goal came just three minutes from the end .
a flowing move from germany ended in a foul on martina müller in the penalty box and lingor secured victory by coolly converting the resulting penalty .

" but , instead , the party base decided that its representatives in the german parliament must vote against continued use of the army in afghanistan if fighting was involved . while the decision can not actually affect germany 's current foreign policy - since chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government does not need opposition votes for a renewal of the troop 's mandate next month - it is indicative of the deep split which has developed within the greens . traditionally pacifist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leader joschka fischer was germany 's foreign minister under gerhard schröder the traditionally pacifist greens made a u-turn when it comes to german military operations abroad during their time in a coalition with social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder from 1998 to 2005 . the decision to support german peacekeeping operations abroad has divided the party ever since . " i still believe this was the right thing to do and we will stand by our responsibility , " bütikofer said of the deployment at the congress , amid heckling and booing by delegates . a turning point for the greens rejecting the expected renewal of the troops ' mandate in afghanistan , the rank-and-file members of the green party effectively reversed the controversial changes in foreign policy that were ushered in by schröder 's foreign minister and former green party leader joschka fischer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's military presence in afghanistan has divided the green party " the result of the party congress marks the temporary end of a 10-year-long struggle over the pragmatist foreign policy course a la joschka fischer , " said political scientist hubert kleinert in an op-ed for the web site of the german weekly spiegel . " on the other hand , this also means , for the time being , the end of all speculations about a possible sharing of power in the federal government beyond the red-green coalition , " kleinert said , alluding to the speculations that the green party might form a coalition with merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- after the next elections . fdp leader guido westerwelle said the green party discredited itself as a potential coalition member in the future .

but the debate raises important issues , even if it 's motivated by political maneuvering , observers say . politicians of all stripes have taken the opportunity to comment on german defense minster franz josef jung 's statement to focus magazine on sunday , sept .
16 , that he would give the command to shoot down a hijacked passenger plane , though such an order has been ruled illegal by germany 's highest court . leaders from the opposition greens have called for his dismissal or at least for public chastisement while his colleagues in christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have tended to back him up by calling for a re-examination of constitutional questions in the face of a modern terrorist threat . also on sunday , interior minister wolfgang schäuble said the risk of a terror attack remains high in germany , and that the country is " in the sights of islamist terrorism . " berlin senator urges end to ' ghost debate ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : military jets forced a small plane circiling downtown frankfurt to land safely in 2003 schäuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung that experts were convinced extremists would one day attack with nuclear weapons . " many experts are convinced that it is a question of when , not if , " he said . his comments came in the wake of events of the past weeks , after security officials arrested three men who apparently were planning terror attacks on the us ramstein air base and other targets .
the suspects were not found to be in possession of any radioactive material . schäuble has recently called for added power to be given to police in the fight against terrorism , including the right for authorities to conduct covert online searches of terror suspects ' computers . despite this month 's terror arrests , berlin interior senator erhart körting called the cacophony of remarks for stricter antiterrorism measures , particularly shooting down hijacked planes , to be a " ghost debate . " the german constitutional court 's decision in 2006 outlawing such an action made jung 's point moot , he said . " we should concentrate on what is possible under our constitution , " he said in an interview with the dpa news agency . real issue more politics than security ? guido steinberg , a senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs , agreed that the media discussion involved more political jockeying ahead of elections in 2009 than any real changes to german security policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble reminded germans of the terror threat posed to the country " the debate has more to do with the coalition than with the topic itself , " he said .
" i think the -lsb- cdu politicians -rsb- are trying to push the spd to get into position for the next election . they are provoking them . " the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and cdu have been partners in a " grand coalition " since 2005 , when angela merkel took germany 's helm as the head of the cdu .
both jung and schäuble are cdu members . that the spd and greens were initially responsible for the law they 've recently come out against " makes their response right now all the more interesting , " steinberg said .
germany enacted the now-repealed law under former chancellor gerhard schröder after the sept .
11 , 2001 terror attacks in the united states . " no pilot would shoot down a plane " despite jung 's comments , a defense minister no longer has the right to decide whether to shoot down a hijacked aircraft , steinberg said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers agreed that pilots would not follow an order to shoot down a passenger plane " since the law was deemed unconstitutional , the pilot knows shooting down such a plane would be illegal - even if he were following orders , " steinberg said .

kouchner said there was " no greater crisis today " than that over tehran 's developing nuclear program . " we will not accept that this -lrb- nuclear -rrb- bomb will be built , " he declared .

" the iranians must understand that tension has reached an extreme point . " while saying that kouchner was right to call the situation with iran dangerous , fillon added that a confrontation was " the last option that any political leader would want . " the french foreign minister called on the european union to impose economic sanctions on tehran outside of those imposed by the united nations . " these would be european sanctions that each country , individually , must put in place with its own banking , commercial and industrial system , " kouchner said .
france takes a hard line bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fillon said tensions with iran were now " extreme " the french foreign minister 's statement follows what appears to be a new hard line from france on dealing with iran . as part of the eu troika along with germany and britain , france led europe 's diplomatic efforts to convince iran to stop its uranium enrichment program , which some believe is being used in the development of nuclear weapons .
while the troika suffered a number of setbacks at the negotiating table , it was seen as the main diplomatic front in averting conflict with iran .

" " the great nation of iran has recorded your discriminatory behavior and performance in its memory and will not forget , " he added . germany will continue to support france france 's european partners appeared divided over the french statement .
germany said monday that it would continue to work closely with france and its other allies to avert the threat of a nuclear-armed iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european governments want to prevent iran from building nuclear weapons the french government was correct in its assessment that " there are all the elements of a very serious obligation on the international community and that we must do everything possible to ensure that iran does not become nuclear armed , " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in berlin .
german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger added that he did not regard kouchner 's statements as a " threat of war . " germany and france were currently cooperating on a third resolution to be placed before the un security council on applying additional sanctions to iran to compel it to halt its nuclear weapons program , he said .
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said that the netherlands would support eu sanctions if the un security council failed to agree on new measures but would not be drawn on any talk of military intervention .

17 , and played a crucial role in the second as germany picked themselves up from the disappointing 0-0 draw against england on friday to make it into the last eight .
germany , who hit a record 11 goals in their first match against argentina , took control of the game in the opening minutes , cutting through japan 's defense and bombarding the goal with shots .
forward petra wimbersky should have scored in the third minute , latching onto a pass inside the area , but goalkeeper miho fukumoto just tipped the thundering shot over the bar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prinz grabbed a hat-trick in the 11-0 win over argentina kerstin garefrekes fired off a missile two minutes later that went high , and came close near half-time when her shot was blocked by a charging fukumoto , who was under pressure to keep her team in the match .
but it was prinz who did the damage , lurking on the edge of the penalty box to meet renate lingor 's corner which she rifled into the net on her second touch with 21 minutes gone . the goal propelled prinz , playing in her fourth world cup , into the history books by surpassing retired american player michelle akers as the most prolific world cup scorer with 13 goals .

18 , on measures to strengthen border controls in a bid to reduce the number of illegal entries to the bloc each year , but the question of funding will be paramount to any decisions taken . according to a draft document by the portuguese presidency , the justice and home affairs -lrb- jha -rrb- council will " encourage " governments to " cooperate , " " share responsibilities " and provide " support " to fellow member states , such as malta , that are struggling to prevent the seemingly unstoppable tide of would-be immigrants who depart from ports in north africa and enter the eu after crossing the mediterranean sea . however , frontex , the recently-established eu agency tasked with coordinating member states ' border security , is unlikely to get any additional money to carry out its work . eu governments believe that the responsibility for the control of external borders lies with individual member states and have accordingly granted a budget of just 40 million euros -lrb- $ 55 million -rrb- to the warsaw-based agency . equipment received less than equipment pledged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontex could have even less funding in the future some of the eu 's 27 member states , including germany and italy , have pledged to provide equipment to frontex .
but many of the total of 21 airplanes , 27 helicopters and more than 100 boats pledged to frontex are assumed to not yet be at the agency 's disposal . the eu 's justice and interior ministers consider the reinforcing of the bloc 's southern maritime borders as a high priority because of the numerous reports over the summer months about would-be immigrants drowning during their ill-fated voyages across the mediterranean sea . experts say most of the illegal aliens who penetrate so-called " fortress europe " - possibly as many as 500,000 per year , according to the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- - are believed to do so through the bloc 's sketchily patrolled eastern land border or by simply catching a plane and entering the eu on a temporary tourist visa . schengen agreement topics also on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schengen is aimed at easing border controls within europe along with efforts to increase border controls in the fight against illegal immigrants , the day-long meeting will also involve discussions on the schengen agreement allowing the abolition of systematic border controls between participating countries , the state of play of shared data among participating countries - the so-called schengen information system - and on the exchange of people 's fingerprints and biometric data .
a total of 15 countries have so far implemented schengen - including non-eu states iceland , norway and switzerland .
nine new eu member states - the czech republic , estonia , latvia , lithuania , hungary , malta , poland , slovenia and slovakia - have started using the schengen information system as of sept .
1 , and the portuguese presidency hopes that ministers meeting in brussels will agree to abolish passport controls at airports for passengers traveling to and from these nine countries as of march 2008 .
unrelated thorny issues expected to feature issues that are not on tuesday 's official agenda , but which threaten to hijack it , include polish opposition to a european day against the death penalty , which has been scheduled for oct .
10 and which warsaw would like to widen to include abortion and euthanasia . the mandate and profile of a new eu anti-terrorism coordinator is also likely to be a hot topic at the meeting .

german defense minister franz josef jung said he would give the order to shoot down a plane that has been hijacked for an attack , despite a ruling by the country 's constitutional court banning such action . " if there were no other way , i would give the order to shoot it down to protect our people , " jung told focus magazine , according to an advance extract from its monday , sept .
17 issue , which was made available on sunday .
in 2006 , germany 's highest court scrapped a controversial law allowing the military to shoot down civilian planes suspected of being hijacked for terrorist attacks .
it ruled that the law was an infringement on the right to life and the right to human dignity .
" but if there is a common danger or the democratic order is in danger , other rules apply , " jung said .
" i would like a clarification of the constitutional law , but there is still no consensus in the coalition -lrb- government -rrb- on this point .
therefore , in an emergency , i need to have recourse to a method that goes above the law . "
minister above the law ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earlier this month , germany arrested three islamic terrorists jung ' statements triggered a storm of criticism from other german politicians .
social democratic domestic policy expert dieter wiefelspütz criticized the minister for " openly counting on a breach of constitution " , while left party politician petra pau accused him of " playing god . "
a former vice president of the german parliament , burkhard hirsch , of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said " this was the first time in the history of the federal republic of germany that a minister openly declares he would disregard the ruling of the constitutional court and order that a crime be committed , if he deems it right . "
support for jung 's radical view came from members of his own - and chancellor merkel 's - conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" in our current legal situation , that is really in the end his decision , " cdu defense expert bernd siebert told kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
" and in the situation which he described , he would have to act accordingly .
" franz josef jung has our full support , " siebert said .
terrorist threats remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he wants tougher security measures : wolfgang schäuble earlier this month , germany arrested three men - two german converts to islam and a turkish muslim - accused of planning " massive " terrorist attacks , possibly on us military facilities in the country .
but interior minister wolfgang schäuble said in a sunday newspaper that the risk of a terrorist attack remained high despite the arrests of these men .
" the terrorist threat has not diminished , " schäuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper .
" i am no less worried since the arrests .
we know that we are in the sights of islamist terrorism . "
schäuble said experts were convinced that extremists would one day attack with nuclear weapons .
" many experts are convinced that it is a question of when , not if , " he said .
" there 's no point in spoiling the time that we have left by getting hysterical about the end of the world beforehand . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.09.2007 microsoft loses eu antitrust appeal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court ruled that microsoft is not giving customers a choice europe 's second-highest court dismissed microsoft 's appeal against a 2004 eu antitrust decision in a landmark victory for the european antitrust regulator .
the us company said it 's still considering its next move . the 13 judges of the court of first instance , led by bo vesterdorf - on his last day on the job - upheld a european commission order from 2004 and a resulting fine of 497 million euros -lrb- $ 688.84 million -rrb- for the software giant . the court said monday , sept .
17 , that the commission was correct in concluding that microsoft was guilty of monopoly abuse and took advantage of its dominance in the desktop computer market to bundle other products with the ubiquitous windows operating system . " the court observes that it is beyond dispute that in consequence of the tying , consumers are unable to acquire the windows operating system without simultaneously acquiring windows media player , " the court said . " in that regard , the court considers that neither the fact that microsoft does not charge a separate price for windows media player nor the fact that consumers are not obliged to use that media player is relevant . " an ongoing saga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft founder and chairman bill gates is not going to be happy about the court 's decision microsoft is likely to lodge an appeal with the europe 's highest tribunal , the european court of justice , and prolong the saga for at least another year .
immediately after the court 's decision was announced , however , microsoft 's general counsel refused to speculate on this issue . " i do n't want to talk about what will come next , " said brad smith in answer to questions about the possibility of an appeal .
" we need to read the ruling before we make any decision .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de design -pipe- 17.09.2007 german design guru discusses peace , purpose and pollution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rams : " design carries responsibility " as the head designer at german electronics and household appliance manufacturer braun from the early-1960s until 1995 , dieter rams was one of the most influential product designers in the 20th century . rams created a functionalist language based on ten principles of good design , which he summed up in the credo " less but better . "
many of the elegant , rigorous objects he created for braun were iconic ; their success helped cement germany 's reputation as a maker of sleek , well-crafted electronics and household goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers compare the braun et 44 calculator to the iphone even today , young designers continue to copy rams ' products and adhere to his design principles . industry watchers of late have enjoyed pointing out similarities between rams ' creations in the 1960s and 70s , and consumer electronics created by apple - another company that places a strong emphasis on product design . dw-world.de spoke with rams , now 75 , when he attended the 16th braun prize awards , a biennial contest honoring young design talent . dw-world.de : mr. rams , what do you think about all the claims that apple is using your designs as inspiration for some of its most popular products , like the ipod , iphone , or g5 ? dieter rams : i like to take it as a compliment ! many people consider your designs for braun the epitome of ‘ german design . '
is there still a german design language ? i have always said , there is no explicit german design .
german design always wanted to be international design .
starting with bauhaus , they called it international design .
the ulm school of design called their style international design .
in contrast to scandinavia , where they talked about scandinavian design , we did n't want our design to be connected with the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even pre-rams , braun had a modern look .
the sk-sk 2/1 radio , 1955 .
and especially at braun , from the beginning , -lsb- company founders -rsb- erwin and arthur braun did n't want a particularly " german " design .
we fought for it to be known as braun design .
it was supposed to be general . are you saying you consider yourself more european than german ? i 've never seen myself as really german .
i mean , germany is my homeland , ok .
but i 'm neither nationalistic nor any " istic " i 'm against all " isms . " we have to start thinking about how to work together - and not only in europe .
it 's hard , because each country wants to put its own interests in the foreground .
but we have to hold together worldwide .
otherwise i do n't see any other possibility for us to achieve a unified culture , not to mention a unified , peaceful world . but some people say it is important for german business to play up its design reputation , as a way of standing out in the international economy .
the country even funds federal and state design centers to promote the field … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lighter , designed by rams of course , it is important .
i was president of the german design council myself , for a long time .
and i always fought for political support for design in germany . … if you had this political background , then of course you could establish an identity - the way companies have a visual identity . countries are , in a sense , companies .
they compete against one another , they have rivalries .
sadly , we still can not manage to find a common denominator , or even to agree on which direction we should start moving in .
and i hope , very much , that it will be possible someday , through design . world peace through design ? design in terms of industrial design , and not where it is sort of heading now , as a lifestyle instrument .
good design has nothing to do with lifestyle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plexiglas covered hi-fis were a famous rams innovation i do n't want to criticize living well - i 'm glad to be doing well .
but " lifestyle " and " wellness " have nothing to do with our day-to-day culture .
our everyday culture should be taken more seriously .
and design has - or should have - the responsibility of taking our culture , responsibly , out into the wider world . the people who are in charge of doing this are product designers , together with the companies they work for , and - although that is the part i really think is missing - politicians .
especially if we see individual countries as businesses .
which , in effect , they are . how much is personal contentment related to the objects that surround us ? i 'm happy if i get a good night 's sleep , have positive thoughts , and stay healthy .
at my age you have to think about these things a bit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braun clock designed by dietrich lubs but of course , lots of things bother me , and i have overlooked a lot of them intentionally .
it 's funny , the psychological chaos and destruction in our world is widely recognized .
it is constantly discussed , mulled over , described , written about .
what never gets discussed or written about is the visual destruction of our environment . for example , do we need windmills littering the countryside , when we do n't even know if they could still be technically improved ?
they make a lot of noise .
or trash removal , with all the green , blue , yellow bags that litter the streets .
these things are visual pollution .
and we do n't deal with it . one of your famous design principles is that design should be concerned with the environment .
how so ? it may sound a bit banal , but i would love to see the day when the world is a more beautiful place , when we honor the nature around us .
but we are stomping on it .
we are ruining our host , mother earth .
and we are n't even aware we are doing it .
we 're leaving it to the next generation to take care of it .
and i think that 's the place we need to start … i do n't know if humanity will make it , ultimately .
i can only say that perhaps design - with the few nice things that are sometimes created - can offer a few rays of hope so that things can look better for this planet we are just visiting . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german defense minister franz josef jung said he would give the order to shoot down a plane that has been hijacked for an attack , despite a ruling by the country 's constitutional court banning such action . " if there were no other way , i would give the order to shoot it down to protect our people , " jung told focus magazine , according to an advance extract from its monday , sept .
17 issue , which was made available on sunday .
in 2006 , germany 's highest court scrapped a controversial law allowing the military to shoot down civilian planes suspected of being hijacked for terrorist attacks .
it ruled that the law was an infringement on the right to life and the right to human dignity .
" but if there is a common danger or the democratic order is in danger , other rules apply , " jung said .
" i would like a clarification of the constitutional law , but there is still no consensus in the coalition -lrb- government -rrb- on this point .
therefore , in an emergency , i need to have recourse to a method that goes above the law . "
minister above the law ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earlier this month , germany arrested three islamic terrorists jung ' statements triggered a storm of criticism from other german politicians .
social democratic domestic policy expert dieter wiefelspütz criticized the minister for " openly counting on a breach of constitution " , while left party politician petra pau accused him of " playing god . "
a former vice president of the german parliament , burkhard hirsch , of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said " this was the first time in the history of the federal republic of germany that a minister openly declares he would disregard the ruling of the constitutional court and order that a crime be committed , if he deems it right . "
support for jung 's radical view came from members of his own - and chancellor merkel 's - conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" in our current legal situation , that is really in the end his decision , " cdu defense expert bernd siebert told kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
" and in the situation which he described , he would have to act accordingly .
" franz josef jung has our full support , " siebert said .
terrorist threats remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he wants tougher security measures : wolfgang schäuble earlier this month , germany arrested three men - two german converts to islam and a turkish muslim - accused of planning " massive " terrorist attacks , possibly on us military facilities in the country .
but interior minister wolfgang schäuble said in a sunday newspaper that the risk of a terrorist attack remained high despite the arrests of these men .
" the terrorist threat has not diminished , " schäuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper .
" i am no less worried since the arrests .
we know that we are in the sights of islamist terrorism . "
schäuble said experts were convinced that extremists would one day attack with nuclear weapons .
" many experts are convinced that it is a question of when , not if , " he said .
" there 's no point in spoiling the time that we have left by getting hysterical about the end of the world beforehand . "
schäuble has been under fire in germany for pushing for a tougher security policy that would allow the indefinite detention and " targeted killing " of terror suspects . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german defense minister franz josef jung said he would give the order to shoot down a plane that has been hijacked for an attack , despite a ruling by the country 's constitutional court banning such action .

in 2006 , germany 's highest court scrapped a controversial law allowing the military to shoot down civilian planes suspected of being hijacked for terrorist attacks .
it ruled that the law was an infringement on the right to life and the right to human dignity .
" but if there is a common danger or the democratic order is in danger , other rules apply , " jung said .
" i would like a clarification of the constitutional law , but there is still no consensus in the coalition -lrb- government -rrb- on this point .
therefore , in an emergency , i need to have recourse to a method that goes above the law . "

"
many of the elegant , rigorous objects he created for braun were iconic ; their success helped cement germany 's reputation as a maker of sleek , well-crafted electronics and household goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers compare the braun et 44 calculator to the iphone even today , young designers continue to copy rams ' products and adhere to his design principles . industry watchers of late have enjoyed pointing out similarities between rams ' creations in the 1960s and 70s , and consumer electronics created by apple - another company that places a strong emphasis on product design . dw-world.de spoke with rams , now 75 , when he attended the 16th braun prize awards , a biennial contest honoring young design talent . dw-world.de : mr. rams , what do you think about all the claims that apple is using your designs as inspiration for some of its most popular products , like the ipod , iphone , or g5 ? dieter rams : i like to take it as a compliment ! many people consider your designs for braun the epitome of ‘ german design . '
is there still a german design language ? i have always said , there is no explicit german design .
german design always wanted to be international design .
starting with bauhaus , they called it international design .
the ulm school of design called their style international design .
in contrast to scandinavia , where they talked about scandinavian design , we did n't want our design to be connected with the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even pre-rams , braun had a modern look .
the sk-sk 2/1 radio , 1955 .
and especially at braun , from the beginning , -lsb- company founders -rsb- erwin and arthur braun did n't want a particularly " german " design .
we fought for it to be known as braun design .
it was supposed to be general . are you saying you consider yourself more european than german ? i 've never seen myself as really german .
i mean , germany is my homeland , ok .
but i 'm neither nationalistic nor any " istic " i 'm against all " isms . " we have to start thinking about how to work together - and not only in europe .
it 's hard , because each country wants to put its own interests in the foreground .
but we have to hold together worldwide .
otherwise i do n't see any other possibility for us to achieve a unified culture , not to mention a unified , peaceful world . but some people say it is important for german business to play up its design reputation , as a way of standing out in the international economy .
the country even funds federal and state design centers to promote the field … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lighter , designed by rams of course , it is important .
i was president of the german design council myself , for a long time .
and i always fought for political support for design in germany . … if you had this political background , then of course you could establish an identity - the way companies have a visual identity . countries are , in a sense , companies .
they compete against one another , they have rivalries .
sadly , we still can not manage to find a common denominator , or even to agree on which direction we should start moving in .
and i hope , very much , that it will be possible someday , through design . world peace through design ? design in terms of industrial design , and not where it is sort of heading now , as a lifestyle instrument .
good design has nothing to do with lifestyle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plexiglas covered hi-fis were a famous rams innovation i do n't want to criticize living well - i 'm glad to be doing well .
but " lifestyle " and " wellness " have nothing to do with our day-to-day culture .
our everyday culture should be taken more seriously .
and design has - or should have - the responsibility of taking our culture , responsibly , out into the wider world . the people who are in charge of doing this are product designers , together with the companies they work for , and - although that is the part i really think is missing - politicians .
especially if we see individual countries as businesses .
which , in effect , they are . how much is personal contentment related to the objects that surround us ? i 'm happy if i get a good night 's sleep , have positive thoughts , and stay healthy .
at my age you have to think about these things a bit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braun clock designed by dietrich lubs but of course , lots of things bother me , and i have overlooked a lot of them intentionally .
it 's funny , the psychological chaos and destruction in our world is widely recognized .
it is constantly discussed , mulled over , described , written about .
what never gets discussed or written about is the visual destruction of our environment . for example , do we need windmills littering the countryside , when we do n't even know if they could still be technically improved ?
they make a lot of noise .
or trash removal , with all the green , blue , yellow bags that litter the streets .
these things are visual pollution .
and we do n't deal with it . one of your famous design principles is that design should be concerned with the environment .
how so ? it may sound a bit banal , but i would love to see the day when the world is a more beautiful place , when we honor the nature around us .
but we are stomping on it .
we are ruining our host , mother earth .
and we are n't even aware we are doing it .
we 're leaving it to the next generation to take care of it .
and i think that 's the place we need to start … i do n't know if humanity will make it , ultimately .
i can only say that perhaps design - with the few nice things that are sometimes created - can offer a few rays of hope so that things can look better for this planet we are just visiting . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
many of the elegant , rigorous objects he created for braun were iconic ; their success helped cement germany 's reputation as a maker of sleek , well-crafted electronics and household goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers compare the braun et 44 calculator to the iphone even today , young designers continue to copy rams ' products and adhere to his design principles . industry watchers of late have enjoyed pointing out similarities between rams ' creations in the 1960s and 70s , and consumer electronics created by apple - another company that places a strong emphasis on product design . dw-world.de spoke with rams , now 75 , when he attended the 16th braun prize awards , a biennial contest honoring young design talent . dw-world.de : mr. rams , what do you think about all the claims that apple is using your designs as inspiration for some of its most popular products , like the ipod , iphone , or g5 ? dieter rams : i like to take it as a compliment ! many people consider your designs for braun the epitome of ‘ german design . '
is there still a german design language ? i have always said , there is no explicit german design .
german design always wanted to be international design .
starting with bauhaus , they called it international design .
the ulm school of design called their style international design .
in contrast to scandinavia , where they talked about scandinavian design , we did n't want our design to be connected with the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even pre-rams , braun had a modern look .
the sk-sk 2/1 radio , 1955 .
and especially at braun , from the beginning , -lsb- company founders -rsb- erwin and arthur braun did n't want a particularly " german " design .
we fought for it to be known as braun design .
it was supposed to be general . are you saying you consider yourself more european than german ? i 've never seen myself as really german .
i mean , germany is my homeland , ok .
but i 'm neither nationalistic nor any " istic " i 'm against all " isms . " we have to start thinking about how to work together - and not only in europe .
it 's hard , because each country wants to put its own interests in the foreground .
but we have to hold together worldwide .
otherwise i do n't see any other possibility for us to achieve a unified culture , not to mention a unified , peaceful world . but some people say it is important for german business to play up its design reputation , as a way of standing out in the international economy .
the country even funds federal and state design centers to promote the field … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lighter , designed by rams of course , it is important .
i was president of the german design council myself , for a long time .
and i always fought for political support for design in germany . … if you had this political background , then of course you could establish an identity - the way companies have a visual identity . countries are , in a sense , companies .
they compete against one another , they have rivalries .
sadly , we still can not manage to find a common denominator , or even to agree on which direction we should start moving in .
and i hope , very much , that it will be possible someday , through design . world peace through design ? design in terms of industrial design , and not where it is sort of heading now , as a lifestyle instrument .
good design has nothing to do with lifestyle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plexiglas covered hi-fis were a famous rams innovation i do n't want to criticize living well - i 'm glad to be doing well .
but " lifestyle " and " wellness " have nothing to do with our day-to-day culture .
our everyday culture should be taken more seriously .
and design has - or should have - the responsibility of taking our culture , responsibly , out into the wider world . the people who are in charge of doing this are product designers , together with the companies they work for , and - although that is the part i really think is missing - politicians .
especially if we see individual countries as businesses .
which , in effect , they are . how much is personal contentment related to the objects that surround us ? i 'm happy if i get a good night 's sleep , have positive thoughts , and stay healthy .
at my age you have to think about these things a bit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braun clock designed by dietrich lubs but of course , lots of things bother me , and i have overlooked a lot of them intentionally .
it 's funny , the psychological chaos and destruction in our world is widely recognized .
it is constantly discussed , mulled over , described , written about .
what never gets discussed or written about is the visual destruction of our environment . for example , do we need windmills littering the countryside , when we do n't even know if they could still be technically improved ?
they make a lot of noise .
or trash removal , with all the green , blue , yellow bags that litter the streets .
these things are visual pollution .
and we do n't deal with it . one of your famous design principles is that design should be concerned with the environment .
how so ? it may sound a bit banal , but i would love to see the day when the world is a more beautiful place , when we honor the nature around us .
but we are stomping on it .
we are ruining our host , mother earth .
and we are n't even aware we are doing it .
we 're leaving it to the next generation to take care of it .
and i think that 's the place we need to start … i do n't know if humanity will make it , ultimately .
i can only say that perhaps design - with the few nice things that are sometimes created - can offer a few rays of hope so that things can look better for this planet we are just visiting . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german defense minister franz josef jung said he would give the order to shoot down a plane that has been hijacked for an attack , despite a ruling by the country 's constitutional court banning such action . " if there were no other way , i would give the order to shoot it down to protect our people , " jung told focus magazine , according to an advance extract from its monday , sept .
17 issue , which was made available on sunday .
in 2006 , germany 's highest court scrapped a controversial law allowing the military to shoot down civilian planes suspected of being hijacked for terrorist attacks .
it ruled that the law was an infringement on the right to life and the right to human dignity .
" but if there is a common danger or the democratic order is in danger , other rules apply , " jung said .
" i would like a clarification of the constitutional law , but there is still no consensus in the coalition -lrb- government -rrb- on this point .
therefore , in an emergency , i need to have recourse to a method that goes above the law . "
minister above the law ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earlier this month , germany arrested three islamic terrorists jung ' statements triggered a storm of criticism from other german politicians .
social democratic domestic policy expert dieter wiefelspütz criticized the minister for " openly counting on a breach of constitution " , while left party politician petra pau accused him of " playing god . "
a former vice president of the german parliament , burkhard hirsch , of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said " this was the first time in the history of the federal republic of germany that a minister openly declares he would disregard the ruling of the constitutional court and order that a crime be committed , if he deems it right . "
support for jung 's radical view came from members of his own - and chancellor merkel 's - conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" in our current legal situation , that is really in the end his decision , " cdu defense expert bernd siebert told kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
" and in the situation which he described , he would have to act accordingly .
" franz josef jung has our full support , " siebert said .
terrorist threats remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he wants tougher security measures : wolfgang schäuble earlier this month , germany arrested three men - two german converts to islam and a turkish muslim - accused of planning " massive " terrorist attacks , possibly on us military facilities in the country .
but interior minister wolfgang schäuble said in a sunday newspaper that the risk of a terrorist attack remained high despite the arrests of these men .
" the terrorist threat has not diminished , " schäuble told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper .
" i am no less worried since the arrests .
we know that we are in the sights of islamist terrorism . "
schäuble said experts were convinced that extremists would one day attack with nuclear weapons .
" many experts are convinced that it is a question of when , not if , " he said .
" there 's no point in spoiling the time that we have left by getting hysterical about the end of the world beforehand . "
schäuble has been under fire in germany for pushing for a tougher security policy that would allow the indefinite detention and " targeted killing " of terror suspects . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de design -pipe- 17.09.2007 german design guru discusses peace , purpose and pollution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rams : " design carries responsibility " as the head designer at german electronics and household appliance manufacturer braun from the early-1960s until 1995 , dieter rams was one of the most influential product designers in the 20th century . rams created a functionalist language based on ten principles of good design , which he summed up in the credo " less but better . "
many of the elegant , rigorous objects he created for braun were iconic ; their success helped cement germany 's reputation as a maker of sleek , well-crafted electronics and household goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers compare the braun et 44 calculator to the iphone even today , young designers continue to copy rams ' products and adhere to his design principles . industry watchers of late have enjoyed pointing out similarities between rams ' creations in the 1960s and 70s , and consumer electronics created by apple - another company that places a strong emphasis on product design . dw-world.de spoke with rams , now 75 , when he attended the 16th braun prize awards , a biennial contest honoring young design talent . dw-world.de : mr. rams , what do you think about all the claims that apple is using your designs as inspiration for some of its most popular products , like the ipod , iphone , or g5 ? dieter rams : i like to take it as a compliment ! many people consider your designs for braun the epitome of ‘ german design . '
is there still a german design language ? i have always said , there is no explicit german design .
german design always wanted to be international design .
starting with bauhaus , they called it international design .
the ulm school of design called their style international design .
in contrast to scandinavia , where they talked about scandinavian design , we did n't want our design to be connected with the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even pre-rams , braun had a modern look .
the sk-sk 2/1 radio , 1955 .
and especially at braun , from the beginning , -lsb- company founders -rsb- erwin and arthur braun did n't want a particularly " german " design .
we fought for it to be known as braun design .
it was supposed to be general . are you saying you consider yourself more european than german ? i 've never seen myself as really german .
i mean , germany is my homeland , ok .
but i 'm neither nationalistic nor any " istic " i 'm against all " isms . " we have to start thinking about how to work together - and not only in europe .
it 's hard , because each country wants to put its own interests in the foreground .
but we have to hold together worldwide .
otherwise i do n't see any other possibility for us to achieve a unified culture , not to mention a unified , peaceful world . but some people say it is important for german business to play up its design reputation , as a way of standing out in the international economy .
the country even funds federal and state design centers to promote the field … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lighter , designed by rams of course , it is important .
i was president of the german design council myself , for a long time .
and i always fought for political support for design in germany . … if you had this political background , then of course you could establish an identity - the way companies have a visual identity . countries are , in a sense , companies .
they compete against one another , they have rivalries .
sadly , we still can not manage to find a common denominator , or even to agree on which direction we should start moving in .
and i hope , very much , that it will be possible someday , through design . world peace through design ? design in terms of industrial design , and not where it is sort of heading now , as a lifestyle instrument .
good design has nothing to do with lifestyle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plexiglas covered hi-fis were a famous rams innovation i do n't want to criticize living well - i 'm glad to be doing well .
but " lifestyle " and " wellness " have nothing to do with our day-to-day culture .
our everyday culture should be taken more seriously .
and design has - or should have - the responsibility of taking our culture , responsibly , out into the wider world . the people who are in charge of doing this are product designers , together with the companies they work for , and - although that is the part i really think is missing - politicians .

"
many of the elegant , rigorous objects he created for braun were iconic ; their success helped cement germany 's reputation as a maker of sleek , well-crafted electronics and household goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers compare the braun et 44 calculator to the iphone even today , young designers continue to copy rams ' products and adhere to his design principles . industry watchers of late have enjoyed pointing out similarities between rams ' creations in the 1960s and 70s , and consumer electronics created by apple - another company that places a strong emphasis on product design . dw-world.de spoke with rams , now 75 , when he attended the 16th braun prize awards , a biennial contest honoring young design talent . dw-world.de : mr. rams , what do you think about all the claims that apple is using your designs as inspiration for some of its most popular products , like the ipod , iphone , or g5 ? dieter rams : i like to take it as a compliment ! many people consider your designs for braun the epitome of ‘ german design . '
is there still a german design language ? i have always said , there is no explicit german design .
german design always wanted to be international design .
starting with bauhaus , they called it international design .
the ulm school of design called their style international design .
in contrast to scandinavia , where they talked about scandinavian design , we did n't want our design to be connected with the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even pre-rams , braun had a modern look .
the sk-sk 2/1 radio , 1955 .
and especially at braun , from the beginning , -lsb- company founders -rsb- erwin and arthur braun did n't want a particularly " german " design .
we fought for it to be known as braun design .
it was supposed to be general . are you saying you consider yourself more european than german ? i 've never seen myself as really german .
i mean , germany is my homeland , ok .
but i 'm neither nationalistic nor any " istic " i 'm against all " isms . " we have to start thinking about how to work together - and not only in europe .
it 's hard , because each country wants to put its own interests in the foreground .
but we have to hold together worldwide .
otherwise i do n't see any other possibility for us to achieve a unified culture , not to mention a unified , peaceful world . but some people say it is important for german business to play up its design reputation , as a way of standing out in the international economy .
the country even funds federal and state design centers to promote the field … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lighter , designed by rams of course , it is important .
i was president of the german design council myself , for a long time .
and i always fought for political support for design in germany . … if you had this political background , then of course you could establish an identity - the way companies have a visual identity . countries are , in a sense , companies .
they compete against one another , they have rivalries .
sadly , we still can not manage to find a common denominator , or even to agree on which direction we should start moving in .
and i hope , very much , that it will be possible someday , through design . world peace through design ? design in terms of industrial design , and not where it is sort of heading now , as a lifestyle instrument .
good design has nothing to do with lifestyle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plexiglas covered hi-fis were a famous rams innovation i do n't want to criticize living well - i 'm glad to be doing well .
but " lifestyle " and " wellness " have nothing to do with our day-to-day culture .
our everyday culture should be taken more seriously .
and design has - or should have - the responsibility of taking our culture , responsibly , out into the wider world . the people who are in charge of doing this are product designers , together with the companies they work for , and - although that is the part i really think is missing - politicians .
especially if we see individual countries as businesses .
which , in effect , they are . how much is personal contentment related to the objects that surround us ? i 'm happy if i get a good night 's sleep , have positive thoughts , and stay healthy .
at my age you have to think about these things a bit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braun clock designed by dietrich lubs but of course , lots of things bother me , and i have overlooked a lot of them intentionally .

german defense minister franz josef jung said he would give the order to shoot down a plane that has been hijacked for an attack , despite a ruling by the country 's constitutional court banning such action . " if there were no other way , i would give the order to shoot it down to protect our people , " jung told focus magazine , according to an advance extract from its monday , sept .

in 2006 , germany 's highest court scrapped a controversial law allowing the military to shoot down civilian planes suspected of being hijacked for terrorist attacks .
it ruled that the law was an infringement on the right to life and the right to human dignity .
" but if there is a common danger or the democratic order is in danger , other rules apply , " jung said .
" i would like a clarification of the constitutional law , but there is still no consensus in the coalition -lrb- government -rrb- on this point .
therefore , in an emergency , i need to have recourse to a method that goes above the law . "

"
many of the elegant , rigorous objects he created for braun were iconic ; their success helped cement germany 's reputation as a maker of sleek , well-crafted electronics and household goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers compare the braun et 44 calculator to the iphone even today , young designers continue to copy rams ' products and adhere to his design principles . industry watchers of late have enjoyed pointing out similarities between rams ' creations in the 1960s and 70s , and consumer electronics created by apple - another company that places a strong emphasis on product design . dw-world.de spoke with rams , now 75 , when he attended the 16th braun prize awards , a biennial contest honoring young design talent . dw-world.de : mr. rams , what do you think about all the claims that apple is using your designs as inspiration for some of its most popular products , like the ipod , iphone , or g5 ? dieter rams : i like to take it as a compliment ! many people consider your designs for braun the epitome of ‘ german design . '
is there still a german design language ? i have always said , there is no explicit german design .
german design always wanted to be international design .
starting with bauhaus , they called it international design .
the ulm school of design called their style international design .
in contrast to scandinavia , where they talked about scandinavian design , we did n't want our design to be connected with the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even pre-rams , braun had a modern look .
the sk-sk 2/1 radio , 1955 .
and especially at braun , from the beginning , -lsb- company founders -rsb- erwin and arthur braun did n't want a particularly " german " design .
we fought for it to be known as braun design .
it was supposed to be general . are you saying you consider yourself more european than german ? i 've never seen myself as really german .
i mean , germany is my homeland , ok .
but i 'm neither nationalistic nor any " istic " i 'm against all " isms . " we have to start thinking about how to work together - and not only in europe .
it 's hard , because each country wants to put its own interests in the foreground .
but we have to hold together worldwide .
otherwise i do n't see any other possibility for us to achieve a unified culture , not to mention a unified , peaceful world . but some people say it is important for german business to play up its design reputation , as a way of standing out in the international economy .
the country even funds federal and state design centers to promote the field … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lighter , designed by rams of course , it is important .
i was president of the german design council myself , for a long time .
and i always fought for political support for design in germany . … if you had this political background , then of course you could establish an identity - the way companies have a visual identity . countries are , in a sense , companies .
they compete against one another , they have rivalries .
sadly , we still can not manage to find a common denominator , or even to agree on which direction we should start moving in .
and i hope , very much , that it will be possible someday , through design . world peace through design ? design in terms of industrial design , and not where it is sort of heading now , as a lifestyle instrument .
good design has nothing to do with lifestyle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plexiglas covered hi-fis were a famous rams innovation i do n't want to criticize living well - i 'm glad to be doing well .
but " lifestyle " and " wellness " have nothing to do with our day-to-day culture .
our everyday culture should be taken more seriously .
and design has - or should have - the responsibility of taking our culture , responsibly , out into the wider world . the people who are in charge of doing this are product designers , together with the companies they work for , and - although that is the part i really think is missing - politicians .
especially if we see individual countries as businesses .
which , in effect , they are . how much is personal contentment related to the objects that surround us ? i 'm happy if i get a good night 's sleep , have positive thoughts , and stay healthy .
at my age you have to think about these things a bit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braun clock designed by dietrich lubs but of course , lots of things bother me , and i have overlooked a lot of them intentionally .
it 's funny , the psychological chaos and destruction in our world is widely recognized .
it is constantly discussed , mulled over , described , written about .
what never gets discussed or written about is the visual destruction of our environment . for example , do we need windmills littering the countryside , when we do n't even know if they could still be technically improved ?
they make a lot of noise .
or trash removal , with all the green , blue , yellow bags that litter the streets .
these things are visual pollution .
and we do n't deal with it . one of your famous design principles is that design should be concerned with the environment .
how so ? it may sound a bit banal , but i would love to see the day when the world is a more beautiful place , when we honor the nature around us .
but we are stomping on it .
we are ruining our host , mother earth .
and we are n't even aware we are doing it .
we 're leaving it to the next generation to take care of it .
and i think that 's the place we need to start … i do n't know if humanity will make it , ultimately .
i can only say that perhaps design - with the few nice things that are sometimes created - can offer a few rays of hope so that things can look better for this planet we are just visiting . interview : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german defense minister franz josef jung said he would give the order to shoot down a plane that has been hijacked for an attack , despite a ruling by the country 's constitutional court banning such action .

it ruled that the law was an infringement on the right to life and the right to human dignity .
" but if there is a common danger or the democratic order is in danger , other rules apply , " jung said .
" i would like a clarification of the constitutional law , but there is still no consensus in the coalition -lrb- government -rrb- on this point .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.09.2007 microsoft loses eu antitrust appeal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court ruled that microsoft is not giving customers a choice europe 's second-highest court dismissed microsoft 's appeal against a 2004 eu antitrust decision in a landmark victory for the european antitrust regulator .
the us company said it 's still considering its next move . the 13 judges of the court of first instance , led by bo vesterdorf - on his last day on the job - upheld a european commission order from 2004 and a resulting fine of 497 million euros -lrb- $ 688.84 million -rrb- for the software giant . the court said monday , sept .
17 , that the commission was correct in concluding that microsoft was guilty of monopoly abuse and took advantage of its dominance in the desktop computer market to bundle other products with the ubiquitous windows operating system . " the court observes that it is beyond dispute that in consequence of the tying , consumers are unable to acquire the windows operating system without simultaneously acquiring windows media player , " the court said . " in that regard , the court considers that neither the fact that microsoft does not charge a separate price for windows media player nor the fact that consumers are not obliged to use that media player is relevant . " an ongoing saga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft founder and chairman bill gates is not going to be happy about the court 's decision microsoft is likely to lodge an appeal with the europe 's highest tribunal , the european court of justice , and prolong the saga for at least another year .
immediately after the court 's decision was announced , however , microsoft 's general counsel refused to speculate on this issue . " i do n't want to talk about what will come next , " said brad smith in answer to questions about the possibility of an appeal .
" we need to read the ruling before we make any decision . " the eu commission ruled in 2004 - after a five-year probe - that microsoft was abusing its 95-percent share of the computer operating system market . the commission ordered the us-based multinational corporation to sell a version of their flagship windows operating system without a media player and to share technical information with competitors so that they could more easily create windows-compatible programs . calling the ruling an " important precedent , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said she wanted to see microsoft quickly changes its business practices and " comply fully " with the court 's judgment . " the commission will do its utmost to ensure that microsoft complies swiftly ...

17 , and played a crucial role in the second as germany picked themselves up from the disappointing 0-0 draw against england on friday to make it into the last eight .
germany , who hit a record 11 goals in their first match against argentina , took control of the game in the opening minutes , cutting through japan 's defense and bombarding the goal with shots .
forward petra wimbersky should have scored in the third minute , latching onto a pass inside the area , but goalkeeper miho fukumoto just tipped the thundering shot over the bar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prinz grabbed a hat-trick in the 11-0 win over argentina kerstin garefrekes fired off a missile two minutes later that went high , and came close near half-time when her shot was blocked by a charging fukumoto , who was under pressure to keep her team in the match .
but it was prinz who did the damage , lurking on the edge of the penalty box to meet renate lingor 's corner which she rifled into the net on her second touch with 21 minutes gone . the goal propelled prinz , playing in her fourth world cup , into the history books by surpassing retired american player michelle akers as the most prolific world cup scorer with 13 goals .
german coach silvia neid brought on 19-year-old sensation fatmire bajramaj to add penetration in the second half , but the germans could not break down japan 's increasingly dogged defense .
the second goal came just three minutes from the end .
a flowing move from germany ended in a foul on martina müller in the penalty box and lingor secured victory by coolly converting the resulting penalty .
victorious germany looking for another level neid was full of praise for her players after the match . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's players march on into the last eight " i 'm very happy with the performance of our team , we reached the quarter finals and that 's what we were aiming for , " she told reporters .
" we played well against a strong opponent and we created a lot of chances .
nevertheless , in the quarter-final , we have to add a little bit to our performance , because we will face a very tough opponent . "
germany ended the cup 's first stage on top of group a with seven points and will play the runner-up in group b , likely to be north korea , on saturday .
england add more misery to argentina germany were joined in the last eight by england , who thumped south american champions argentina 6-1 .
kelly smith scored twice in the rout which signaled the end of a nightmare tournament for argentina , who conceded 18 goals in total and scored just one .
star striker smith pounced in the 64th and the 77th minute to bring her world cup tally to four goals in three games and ensure england made the last eight for the first time since 1995 .
the game got off to the worst possible start for argentina when captain eva gonzalez scored an own goal in the ninth minute .
then jill scott pounced barely 60 seconds later with a long-range effort to put england a well-deserved 2-0 up at half time .
the south americans then gave away two penalties and had catalina perez sent off - the first red card of the championships - leaving them in all sorts of trouble .
fara williams converted the first penalty kick in the 50th minute , smith scored her brace and then substitute vicky exley added another from the spot on 90 minutes .
" the girls were magnificent and we are really pleased , " said england coach hope powell .
" it was our target to get out of the group .
we have achieved that .
we now move on to the next stage . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the body said 60 % of refugees have a further or higher education qualification but 64 % are unemployed .
a lack of language or computer skills as well as insufficient work experience in britain were highlighted as the main obstacles to employment .
of those questioned for the refugee skills audit report , 27 % had degrees .
before being forced to flee their home country , 78 % had been working for employers , were self-employed or in a family business .
" i was the owner of a large factory and had more than 100 people working for me before i had to give it all up and flee my country . "
refugee living in cardiff a total of 363 questionnaires were completed by refugees in cardiff , newport , swansea and wrexham .
they had been translated into kurdish , somali , arabic and french .
there are currently at least 10,000 refugees in wales , according to the wrc 's estimates .
eid ali ahmed , the wrc 's deputy chief executive , said : " the findings reveal disturbing levels of unemployment amongst refugee communities in wales , despite their being relatively highly qualified .
" we now need to work together to reverse this trend if our communities are to be truly inclusive and cohesive . "
following the questionnaires , focus groups which refugees helped organise and run , were held in the four areas of wales to discuss the findings in more depth .
nationalities questioned kurdish - 25 % somali - 18 % iranian - 12 % sudanese - 18 % eritrean - 8 % in cardiff , one refugee said : " i was the owner of a large factory and had more than 100 people working for me before i had to give it all up and flee my country .
" i lived very well and i could afford anything i wanted .
here i have to live off handouts and i ca n't get a job . "
one man had completed a masters degree in his home country , where all post-16 education is taught in english and based on the uk curriculum .
at all of the groups , lack of language and / or computer skills was highlighted as one of the top two barriers to getting work .
in newport and swansea , refugees said lack of work experience in britain was the main obstacle .
mike lewis , the wrc 's chief executive , said : " this report is the first of its kind in wales and demonstrates that refugees have a huge amount to offer the labour market here and across the uk . "
their aim , he said , was to break down barriers highlighted in the report , such as lack of esol -lrb- english for speakers of other languages -rrb- classes and non-recognition of overseas qualifications and experience .
recommendations the report makes a string of recommendation for the welsh assembly government , the uk government , job centre plus and other bodies .
among them are increasing the number of language classes and teachers and providing financial incentives for refugees setting up in business .
the report was complied as part of the wrc 's equal project which helps refugees to get into work , training and enterprise .
refugees who have found jobs or work experience through the project will tell their stories at monday 's conference .

after trailing the no side for the whole night , it was carmarthenshire that finally tipped the balance in favour of devolution by the narrowest of margins .
despite the small majority , it was without doubt a milestone in welsh history .
as the former welsh secretary ron davies famously claimed , devolution is a process , not an event .
while the referendum marked the end of the battle for devolved government , it was only the beginning of the story as far as the institution itself was concerned .
for the assembly , the early years were rocky , to say the least .
it 's a fair bet that it will be at least another decade before anything like a permanent constitutional settlement is reached the fratricidal infighting within labour following ron davies 's fall from grace left his replacement as welsh party leader , alun michael , leading a struggling minority government .
it was only when rhodri morgan took the top job that the welsh assembly began to grow into the body we know today .
that growth has been relentless and continual .
in pure cash terms , the welsh assembly government 's spending has ballooned since it was established and it now spends about £ 4,000 per head on every man , woman and child in wales .
much of that money would have been spent anyway , of course , on providing schools , hospitals and roads .
devolution milestones sept 1997 : wales votes to establish an assembly oct 1998 : welsh labour leader ron davies resigns may 1999 : assembly opens in cardiff bay feb 2000 : first assembly leader alun michael resigns ; rhodri morgan takes over 2000 - 2003 : labour in coalition with liberal democrats march 2006 : assembly debating chamber , the senedd , opened by the queen july 2006 : assembly gains new powers with government of wales act ; labour enters coalition with plaid cymru so has establishing the assembly made a difference to the way those services are delivered ?
certainly the way services are provided in wales and england has diverged increasingly over the past decade although , ironically , that 's more because of changes in england than anything that has happened in wales .
while the government in westminster has pressed ahead with radical reforms such as private sector involvement in the public services , foundation hospitals , city academies and the like , the assembly government has stuck with more traditional models .
comprehensive schools are n't regarded as " bog-standard " in wales - as alastair campbell , tony blair 's former communications chief once put it - but as the way forward , and private finance initiative -lrb- pfi -rrb- deals are very rare beasts .
cardiff bay has also adopted a series of measures designed to put " clear red water " - in rhodri morgan 's phrase - between wales and westminster .
some , such as free entry to museums and galleries , were later copied in england .
others , such as free bus travel for pensioners and the abolition of prescription charges , remain distinctively welsh .
yes campaigners literally jumped for joy following the final result like scotland , but unlike england , the assembly government has attempted wherever possible to re-open disused railways such as the vale of glamorgan and ebbw valley lines .
some promises have been trickier to deliver .
european rules have resulted in a messy compromise where the assembly government has made life easier financially for welsh students studying in wales but has been unable to help those who choose to study elsewhere .
whether the welsh model is superior to the english one is debatable .
but they are without doubt very different and that difference will grow as the assembly government begins to acquire the power to make laws granted to it under the latest government of wales act .
all of which may lead to a third devolution referendum four years from now , this time to decide whether the assembly should have full law-making powers like the scottish parliament .
even that probably would n't be the end of the story .
with an snp government in edinburgh pressing for independence and unresolved questions surrounding the status of england , it is a fair bet that it will be at least another decade before anything like a permanent constitutional settlement is reached .

after trailing the no side for the whole night , it was carmarthenshire that finally tipped the balance in favour of devolution by the narrowest of margins .
despite the small majority , it was without doubt a milestone in welsh history .
as the former welsh secretary ron davies famously claimed , devolution is a process , not an event .
while the referendum marked the end of the battle for devolved government , it was only the beginning of the story as far as the institution itself was concerned .
for the assembly , the early years were rocky , to say the least . "
it 's a fair bet that it will be at least another decade before anything like a permanent constitutional settlement is reached " the fratricidal infighting within labour following ron davies 's fall from grace left his replacement as welsh party leader , alun michael , leading a struggling minority government .
it was only when rhodri morgan took the top job that the welsh assembly began to grow into the body we know today .
that growth has been relentless and continual .
in pure cash terms , the welsh assembly government 's spending has ballooned since it was established and it now spends about £ 4,000 per head on every man , woman and child in wales .
much of that money would have been spent anyway , of course , on providing schools , hospitals and roads .
devolution milestones sept 1997 : wales votes to establish an assembly oct 1998 : welsh labour leader ron davies resigns may 1999 : assembly opens in cardiff bay feb 2000 : first assembly leader alun michael resigns ; rhodri morgan takes over 2000 - 2003 : labour in coalition with liberal democrats march 2006 : assembly debating chamber , the senedd , opened by the queen july 2006 : assembly gains new powers with government of wales act ; labour enters coalition with plaid cymru so has establishing the assembly made a difference to the way those services are delivered ?
certainly the way services are provided in wales and england has diverged increasingly over the past decade although , ironically , that 's more because of changes in england than anything that has happened in wales .
while the government in westminster has pressed ahead with radical reforms such as private sector involvement in the public services , foundation hospitals , city academies and the like , the assembly government has stuck with more traditional models .
comprehensive schools are n't regarded as " bog-standard " in wales - as alastair campbell , tony blair 's former communications chief once put it - but as the way forward , and private finance initiative -lrb- pfi -rrb- deals are very rare beasts .
cardiff bay has also adopted a series of measures designed to put " clear red water " - in rhodri morgan 's phrase - between wales and westminster .
some , such as free entry to museums and galleries , were later copied in england .
others , such as free bus travel for pensioners and the abolition of prescription charges , remain distinctively welsh .
like scotland , but unlike england , the assembly government has attempted wherever possible to re-open disused railways such as the vale of glamorgan and ebbw valley lines .
some promises have been trickier to deliver .
european rules have resulted in a messy compromise where the assembly government has made life easier financially for welsh students studying in wales but has been unable to help those who choose to study elsewhere .
whether the welsh model is superior to the english one is debatable .
but they are without doubt very different and that difference will grow as the assembly government begins to acquire the power to make laws granted to it under the latest government of wales act .
all of which may lead to a third devolution referendum four years from now , this time to decide whether the assembly should have full law-making powers like the scottish parliament .
even that probably would n't be the end of the story .
with an snp government in edinburgh pressing for independence and unresolved questions surrounding the status of england , it is a fair bet that it will be at least another decade before anything like a permanent constitutional settlement is reached .

as competition commissioner , she has three key responsibilities : taking action against price-fixing cartels , disallowing mergers that would restrict competition , and ensuring governments do not unfairly subsidise industry .
she almost did not get the job .
in 2004 , meps forced incoming commission president jose manuel barroso to drop his proposed justice commissioner , rocco buttiglione , and questioned loudly whether ms kroes was too close to the businesses she was set to police .
at the time , the former dutch transport minister was on the board of 12 companies , including volvo and the french defence group thales .
she had also worked as a lobbyist for lockheed-martin .
but mr barroso refused to withdraw the nomination and ms kroes survived a bruising parliamentary hearing , where her reputation was attacked by compatriot paul van buitenen , the one-time commission whistleblower turned mep .
record fines so she took up her job in the barroso commission in 2004 , having sold her shares and put her money in a blind trust , and having promised to take no part in cases involving the 30 or so companies she worked for during her business career .
she also vowed not to return to the private sector after leaving the commission .
but the idea that she would be too soft on business soon evaporated .
in 2007 , the european commission has imposed record fines on cartels , including the biggest-ever - of nearly 1bn euros -lrb- £ 0.69bn -rrb- - on four lift and escalator makers .
ms kroes has been one of the loudest voices in the commission calling for european energy giants such as e.on and gaz de france to be forced to sell off their distribution networks she has also been forced to deny pursuing a vendetta against microsoft after fining the company for failing to comply with demands made by her predecessor , mario monti , and warning that the vista operating system could fall foul of competition law .
after some tense months in 2006 , microsoft made changes to vista that ms kroes said left her a " happy woman " - but the disagreements over the monti ruling have only now come to a head .
neelie kroes -lrb- the first name rhymes with " daily " and the second with " mousse " -rrb- spent 11 years in government in the netherlands , seven of them as transport minister , representing the free-market liberal vvd party .
political instincts she spent the earlier part of her career in the family transport business , as a professor of transport at erasmus university in rotterdam , and as a member of the dutch parliament .
after leaving government in 1989 , following a short stint as an adviser to eu transport commissioner karel van miert , she became president of the nijenrode business school .
in that capacity , she presented an honorary degree to microsoft president bill gates in 1996 .
correspondents say ms kroes has sharper political instincts than her predecessor , mr monti , an academic economist and university president .
she is also more down-to-earth than her dutch predecessor on the commission and fellow vvd party member , frits bolkestein .
neither man would have been likely to invite members of the polish solidarity union for talks in brussels after they protested against eu rules restricting subsidies to the gdansk shipyard .
but she is not shy of upsetting big corporate interests , or even member states .
ms kroes has been one of the loudest voices in the commission calling for european energy giants such as e.on and gaz de france to be forced to sell off their distribution networks .
that is another battle that is just coming to a head , with heavyweights france and germany on the opposite side of the barricade .

as competition commissioner , she has three key responsibilities : taking action against price-fixing cartels , disallowing mergers that would restrict competition , and ensuring governments do not unfairly subsidise industry .
she almost did not get the job .
in 2004 , meps forced incoming commission president jose manuel barroso to drop his proposed justice commissioner , rocco buttiglione , and questioned loudly whether ms kroes was too close to the businesses she was set to police .
at the time , the former dutch transport minister was on the board of 12 companies , including volvo and the french defence group thales .
she had also worked as a lobbyist for lockheed-martin .
but mr barroso refused to withdraw the nomination and ms kroes survived a bruising parliamentary hearing , where her reputation was attacked by compatriot paul van buitenen , the one-time commission whistleblower turned mep .
record fines so she took up her job in the barroso commission in 2004 , having sold her shares and put her money in a blind trust , and having promised to take no part in cases involving the 30 or so companies she worked for during her business career .
she also vowed not to return to the private sector after leaving the commission .
but the idea that she would be too soft on business soon evaporated .
in 2007 , the european commission has imposed record fines on cartels , including the biggest-ever - of nearly 1bn euros -lrb- £ 0.69bn -rrb- - on four lift and escalator makers .
ms kroes has been one of the loudest voices in the commission calling for european energy giants such as e.on and gaz de france to be forced to sell off their distribution networks she has also been forced to deny pursuing a vendetta against microsoft after fining the company for failing to comply with demands made by her predecessor , mario monti , and warning that the vista operating system could fall foul of competition law .
after some tense months in 2006 , microsoft made changes to vista that ms kroes said left her a " happy woman " - but the disagreements over the monti ruling have only now come to a head .
neelie kroes -lrb- the first name rhymes with " daily " and the second with " mousse " -rrb- spent 11 years in government in the netherlands , seven of them as transport minister , representing the free-market liberal vvd party .
political instincts she spent the earlier part of her career in the family transport business , as a professor of transport at erasmus university in rotterdam , and as a member of the dutch parliament .
after leaving government in 1989 , following a short stint as an adviser to eu transport commissioner karel van miert , she became president of the nijenrode business school .
in that capacity , she presented an honorary degree to microsoft president bill gates in 1996 .
correspondents say ms kroes has sharper political instincts than her predecessor , mr monti , an academic economist and university president .
she is also more down-to-earth than her dutch predecessor on the commission and fellow vvd party member , frits bolkestein .
neither man would have been likely to invite members of the polish solidarity union for talks in brussels after they protested against eu rules restricting subsidies to the gdansk shipyard .

the two sides adjourned without agreement at 0300 local time -lrb- 0800 bst -rrb- and will resume later in the day .
a gm spokesman said that all employees were expected to report for work at their scheduled times on monday .
the talks are important because the uaw 's contracts with ford and chrysler will be based on the gm agreement .
the three detroit-based carmakers are trying to cut costs as they attempt to recover from combined losses of $ 15bn -lrb- £ 7.5bn -rrb- last year .
gm 's contract with the uaw was due to expire on friday night but has been extended hour by hour since then .
there was a danger that if no agreement could be reached , the union may instruct its members not to report for work on monday .
expensive benefits gm , ford and chrysler claim that their workers , on average , cost them more than $ 30 an hour more than toyota 's .
they want staff to give up some of their expensive benefits such as pensions and health insurance to improve their overall competitiveness .
any tentative agreement between gm and the uaw will have to be ratified by a majority of gm 's 73,000 hourly workers .
if no agreement can be reached , union leaders might tell their members to walk out , but they are seen as more likely to set a deadline for strike action some time in the future .

only five boroughs managed to meet mayor ken livingstone 's target of ensuring 50 % of all new homes were affordable , the report found .
wandsworth and bexley were the worst offenders with only 12 % and 15 % of homes being affordable , it said .
the report looked at the councils ' performances since 2004 .
the london plan , which sets the annual housing targets for councils , states at least half of all new houses built in every borough needs to be affordable and 70 % of this social housing has to be kept for rent .
both wandsworth and bexley councils have countered the figures in the report .
best and worst performers hammersmith and fulham - 82 % haringey - 63 % waltham forest - 54 % barking and dagenham - 54 % ealing - 52 % havering - 17 % greenwich - 17 % kingston-upon-thames - 16 % bexley -15 % wandsworth -12 % the charity adds that about 200,000 families were forced to live in overcrowded houses due to a shortage of suitable houses within their budget .
adam sampson , chief executive of shelter , said : " it is vital councils meet the targets set for affordable housing if hard working londoners are to have any chance of securing a decent home in the capital .
" the government has pledged to make housing a top priority which means local councils will need to work much harder to ensure they meet these targets and help address the capital 's growing housing crisis , " he said .
the charity said the five boroughs which managed to meet their 50 % targets were hammersmith and fulham , haringey , waltham forest , ealing and barking and dagenham .
the worst offenders were wandsworth , bexley , kingston-upon-thames , greenwich and havering .
dispute over figures a spokesman for wandsworth council said it was " 11th highest in building affordable homes , not the lowest . "
he said : " we have previously disputed the figures which have been previously quoted by the mayor and an analysis of gla 's -lrb- greater london authority -rrb- own database gives a much different picture . "
about 700 new affordable homes have been built in the past three years in wandsworth .
therefore 16 % of all new homes were affordable , the council said .
bexley council 's cabinet member for regeneration and housing , councillor john waters , said : " while we comply with statutory requirements , we have never accepted that a ' one-size-fits-all ' approach is correct for the whole of london .
" therefore the amount of affordable housing in bexley may well be less than 50 % . "
the council added that 42 % of all new buildings in the area were affordable homes .

only five boroughs managed to meet mayor ken livingstone 's target of ensuring 50 % of all new homes were affordable , the report found .
wandsworth and bexley were the worst offenders with only 12 % and 15 % of homes being affordable , it said .
the report looked at the councils ' performances since 2004 .
the london plan , which sets the annual housing targets for councils , states at least half of all new houses built in every borough needs to be affordable and 70 % of this social housing has to be kept for rent .
both wandsworth and bexley councils have countered the figures in the report .
best and worst performers hammersmith and fulham - 82 % haringey - 63 % waltham forest - 54 % barking and dagenham - 54 % ealing - 52 % havering - 17 % greenwich - 17 % kingston-upon-thames - 16 % bexley -15 % wandsworth -12 % the charity adds that about 200,000 families were forced to live in overcrowded houses due to a shortage of suitable houses within their budget .
adam sampson , chief executive of shelter , said : " it is vital councils meet the targets set for affordable housing if hard working londoners are to have any chance of securing a decent home in the capital .
" the government has pledged to make housing a top priority which means local councils will need to work much harder to ensure they meet these targets and help address the capital 's growing housing crisis , " he said .
the charity said the five boroughs which managed to meet their 50 % targets were hammersmith and fulham , haringey , waltham forest , ealing and barking and dagenham .
the worst offenders were wandsworth , bexley , kingston-upon-thames , greenwich and havering .
dispute over figures a spokesman for wandsworth council said it was " 11th highest in building affordable homes , not the lowest . "
he said : " we have previously disputed the figures which have been previously quoted by the mayor and an analysis of gla 's -lrb- greater london authority -rrb- own database gives a much different picture . "
about 700 new affordable homes have been built in the past three years in wandsworth .
therefore 16 % of all new homes were affordable , the council said .
bexley council 's cabinet member for regeneration and housing , councillor john waters , said : " while we comply with statutory requirements , we have never accepted that a ' one-size-fits-all ' approach is correct for the whole of london .
" therefore the amount of affordable housing in bexley may well be less than 50 % . "
the council added that 42 % of all new buildings in the area were affordable homes .

only five boroughs managed to meet mayor ken livingstone 's target of ensuring 50 % of all new homes were affordable , the report found .
wandsworth and bexley were the worst offenders with only 12 % and 15 % of homes being affordable , it said .
the report looked at the councils ' performances since 2004 .
the london plan , which sets the annual housing targets for councils , states at least half of all new houses built in every borough needs to be affordable and 70 % of this social housing has to be kept for rent .
both wandsworth and bexley councils have countered the figures in the report .
best and worst performers hammersmith and fulham - 82 % haringey - 63 % waltham forest - 54 % barking and dagenham - 54 % ealing - 52 % havering - 17 % greenwich - 17 % kingston-upon-thames - 16 % bexley -15 % wandsworth -12 % the charity adds that about 200,000 families were forced to live in overcrowded houses due to a shortage of suitable houses within their budget .
adam sampson , chief executive of shelter , said : " it is vital councils meet the targets set for affordable housing if hard working londoners are to have any chance of securing a decent home in the capital .
" the government has pledged to make housing a top priority which means local councils will need to work much harder to ensure they meet these targets and help address the capital 's growing housing crisis , " he said .
the charity said the five boroughs which managed to meet their 50 % targets were hammersmith and fulham , haringey , waltham forest , ealing and barking and dagenham .
the worst offenders were wandsworth , bexley , kingston-upon-thames , greenwich and havering .
dispute over figures a spokesman for wandsworth council said it was " 11th highest in building affordable homes , not the lowest . "
he said : " we have previously disputed the figures which have been previously quoted by the mayor and an analysis of gla 's -lrb- greater london authority -rrb- own database gives a much different picture . "
about 700 new affordable homes have been built in the past three years in wandsworth .
therefore 16 % of all new homes were affordable , the council said .
bexley council 's cabinet member for regeneration and housing , councillor john waters , said : " while we comply with statutory requirements , we have never accepted that a ' one-size-fits-all ' approach is correct for the whole of london .
" therefore the amount of affordable housing in bexley may well be less than 50 % . "
the council added that 42 % of all new buildings in the area were affordable homes .

the report said cyber crime had become increasingly professional and was now a multi-billion dollar industry .
the underground economy has its own auction sites and marketplaces that sell valuable data such as credit card numbers and bank accounts .
they also sell toolkits for novice cyber criminals who lack technical know-how to craft their own attacks .
boom times " we 're seeing a definite shift in terms of commercialisation , " said william beer , symantec 's european director of security practice .
" it 's being used by organised crime and it 's being used to launch their attacks .
" we have seen very focussed attacks that leverage very active commercial business on toolkits , " he told the bbc news website .
mr beer said symantec had seen the net 's underground economy enter a new phase in the last six months as those involved in it prospered . "
even the smallest bank has enough money " william beer , symantec one example of how it had grown could be found in the number of new malicious programs reported to symantec .
the 212,101 new threats reported during the first six months of 2007 was a 185 % increase over the previous six months .
the economy had rapidly become specialised and now every service a criminal needed to carry out attacks was widely available , said mr beer .
for instance , he said , many malicious hackers were using their technical skills to create tool kits that they then sold to those with the criminal know-how to carry out attacks .
evidence that these were being taken up enthusiastically , he said , could be found in the fact that three phishing toolkits were behind 42 % of all phishing attacks seen by symantec in the first six months of 2007 .
in addition , 86 % of all phishing websites were hosted on only 30 % of ip addresses known to be phishing websites , suggesting that some were cornering the market in looking after criminal sites .
more worryingly , said mr beer , were signs that different sections of the underground economy were starting to collaborate to improve their chances of catching people out .
hi-tech criminals with information culled from job sites , online games or social networking sites were teaming up with phishing gangs and spammers , said mr beer .
the end result was well-crafted e-mail campaigns that gained a gloss of credibility by combining several different bits of data .
often , he said , these targeted attacks were aimed at the customers of smaller financial institutions .
" attention has gone away from the larger banks down to credit unions and small banks that do not have the people and resources to fight off the attacks , " he said .
" even the smallest bank has enough money , " said mr beer .
