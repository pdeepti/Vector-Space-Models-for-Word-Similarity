the increase is not expected to hurt the german economy , which has shown strong growth rates in 2007 . the last-minute agreement between the union and employers averted a strike .
the deal was reached during 20 hours of negotiations with employers in the south german state of baden-würtenberg , but will be applied across germany .
besides the 4.1 percent raise this year , workers can expect an additional 1.7 percent a year later .
workers will also receive payments of 400 euros for the last two months before the agreement goes into effect on june 1 .
initially , the metalworkers ' union ig metall demanded a 6.5 percent increase .
employers countered with a 2.5 percent increase and a 0.5 percent bonus .
analysts said the agreement was positive for both employer and workers .
it is not likely to worry european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- policymakers concerned about risks to price stability .
" the wage rise has come in lower than generally expected , " said eckart tuchtfeld , an economist at commerzbank in frankfurt , told reuters .
" ecb fears of excessive wage pressure in germany and the resulting risk to inflation should ease as a result . "
" fears that wages would rise excessively did n't come true , " said stefan bielmeier , an economist at frankfurt-based deutsche bank ag , told the bloomberg news service .
" we stick to our estimate that ecb interest rates will rise to 4 percent in june and no further afterwards . "
economists have been closely watching the ig metall negotiations , with many fearful that handing out big pay hikes could slow germany 's economic growth .
stefan bielmeier at deutsche bank said the deal would equal a wage increase of 3.5 percent for 2007 in a country where inflation is currently just below two percent .
" that means the sector will remain competitive , " he told reuters .
" it also means more purchasing power for employees .
both together are good for the economy . "
union pleased with deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german metalworkers last launched a strike in 2002 " a nice sum of money will be going into the wallets of employees , " said negotiator jörg hofmann .
the union had put pressure on employers with temporary work stoppages and had threatened to strike if a deal was not reached quickly .
" i think it was very important for firms to avoid strikes , because business is booming just now and they 've been racking up huge amounts of orders , " bernd weidensteiner at dz bank told reuters .
" full-scale industrial action would have been poison for firms , so if you look at it from that perspective , they 've gotten off pretty lightly , " he said .
in 2002 , more than 200,000 ig metall union members participated in strikes .
carmakers daimlerchrysler , porsche and audi , truck maker man and french-american telecoms equipment company alcatel-lucent are among firms which faced work stoppages this year .
economy continues to boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers wanted a wage increase of more than 5 percent employers had wanted to keep the pay raise under 4 percent , but did n't complain after the deal was announced friday .
" it is balanced and appropriate given that the economy is doing exceptionally well , " said stefan roell , who represented the state of baden-württemberg in the talks .
after years of gloom , the german government last month raised its growth forecast for 2007 to 2.3 percent , representing a clear improvement on its previous prediction of 1.7 percent .
consumer sentiment and business confidence indices in the euro zone 's biggest economy have also shown sharp rises recently . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powerful unions launch warning strikes with more to come thousands of workers downed tools after the ig metall trade union called strikes to step up pressure for wage talks in the electrical , engineering and metalworking sectors .

according to baetzing , the use of soft drugs is becoming more and more acceptable in the german society . " the relaxed view of everyday drugs like tobacco , alcohol and prescription drugs in particular leads to immeasurable , often silent and unnoticed suffering for those addicted , " she said .

the increase is not expected to hurt the german economy , which has shown strong growth rates in 2007 . the last-minute agreement between the union and employers averted a strike .
the deal was reached during 20 hours of negotiations with employers in the south german state of baden-würtenberg , but will be applied across germany .
besides the 4.1 percent raise this year , workers can expect an additional 1.7 percent a year later .
workers will also receive payments of 400 euros for the last two months before the agreement goes into effect on june 1 .
initially , the metalworkers ' union ig metall demanded a 6.5 percent increase .
employers countered with a 2.5 percent increase and a 0.5 percent bonus .
analysts said the agreement was positive for both employer and workers .
it is not likely to worry european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- policymakers concerned about risks to price stability .
" the wage rise has come in lower than generally expected , " said eckart tuchtfeld , an economist at commerzbank in frankfurt , told reuters .
" ecb fears of excessive wage pressure in germany and the resulting risk to inflation should ease as a result . "
" fears that wages would rise excessively did n't come true , " said stefan bielmeier , an economist at frankfurt-based deutsche bank ag , told the bloomberg news service .
" we stick to our estimate that ecb interest rates will rise to 4 percent in june and no further afterwards . "
economists have been closely watching the ig metall negotiations , with many fearful that handing out big pay hikes could slow germany 's economic growth .
stefan bielmeier at deutsche bank said the deal would equal a wage increase of 3.5 percent for 2007 in a country where inflation is currently just below two percent .
" that means the sector will remain competitive , " he told reuters .
" it also means more purchasing power for employees .
both together are good for the economy . "
union pleased with deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german metalworkers last launched a strike in 2002 " a nice sum of money will be going into the wallets of employees , " said negotiator jörg hofmann .
the union had put pressure on employers with temporary work stoppages and had threatened to strike if a deal was not reached quickly .
" i think it was very important for firms to avoid strikes , because business is booming just now and they 've been racking up huge amounts of orders , " bernd weidensteiner at dz bank told reuters .
" full-scale industrial action would have been poison for firms , so if you look at it from that perspective , they 've gotten off pretty lightly , " he said .
in 2002 , more than 200,000 ig metall union members participated in strikes .
carmakers daimlerchrysler , porsche and audi , truck maker man and french-american telecoms equipment company alcatel-lucent are among firms which faced work stoppages this year .
economy continues to boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers wanted a wage increase of more than 5 percent employers had wanted to keep the pay raise under 4 percent , but did n't complain after the deal was announced friday .
" it is balanced and appropriate given that the economy is doing exceptionally well , " said stefan roell , who represented the state of baden-württemberg in the talks .
after years of gloom , the german government last month raised its growth forecast for 2007 to 2.3 percent , representing a clear improvement on its previous prediction of 1.7 percent .
consumer sentiment and business confidence indices in the euro zone 's biggest economy have also shown sharp rises recently . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powerful unions launch warning strikes with more to come thousands of workers downed tools after the ig metall trade union called strikes to step up pressure for wage talks in the electrical , engineering and metalworking sectors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 04.05.2007 german metalworkers win pay hike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metalworkers demonstrated for higher wagers germany 's powerful ig metall union won a 4.1 percent pay raise for its 3.4 million members .
the increase is not expected to hurt the german economy , which has shown strong growth rates in 2007 . the last-minute agreement between the union and employers averted a strike .
the deal was reached during 20 hours of negotiations with employers in the south german state of baden-würtenberg , but will be applied across germany .
besides the 4.1 percent raise this year , workers can expect an additional 1.7 percent a year later .
workers will also receive payments of 400 euros for the last two months before the agreement goes into effect on june 1 .
initially , the metalworkers ' union ig metall demanded a 6.5 percent increase .
employers countered with a 2.5 percent increase and a 0.5 percent bonus .
analysts said the agreement was positive for both employer and workers .
it is not likely to worry european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- policymakers concerned about risks to price stability .
" the wage rise has come in lower than generally expected , " said eckart tuchtfeld , an economist at commerzbank in frankfurt , told reuters .
" ecb fears of excessive wage pressure in germany and the resulting risk to inflation should ease as a result . "
" fears that wages would rise excessively did n't come true , " said stefan bielmeier , an economist at frankfurt-based deutsche bank ag , told the bloomberg news service .
" we stick to our estimate that ecb interest rates will rise to 4 percent in june and no further afterwards . "
economists have been closely watching the ig metall negotiations , with many fearful that handing out big pay hikes could slow germany 's economic growth .
stefan bielmeier at deutsche bank said the deal would equal a wage increase of 3.5 percent for 2007 in a country where inflation is currently just below two percent .
" that means the sector will remain competitive , " he told reuters .
" it also means more purchasing power for employees .
both together are good for the economy . "
union pleased with deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german metalworkers last launched a strike in 2002 " a nice sum of money will be going into the wallets of employees , " said negotiator jörg hofmann .
the union had put pressure on employers with temporary work stoppages and had threatened to strike if a deal was not reached quickly .
" i think it was very important for firms to avoid strikes , because business is booming just now and they 've been racking up huge amounts of orders , " bernd weidensteiner at dz bank told reuters .
" full-scale industrial action would have been poison for firms , so if you look at it from that perspective , they 've gotten off pretty lightly , " he said .
in 2002 , more than 200,000 ig metall union members participated in strikes .
carmakers daimlerchrysler , porsche and audi , truck maker man and french-american telecoms equipment company alcatel-lucent are among firms which faced work stoppages this year .
economy continues to boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers wanted a wage increase of more than 5 percent employers had wanted to keep the pay raise under 4 percent , but did n't complain after the deal was announced friday .

can the hissing of a hot air balloon startle a brood of hens into near-infertility ?
a german farmer grappling with dwindling egg production on his farm certainly seemed to think so .
but he failed to convince a court . stranger things are known to happen in the animal world .
but the theory that a loud hot air balloon could have impaired the fertility of a brood of hens proved too much for a court in germany on friday .
it threw out the complaint by a german farmer against a dutch balloon pilot . the farmer was seeking 26,000 euros -lrb- $ 35,000 -rrb- in damages from the pilot 's insurance company .
the incident occurred in september 2004 , when the balloon pilot swooped low and passed over the farmer 's land in the village of nordhorn in the german state of lower saxony .
in an attempt to regain altitude , the pilot fired up his propane gas burner with a loud hiss causing panic among the farm 's 20,000 free-range hens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piloting a hot air balloon can sometimes have unforeseen consequences according to the farmer , some of the startled , squawking birds sprang over a two-meter fence while others tried to flee into coops .
the hens , the farmer said , had been scared badly .
their post-traumatic stress syndrome meant that a week and a half later , they were laying fewer eggs .
egg production dropped by almost 60 percent , the farmer said . the unusual theory was , however , refuted by a professor at a nearby veterinary college .
asked to testify by the court , the expert said that decreased egg production among hens was possible for up to two days after a major shock - but not ten days after as the farmer had claimed . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de star bear knut lands book deal to help save the planet baby polar bear knut is not only a cuddly cover boy and audience magnet , he 's about to become an environmental activist .

can the hissing of a hot air balloon startle a brood of hens into near-infertility ?
a german farmer grappling with dwindling egg production on his farm certainly seemed to think so .
but he failed to convince a court . stranger things are known to happen in the animal world .
but the theory that a loud hot air balloon could have impaired the fertility of a brood of hens proved too much for a court in germany on friday .
it threw out the complaint by a german farmer against a dutch balloon pilot . the farmer was seeking 26,000 euros -lrb- $ 35,000 -rrb- in damages from the pilot 's insurance company .
the incident occurred in september 2004 , when the balloon pilot swooped low and passed over the farmer 's land in the village of nordhorn in the german state of lower saxony .
in an attempt to regain altitude , the pilot fired up his propane gas burner with a loud hiss causing panic among the farm 's 20,000 free-range hens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piloting a hot air balloon can sometimes have unforeseen consequences according to the farmer , some of the startled , squawking birds sprang over a two-meter fence while others tried to flee into coops .
the hens , the farmer said , had been scared badly .
their post-traumatic stress syndrome meant that a week and a half later , they were laying fewer eggs .
egg production dropped by almost 60 percent , the farmer said . the unusual theory was , however , refuted by a professor at a nearby veterinary college .
asked to testify by the court , the expert said that decreased egg production among hens was possible for up to two days after a major shock - but not ten days after as the farmer had claimed . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de star bear knut lands book deal to help save the planet baby polar bear knut is not only a cuddly cover boy and audience magnet , he 's about to become an environmental activist .

thomas raabe , spokesman for the minister , said in berlin the assistance was not an emergency and therefore was not covered by the current german parliamentary mandate authorizing over 3,000 troops currently stationed in afghanistan as a part of a nato-led international peacekeeping force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
germany 's ground troops are only authorized to operate in kabul and the north of afghanistan , though the german air force flies reconnaissance missions above the fighting in the south .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peacekeepers in afghanistan are largely confined to the capital kabul kabul had urgently asked for the 19 germans as part of an afghan army infantry battalion based in kundus in the north which is being redeployed to kandahar , a province which is the scene of intense fighting between alliance forces and a resurgent taliban .
the 19 germans are among 60 german soldiers selected to train the afghan unit .
a german television channel , zdf , has reported that the battalion is set to move out saturday or sunday .
controversial request kabul 's request was bound to be a controversial one for the german government which until now has steadfastly maintained that it does not want its peacekeeping troops embroiled in the growing fighting in afghanistan .
germany has elite special forces in afghanistan but has never disclosed where they operate , though it is generally believed that the ksk commandoes are in the south in direct conflict with taliban forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany sent tornado spy jets to afghanistan last month germany 's parliament needs to approve any military or peacekeeping deployment of its troops .
the current afghanistan mandate explicitly rules out german participation in combat missions .
earlier last month , germany sent six surveillance jets to afghanistan - amid misgivings among some opposition parties - to photograph taliban locations and support nato forces on the ground .
politicians want more open debate on friday , a few politicians raised doubts about the deployment and urged the government to openly discuss afghanistan 's request for troops .
" my spontaneous reaction is that this request from kabul is not covered by the parliamentary mandate for the isaf deployment , " karl lamers , defense expert of the governing christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the online site of der spiegel magazine .
claudia roth , head of the opposition green party said defense minister jung needed to inform parliament and the public about his decision .

" if we continue to do what we are doing now , we are in deep trouble , " said ogunlade davidson , co-chair of the ipcc .
" this report is all about solutions to climate change . " the report presented a best-case scenario of limiting global warming to 2.0-2.4 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6-4.3 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , which is generally recognized as the threshold to avoiding the most extreme consequences of climate change . co2 reduction still possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ipcc cited wind energy as an important existing technlolgy there is " substantial " potential for the world to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below current levels without crippling the global economy since many of the tools already exist and could be quickly implemented , the report said . harnessing more solar , wind , and hydro-power could have a large effect on reducing greenhouse gasses , the report said . nascent technology that could store carbon dioxide , the most abundant greenhouse gas , underground is also mentioned by the report , as are tariffs and other economic mechanisms to make using fossil fuels more expensive and lower prices for renewable energy use .
" there is substantial economic potential for the mitigation of global greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades , " the report said , adding that greenhouse emissions would have to be cut to between 50 and 85 percent of year 2000 levels by 2050 to keep the world in line with the report 's best-case scenario .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 04.05.2007 german metalworkers win pay hike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metalworkers demonstrated for higher wagers germany 's powerful ig metall union won a 4.1 percent pay raise for its 3.4 million members .
the increase is not expected to hurt the german economy , which has shown strong growth rates in 2007 . the last-minute agreement between the union and employers averted a strike .
the deal was reached during 20 hours of negotiations with employers in the south german state of baden-würtenberg , but will be applied across germany .
besides the 4.1 percent raise this year , workers can expect an additional 1.7 percent a year later .
workers will also receive payments of 400 euros for the last two months before the agreement goes into effect on june 1 .
initially , the metalworkers ' union ig metall demanded a 6.5 percent increase .
employers countered with a 2.5 percent increase and a 0.5 percent bonus .
analysts said the agreement was positive for both employer and workers .
it is not likely to worry european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- policymakers concerned about risks to price stability .
" the wage rise has come in lower than generally expected , " said eckart tuchtfeld , an economist at commerzbank in frankfurt , told reuters .
" ecb fears of excessive wage pressure in germany and the resulting risk to inflation should ease as a result . "
" fears that wages would rise excessively did n't come true , " said stefan bielmeier , an economist at frankfurt-based deutsche bank ag , told the bloomberg news service .
" we stick to our estimate that ecb interest rates will rise to 4 percent in june and no further afterwards . "
economists have been closely watching the ig metall negotiations , with many fearful that handing out big pay hikes could slow germany 's economic growth .
stefan bielmeier at deutsche bank said the deal would equal a wage increase of 3.5 percent for 2007 in a country where inflation is currently just below two percent .
" that means the sector will remain competitive , " he told reuters .
" it also means more purchasing power for employees .
both together are good for the economy . "
union pleased with deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german metalworkers last launched a strike in 2002 " a nice sum of money will be going into the wallets of employees , " said negotiator jörg hofmann .
the union had put pressure on employers with temporary work stoppages and had threatened to strike if a deal was not reached quickly .
" i think it was very important for firms to avoid strikes , because business is booming just now and they 've been racking up huge amounts of orders , " bernd weidensteiner at dz bank told reuters .
" full-scale industrial action would have been poison for firms , so if you look at it from that perspective , they 've gotten off pretty lightly , " he said .
in 2002 , more than 200,000 ig metall union members participated in strikes .
carmakers daimlerchrysler , porsche and audi , truck maker man and french-american telecoms equipment company alcatel-lucent are among firms which faced work stoppages this year .
economy continues to boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers wanted a wage increase of more than 5 percent employers had wanted to keep the pay raise under 4 percent , but did n't complain after the deal was announced friday .
" it is balanced and appropriate given that the economy is doing exceptionally well , " said stefan roell , who represented the state of baden-württemberg in the talks .
after years of gloom , the german government last month raised its growth forecast for 2007 to 2.3 percent , representing a clear improvement on its previous prediction of 1.7 percent .
consumer sentiment and business confidence indices in the euro zone 's biggest economy have also shown sharp rises recently . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powerful unions launch warning strikes with more to come thousands of workers downed tools after the ig metall trade union called strikes to step up pressure for wage talks in the electrical , engineering and metalworking sectors .

the increase is not expected to hurt the german economy , which has shown strong growth rates in 2007 . the last-minute agreement between the union and employers averted a strike .
the deal was reached during 20 hours of negotiations with employers in the south german state of baden-würtenberg , but will be applied across germany .
besides the 4.1 percent raise this year , workers can expect an additional 1.7 percent a year later .
workers will also receive payments of 400 euros for the last two months before the agreement goes into effect on june 1 .
initially , the metalworkers ' union ig metall demanded a 6.5 percent increase .
employers countered with a 2.5 percent increase and a 0.5 percent bonus .
analysts said the agreement was positive for both employer and workers .
it is not likely to worry european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- policymakers concerned about risks to price stability .
" the wage rise has come in lower than generally expected , " said eckart tuchtfeld , an economist at commerzbank in frankfurt , told reuters .
" ecb fears of excessive wage pressure in germany and the resulting risk to inflation should ease as a result . "
" fears that wages would rise excessively did n't come true , " said stefan bielmeier , an economist at frankfurt-based deutsche bank ag , told the bloomberg news service .
" we stick to our estimate that ecb interest rates will rise to 4 percent in june and no further afterwards . "
economists have been closely watching the ig metall negotiations , with many fearful that handing out big pay hikes could slow germany 's economic growth .
stefan bielmeier at deutsche bank said the deal would equal a wage increase of 3.5 percent for 2007 in a country where inflation is currently just below two percent .
" that means the sector will remain competitive , " he told reuters .
" it also means more purchasing power for employees .
both together are good for the economy . "
union pleased with deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german metalworkers last launched a strike in 2002 " a nice sum of money will be going into the wallets of employees , " said negotiator jörg hofmann .
the union had put pressure on employers with temporary work stoppages and had threatened to strike if a deal was not reached quickly .
" i think it was very important for firms to avoid strikes , because business is booming just now and they 've been racking up huge amounts of orders , " bernd weidensteiner at dz bank told reuters .
" full-scale industrial action would have been poison for firms , so if you look at it from that perspective , they 've gotten off pretty lightly , " he said .
in 2002 , more than 200,000 ig metall union members participated in strikes .
carmakers daimlerchrysler , porsche and audi , truck maker man and french-american telecoms equipment company alcatel-lucent are among firms which faced work stoppages this year .
economy continues to boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers wanted a wage increase of more than 5 percent employers had wanted to keep the pay raise under 4 percent , but did n't complain after the deal was announced friday .
" it is balanced and appropriate given that the economy is doing exceptionally well , " said stefan roell , who represented the state of baden-württemberg in the talks .
after years of gloom , the german government last month raised its growth forecast for 2007 to 2.3 percent , representing a clear improvement on its previous prediction of 1.7 percent .

can the hissing of a hot air balloon startle a brood of hens into near-infertility ?
a german farmer grappling with dwindling egg production on his farm certainly seemed to think so .
but he failed to convince a court . stranger things are known to happen in the animal world .
but the theory that a loud hot air balloon could have impaired the fertility of a brood of hens proved too much for a court in germany on friday .
it threw out the complaint by a german farmer against a dutch balloon pilot . the farmer was seeking 26,000 euros -lrb- $ 35,000 -rrb- in damages from the pilot 's insurance company .
the incident occurred in september 2004 , when the balloon pilot swooped low and passed over the farmer 's land in the village of nordhorn in the german state of lower saxony .
in an attempt to regain altitude , the pilot fired up his propane gas burner with a loud hiss causing panic among the farm 's 20,000 free-range hens .

the hens , the farmer said , had been scared badly .
their post-traumatic stress syndrome meant that a week and a half later , they were laying fewer eggs .
egg production dropped by almost 60 percent , the farmer said . the unusual theory was , however , refuted by a professor at a nearby veterinary college .

thomas raabe , spokesman for the minister , said in berlin the assistance was not an emergency and therefore was not covered by the current german parliamentary mandate authorizing over 3,000 troops currently stationed in afghanistan as a part of a nato-led international peacekeeping force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
germany 's ground troops are only authorized to operate in kabul and the north of afghanistan , though the german air force flies reconnaissance missions above the fighting in the south .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peacekeepers in afghanistan are largely confined to the capital kabul kabul had urgently asked for the 19 germans as part of an afghan army infantry battalion based in kundus in the north which is being redeployed to kandahar , a province which is the scene of intense fighting between alliance forces and a resurgent taliban .
the 19 germans are among 60 german soldiers selected to train the afghan unit .
a german television channel , zdf , has reported that the battalion is set to move out saturday or sunday .
controversial request kabul 's request was bound to be a controversial one for the german government which until now has steadfastly maintained that it does not want its peacekeeping troops embroiled in the growing fighting in afghanistan .
germany has elite special forces in afghanistan but has never disclosed where they operate , though it is generally believed that the ksk commandoes are in the south in direct conflict with taliban forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany sent tornado spy jets to afghanistan last month germany 's parliament needs to approve any military or peacekeeping deployment of its troops .
the current afghanistan mandate explicitly rules out german participation in combat missions .
earlier last month , germany sent six surveillance jets to afghanistan - amid misgivings among some opposition parties - to photograph taliban locations and support nato forces on the ground .
politicians want more open debate on friday , a few politicians raised doubts about the deployment and urged the government to openly discuss afghanistan 's request for troops .
" my spontaneous reaction is that this request from kabul is not covered by the parliamentary mandate for the isaf deployment , " karl lamers , defense expert of the governing christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the online site of der spiegel magazine .
claudia roth , head of the opposition green party said defense minister jung needed to inform parliament and the public about his decision .
" such a request -lrb- from afghanistan -rrb- belongs in the parliament and should not be clandestinely decided in the defense ministry , " roth said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german jets head for afghanistan amid mounting concerns german tornado jets and their crews deploy to afghanistan monday .
despite their well-publicized surveillance role , the new troops may soon find the taliban does not see a difference between combat and support .
-lrb- 02.04.2007 -rrb- will germany join the fight against the taliban ?
germany faces a difficult decision about deploying tornado fighter jets in southern afghanistan .
defense minister franz josef jung said the mission could begin in april , but only if the bundestag agrees .
-lrb- 06.02.2007 -rrb- german parliament backs reconnaissance mission to afghanistan germany 's parliament approved on friday a plan to deploy six tornado jets to provide reconnaissance assistance to nato troops in southern afghanistan ahead of an expected spring offensive by insurgents .

much of the technology already exists , but quick action is needed , according to the final report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc . -rrb- steps to control global warming would require less than 0.1 percent of world 's annual gross domestic product , according to the 24-page report released by the ipcc on friday in bangkok . " if we continue to do what we are doing now , we are in deep trouble , " said ogunlade davidson , co-chair of the ipcc .
" this report is all about solutions to climate change . " the report presented a best-case scenario of limiting global warming to 2.0-2.4 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6-4.3 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , which is generally recognized as the threshold to avoiding the most extreme consequences of climate change . co2 reduction still possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ipcc cited wind energy as an important existing technlolgy there is " substantial " potential for the world to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below current levels without crippling the global economy since many of the tools already exist and could be quickly implemented , the report said . harnessing more solar , wind , and hydro-power could have a large effect on reducing greenhouse gasses , the report said . nascent technology that could store carbon dioxide , the most abundant greenhouse gas , underground is also mentioned by the report , as are tariffs and other economic mechanisms to make using fossil fuels more expensive and lower prices for renewable energy use .
" there is substantial economic potential for the mitigation of global greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades , " the report said , adding that greenhouse emissions would have to be cut to between 50 and 85 percent of year 2000 levels by 2050 to keep the world in line with the report 's best-case scenario .
consensus exists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar energy is increasingly popular in europe after intense debate , climate experts and representatives from 105 countries reached a consensus on the ipcc document friday .
final approval had been held up by few key sticking points and the complexity of the document , according to participants . the cost of reducing greenhouse gases that cause global warming was one of the biggest disputes , with china expressing concern about the economic impact of cutting back , one european delegate said .
another matter of contention was how much importance to give nuclear energy in the mix of new technologies that the world could use in a shift away from fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases , the european delegate said . next up : the g8 summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors in bangkok demanded governments take action on climate change the report is the ipcc 's third and last for the year .
the first two reports looked into the evidence for and impacts of global warming .
" it has been shown for the first time that stopping climate pollution in a very ambitious way does not cost a fortune , " said stephan singer of the world wildlife fund .
" there is no excuse for any government to argue that it is going to cause their economy to collapse . " " it 's a great report and the conclusions are quite strong , " said greenpeace 's bill hare , one of the led authors of report .
though he admitted that it 's " a little hard to read . "
after the bangkok ipcc talks , the next two important meetings for climate change are the june summit of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialized countries in germany and an end-of-the-year environmental summit in bali to set world targets on emissions reductions .
" we have no time to lose , " german environment minister sigmar gabriel said friday .
" it 's important that we set the right course at the climate conference in bali in december .

thomas raabe , spokesman for the minister , said in berlin the assistance was not an emergency and therefore was not covered by the current german parliamentary mandate authorizing over 3,000 troops currently stationed in afghanistan as a part of a nato-led international peacekeeping force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
germany 's ground troops are only authorized to operate in kabul and the north of afghanistan , though the german air force flies reconnaissance missions above the fighting in the south .

the 19 germans are among 60 german soldiers selected to train the afghan unit .
a german television channel , zdf , has reported that the battalion is set to move out saturday or sunday .
controversial request kabul 's request was bound to be a controversial one for the german government which until now has steadfastly maintained that it does not want its peacekeeping troops embroiled in the growing fighting in afghanistan .
germany has elite special forces in afghanistan but has never disclosed where they operate , though it is generally believed that the ksk commandoes are in the south in direct conflict with taliban forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany sent tornado spy jets to afghanistan last month germany 's parliament needs to approve any military or peacekeeping deployment of its troops .
the current afghanistan mandate explicitly rules out german participation in combat missions .
earlier last month , germany sent six surveillance jets to afghanistan - amid misgivings among some opposition parties - to photograph taliban locations and support nato forces on the ground .
politicians want more open debate on friday , a few politicians raised doubts about the deployment and urged the government to openly discuss afghanistan 's request for troops .
" my spontaneous reaction is that this request from kabul is not covered by the parliamentary mandate for the isaf deployment , " karl lamers , defense expert of the governing christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the online site of der spiegel magazine .
claudia roth , head of the opposition green party said defense minister jung needed to inform parliament and the public about his decision .

thomas raabe , spokesman for the minister , said in berlin the assistance was not an emergency and therefore was not covered by the current german parliamentary mandate authorizing over 3,000 troops currently stationed in afghanistan as a part of a nato-led international peacekeeping force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
germany 's ground troops are only authorized to operate in kabul and the north of afghanistan , though the german air force flies reconnaissance missions above the fighting in the south .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peacekeepers in afghanistan are largely confined to the capital kabul kabul had urgently asked for the 19 germans as part of an afghan army infantry battalion based in kundus in the north which is being redeployed to kandahar , a province which is the scene of intense fighting between alliance forces and a resurgent taliban .
the 19 germans are among 60 german soldiers selected to train the afghan unit .
a german television channel , zdf , has reported that the battalion is set to move out saturday or sunday .
controversial request kabul 's request was bound to be a controversial one for the german government which until now has steadfastly maintained that it does not want its peacekeeping troops embroiled in the growing fighting in afghanistan .
germany has elite special forces in afghanistan but has never disclosed where they operate , though it is generally believed that the ksk commandoes are in the south in direct conflict with taliban forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany sent tornado spy jets to afghanistan last month germany 's parliament needs to approve any military or peacekeeping deployment of its troops .
the current afghanistan mandate explicitly rules out german participation in combat missions .
earlier last month , germany sent six surveillance jets to afghanistan - amid misgivings among some opposition parties - to photograph taliban locations and support nato forces on the ground .
politicians want more open debate on friday , a few politicians raised doubts about the deployment and urged the government to openly discuss afghanistan 's request for troops .
" my spontaneous reaction is that this request from kabul is not covered by the parliamentary mandate for the isaf deployment , " karl lamers , defense expert of the governing christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the online site of der spiegel magazine .
claudia roth , head of the opposition green party said defense minister jung needed to inform parliament and the public about his decision .
" such a request -lrb- from afghanistan -rrb- belongs in the parliament and should not be clandestinely decided in the defense ministry , " roth said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german jets head for afghanistan amid mounting concerns german tornado jets and their crews deploy to afghanistan monday .
despite their well-publicized surveillance role , the new troops may soon find the taliban does not see a difference between combat and support .
-lrb- 02.04.2007 -rrb- will germany join the fight against the taliban ?
germany faces a difficult decision about deploying tornado fighter jets in southern afghanistan .
defense minister franz josef jung said the mission could begin in april , but only if the bundestag agrees .
-lrb- 06.02.2007 -rrb- german parliament backs reconnaissance mission to afghanistan germany 's parliament approved on friday a plan to deploy six tornado jets to provide reconnaissance assistance to nato troops in southern afghanistan ahead of an expected spring offensive by insurgents .

the increase is not expected to hurt the german economy , which has shown strong growth rates in 2007 . the last-minute agreement between the union and employers averted a strike .
the deal was reached during 20 hours of negotiations with employers in the south german state of baden-würtenberg , but will be applied across germany .
besides the 4.1 percent raise this year , workers can expect an additional 1.7 percent a year later .
workers will also receive payments of 400 euros for the last two months before the agreement goes into effect on june 1 .
initially , the metalworkers ' union ig metall demanded a 6.5 percent increase .
employers countered with a 2.5 percent increase and a 0.5 percent bonus .
analysts said the agreement was positive for both employer and workers .
it is not likely to worry european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- policymakers concerned about risks to price stability .
" the wage rise has come in lower than generally expected , " said eckart tuchtfeld , an economist at commerzbank in frankfurt , told reuters .
" ecb fears of excessive wage pressure in germany and the resulting risk to inflation should ease as a result . "
" fears that wages would rise excessively did n't come true , " said stefan bielmeier , an economist at frankfurt-based deutsche bank ag , told the bloomberg news service .
" we stick to our estimate that ecb interest rates will rise to 4 percent in june and no further afterwards . "
economists have been closely watching the ig metall negotiations , with many fearful that handing out big pay hikes could slow germany 's economic growth .
stefan bielmeier at deutsche bank said the deal would equal a wage increase of 3.5 percent for 2007 in a country where inflation is currently just below two percent .
" that means the sector will remain competitive , " he told reuters .
" it also means more purchasing power for employees .
both together are good for the economy . "
union pleased with deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german metalworkers last launched a strike in 2002 " a nice sum of money will be going into the wallets of employees , " said negotiator jörg hofmann .
the union had put pressure on employers with temporary work stoppages and had threatened to strike if a deal was not reached quickly .
" i think it was very important for firms to avoid strikes , because business is booming just now and they 've been racking up huge amounts of orders , " bernd weidensteiner at dz bank told reuters .
" full-scale industrial action would have been poison for firms , so if you look at it from that perspective , they 've gotten off pretty lightly , " he said .
in 2002 , more than 200,000 ig metall union members participated in strikes .
carmakers daimlerchrysler , porsche and audi , truck maker man and french-american telecoms equipment company alcatel-lucent are among firms which faced work stoppages this year .
economy continues to boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers wanted a wage increase of more than 5 percent employers had wanted to keep the pay raise under 4 percent , but did n't complain after the deal was announced friday .
" it is balanced and appropriate given that the economy is doing exceptionally well , " said stefan roell , who represented the state of baden-württemberg in the talks .
after years of gloom , the german government last month raised its growth forecast for 2007 to 2.3 percent , representing a clear improvement on its previous prediction of 1.7 percent .
consumer sentiment and business confidence indices in the euro zone 's biggest economy have also shown sharp rises recently . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powerful unions launch warning strikes with more to come thousands of workers downed tools after the ig metall trade union called strikes to step up pressure for wage talks in the electrical , engineering and metalworking sectors .

much of the technology already exists , but quick action is needed , according to the final report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc . -rrb- steps to control global warming would require less than 0.1 percent of world 's annual gross domestic product , according to the 24-page report released by the ipcc on friday in bangkok . " if we continue to do what we are doing now , we are in deep trouble , " said ogunlade davidson , co-chair of the ipcc .
" this report is all about solutions to climate change . " the report presented a best-case scenario of limiting global warming to 2.0-2.4 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6-4.3 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , which is generally recognized as the threshold to avoiding the most extreme consequences of climate change . co2 reduction still possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ipcc cited wind energy as an important existing technlolgy there is " substantial " potential for the world to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below current levels without crippling the global economy since many of the tools already exist and could be quickly implemented , the report said . harnessing more solar , wind , and hydro-power could have a large effect on reducing greenhouse gasses , the report said . nascent technology that could store carbon dioxide , the most abundant greenhouse gas , underground is also mentioned by the report , as are tariffs and other economic mechanisms to make using fossil fuels more expensive and lower prices for renewable energy use .
" there is substantial economic potential for the mitigation of global greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades , " the report said , adding that greenhouse emissions would have to be cut to between 50 and 85 percent of year 2000 levels by 2050 to keep the world in line with the report 's best-case scenario .
consensus exists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar energy is increasingly popular in europe after intense debate , climate experts and representatives from 105 countries reached a consensus on the ipcc document friday .
final approval had been held up by few key sticking points and the complexity of the document , according to participants . the cost of reducing greenhouse gases that cause global warming was one of the biggest disputes , with china expressing concern about the economic impact of cutting back , one european delegate said .
another matter of contention was how much importance to give nuclear energy in the mix of new technologies that the world could use in a shift away from fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases , the european delegate said . next up : the g8 summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors in bangkok demanded governments take action on climate change the report is the ipcc 's third and last for the year .
the first two reports looked into the evidence for and impacts of global warming .
" it has been shown for the first time that stopping climate pollution in a very ambitious way does not cost a fortune , " said stephan singer of the world wildlife fund .
" there is no excuse for any government to argue that it is going to cause their economy to collapse . " " it 's a great report and the conclusions are quite strong , " said greenpeace 's bill hare , one of the led authors of report .
though he admitted that it 's " a little hard to read . "
after the bangkok ipcc talks , the next two important meetings for climate change are the june summit of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialized countries in germany and an end-of-the-year environmental summit in bali to set world targets on emissions reductions .
" we have no time to lose , " german environment minister sigmar gabriel said friday .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piloting a hot air balloon can sometimes have unforeseen consequences according to the farmer , some of the startled , squawking birds sprang over a two-meter fence while others tried to flee into coops .
the hens , the farmer said , had been scared badly .
their post-traumatic stress syndrome meant that a week and a half later , they were laying fewer eggs .
egg production dropped by almost 60 percent , the farmer said . the unusual theory was , however , refuted by a professor at a nearby veterinary college .
asked to testify by the court , the expert said that decreased egg production among hens was possible for up to two days after a major shock - but not ten days after as the farmer had claimed . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de star bear knut lands book deal to help save the planet baby polar bear knut is not only a cuddly cover boy and audience magnet , he 's about to become an environmental activist .

thomas raabe , spokesman for the minister , said in berlin the assistance was not an emergency and therefore was not covered by the current german parliamentary mandate authorizing over 3,000 troops currently stationed in afghanistan as a part of a nato-led international peacekeeping force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
germany 's ground troops are only authorized to operate in kabul and the north of afghanistan , though the german air force flies reconnaissance missions above the fighting in the south .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peacekeepers in afghanistan are largely confined to the capital kabul kabul had urgently asked for the 19 germans as part of an afghan army infantry battalion based in kundus in the north which is being redeployed to kandahar , a province which is the scene of intense fighting between alliance forces and a resurgent taliban .
the 19 germans are among 60 german soldiers selected to train the afghan unit .
a german television channel , zdf , has reported that the battalion is set to move out saturday or sunday .
controversial request kabul 's request was bound to be a controversial one for the german government which until now has steadfastly maintained that it does not want its peacekeeping troops embroiled in the growing fighting in afghanistan .
germany has elite special forces in afghanistan but has never disclosed where they operate , though it is generally believed that the ksk commandoes are in the south in direct conflict with taliban forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany sent tornado spy jets to afghanistan last month germany 's parliament needs to approve any military or peacekeeping deployment of its troops .
the current afghanistan mandate explicitly rules out german participation in combat missions .
earlier last month , germany sent six surveillance jets to afghanistan - amid misgivings among some opposition parties - to photograph taliban locations and support nato forces on the ground .
politicians want more open debate on friday , a few politicians raised doubts about the deployment and urged the government to openly discuss afghanistan 's request for troops .
" my spontaneous reaction is that this request from kabul is not covered by the parliamentary mandate for the isaf deployment , " karl lamers , defense expert of the governing christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the online site of der spiegel magazine .
claudia roth , head of the opposition green party said defense minister jung needed to inform parliament and the public about his decision .
" such a request -lrb- from afghanistan -rrb- belongs in the parliament and should not be clandestinely decided in the defense ministry , " roth said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german jets head for afghanistan amid mounting concerns german tornado jets and their crews deploy to afghanistan monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 04.05.2007 german metalworkers win pay hike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metalworkers demonstrated for higher wagers germany 's powerful ig metall union won a 4.1 percent pay raise for its 3.4 million members .
the increase is not expected to hurt the german economy , which has shown strong growth rates in 2007 . the last-minute agreement between the union and employers averted a strike .
the deal was reached during 20 hours of negotiations with employers in the south german state of baden-würtenberg , but will be applied across germany .
besides the 4.1 percent raise this year , workers can expect an additional 1.7 percent a year later .
workers will also receive payments of 400 euros for the last two months before the agreement goes into effect on june 1 .
initially , the metalworkers ' union ig metall demanded a 6.5 percent increase .
employers countered with a 2.5 percent increase and a 0.5 percent bonus .
analysts said the agreement was positive for both employer and workers .
it is not likely to worry european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- policymakers concerned about risks to price stability .
" the wage rise has come in lower than generally expected , " said eckart tuchtfeld , an economist at commerzbank in frankfurt , told reuters .
" ecb fears of excessive wage pressure in germany and the resulting risk to inflation should ease as a result . "
" fears that wages would rise excessively did n't come true , " said stefan bielmeier , an economist at frankfurt-based deutsche bank ag , told the bloomberg news service .
" we stick to our estimate that ecb interest rates will rise to 4 percent in june and no further afterwards . "
economists have been closely watching the ig metall negotiations , with many fearful that handing out big pay hikes could slow germany 's economic growth .
stefan bielmeier at deutsche bank said the deal would equal a wage increase of 3.5 percent for 2007 in a country where inflation is currently just below two percent .
" that means the sector will remain competitive , " he told reuters .
" it also means more purchasing power for employees .
both together are good for the economy . "
union pleased with deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german metalworkers last launched a strike in 2002 " a nice sum of money will be going into the wallets of employees , " said negotiator jörg hofmann .
the union had put pressure on employers with temporary work stoppages and had threatened to strike if a deal was not reached quickly .
" i think it was very important for firms to avoid strikes , because business is booming just now and they 've been racking up huge amounts of orders , " bernd weidensteiner at dz bank told reuters .
" full-scale industrial action would have been poison for firms , so if you look at it from that perspective , they 've gotten off pretty lightly , " he said .

the increase is not expected to hurt the german economy , which has shown strong growth rates in 2007 . the last-minute agreement between the union and employers averted a strike .
the deal was reached during 20 hours of negotiations with employers in the south german state of baden-würtenberg , but will be applied across germany .
besides the 4.1 percent raise this year , workers can expect an additional 1.7 percent a year later .
workers will also receive payments of 400 euros for the last two months before the agreement goes into effect on june 1 .
initially , the metalworkers ' union ig metall demanded a 6.5 percent increase .
employers countered with a 2.5 percent increase and a 0.5 percent bonus .
analysts said the agreement was positive for both employer and workers .
it is not likely to worry european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- policymakers concerned about risks to price stability .
" the wage rise has come in lower than generally expected , " said eckart tuchtfeld , an economist at commerzbank in frankfurt , told reuters .
" ecb fears of excessive wage pressure in germany and the resulting risk to inflation should ease as a result . "
" fears that wages would rise excessively did n't come true , " said stefan bielmeier , an economist at frankfurt-based deutsche bank ag , told the bloomberg news service .
" we stick to our estimate that ecb interest rates will rise to 4 percent in june and no further afterwards . "
economists have been closely watching the ig metall negotiations , with many fearful that handing out big pay hikes could slow germany 's economic growth .
stefan bielmeier at deutsche bank said the deal would equal a wage increase of 3.5 percent for 2007 in a country where inflation is currently just below two percent .
" that means the sector will remain competitive , " he told reuters .
" it also means more purchasing power for employees .
both together are good for the economy . "
union pleased with deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german metalworkers last launched a strike in 2002 " a nice sum of money will be going into the wallets of employees , " said negotiator jörg hofmann .
the union had put pressure on employers with temporary work stoppages and had threatened to strike if a deal was not reached quickly .
" i think it was very important for firms to avoid strikes , because business is booming just now and they 've been racking up huge amounts of orders , " bernd weidensteiner at dz bank told reuters .

estonians view it as a reminder of soviet occupation .

the study also revealed that there were 30 fewer drug-related deaths last year compared to 2005 , a large decrease from the 2,030 deaths recorded in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deaths caused by drugs like cocaine and heroin are down despite the good news on those fronts , federal drug commissioner sabine baetzing said drugs continue to be a serious problem that should not be ignored . " the containment of drug and addiction problems remains one of the most important political and societal challenges in germany , " baetzing said in a statement . the number of first-time users of hard drugs like heroin and cocaine also declined in 2006 . soft drugs a problem while the report documented some successes against hard drugs , it also highlighted germany ’ s continued problems in managing addiction to so-called " soft " drugs like tobacco , alcohol and prescription drugs .
according to baetzing , the use of soft drugs is becoming more and more acceptable in the german society . " the relaxed view of everyday drugs like tobacco , alcohol and prescription drugs in particular leads to immeasurable , often silent and unnoticed suffering for those addicted , " she said .
some 1.6 million germans were classed as suffering from alcohol dependency in the report , which said one in five people aged between 12 and 25 were regular consumers of alcohol - drinking more alcohol and starting younger than ever before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german youths are starting to drink at younger ages the problem of excessive alcohol consumption among youth hit the headlines recently when a 16-year-old died in berlin after a night of binge drinking at a club .

according to baetzing , the drug commissioner , more focus must be put on the research and treatment for people suffering under their addictions to prescription drugs .
" continued education must highlight the risks of the consumption of any drug that can lead to addiction , " she said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch coffee shops close as authorities weed out drug tourists each year , thousands of german drug tourists cross the border into the dutch town of enschede , where soft drugs such as marijuana are sold openly .

can the hissing of a hot air balloon startle a brood of hens into near-infertility ?
a german farmer grappling with dwindling egg production on his farm certainly seemed to think so .
but he failed to convince a court . stranger things are known to happen in the animal world .
but the theory that a loud hot air balloon could have impaired the fertility of a brood of hens proved too much for a court in germany on friday .
it threw out the complaint by a german farmer against a dutch balloon pilot . the farmer was seeking 26,000 euros -lrb- $ 35,000 -rrb- in damages from the pilot 's insurance company .
the incident occurred in september 2004 , when the balloon pilot swooped low and passed over the farmer 's land in the village of nordhorn in the german state of lower saxony .
in an attempt to regain altitude , the pilot fired up his propane gas burner with a loud hiss causing panic among the farm 's 20,000 free-range hens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piloting a hot air balloon can sometimes have unforeseen consequences according to the farmer , some of the startled , squawking birds sprang over a two-meter fence while others tried to flee into coops .
the hens , the farmer said , had been scared badly .
their post-traumatic stress syndrome meant that a week and a half later , they were laying fewer eggs .
egg production dropped by almost 60 percent , the farmer said . the unusual theory was , however , refuted by a professor at a nearby veterinary college .
asked to testify by the court , the expert said that decreased egg production among hens was possible for up to two days after a major shock - but not ten days after as the farmer had claimed . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de star bear knut lands book deal to help save the planet baby polar bear knut is not only a cuddly cover boy and audience magnet , he 's about to become an environmental activist .

the increase is not expected to hurt the german economy , which has shown strong growth rates in 2007 . the last-minute agreement between the union and employers averted a strike .
the deal was reached during 20 hours of negotiations with employers in the south german state of baden-würtenberg , but will be applied across germany .
besides the 4.1 percent raise this year , workers can expect an additional 1.7 percent a year later .
workers will also receive payments of 400 euros for the last two months before the agreement goes into effect on june 1 .
initially , the metalworkers ' union ig metall demanded a 6.5 percent increase .
employers countered with a 2.5 percent increase and a 0.5 percent bonus .
analysts said the agreement was positive for both employer and workers .
it is not likely to worry european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- policymakers concerned about risks to price stability .
" the wage rise has come in lower than generally expected , " said eckart tuchtfeld , an economist at commerzbank in frankfurt , told reuters .
" ecb fears of excessive wage pressure in germany and the resulting risk to inflation should ease as a result . "
" fears that wages would rise excessively did n't come true , " said stefan bielmeier , an economist at frankfurt-based deutsche bank ag , told the bloomberg news service .
" we stick to our estimate that ecb interest rates will rise to 4 percent in june and no further afterwards . "
economists have been closely watching the ig metall negotiations , with many fearful that handing out big pay hikes could slow germany 's economic growth .
stefan bielmeier at deutsche bank said the deal would equal a wage increase of 3.5 percent for 2007 in a country where inflation is currently just below two percent .
" that means the sector will remain competitive , " he told reuters .
" it also means more purchasing power for employees .
both together are good for the economy . "
union pleased with deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german metalworkers last launched a strike in 2002 " a nice sum of money will be going into the wallets of employees , " said negotiator jörg hofmann .
the union had put pressure on employers with temporary work stoppages and had threatened to strike if a deal was not reached quickly .
" i think it was very important for firms to avoid strikes , because business is booming just now and they 've been racking up huge amounts of orders , " bernd weidensteiner at dz bank told reuters .
" full-scale industrial action would have been poison for firms , so if you look at it from that perspective , they 've gotten off pretty lightly , " he said .
in 2002 , more than 200,000 ig metall union members participated in strikes .
carmakers daimlerchrysler , porsche and audi , truck maker man and french-american telecoms equipment company alcatel-lucent are among firms which faced work stoppages this year .

" it is balanced and appropriate given that the economy is doing exceptionally well , " said stefan roell , who represented the state of baden-württemberg in the talks .
after years of gloom , the german government last month raised its growth forecast for 2007 to 2.3 percent , representing a clear improvement on its previous prediction of 1.7 percent .

" fears that wages would rise excessively did n't come true , " said stefan bielmeier , an economist at frankfurt-based deutsche bank ag , told the bloomberg news service .
" we stick to our estimate that ecb interest rates will rise to 4 percent in june and no further afterwards . "
economists have been closely watching the ig metall negotiations , with many fearful that handing out big pay hikes could slow germany 's economic growth .
stefan bielmeier at deutsche bank said the deal would equal a wage increase of 3.5 percent for 2007 in a country where inflation is currently just below two percent .
" that means the sector will remain competitive , " he told reuters .
" it also means more purchasing power for employees .
both together are good for the economy . "
union pleased with deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german metalworkers last launched a strike in 2002 " a nice sum of money will be going into the wallets of employees , " said negotiator jörg hofmann .
the union had put pressure on employers with temporary work stoppages and had threatened to strike if a deal was not reached quickly .
" i think it was very important for firms to avoid strikes , because business is booming just now and they 've been racking up huge amounts of orders , " bernd weidensteiner at dz bank told reuters .
" full-scale industrial action would have been poison for firms , so if you look at it from that perspective , they 've gotten off pretty lightly , " he said .
in 2002 , more than 200,000 ig metall union members participated in strikes .
carmakers daimlerchrysler , porsche and audi , truck maker man and french-american telecoms equipment company alcatel-lucent are among firms which faced work stoppages this year .
economy continues to boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers wanted a wage increase of more than 5 percent employers had wanted to keep the pay raise under 4 percent , but did n't complain after the deal was announced friday .
" it is balanced and appropriate given that the economy is doing exceptionally well , " said stefan roell , who represented the state of baden-württemberg in the talks .
after years of gloom , the german government last month raised its growth forecast for 2007 to 2.3 percent , representing a clear improvement on its previous prediction of 1.7 percent .

can the hissing of a hot air balloon startle a brood of hens into near-infertility ?
a german farmer grappling with dwindling egg production on his farm certainly seemed to think so .
but he failed to convince a court . stranger things are known to happen in the animal world .
but the theory that a loud hot air balloon could have impaired the fertility of a brood of hens proved too much for a court in germany on friday .
it threw out the complaint by a german farmer against a dutch balloon pilot . the farmer was seeking 26,000 euros -lrb- $ 35,000 -rrb- in damages from the pilot 's insurance company .
the incident occurred in september 2004 , when the balloon pilot swooped low and passed over the farmer 's land in the village of nordhorn in the german state of lower saxony .
in an attempt to regain altitude , the pilot fired up his propane gas burner with a loud hiss causing panic among the farm 's 20,000 free-range hens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piloting a hot air balloon can sometimes have unforeseen consequences according to the farmer , some of the startled , squawking birds sprang over a two-meter fence while others tried to flee into coops .
the hens , the farmer said , had been scared badly .
their post-traumatic stress syndrome meant that a week and a half later , they were laying fewer eggs .
egg production dropped by almost 60 percent , the farmer said . the unusual theory was , however , refuted by a professor at a nearby veterinary college .
asked to testify by the court , the expert said that decreased egg production among hens was possible for up to two days after a major shock - but not ten days after as the farmer had claimed . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de star bear knut lands book deal to help save the planet baby polar bear knut is not only a cuddly cover boy and audience magnet , he 's about to become an environmental activist .

thomas raabe , spokesman for the minister , said in berlin the assistance was not an emergency and therefore was not covered by the current german parliamentary mandate authorizing over 3,000 troops currently stationed in afghanistan as a part of a nato-led international peacekeeping force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
germany 's ground troops are only authorized to operate in kabul and the north of afghanistan , though the german air force flies reconnaissance missions above the fighting in the south .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peacekeepers in afghanistan are largely confined to the capital kabul kabul had urgently asked for the 19 germans as part of an afghan army infantry battalion based in kundus in the north which is being redeployed to kandahar , a province which is the scene of intense fighting between alliance forces and a resurgent taliban .
the 19 germans are among 60 german soldiers selected to train the afghan unit .
a german television channel , zdf , has reported that the battalion is set to move out saturday or sunday .
controversial request kabul 's request was bound to be a controversial one for the german government which until now has steadfastly maintained that it does not want its peacekeeping troops embroiled in the growing fighting in afghanistan .
germany has elite special forces in afghanistan but has never disclosed where they operate , though it is generally believed that the ksk commandoes are in the south in direct conflict with taliban forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany sent tornado spy jets to afghanistan last month germany 's parliament needs to approve any military or peacekeeping deployment of its troops .
the current afghanistan mandate explicitly rules out german participation in combat missions .
earlier last month , germany sent six surveillance jets to afghanistan - amid misgivings among some opposition parties - to photograph taliban locations and support nato forces on the ground .
politicians want more open debate on friday , a few politicians raised doubts about the deployment and urged the government to openly discuss afghanistan 's request for troops .
" my spontaneous reaction is that this request from kabul is not covered by the parliamentary mandate for the isaf deployment , " karl lamers , defense expert of the governing christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the online site of der spiegel magazine .
claudia roth , head of the opposition green party said defense minister jung needed to inform parliament and the public about his decision .
" such a request -lrb- from afghanistan -rrb- belongs in the parliament and should not be clandestinely decided in the defense ministry , " roth said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german jets head for afghanistan amid mounting concerns german tornado jets and their crews deploy to afghanistan monday .
despite their well-publicized surveillance role , the new troops may soon find the taliban does not see a difference between combat and support .
-lrb- 02.04.2007 -rrb- will germany join the fight against the taliban ?

thomas raabe , spokesman for the minister , said in berlin the assistance was not an emergency and therefore was not covered by the current german parliamentary mandate authorizing over 3,000 troops currently stationed in afghanistan as a part of a nato-led international peacekeeping force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
germany 's ground troops are only authorized to operate in kabul and the north of afghanistan , though the german air force flies reconnaissance missions above the fighting in the south .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peacekeepers in afghanistan are largely confined to the capital kabul kabul had urgently asked for the 19 germans as part of an afghan army infantry battalion based in kundus in the north which is being redeployed to kandahar , a province which is the scene of intense fighting between alliance forces and a resurgent taliban .
the 19 germans are among 60 german soldiers selected to train the afghan unit .
a german television channel , zdf , has reported that the battalion is set to move out saturday or sunday .
controversial request kabul 's request was bound to be a controversial one for the german government which until now has steadfastly maintained that it does not want its peacekeeping troops embroiled in the growing fighting in afghanistan .
germany has elite special forces in afghanistan but has never disclosed where they operate , though it is generally believed that the ksk commandoes are in the south in direct conflict with taliban forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany sent tornado spy jets to afghanistan last month germany 's parliament needs to approve any military or peacekeeping deployment of its troops .
the current afghanistan mandate explicitly rules out german participation in combat missions .
earlier last month , germany sent six surveillance jets to afghanistan - amid misgivings among some opposition parties - to photograph taliban locations and support nato forces on the ground .
politicians want more open debate on friday , a few politicians raised doubts about the deployment and urged the government to openly discuss afghanistan 's request for troops .
" my spontaneous reaction is that this request from kabul is not covered by the parliamentary mandate for the isaf deployment , " karl lamers , defense expert of the governing christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the online site of der spiegel magazine .
claudia roth , head of the opposition green party said defense minister jung needed to inform parliament and the public about his decision .
" such a request -lrb- from afghanistan -rrb- belongs in the parliament and should not be clandestinely decided in the defense ministry , " roth said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german jets head for afghanistan amid mounting concerns german tornado jets and their crews deploy to afghanistan monday .
despite their well-publicized surveillance role , the new troops may soon find the taliban does not see a difference between combat and support .

can the hissing of a hot air balloon startle a brood of hens into near-infertility ?
a german farmer grappling with dwindling egg production on his farm certainly seemed to think so .
but he failed to convince a court . stranger things are known to happen in the animal world .
but the theory that a loud hot air balloon could have impaired the fertility of a brood of hens proved too much for a court in germany on friday .
it threw out the complaint by a german farmer against a dutch balloon pilot . the farmer was seeking 26,000 euros -lrb- $ 35,000 -rrb- in damages from the pilot 's insurance company .
the incident occurred in september 2004 , when the balloon pilot swooped low and passed over the farmer 's land in the village of nordhorn in the german state of lower saxony .
in an attempt to regain altitude , the pilot fired up his propane gas burner with a loud hiss causing panic among the farm 's 20,000 free-range hens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piloting a hot air balloon can sometimes have unforeseen consequences according to the farmer , some of the startled , squawking birds sprang over a two-meter fence while others tried to flee into coops .
the hens , the farmer said , had been scared badly .
their post-traumatic stress syndrome meant that a week and a half later , they were laying fewer eggs .
egg production dropped by almost 60 percent , the farmer said . the unusual theory was , however , refuted by a professor at a nearby veterinary college .
asked to testify by the court , the expert said that decreased egg production among hens was possible for up to two days after a major shock - but not ten days after as the farmer had claimed . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de star bear knut lands book deal to help save the planet baby polar bear knut is not only a cuddly cover boy and audience magnet , he 's about to become an environmental activist .

thomas raabe , spokesman for the minister , said in berlin the assistance was not an emergency and therefore was not covered by the current german parliamentary mandate authorizing over 3,000 troops currently stationed in afghanistan as a part of a nato-led international peacekeeping force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .

much of the technology already exists , but quick action is needed , according to the final report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc . -rrb- steps to control global warming would require less than 0.1 percent of world 's annual gross domestic product , according to the 24-page report released by the ipcc on friday in bangkok . " if we continue to do what we are doing now , we are in deep trouble , " said ogunlade davidson , co-chair of the ipcc .
" this report is all about solutions to climate change . " the report presented a best-case scenario of limiting global warming to 2.0-2.4 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6-4.3 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , which is generally recognized as the threshold to avoiding the most extreme consequences of climate change . co2 reduction still possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ipcc cited wind energy as an important existing technlolgy there is " substantial " potential for the world to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below current levels without crippling the global economy since many of the tools already exist and could be quickly implemented , the report said . harnessing more solar , wind , and hydro-power could have a large effect on reducing greenhouse gasses , the report said . nascent technology that could store carbon dioxide , the most abundant greenhouse gas , underground is also mentioned by the report , as are tariffs and other economic mechanisms to make using fossil fuels more expensive and lower prices for renewable energy use .
" there is substantial economic potential for the mitigation of global greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades , " the report said , adding that greenhouse emissions would have to be cut to between 50 and 85 percent of year 2000 levels by 2050 to keep the world in line with the report 's best-case scenario .
consensus exists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar energy is increasingly popular in europe after intense debate , climate experts and representatives from 105 countries reached a consensus on the ipcc document friday .
final approval had been held up by few key sticking points and the complexity of the document , according to participants . the cost of reducing greenhouse gases that cause global warming was one of the biggest disputes , with china expressing concern about the economic impact of cutting back , one european delegate said .
another matter of contention was how much importance to give nuclear energy in the mix of new technologies that the world could use in a shift away from fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases , the european delegate said . next up : the g8 summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors in bangkok demanded governments take action on climate change the report is the ipcc 's third and last for the year .
the first two reports looked into the evidence for and impacts of global warming .
" it has been shown for the first time that stopping climate pollution in a very ambitious way does not cost a fortune , " said stephan singer of the world wildlife fund .
" there is no excuse for any government to argue that it is going to cause their economy to collapse . " " it 's a great report and the conclusions are quite strong , " said greenpeace 's bill hare , one of the led authors of report .
though he admitted that it 's " a little hard to read . "
after the bangkok ipcc talks , the next two important meetings for climate change are the june summit of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialized countries in germany and an end-of-the-year environmental summit in bali to set world targets on emissions reductions .
" we have no time to lose , " german environment minister sigmar gabriel said friday .

thomas raabe , spokesman for the minister , said in berlin the assistance was not an emergency and therefore was not covered by the current german parliamentary mandate authorizing over 3,000 troops currently stationed in afghanistan as a part of a nato-led international peacekeeping force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
germany 's ground troops are only authorized to operate in kabul and the north of afghanistan , though the german air force flies reconnaissance missions above the fighting in the south .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peacekeepers in afghanistan are largely confined to the capital kabul kabul had urgently asked for the 19 germans as part of an afghan army infantry battalion based in kundus in the north which is being redeployed to kandahar , a province which is the scene of intense fighting between alliance forces and a resurgent taliban .
the 19 germans are among 60 german soldiers selected to train the afghan unit .
a german television channel , zdf , has reported that the battalion is set to move out saturday or sunday .
controversial request kabul 's request was bound to be a controversial one for the german government which until now has steadfastly maintained that it does not want its peacekeeping troops embroiled in the growing fighting in afghanistan .
germany has elite special forces in afghanistan but has never disclosed where they operate , though it is generally believed that the ksk commandoes are in the south in direct conflict with taliban forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany sent tornado spy jets to afghanistan last month germany 's parliament needs to approve any military or peacekeeping deployment of its troops .
the current afghanistan mandate explicitly rules out german participation in combat missions .
earlier last month , germany sent six surveillance jets to afghanistan - amid misgivings among some opposition parties - to photograph taliban locations and support nato forces on the ground .

thomas raabe , spokesman for the minister , said in berlin the assistance was not an emergency and therefore was not covered by the current german parliamentary mandate authorizing over 3,000 troops currently stationed in afghanistan as a part of a nato-led international peacekeeping force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
germany 's ground troops are only authorized to operate in kabul and the north of afghanistan , though the german air force flies reconnaissance missions above the fighting in the south .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german peacekeepers in afghanistan are largely confined to the capital kabul kabul had urgently asked for the 19 germans as part of an afghan army infantry battalion based in kundus in the north which is being redeployed to kandahar , a province which is the scene of intense fighting between alliance forces and a resurgent taliban .
the 19 germans are among 60 german soldiers selected to train the afghan unit .
a german television channel , zdf , has reported that the battalion is set to move out saturday or sunday .
controversial request kabul 's request was bound to be a controversial one for the german government which until now has steadfastly maintained that it does not want its peacekeeping troops embroiled in the growing fighting in afghanistan .
germany has elite special forces in afghanistan but has never disclosed where they operate , though it is generally believed that the ksk commandoes are in the south in direct conflict with taliban forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany sent tornado spy jets to afghanistan last month germany 's parliament needs to approve any military or peacekeeping deployment of its troops .
the current afghanistan mandate explicitly rules out german participation in combat missions .
earlier last month , germany sent six surveillance jets to afghanistan - amid misgivings among some opposition parties - to photograph taliban locations and support nato forces on the ground .
politicians want more open debate on friday , a few politicians raised doubts about the deployment and urged the government to openly discuss afghanistan 's request for troops .
" my spontaneous reaction is that this request from kabul is not covered by the parliamentary mandate for the isaf deployment , " karl lamers , defense expert of the governing christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the online site of der spiegel magazine .
claudia roth , head of the opposition green party said defense minister jung needed to inform parliament and the public about his decision .
" such a request -lrb- from afghanistan -rrb- belongs in the parliament and should not be clandestinely decided in the defense ministry , " roth said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german jets head for afghanistan amid mounting concerns german tornado jets and their crews deploy to afghanistan monday .
despite their well-publicized surveillance role , the new troops may soon find the taliban does not see a difference between combat and support .
-lrb- 02.04.2007 -rrb- will germany join the fight against the taliban ?
germany faces a difficult decision about deploying tornado fighter jets in southern afghanistan .
defense minister franz josef jung said the mission could begin in april , but only if the bundestag agrees .
-lrb- 06.02.2007 -rrb- german parliament backs reconnaissance mission to afghanistan germany 's parliament approved on friday a plan to deploy six tornado jets to provide reconnaissance assistance to nato troops in southern afghanistan ahead of an expected spring offensive by insurgents .

the study also revealed that there were 30 fewer drug-related deaths last year compared to 2005 , a large decrease from the 2,030 deaths recorded in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deaths caused by drugs like cocaine and heroin are down despite the good news on those fronts , federal drug commissioner sabine baetzing said drugs continue to be a serious problem that should not be ignored .

according to baetzing , the use of soft drugs is becoming more and more acceptable in the german society . " the relaxed view of everyday drugs like tobacco , alcohol and prescription drugs in particular leads to immeasurable , often silent and unnoticed suffering for those addicted , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 04.05.2007 german metalworkers win pay hike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metalworkers demonstrated for higher wagers germany 's powerful ig metall union won a 4.1 percent pay raise for its 3.4 million members .
the increase is not expected to hurt the german economy , which has shown strong growth rates in 2007 . the last-minute agreement between the union and employers averted a strike .
the deal was reached during 20 hours of negotiations with employers in the south german state of baden-würtenberg , but will be applied across germany .
besides the 4.1 percent raise this year , workers can expect an additional 1.7 percent a year later .
workers will also receive payments of 400 euros for the last two months before the agreement goes into effect on june 1 .
initially , the metalworkers ' union ig metall demanded a 6.5 percent increase .
employers countered with a 2.5 percent increase and a 0.5 percent bonus .
analysts said the agreement was positive for both employer and workers .
it is not likely to worry european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- policymakers concerned about risks to price stability .
" the wage rise has come in lower than generally expected , " said eckart tuchtfeld , an economist at commerzbank in frankfurt , told reuters .
" ecb fears of excessive wage pressure in germany and the resulting risk to inflation should ease as a result . "
" fears that wages would rise excessively did n't come true , " said stefan bielmeier , an economist at frankfurt-based deutsche bank ag , told the bloomberg news service .
" we stick to our estimate that ecb interest rates will rise to 4 percent in june and no further afterwards . "
economists have been closely watching the ig metall negotiations , with many fearful that handing out big pay hikes could slow germany 's economic growth .
stefan bielmeier at deutsche bank said the deal would equal a wage increase of 3.5 percent for 2007 in a country where inflation is currently just below two percent .
" that means the sector will remain competitive , " he told reuters .
" it also means more purchasing power for employees .
both together are good for the economy . "
union pleased with deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german metalworkers last launched a strike in 2002 " a nice sum of money will be going into the wallets of employees , " said negotiator jörg hofmann .
the union had put pressure on employers with temporary work stoppages and had threatened to strike if a deal was not reached quickly .
" i think it was very important for firms to avoid strikes , because business is booming just now and they 've been racking up huge amounts of orders , " bernd weidensteiner at dz bank told reuters .
" full-scale industrial action would have been poison for firms , so if you look at it from that perspective , they 've gotten off pretty lightly , " he said .
in 2002 , more than 200,000 ig metall union members participated in strikes .
carmakers daimlerchrysler , porsche and audi , truck maker man and french-american telecoms equipment company alcatel-lucent are among firms which faced work stoppages this year .
economy continues to boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers wanted a wage increase of more than 5 percent employers had wanted to keep the pay raise under 4 percent , but did n't complain after the deal was announced friday .
" it is balanced and appropriate given that the economy is doing exceptionally well , " said stefan roell , who represented the state of baden-württemberg in the talks .
after years of gloom , the german government last month raised its growth forecast for 2007 to 2.3 percent , representing a clear improvement on its previous prediction of 1.7 percent .
consumer sentiment and business confidence indices in the euro zone 's biggest economy have also shown sharp rises recently . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powerful unions launch warning strikes with more to come thousands of workers downed tools after the ig metall trade union called strikes to step up pressure for wage talks in the electrical , engineering and metalworking sectors .

the increase is not expected to hurt the german economy , which has shown strong growth rates in 2007 . the last-minute agreement between the union and employers averted a strike .
the deal was reached during 20 hours of negotiations with employers in the south german state of baden-würtenberg , but will be applied across germany .
besides the 4.1 percent raise this year , workers can expect an additional 1.7 percent a year later .
workers will also receive payments of 400 euros for the last two months before the agreement goes into effect on june 1 .
initially , the metalworkers ' union ig metall demanded a 6.5 percent increase .
employers countered with a 2.5 percent increase and a 0.5 percent bonus .
analysts said the agreement was positive for both employer and workers .
it is not likely to worry european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- policymakers concerned about risks to price stability .
" the wage rise has come in lower than generally expected , " said eckart tuchtfeld , an economist at commerzbank in frankfurt , told reuters .
" ecb fears of excessive wage pressure in germany and the resulting risk to inflation should ease as a result . "
" fears that wages would rise excessively did n't come true , " said stefan bielmeier , an economist at frankfurt-based deutsche bank ag , told the bloomberg news service .
" we stick to our estimate that ecb interest rates will rise to 4 percent in june and no further afterwards . "
economists have been closely watching the ig metall negotiations , with many fearful that handing out big pay hikes could slow germany 's economic growth .
stefan bielmeier at deutsche bank said the deal would equal a wage increase of 3.5 percent for 2007 in a country where inflation is currently just below two percent .
" that means the sector will remain competitive , " he told reuters .
" it also means more purchasing power for employees .
both together are good for the economy . "
union pleased with deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german metalworkers last launched a strike in 2002 " a nice sum of money will be going into the wallets of employees , " said negotiator jörg hofmann .
the union had put pressure on employers with temporary work stoppages and had threatened to strike if a deal was not reached quickly .
" i think it was very important for firms to avoid strikes , because business is booming just now and they 've been racking up huge amounts of orders , " bernd weidensteiner at dz bank told reuters .
" full-scale industrial action would have been poison for firms , so if you look at it from that perspective , they 've gotten off pretty lightly , " he said .
in 2002 , more than 200,000 ig metall union members participated in strikes .
carmakers daimlerchrysler , porsche and audi , truck maker man and french-american telecoms equipment company alcatel-lucent are among firms which faced work stoppages this year .
economy continues to boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers wanted a wage increase of more than 5 percent employers had wanted to keep the pay raise under 4 percent , but did n't complain after the deal was announced friday .
" it is balanced and appropriate given that the economy is doing exceptionally well , " said stefan roell , who represented the state of baden-württemberg in the talks .
after years of gloom , the german government last month raised its growth forecast for 2007 to 2.3 percent , representing a clear improvement on its previous prediction of 1.7 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 04.05.2007 german metalworkers win pay hike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metalworkers demonstrated for higher wagers germany 's powerful ig metall union won a 4.1 percent pay raise for its 3.4 million members .
the increase is not expected to hurt the german economy , which has shown strong growth rates in 2007 . the last-minute agreement between the union and employers averted a strike .
the deal was reached during 20 hours of negotiations with employers in the south german state of baden-würtenberg , but will be applied across germany .
besides the 4.1 percent raise this year , workers can expect an additional 1.7 percent a year later .
workers will also receive payments of 400 euros for the last two months before the agreement goes into effect on june 1 .
initially , the metalworkers ' union ig metall demanded a 6.5 percent increase .
employers countered with a 2.5 percent increase and a 0.5 percent bonus .
analysts said the agreement was positive for both employer and workers .
it is not likely to worry european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- policymakers concerned about risks to price stability .
" the wage rise has come in lower than generally expected , " said eckart tuchtfeld , an economist at commerzbank in frankfurt , told reuters .
" ecb fears of excessive wage pressure in germany and the resulting risk to inflation should ease as a result . "
" fears that wages would rise excessively did n't come true , " said stefan bielmeier , an economist at frankfurt-based deutsche bank ag , told the bloomberg news service .
" we stick to our estimate that ecb interest rates will rise to 4 percent in june and no further afterwards . "
economists have been closely watching the ig metall negotiations , with many fearful that handing out big pay hikes could slow germany 's economic growth .
stefan bielmeier at deutsche bank said the deal would equal a wage increase of 3.5 percent for 2007 in a country where inflation is currently just below two percent .
" that means the sector will remain competitive , " he told reuters .
" it also means more purchasing power for employees .
both together are good for the economy . "
union pleased with deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german metalworkers last launched a strike in 2002 " a nice sum of money will be going into the wallets of employees , " said negotiator jörg hofmann .
the union had put pressure on employers with temporary work stoppages and had threatened to strike if a deal was not reached quickly .
" i think it was very important for firms to avoid strikes , because business is booming just now and they 've been racking up huge amounts of orders , " bernd weidensteiner at dz bank told reuters .
" full-scale industrial action would have been poison for firms , so if you look at it from that perspective , they 've gotten off pretty lightly , " he said .
in 2002 , more than 200,000 ig metall union members participated in strikes .
carmakers daimlerchrysler , porsche and audi , truck maker man and french-american telecoms equipment company alcatel-lucent are among firms which faced work stoppages this year .
economy continues to boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers wanted a wage increase of more than 5 percent employers had wanted to keep the pay raise under 4 percent , but did n't complain after the deal was announced friday .
" it is balanced and appropriate given that the economy is doing exceptionally well , " said stefan roell , who represented the state of baden-württemberg in the talks .

can the hissing of a hot air balloon startle a brood of hens into near-infertility ?
a german farmer grappling with dwindling egg production on his farm certainly seemed to think so .
but he failed to convince a court . stranger things are known to happen in the animal world .
but the theory that a loud hot air balloon could have impaired the fertility of a brood of hens proved too much for a court in germany on friday .
it threw out the complaint by a german farmer against a dutch balloon pilot . the farmer was seeking 26,000 euros -lrb- $ 35,000 -rrb- in damages from the pilot 's insurance company .
the incident occurred in september 2004 , when the balloon pilot swooped low and passed over the farmer 's land in the village of nordhorn in the german state of lower saxony .
in an attempt to regain altitude , the pilot fired up his propane gas burner with a loud hiss causing panic among the farm 's 20,000 free-range hens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piloting a hot air balloon can sometimes have unforeseen consequences according to the farmer , some of the startled , squawking birds sprang over a two-meter fence while others tried to flee into coops .
the hens , the farmer said , had been scared badly .
their post-traumatic stress syndrome meant that a week and a half later , they were laying fewer eggs .
egg production dropped by almost 60 percent , the farmer said . the unusual theory was , however , refuted by a professor at a nearby veterinary college .
asked to testify by the court , the expert said that decreased egg production among hens was possible for up to two days after a major shock - but not ten days after as the farmer had claimed . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de star bear knut lands book deal to help save the planet baby polar bear knut is not only a cuddly cover boy and audience magnet , he 's about to become an environmental activist .

can the hissing of a hot air balloon startle a brood of hens into near-infertility ?
a german farmer grappling with dwindling egg production on his farm certainly seemed to think so .
but he failed to convince a court . stranger things are known to happen in the animal world .
but the theory that a loud hot air balloon could have impaired the fertility of a brood of hens proved too much for a court in germany on friday .
it threw out the complaint by a german farmer against a dutch balloon pilot . the farmer was seeking 26,000 euros -lrb- $ 35,000 -rrb- in damages from the pilot 's insurance company .
the incident occurred in september 2004 , when the balloon pilot swooped low and passed over the farmer 's land in the village of nordhorn in the german state of lower saxony .
in an attempt to regain altitude , the pilot fired up his propane gas burner with a loud hiss causing panic among the farm 's 20,000 free-range hens .

the hens , the farmer said , had been scared badly .
their post-traumatic stress syndrome meant that a week and a half later , they were laying fewer eggs .
egg production dropped by almost 60 percent , the farmer said . the unusual theory was , however , refuted by a professor at a nearby veterinary college .

much of the technology already exists , but quick action is needed , according to the final report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc . -rrb- steps to control global warming would require less than 0.1 percent of world 's annual gross domestic product , according to the 24-page report released by the ipcc on friday in bangkok . " if we continue to do what we are doing now , we are in deep trouble , " said ogunlade davidson , co-chair of the ipcc .
" this report is all about solutions to climate change . " the report presented a best-case scenario of limiting global warming to 2.0-2.4 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6-4.3 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , which is generally recognized as the threshold to avoiding the most extreme consequences of climate change . co2 reduction still possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ipcc cited wind energy as an important existing technlolgy there is " substantial " potential for the world to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below current levels without crippling the global economy since many of the tools already exist and could be quickly implemented , the report said . harnessing more solar , wind , and hydro-power could have a large effect on reducing greenhouse gasses , the report said . nascent technology that could store carbon dioxide , the most abundant greenhouse gas , underground is also mentioned by the report , as are tariffs and other economic mechanisms to make using fossil fuels more expensive and lower prices for renewable energy use .
" there is substantial economic potential for the mitigation of global greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades , " the report said , adding that greenhouse emissions would have to be cut to between 50 and 85 percent of year 2000 levels by 2050 to keep the world in line with the report 's best-case scenario .
consensus exists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar energy is increasingly popular in europe after intense debate , climate experts and representatives from 105 countries reached a consensus on the ipcc document friday .
final approval had been held up by few key sticking points and the complexity of the document , according to participants . the cost of reducing greenhouse gases that cause global warming was one of the biggest disputes , with china expressing concern about the economic impact of cutting back , one european delegate said .
another matter of contention was how much importance to give nuclear energy in the mix of new technologies that the world could use in a shift away from fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases , the european delegate said . next up : the g8 summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors in bangkok demanded governments take action on climate change the report is the ipcc 's third and last for the year .
the first two reports looked into the evidence for and impacts of global warming .
" it has been shown for the first time that stopping climate pollution in a very ambitious way does not cost a fortune , " said stephan singer of the world wildlife fund .
" there is no excuse for any government to argue that it is going to cause their economy to collapse . " " it 's a great report and the conclusions are quite strong , " said greenpeace 's bill hare , one of the led authors of report .
though he admitted that it 's " a little hard to read . "
after the bangkok ipcc talks , the next two important meetings for climate change are the june summit of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrialized countries in germany and an end-of-the-year environmental summit in bali to set world targets on emissions reductions .
" we have no time to lose , " german environment minister sigmar gabriel said friday .
" it 's important that we set the right course at the climate conference in bali in december . " dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : climate change poses serious challenge for europe the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that the world 's poorest countries will be affected most by climate change .

the increase is not expected to hurt the german economy , which has shown strong growth rates in 2007 . the last-minute agreement between the union and employers averted a strike .
the deal was reached during 20 hours of negotiations with employers in the south german state of baden-würtenberg , but will be applied across germany .
besides the 4.1 percent raise this year , workers can expect an additional 1.7 percent a year later .
workers will also receive payments of 400 euros for the last two months before the agreement goes into effect on june 1 .
initially , the metalworkers ' union ig metall demanded a 6.5 percent increase .
employers countered with a 2.5 percent increase and a 0.5 percent bonus .
analysts said the agreement was positive for both employer and workers .
it is not likely to worry european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- policymakers concerned about risks to price stability .
" the wage rise has come in lower than generally expected , " said eckart tuchtfeld , an economist at commerzbank in frankfurt , told reuters .
" ecb fears of excessive wage pressure in germany and the resulting risk to inflation should ease as a result . "
" fears that wages would rise excessively did n't come true , " said stefan bielmeier , an economist at frankfurt-based deutsche bank ag , told the bloomberg news service .
" we stick to our estimate that ecb interest rates will rise to 4 percent in june and no further afterwards . "
economists have been closely watching the ig metall negotiations , with many fearful that handing out big pay hikes could slow germany 's economic growth .
stefan bielmeier at deutsche bank said the deal would equal a wage increase of 3.5 percent for 2007 in a country where inflation is currently just below two percent .
" that means the sector will remain competitive , " he told reuters .
" it also means more purchasing power for employees .
both together are good for the economy . "
union pleased with deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german metalworkers last launched a strike in 2002 " a nice sum of money will be going into the wallets of employees , " said negotiator jörg hofmann .
the union had put pressure on employers with temporary work stoppages and had threatened to strike if a deal was not reached quickly .
" i think it was very important for firms to avoid strikes , because business is booming just now and they 've been racking up huge amounts of orders , " bernd weidensteiner at dz bank told reuters .
" full-scale industrial action would have been poison for firms , so if you look at it from that perspective , they 've gotten off pretty lightly , " he said .
in 2002 , more than 200,000 ig metall union members participated in strikes .
carmakers daimlerchrysler , porsche and audi , truck maker man and french-american telecoms equipment company alcatel-lucent are among firms which faced work stoppages this year .
economy continues to boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers wanted a wage increase of more than 5 percent employers had wanted to keep the pay raise under 4 percent , but did n't complain after the deal was announced friday .
" it is balanced and appropriate given that the economy is doing exceptionally well , " said stefan roell , who represented the state of baden-württemberg in the talks .
after years of gloom , the german government last month raised its growth forecast for 2007 to 2.3 percent , representing a clear improvement on its previous prediction of 1.7 percent .

the increase is not expected to hurt the german economy , which has shown strong growth rates in 2007 . the last-minute agreement between the union and employers averted a strike .
the deal was reached during 20 hours of negotiations with employers in the south german state of baden-würtenberg , but will be applied across germany .
besides the 4.1 percent raise this year , workers can expect an additional 1.7 percent a year later .
workers will also receive payments of 400 euros for the last two months before the agreement goes into effect on june 1 .
initially , the metalworkers ' union ig metall demanded a 6.5 percent increase .
employers countered with a 2.5 percent increase and a 0.5 percent bonus .
analysts said the agreement was positive for both employer and workers .
it is not likely to worry european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- policymakers concerned about risks to price stability .
" the wage rise has come in lower than generally expected , " said eckart tuchtfeld , an economist at commerzbank in frankfurt , told reuters .
" ecb fears of excessive wage pressure in germany and the resulting risk to inflation should ease as a result . "
" fears that wages would rise excessively did n't come true , " said stefan bielmeier , an economist at frankfurt-based deutsche bank ag , told the bloomberg news service .
" we stick to our estimate that ecb interest rates will rise to 4 percent in june and no further afterwards . "
economists have been closely watching the ig metall negotiations , with many fearful that handing out big pay hikes could slow germany 's economic growth .
stefan bielmeier at deutsche bank said the deal would equal a wage increase of 3.5 percent for 2007 in a country where inflation is currently just below two percent .
" that means the sector will remain competitive , " he told reuters .
" it also means more purchasing power for employees .
both together are good for the economy . "

" if we continue to do what we are doing now , we are in deep trouble , " said ogunlade davidson , co-chair of the ipcc .
" this report is all about solutions to climate change . " the report presented a best-case scenario of limiting global warming to 2.0-2.4 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6-4.3 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , which is generally recognized as the threshold to avoiding the most extreme consequences of climate change . co2 reduction still possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ipcc cited wind energy as an important existing technlolgy there is " substantial " potential for the world to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below current levels without crippling the global economy since many of the tools already exist and could be quickly implemented , the report said . harnessing more solar , wind , and hydro-power could have a large effect on reducing greenhouse gasses , the report said . nascent technology that could store carbon dioxide , the most abundant greenhouse gas , underground is also mentioned by the report , as are tariffs and other economic mechanisms to make using fossil fuels more expensive and lower prices for renewable energy use .
" there is substantial economic potential for the mitigation of global greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades , " the report said , adding that greenhouse emissions would have to be cut to between 50 and 85 percent of year 2000 levels by 2050 to keep the world in line with the report 's best-case scenario .

final approval had been held up by few key sticking points and the complexity of the document , according to participants . the cost of reducing greenhouse gases that cause global warming was one of the biggest disputes , with china expressing concern about the economic impact of cutting back , one european delegate said .
another matter of contention was how much importance to give nuclear energy in the mix of new technologies that the world could use in a shift away from fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases , the european delegate said . next up : the g8 summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors in bangkok demanded governments take action on climate change the report is the ipcc 's third and last for the year .

can the hissing of a hot air balloon startle a brood of hens into near-infertility ?
a german farmer grappling with dwindling egg production on his farm certainly seemed to think so .
but he failed to convince a court . stranger things are known to happen in the animal world .
but the theory that a loud hot air balloon could have impaired the fertility of a brood of hens proved too much for a court in germany on friday .
it threw out the complaint by a german farmer against a dutch balloon pilot . the farmer was seeking 26,000 euros -lrb- $ 35,000 -rrb- in damages from the pilot 's insurance company .
the incident occurred in september 2004 , when the balloon pilot swooped low and passed over the farmer 's land in the village of nordhorn in the german state of lower saxony .
in an attempt to regain altitude , the pilot fired up his propane gas burner with a loud hiss causing panic among the farm 's 20,000 free-range hens .

their post-traumatic stress syndrome meant that a week and a half later , they were laying fewer eggs .

thomas raabe , spokesman for the minister , said in berlin the assistance was not an emergency and therefore was not covered by the current german parliamentary mandate authorizing over 3,000 troops currently stationed in afghanistan as a part of a nato-led international peacekeeping force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
germany 's ground troops are only authorized to operate in kabul and the north of afghanistan , though the german air force flies reconnaissance missions above the fighting in the south .

the 19 germans are among 60 german soldiers selected to train the afghan unit .
a german television channel , zdf , has reported that the battalion is set to move out saturday or sunday .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany sent tornado spy jets to afghanistan last month germany 's parliament needs to approve any military or peacekeeping deployment of its troops .
the current afghanistan mandate explicitly rules out german participation in combat missions .
earlier last month , germany sent six surveillance jets to afghanistan - amid misgivings among some opposition parties - to photograph taliban locations and support nato forces on the ground .

can the hissing of a hot air balloon startle a brood of hens into near-infertility ?
a german farmer grappling with dwindling egg production on his farm certainly seemed to think so .
but he failed to convince a court . stranger things are known to happen in the animal world .
but the theory that a loud hot air balloon could have impaired the fertility of a brood of hens proved too much for a court in germany on friday .
it threw out the complaint by a german farmer against a dutch balloon pilot . the farmer was seeking 26,000 euros -lrb- $ 35,000 -rrb- in damages from the pilot 's insurance company .
the incident occurred in september 2004 , when the balloon pilot swooped low and passed over the farmer 's land in the village of nordhorn in the german state of lower saxony .
in an attempt to regain altitude , the pilot fired up his propane gas burner with a loud hiss causing panic among the farm 's 20,000 free-range hens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piloting a hot air balloon can sometimes have unforeseen consequences according to the farmer , some of the startled , squawking birds sprang over a two-meter fence while others tried to flee into coops .
the hens , the farmer said , had been scared badly .
their post-traumatic stress syndrome meant that a week and a half later , they were laying fewer eggs .
egg production dropped by almost 60 percent , the farmer said . the unusual theory was , however , refuted by a professor at a nearby veterinary college .
asked to testify by the court , the expert said that decreased egg production among hens was possible for up to two days after a major shock - but not ten days after as the farmer had claimed . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de star bear knut lands book deal to help save the planet baby polar bear knut is not only a cuddly cover boy and audience magnet , he 's about to become an environmental activist .

thomas raabe , spokesman for the minister , said in berlin the assistance was not an emergency and therefore was not covered by the current german parliamentary mandate authorizing over 3,000 troops currently stationed in afghanistan as a part of a nato-led international peacekeeping force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
germany 's ground troops are only authorized to operate in kabul and the north of afghanistan , though the german air force flies reconnaissance missions above the fighting in the south .

the 19 germans are among 60 german soldiers selected to train the afghan unit .
a german television channel , zdf , has reported that the battalion is set to move out saturday or sunday .
controversial request kabul 's request was bound to be a controversial one for the german government which until now has steadfastly maintained that it does not want its peacekeeping troops embroiled in the growing fighting in afghanistan .

can the hissing of a hot air balloon startle a brood of hens into near-infertility ?
a german farmer grappling with dwindling egg production on his farm certainly seemed to think so .
but he failed to convince a court . stranger things are known to happen in the animal world .
but the theory that a loud hot air balloon could have impaired the fertility of a brood of hens proved too much for a court in germany on friday .
it threw out the complaint by a german farmer against a dutch balloon pilot . the farmer was seeking 26,000 euros -lrb- $ 35,000 -rrb- in damages from the pilot 's insurance company .
the incident occurred in september 2004 , when the balloon pilot swooped low and passed over the farmer 's land in the village of nordhorn in the german state of lower saxony .
in an attempt to regain altitude , the pilot fired up his propane gas burner with a loud hiss causing panic among the farm 's 20,000 free-range hens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piloting a hot air balloon can sometimes have unforeseen consequences according to the farmer , some of the startled , squawking birds sprang over a two-meter fence while others tried to flee into coops .
the hens , the farmer said , had been scared badly .
their post-traumatic stress syndrome meant that a week and a half later , they were laying fewer eggs .
egg production dropped by almost 60 percent , the farmer said . the unusual theory was , however , refuted by a professor at a nearby veterinary college .
asked to testify by the court , the expert said that decreased egg production among hens was possible for up to two days after a major shock - but not ten days after as the farmer had claimed . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de star bear knut lands book deal to help save the planet baby polar bear knut is not only a cuddly cover boy and audience magnet , he 's about to become an environmental activist .

the estonian government maintains that the vacation has been planned since the end of april .
" there are no political or health reasons for the vacation , " said a spokesperson for the estonian government .

the increase is not expected to hurt the german economy , which has shown strong growth rates in 2007 . the last-minute agreement between the union and employers averted a strike .
the deal was reached during 20 hours of negotiations with employers in the south german state of baden-würtenberg , but will be applied across germany .
besides the 4.1 percent raise this year , workers can expect an additional 1.7 percent a year later .
workers will also receive payments of 400 euros for the last two months before the agreement goes into effect on june 1 .
initially , the metalworkers ' union ig metall demanded a 6.5 percent increase .
employers countered with a 2.5 percent increase and a 0.5 percent bonus .
analysts said the agreement was positive for both employer and workers .
it is not likely to worry european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- policymakers concerned about risks to price stability .
" the wage rise has come in lower than generally expected , " said eckart tuchtfeld , an economist at commerzbank in frankfurt , told reuters .
" ecb fears of excessive wage pressure in germany and the resulting risk to inflation should ease as a result . "
" fears that wages would rise excessively did n't come true , " said stefan bielmeier , an economist at frankfurt-based deutsche bank ag , told the bloomberg news service .
" we stick to our estimate that ecb interest rates will rise to 4 percent in june and no further afterwards . "
economists have been closely watching the ig metall negotiations , with many fearful that handing out big pay hikes could slow germany 's economic growth .
stefan bielmeier at deutsche bank said the deal would equal a wage increase of 3.5 percent for 2007 in a country where inflation is currently just below two percent .
" that means the sector will remain competitive , " he told reuters .
" it also means more purchasing power for employees .
both together are good for the economy . "
union pleased with deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german metalworkers last launched a strike in 2002 " a nice sum of money will be going into the wallets of employees , " said negotiator jörg hofmann .
the union had put pressure on employers with temporary work stoppages and had threatened to strike if a deal was not reached quickly .
" i think it was very important for firms to avoid strikes , because business is booming just now and they 've been racking up huge amounts of orders , " bernd weidensteiner at dz bank told reuters .
" full-scale industrial action would have been poison for firms , so if you look at it from that perspective , they 've gotten off pretty lightly , " he said .
in 2002 , more than 200,000 ig metall union members participated in strikes .
carmakers daimlerchrysler , porsche and audi , truck maker man and french-american telecoms equipment company alcatel-lucent are among firms which faced work stoppages this year .
economy continues to boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers wanted a wage increase of more than 5 percent employers had wanted to keep the pay raise under 4 percent , but did n't complain after the deal was announced friday .
" it is balanced and appropriate given that the economy is doing exceptionally well , " said stefan roell , who represented the state of baden-württemberg in the talks .
after years of gloom , the german government last month raised its growth forecast for 2007 to 2.3 percent , representing a clear improvement on its previous prediction of 1.7 percent .

" the wage rise has come in lower than generally expected , " said eckart tuchtfeld , an economist at commerzbank in frankfurt , told reuters .
" ecb fears of excessive wage pressure in germany and the resulting risk to inflation should ease as a result . "
" fears that wages would rise excessively did n't come true , " said stefan bielmeier , an economist at frankfurt-based deutsche bank ag , told the bloomberg news service .
" we stick to our estimate that ecb interest rates will rise to 4 percent in june and no further afterwards . "
economists have been closely watching the ig metall negotiations , with many fearful that handing out big pay hikes could slow germany 's economic growth .
stefan bielmeier at deutsche bank said the deal would equal a wage increase of 3.5 percent for 2007 in a country where inflation is currently just below two percent .
" that means the sector will remain competitive , " he told reuters .
" it also means more purchasing power for employees .
both together are good for the economy . "
union pleased with deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german metalworkers last launched a strike in 2002 " a nice sum of money will be going into the wallets of employees , " said negotiator jörg hofmann .
the union had put pressure on employers with temporary work stoppages and had threatened to strike if a deal was not reached quickly .
" i think it was very important for firms to avoid strikes , because business is booming just now and they 've been racking up huge amounts of orders , " bernd weidensteiner at dz bank told reuters .
" full-scale industrial action would have been poison for firms , so if you look at it from that perspective , they 've gotten off pretty lightly , " he said .
in 2002 , more than 200,000 ig metall union members participated in strikes .
carmakers daimlerchrysler , porsche and audi , truck maker man and french-american telecoms equipment company alcatel-lucent are among firms which faced work stoppages this year .
economy continues to boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers wanted a wage increase of more than 5 percent employers had wanted to keep the pay raise under 4 percent , but did n't complain after the deal was announced friday .
" it is balanced and appropriate given that the economy is doing exceptionally well , " said stefan roell , who represented the state of baden-württemberg in the talks .
after years of gloom , the german government last month raised its growth forecast for 2007 to 2.3 percent , representing a clear improvement on its previous prediction of 1.7 percent .
consumer sentiment and business confidence indices in the euro zone 's biggest economy have also shown sharp rises recently . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powerful unions launch warning strikes with more to come thousands of workers downed tools after the ig metall trade union called strikes to step up pressure for wage talks in the electrical , engineering and metalworking sectors .

the study also revealed that there were 30 fewer drug-related deaths last year compared to 2005 , a large decrease from the 2,030 deaths recorded in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deaths caused by drugs like cocaine and heroin are down despite the good news on those fronts , federal drug commissioner sabine baetzing said drugs continue to be a serious problem that should not be ignored . " the containment of drug and addiction problems remains one of the most important political and societal challenges in germany , " baetzing said in a statement . the number of first-time users of hard drugs like heroin and cocaine also declined in 2006 . soft drugs a problem while the report documented some successes against hard drugs , it also highlighted germany ’ s continued problems in managing addiction to so-called " soft " drugs like tobacco , alcohol and prescription drugs .
according to baetzing , the use of soft drugs is becoming more and more acceptable in the german society . " the relaxed view of everyday drugs like tobacco , alcohol and prescription drugs in particular leads to immeasurable , often silent and unnoticed suffering for those addicted , " she said .

according to baetzing , the drug commissioner , more focus must be put on the research and treatment for people suffering under their addictions to prescription drugs .

vigils were held by journalists in london , china and indonesia to call for the release of mr johnston , who has been missing for more than seven weeks .
at a rally at the un headquarters in new york , its deputy chief said the abduction " served no purpose " .
secretary general ban ki-moon , in egypt , also called for his release .
father 's message in new york , un deputy secretary-general asha-rose migiro told about 100 gathered demonstrators : " no cause is served by alan 's captivity . "
the un officials and journalists - including bbc news world editor jon williams and martin bashir from us tv network abc news - held a minute 's silence .
many countries have joined the campaign for alan johnston mr williams said : " gaza is not an easy place to work ...
he stayed so long - and after so many colleagues had left - because he wanted to tell the story of gaza to the world . "
in the indonesian capital , jakarta , reporters , diplomats and human rights activists gathered in a park at dusk and lit candles in support of mr johnston 's release .
a british embassy official read out a message from mr johnston 's father , graham .
" there is so much sympathy for our plight around the globe and we are overwhelmed at such support , all of which has helped to buoy us during these past seemingly interminable weeks , " the letter said .
journalists in beijing also gathered at sunset to light candles and hold a minute 's silence for mr johnston , who was seized after leaving his office in gaza city on 12 march .
mr ban said he had been following " with dismay " the case of mr johnston , and again appealed for his immediate and safe release .
he widened the issue on world press freedom day , saying : " alarmingly , in seeking to shed light on the plight of others , journalists themselves become targets .

vigils were held by journalists in london , china and indonesia to call for the release of mr johnston , who has been missing for more than seven weeks .
at a rally at the un headquarters in new york , its deputy chief said the abduction " served no purpose " .
secretary general ban ki-moon , in egypt , also called for his release .
father 's message in new york , un deputy secretary-general asha-rose migiro told about 100 gathered demonstrators : " no cause is served by alan 's captivity . "
the un officials and journalists - including bbc news world editor jon williams and martin bashir from us tv network abc news - held a minute 's silence .
mr williams said : " gaza is not an easy place to work ...
he stayed so long - and after so many colleagues had left - because he wanted to tell the story of gaza to the world . "
in the indonesian capital , jakarta , reporters , diplomats and human rights activists gathered in a park at dusk and lit candles in support of mr johnston 's release .
a british embassy official read out a message from mr johnston 's father , graham .
" there is so much sympathy for our plight around the globe and we are overwhelmed at such support , all of which has helped to buoy us during these past seemingly interminable weeks , " the letter said .
journalists in beijing also gathered at sunset to light candles and hold a minute 's silence for mr johnston , who was seized after leaving his office in gaza city on 12 march .
mr ban said he had been following " with dismay " the case of mr johnston , and again appealed for his immediate and safe release .
he widened the issue on world press freedom day , saying : " alarmingly , in seeking to shed light on the plight of others , journalists themselves become targets .
" this happens not just in the midst of armed conflict , but also in pursuit of stories on corruption , poverty and abuse of power . "
meanwhile , journalists protested against attacks and obstruction in their own countries .
the media alliance of zimbabwe urged the government to scrap tough media laws , which it said led to " intimidation , harassment and unlawful arrests , detention and torture of journalists " .
the organisation for security and cooperation in europe recalled the unsolved murder of three journalists in serbia , saying the cases could " lead to self-censorship by journalists who fear the state is not able to protect them " .
robert mahoney of the new york-based committee to protect journalists said : " it used to be that a press pass was a passport to going into a country and a certain status , now a press pass is a liability . "
he said most journalists killed on duty now are murdered , rather than caught in the cross-fire .

the party held monmouth , and gained cardiff north , clwyd west , carmarthen west and south pembrokeshire and preseli pembrokeshire from labour .
it marks a revival in tory fortunes which is being attributed in part to the leadership of david cameron .
there were no tory mps in wales after either the 1997 or 2001 uk general elections .
until now they had only one constituency seat in the assembly , although they had 11 ams in 2003 thanks to the regional list system .
visible campaign jonathan morgan , the victor for the conservatives in cardiff north , won after abandoning a bid in the regional list through which he had a seat in the last assembly .
he polled 15,253 votes and 45.3 % share , beating labour 's sophie howe by almost 5,000 votes .
" we fought a very visible campaign and i do n't think there was much activity from the other parties , notably the labour party which i think gave up before the campaign had even started . "
mr morgan said the welsh conservatives had proved they had changed over the last decade and said that was partly due to the leadership of nick bourne in the assembly , as well as david cameron at westminster .
in the three-way marginal of clwyd west , darren millar ousted former labour culture minister alun pugh with a majority of almost 1,600 .
mr millar joins david jones mp , a fellow conservative in the constituency .
he said ; " i think the people of clwyd west have rejected labour soundly tonight .
" clearly the people of clwyd west want to make sure they have got a conservative voice not just at westminster but at cardiff bay . "
in another three-way marginal in carmarthen west and south pembrokeshire , angela burns defeated labour 's one-time vegetarian agriculture minister christine gwyther , an am since the assembly was set up .
and in another west wales constituency preseli pembrokeshire , which already has a conservative mp , paul davies defeated labour 's tamsin dunwoody by more than 3,000 votes .
monmouth , the seat formerly held by david davies who has opted to concentrate on his role as mp for the town , was also held by the tories .
mr davies 's successor nick ramsay polled 15,389 votes - a 52 % share .

the party held monmouth , and gained cardiff north , clwyd west , carmarthen west and south pembrokeshire and preseli pembrokeshire from labour .
it marks a revival in tory fortunes which is being attributed in part to the leadership of david cameron .
there were no tory mps in wales after either the 1997 or 2001 uk general elections .
until now they had only one constituency seat in the assembly , although they had 11 ams in 2003 thanks to the regional list system .
visible campaign jonathan morgan , the victor for the conservatives in cardiff north , won after abandoning a bid in the regional list through which he had a seat in the last assembly .
he polled 15,253 votes and 45.3 % share , beating labour 's sophie howe by almost 5,000 votes .
" we fought a very visible campaign and i do n't think there was much activity from the other parties , notably the labour party which i think gave up before the campaign had even started . "
mr morgan said the welsh conservatives had proved they had changed over the last decade and said that was partly due to the leadership of nick bourne in the assembly , as well as david cameron at westminster .
in the three-way marginal of clwyd west , darren millar ousted former labour culture minister alun pugh with a majority of almost 1,600 .
darren millar ousted former cabinet minister alun pugh mr millar joins david jones mp , a fellow conservative in the constituency .
he said ; " i think the people of clwyd west have rejected labour soundly tonight .
" clearly the people of clwyd west want to make sure they have got a conservative voice not just at westminster but at cardiff bay . "
in another three-way marginal in carmarthen west and south pembrokeshire , angela burns defeated labour 's one-time vegetarian agriculture minister christine gwyther , an am since the assembly was set up .
and in another west wales constituency preseli pembrokeshire , which already has a conservative mp , paul davies defeated labour 's tamsin dunwoody by more than 3,000 votes .
monmouth , the seat formerly held by david davies who has opted to concentrate on his role as mp for the town , was also held by the tories .
mr davies 's successor nick ramsay polled 15,389 votes - a 52 % share .

bbc correspondent alastair leithead is with the royal anglians on the front line .
0900 local time -lrb- 0530 bst -rrb- : : 4 may if the raf gave out air miles i 'd be on to a winner .
it 's been a busy few days , bouncing from place to place mostly by helicopter , and as the tents are all identical , you can easily get disorientated and walk out of the front door expecting to be in one place , just to find yourself in another .
this morning i woke in fob price in gereshk to some pretty hairy news - the royal engineers had struck a mine on the way back to base after they finished building the defensive posts for the afghan army which they had been working on day and night for the last couple of days .
fortunately nobody was injured , but i 'd been on that same track just a few hours earlier and it 's a reminder of the random risk of mines left over from the soviet war .
they were never properly marked and the floods that come each spring when the river swells to the torrent it is at the moment the mines can shift and move around in the mud .
there was also news last night of another british fatality .
a grenadier guard , manning a checkpoint in garmsir in the south of helmand , had been shot during a firefight with a small group of taleban fighters .
he 'd been airlifted out very quickly but died of his injuries - his family and friends have been told .
the fight went on and a bomb was dropped on the taleban position , although it 's not known how many were killed . "
the hope is that people will see the hand of the government , feel they are getting something out of it and turn their backs on the taleban " i heard the news out at the front edge of the ground british forces had taken as part of operation silicon .
i got back there towards sunset to see how the engineers had done in 36 hours - it was amazing how the ground had been levelled , and the main defensive post built .
they use flat-pack wire supported sack-cloth containers that once filled with rubble and soil make huge sandbag blocks that can be stacked and arranged to build a small base .
three had to be built and the last one was just being finished as the darkness came and the full moon provided them light to work by .
i came back before they finished , but it was on the same way back to the base a few hours later that their vehicle struck the mine .
there had been some fighting going on - not as intense as in the previous days , but still some clashes .
it seemed the ground gained by the 1st anglians had been held , and the point of the defensive posts was to help the afghan national army to use them to secure the area .
lashkar gah had been interesting - hearing about all the development work being done from the provincial reconstruction team where the main british task force helmand command is based in the provincial capital of helmand .
the foreign and commonwealth office -lrb- fco -rrb- and the department for international development -lrb- dfid -rrb- have a large presence there now - compared to the last time i was there almost six months ago .
the dfid strategy is long-term , channeling money through the government structures to try and help build the capacity to spend it in the right places and through the right channels .
that is going ok , i was told , but it 's a long process , so the quick impact projects were explained to me .
i was taken out to lashkar gah town in an armoured vehicle convoy with armed guards to see a police checkpoint - one of more than half a dozen across the city to help show security is improving .
they also took me to a park which is being built landscaped and planted - for everyone , but also exclusively for women at certain times of the week .
" it goes deeper than just hearts and minds , it 's about creating stability and a normal life , " james mortimer from the fco told me .
" it 's about having a range of projects and creating a range of opportunities - stimulating the local environment and having a number of reconstruction projects that will extend over a number of years . "
the hope is that people will see the hand of the government , feel they are getting something out of it and turn their backs on the taleban .
the problem is there 's no confidence in any justice system , security is still a huge problem and corruption is the biggest failing of all .
people do n't trust the police or the government departments and that makes persuading them all is well so much more difficult .
there 's certainly more confidence within the provincial reconstrution team headquarters - new buildings and a lot of extra staff , but the challenge is huge , will take time and demands a long-term strategy in a place where politics want to see immediate results .
1200 local time -lrb- 0830 bst -rrb- : : 2 may it was a shorter stay than expected at the front line - there was a trip to the hotspot of sangin with the brigadier planned which meant a night-time move back to the fixed base .
sangin was the scene of some of the heaviest fighting last summer with british troops pinned down in the government compound facing waves of taleban attack day and night . "
there had been a couple of breakdowns during our two days on the ground which did cause pretty major delays and diversions , but it seems it 's more serious than that " things had been worsening at the start of this year and the precursor to operation silicon - operation silver - was carried out earlier this month to secure the town .
commanders felt they had an opportunity to push the taleban back , and with the ground still being held it 's being seen as a success so far .
things have quietened down on the front and the engineers are making fast progress on the defences .
one issue worth a mention is something pretty much everyone has mentioned to me - the shortage of vehicles .
one officer said only two thirds of the wmiks -lrb- weapon mounting installation kit -rrb- , which are heavily armed cut down land rovers , are operational .
there had been a couple of breakdowns during our two days on the ground which did cause pretty major delays and diversions , but it seems it 's more serious than that .
the task force helmand spokesman , lt col charlie mayo , said 170 wmiks had been requested , but only 126 operational , but that commanders do n't always get what the ask for .
he did say a fifth of the vehicles were not operational because they needed repairs , or had been damaged or destroyed by enemy fire .
" it 's tight , but we are not at our critical level , and more vehicles will be arriving soon , ' said col mayo .
" they are taking a hell of a hammering , " he added , and the conditions are incredibly difficult - the heat and dust , and the constant use of vehicles that do n't rest when the soldiers do as they are passed from unit to unit ... because of the shortfall .
new vehicles have also been delayed and extra troops have been deployed without extra transport .
last summer the issue was a shortfall in helicopters - they are still under pressure , but more operations are being done on the ground now - hence the problem .
the transport to sangin did n't arrive , by the way , so i was brought back to camp bastion and on to lashkar gah to find out more about the british operations - the foreign and commonwealth office and the department for international development .
2100 local time -lrb- 1730 bst -rrb- : : 1 may i managed to get to the front line after dark with an almost full moon lighting the river and a view over the valley ahead and the taleban positions .
after two days of hard fighting the british troops here are getting a little rest , while the royal engineers will be working through the night to build the defensive positions .
i 'm sitting with a few of the troops sheltering in the open next to their heavily-armed land rovers , hearing about their experiences .
there 's the loud calling of frogs in the marshlands close to the river , but other than that it 's quiet tonight .
colour sergeant peter yates from the argylls , 5th battalion , the royal regiment of scotland , who 's from oban , is one of the british troops helping to mentor the afghan national army -lrb- ana -rrb- . "
there were some efforts by the afghan army to catch some fish earlier in the day - with rocket propelled grenades " afghanistan 's ' lack of vehicles ' " the afghan soldiers are actually very motivated in the field - they may not have much experience , but they show no fear .
" at times it 's hard to hold them back as they do n't know the big picture and that there are other things happening on the battlefield , " he told me .
" it 's been physically and mentally very difficult - we 're still struggling with the heat - but the food is second to none if you like corned beef hash . "
there were some efforts by the afghan army to catch some fish earlier in the day - with rocket-propelled grenades - and some of them have found a comfortable spot to bed down - on a huge pile of marijuana discovered in one of the compounds .
captain rob worthington is from queen 's company of the grenadier guards and they have the job of training and fighting with the ana who took this strategically important position in the sangin valley .
" morale is high both among the british and the afghan forces - we 're keen to get on with the task in hand .
the local people are happy that we are here and have been helping us identify taleban positions , " he said .
" we 'll be here for three weeks to hold the ground we 've captured before we hand it over to the afghan national police . "
i joined the engineers as they left the comfort of forward operating base price this afternoon and cleared a road through what was , until a day ago , taleban territory , coming under fire at one point as they drove along an irrigation canal .
they stopped at a small bridge , not big enough for trucks with supplies to cross over , so in the heat they unloaded and built a metal bridge in just a couple of hours .
there were a few missing parts of the bridge , but the ana came up with a solution to get all the vehicles across and all the necessary equipment forward to build the front-line bases .
the commanding officer said it would also be left behind to help the locals .
that 's what it 's about now - having cleared many of the taleban fighters out , it 's a matter of trying to win the support of the people to stop them from coming back and re-establishing themselves in the area .
and the troops say the locals are now helping to point out where the taleban are .
2345 local time -lrb- 2015 bst -rrb- : : 30 april i had nothing but respect for the men of b company 1st royal anglians who headed back out for another night in the desert and another day of fighting ahead of them .
their faces said it all as i took my bags off the viking armoured vehicle -lrb- not a moment too soon -rrb- at forward operating base -lrb- fob -rrb- price in gereshk .
rather than writing this crammed into a corner of the viking in the dark , the only relief from the heat of the day bottled water so warm i 've had colder cups of tea , i 'm lying in my sleeping bag in a tent looking forward to a shower and breakfast in the morning .
the power supply in the van - a heath robinson affair taped together by an electrical engineer at camp bastion - had dramatically gone up in smoke in the back of the viking .
no power means no way of recharging camera batteries , laptop or satellite dish for e-mailing reports and broadcasting tv and radio , so i took the opportunity of an unplanned stop at fob price to jump ship . "
and then there is the issue of holding the ground gained as the poppy harvest ends and more taleban foot soldiers potentially return to the insurgency " one of the vehicles had broken down - the second one to need towing in as many days - and it had to be brought to a base for repairs - a three-hour round trip at night after a long , long day .
it 's not an easy way of life , sleeping rough in the desert , being woken periodically as sandstorms gust through , sandblasting the temporary camp , and living on cold rations , as fire to heat them up would give away the position after dark .
it was hot sitting in the back of the vehicle filming and broadcasting ; it was even hotter among the drainage ditches and compounds in the lower sangin valley where the fighting was intense .
an embargo was placed on our embedded reporting - for " operational reasons " - but the clashes i wrote about on monday morning continued all afternoon .
for seven hours , the british forces fought the taleban - at one point on three separate fronts - but by the end of the day they said they had reached their objective .
there had been aerial bombardments from fast jets and apache helicopters , and relatively close-quarter fighting as the nato force moved forward compound by compound .
we drove up to the front line position at dusk and saw that homes had been abandoned .
two donkeys wandered the streets , broken tethers hanging around their necks , and a huge afghan dog sat by a broken door , presumably of its owner 's house which was now empty , watching the line-up of british military vehicles rumble past .
as we waited for the order to pull back for the evening , i thought what it must be like on the other side in the battle - at the receiving end of high-tech fire power .
without the sophisticated supply lines or equipment , the determined taleban fighters are still fighting hard and at times put british troops under a lot of pressure .
people in the valley had been warned the operation was coming - but it 's hard to know if everyone got the message .
civilians fled the heavy fighting , and the engineers moving up behind to provide projects to try to win people over may have trouble finding many people to ask .
but i 'll find that out soon , as the plan is to switch units and see just how easy , or difficult , it is to bring in the next stage - development and rebuilding - to persuade the people that the international forces , and the government of afghanistan , are worth supporting .
the fighting 's not over either - the taleban will no doubt be fighting for every inch of ground .
and then , of course , there 's the issue of holding the ground gained as the poppy harvest ends and more taleban foot soldiers potentially return to the insurgency .
0930 local time -lrb- 0600 bst -rrb- : : 30 april the infantry soldiers started taking heavy fire on the ground as they were making their way through the valley .
the taleban had clearly been expecting them , after all the information campaigns and statements from the governor - used to try and warn civilians to get out of the area .
they fired rocket propelled grenades and mortar bombs at the british troops - they returned fire with mortars , heavy machine guns and javelin missiles - anti-tank rockets used here -lrb- at great expense -rrb- to destroy compounds .
the vehicle i am in moved up onto high ground to watch the battle unfold and communicate with the rest of the forces what was going on .
i am sitting in the back of the viking armoured vehicle again writing this and listening to the bombs and rockets exploding in the valley below .
it has been more than an hour of fighting now and many plumes of smoke can be seen about 2kms away where the fighting is centred .
one of the soldiers said he was pleased when things had started quietly , but thought it would get more difficult as the day progressed .
this is taleban heartland and it appears the insurgents are putting up quite a fight .
0700 local time -lrb- 0330 bst -rrb- : : 30 april at first light the infantry dismounted from the armoured personnel carriers and headed on foot towards the green belt of trees and poppy fields irrigated by the helmand river .
the objective is to negotiate the high compound walls and deep irrigation ditches and push the insurgents further up the lower sangin valley .
it is taleban territory and has been out of government control since british forces arrived last year - the mission is to take ground and hold it .
a few sporadic shots were fired as operation silicon began at 0500 local time -lrb- 0130 bst -rrb- .
apache helicopters circled menacingly overhead as the platoons pushed forward slowly , heavy guns on the high ground watching their progress towards the known taleban positions .
i am now on high ground waiting and watching to see what unfolds in the valley below . "
soldiers i spoke to said they thought it was more dangerous than anything they had done in iraq " it had been a tortuous drive from camp bastion , packed like sardines in the back of the viking armoured vehicles - their twin cabs and tracks making them look like something out of star wars .
inside the air is stuffy , the air conditioning ineffective - the feeling , crammed in the back , is a combination of being in a sauna and a washing machine .
one viking had broken down , so it took longer to crawl out into the desert , well away from sight to prepare for the early start to the mission .
the wind whipped sand across the camp throughout the night , a nearly-full moon helping people sort out their equipment , clean their weapons and get last briefings from higher chains of command before getting a few hours of sleep .
it is the biggest operation the 1st battalion royal anglians , known as the vikings , have taken part in since they took over from the marines - and soldiers i spoke to said they thought it was more dangerous than anything they had done in iraq .
more than 3,000 troops are involved in operation silicon , with british forces taking the lead , and more than a thousand afghan national army soldiers also pushing up the lawless valley .
they will go into people 's homes to explain what is going on and put an afghan face on a multinational operation .
fighting alongside are dutch , danish , estonian , canadian and american forces who are moving up the valley through the difficult terrain alongside the river from gereshk .
lt col stuart carver , commanding officer of 1st battalion royal anglians , said the mission was to build on an earlier operation which took back control of sangin town - where british forces had been heavily bombarded in their small base by the river .
" operation silicon is to extend the government of afghanistan 's authority in the lower sangin valley which for too long has been semi-controlled by the taleban , " he said .
" it 's part of a longer term plan to restore the whole of helmand to government control and we will be targeting the ideologically motivated taleban . "
british forces said they launched an information campaign ahead of the operation , with leaflet drops and radio messages telling local people it would be beginning soon and warning them to stay inside their homes when fighting begins - and to leave their houses if the taleban are using them to fight from .
it is impossible to know how many people would have received the message .
so far , all is relatively quiet and progress is slow and careful .
although the valley is a taleban heartland it is not known if there will be much resistance as many people are harvesting the opium poppies at the moment - the raw materials for heroin .
the information campaign also warned the local people to expect action - the british commander said he would be happy to push through without a fight , but he says that would be very unlikely .

bbc correspondent alastair leithead is with the royal anglians on the front line .
0900 local time -lrb- 0530 bst -rrb- : : 4 may if the raf gave out air miles i 'd be on to a winner .
it 's been a busy few days , bouncing from place to place mostly by helicopter , and as the tents are all identical , you can easily get disorientated and walk out of the front door expecting to be in one place , just to find yourself in another .
the bbc 's alastair leithead is with the royal anglians on the front line this morning i woke in fob price in gereshk to some pretty hairy news - the royal engineers had struck a mine on the way back to base after they finished building the defensive posts for the afghan army which they had been working on day and night for the last couple of days .
fortunately nobody was injured , but i 'd been on that same track just a few hours earlier and it 's a reminder of the random risk of mines left over from the soviet war .
they were never properly marked and the floods that come each spring when the river swells to the torrent it is at the moment the mines can shift and move around in the mud .
there was also news last night of another british fatality .
a grenadier guard , manning a checkpoint in garmsir in the south of helmand , had been shot during a firefight with a small group of taleban fighters .
he 'd been airlifted out very quickly but died of his injuries - his family and friends have been told .
the fight went on and a bomb was dropped on the taleban position , although it 's not known how many were killed .
the hope is that people will see the hand of the government , feel they are getting something out of it and turn their backs on the taleban i heard the news out at the front edge of the ground british forces had taken as part of operation silicon .
i got back there towards sunset to see how the engineers had done in 36 hours - it was amazing how the ground had been levelled , and the main defensive post built .
they use flat-pack wire supported sack-cloth containers that once filled with rubble and soil make huge sandbag blocks that can be stacked and arranged to build a small base .
three had to be built and the last one was just being finished as the darkness came and the full moon provided them light to work by .
i came back before they finished , but it was on the same way back to the base a few hours later that their vehicle struck the mine .
there had been some fighting going on - not as intense as in the previous days , but still some clashes .
it seemed the ground gained by the 1st anglians had been held , and the point of the defensive posts was to help the afghan national army to use them to secure the area .
lashkar gah had been interesting - hearing about all the development work being done from the provincial reconstruction team where the main british task force helmand command is based in the provincial capital of helmand .
the foreign and commonwealth office -lrb- fco -rrb- and the department for international development -lrb- dfid -rrb- have a large presence there now - compared to the last time i was there almost six months ago .
the dfid strategy is long-term , channeling money through the government structures to try and help build the capacity to spend it in the right places and through the right channels .
that is going ok , i was told , but it 's a long process , so the quick impact projects were explained to me .
i was taken out to lashkar gah town in an armoured vehicle convoy with armed guards to see a police checkpoint - one of more than half a dozen across the city to help show security is improving .
they also took me to a park which is being built landscaped and planted - for everyone , but also exclusively for women at certain times of the week .
" it goes deeper than just hearts and minds , it 's about creating stability and a normal life , " james mortimer from the fco told me .
" it 's about having a range of projects and creating a range of opportunities - stimulating the local environment and having a number of reconstruction projects that will extend over a number of years . "
the hope is that people will see the hand of the government , feel they are getting something out of it and turn their backs on the taleban .
the problem is there 's no confidence in any justice system , security is still a huge problem and corruption is the biggest failing of all .
people do n't trust the police or the government departments and that makes persuading them all is well so much more difficult .

a few sporadic shots were fired as operation silicon began at 0500 local time -lrb- 0130 bst -rrb- .
apache helicopters circled menacingly overhead as the platoons pushed forward slowly , heavy guns on the high ground watching their progress towards the known taleban positions .
i am now on high ground waiting and watching to see what unfolds in the valley below .
soldiers i spoke to said they thought it was more dangerous than anything they had done in iraq it had been a tortuous drive from camp bastion , packed like sardines in the back of the viking armoured vehicles - their twin cabs and tracks making them look like something out of star wars .

the wind whipped sand across the camp throughout the night , a nearly-full moon helping people sort out their equipment , clean their weapons and get last briefings from higher chains of command before getting a few hours of sleep .
it is the biggest operation the 1st battalion royal anglians , known as the vikings , have taken part in since they took over from the marines - and soldiers i spoke to said they thought it was more dangerous than anything they had done in iraq .
more than 3,000 troops are involved in operation silicon , with british forces taking the lead , and more than a thousand afghan national army soldiers also pushing up the lawless valley .
they will go into people 's homes to explain what is going on and put an afghan face on a multinational operation .
fighting alongside are dutch , danish , estonian , canadian and american forces who are moving up the valley through the difficult terrain alongside the river from gereshk .
lt col stuart carver , commanding officer of 1st battalion royal anglians , said the mission was to build on an earlier operation which took back control of sangin town - where british forces had been heavily bombarded in their small base by the river .
british scimitar tanks are being used in the operation " operation silicon is to extend the government of afghanistan 's authority in the lower sangin valley which for too long has been semi-controlled by the taleban , " he said .
" it 's part of a longer term plan to restore the whole of helmand to government control and we will be targeting the ideologically motivated taleban . "
british forces said they launched an information campaign ahead of the operation , with leaflet drops and radio messages telling local people it would be beginning soon and warning them to stay inside their homes when fighting begins - and to leave their houses if the taleban are using them to fight from .
it is impossible to know how many people would have received the message .
so far , all is relatively quiet and progress is slow and careful .
although the valley is a taleban heartland it is not known if there will be much resistance as many people are harvesting the opium poppies at the moment - the raw materials for heroin .
the information campaign also warned the local people to expect action - the british commander said he would be happy to push through without a fight , but he says that would be very unlikely .

bbc correspondent alastair leithead is with the royal anglians on the front line .
0900 local time -lrb- 0530 bst -rrb- : : 4 may if the raf gave out air miles i 'd be on to a winner .
it 's been a busy few days , bouncing from place to place mostly by helicopter , and as the tents are all identical , you can easily get disorientated and walk out of the front door expecting to be in one place , just to find yourself in another .
the bbc 's alastair leithead is with the royal anglians on the front line this morning i woke in fob price in gereshk to some pretty hairy news - the royal engineers had struck a mine on the way back to base after they finished building the defensive posts for the afghan army which they had been working on day and night for the last couple of days .
fortunately nobody was injured , but i 'd been on that same track just a few hours earlier and it 's a reminder of the random risk of mines left over from the soviet war .
they were never properly marked and the floods that come each spring when the river swells to the torrent it is at the moment the mines can shift and move around in the mud .
there was also news last night of another british fatality .
a grenadier guard , manning a checkpoint in garmsir in the south of helmand , had been shot during a firefight with a small group of taleban fighters .
he 'd been airlifted out very quickly but died of his injuries - his family and friends have been told .
the fight went on and a bomb was dropped on the taleban position , although it 's not known how many were killed .
the hope is that people will see the hand of the government , feel they are getting something out of it and turn their backs on the taleban i heard the news out at the front edge of the ground british forces had taken as part of operation silicon .
i got back there towards sunset to see how the engineers had done in 36 hours - it was amazing how the ground had been levelled , and the main defensive post built .
they use flat-pack wire supported sack-cloth containers that once filled with rubble and soil make huge sandbag blocks that can be stacked and arranged to build a small base .
three had to be built and the last one was just being finished as the darkness came and the full moon provided them light to work by .
i came back before they finished , but it was on the same way back to the base a few hours later that their vehicle struck the mine .
there had been some fighting going on - not as intense as in the previous days , but still some clashes .
it seemed the ground gained by the 1st anglians had been held , and the point of the defensive posts was to help the afghan national army to use them to secure the area .
lashkar gah had been interesting - hearing about all the development work being done from the provincial reconstruction team where the main british task force helmand command is based in the provincial capital of helmand .
the foreign and commonwealth office -lrb- fco -rrb- and the department for international development -lrb- dfid -rrb- have a large presence there now - compared to the last time i was there almost six months ago .
the dfid strategy is long-term , channeling money through the government structures to try and help build the capacity to spend it in the right places and through the right channels .
that is going ok , i was told , but it 's a long process , so the quick impact projects were explained to me .
i was taken out to lashkar gah town in an armoured vehicle convoy with armed guards to see a police checkpoint - one of more than half a dozen across the city to help show security is improving .
they also took me to a park which is being built landscaped and planted - for everyone , but also exclusively for women at certain times of the week .
" it goes deeper than just hearts and minds , it 's about creating stability and a normal life , " james mortimer from the fco told me .
" it 's about having a range of projects and creating a range of opportunities - stimulating the local environment and having a number of reconstruction projects that will extend over a number of years . "
the hope is that people will see the hand of the government , feel they are getting something out of it and turn their backs on the taleban .
the problem is there 's no confidence in any justice system , security is still a huge problem and corruption is the biggest failing of all .
people do n't trust the police or the government departments and that makes persuading them all is well so much more difficult .
there 's certainly more confidence within the provincial reconstrution team headquarters - new buildings and a lot of extra staff , but the challenge is huge , will take time and demands a long-term strategy in a place where politics want to see immediate results .
1200 local time -lrb- 0830 bst -rrb- : : 2 may it was a shorter stay than expected at the front line - there was a trip to the hotspot of sangin with the brigadier planned which meant a night-time move back to the fixed base .
sangin was the scene of some of the heaviest fighting last summer with british troops pinned down in the government compound facing waves of taleban attack day and night .
there had been a couple of breakdowns during our two days on the ground which did cause pretty major delays and diversions , but it seems it 's more serious than that things had been worsening at the start of this year and the precursor to operation silicon - operation silver - was carried out earlier this month to secure the town .
commanders felt they had an opportunity to push the taleban back , and with the ground still being held it 's being seen as a success so far .
things have quietened down on the front and the engineers are making fast progress on the defences .
one issue worth a mention is something pretty much everyone has mentioned to me - the shortage of vehicles .
one officer said only two thirds of the wmiks -lrb- weapon mounting installation kit -rrb- , which are heavily armed cut down land rovers , are operational .
there had been a couple of breakdowns during our two days on the ground which did cause pretty major delays and diversions , but it seems it 's more serious than that .
the task force helmand spokesman , lt col charlie mayo , said 170 wmiks had been requested , but only 126 operational , but that commanders do n't always get what the ask for .
he did say a fifth of the vehicles were not operational because they needed repairs , or had been damaged or destroyed by enemy fire .
" it 's tight , but we are not at our critical level , and more vehicles will be arriving soon , ' said col mayo .
" they are taking a hell of a hammering , " he added , and the conditions are incredibly difficult - the heat and dust , and the constant use of vehicles that do n't rest when the soldiers do as they are passed from unit to unit ... because of the shortfall .
new vehicles have also been delayed and extra troops have been deployed without extra transport .
last summer the issue was a shortfall in helicopters - they are still under pressure , but more operations are being done on the ground now - hence the problem .
the transport to sangin did n't arrive , by the way , so i was brought back to camp bastion and on to lashkar gah to find out more about the british operations - the foreign and commonwealth office and the department for international development .
2100 local time -lrb- 1730 bst -rrb- : : 1 may i managed to get to the front line after dark with an almost full moon lighting the river and a view over the valley ahead and the taleban positions .
after two days of hard fighting the british troops here are getting a little rest , while the royal engineers will be working through the night to build the defensive positions .
i 'm sitting with a few of the troops sheltering in the open next to their heavily-armed land rovers , hearing about their experiences .
there 's the loud calling of frogs in the marshlands close to the river , but other than that it 's quiet tonight .
colour sergeant peter yates from the argylls , 5th battalion , the royal regiment of scotland , who 's from oban , is one of the british troops helping to mentor the afghan national army -lrb- ana -rrb- .
there were some efforts by the afghan army to catch some fish earlier in the day - with rocket propelled grenades afghanistan 's ' lack of vehicles ' " the afghan soldiers are actually very motivated in the field - they may not have much experience , but they show no fear .
" at times it 's hard to hold them back as they do n't know the big picture and that there are other things happening on the battlefield , " he told me .
" it 's been physically and mentally very difficult - we 're still struggling with the heat - but the food is second to none if you like corned beef hash . "
there were some efforts by the afghan army to catch some fish earlier in the day - with rocket-propelled grenades - and some of them have found a comfortable spot to bed down - on a huge pile of marijuana discovered in one of the compounds .
captain rob worthington is from queen 's company of the grenadier guards and they have the job of training and fighting with the ana who took this strategically important position in the sangin valley .
" morale is high both among the british and the afghan forces - we 're keen to get on with the task in hand .
the local people are happy that we are here and have been helping us identify taleban positions , " he said .
" we 'll be here for three weeks to hold the ground we 've captured before we hand it over to the afghan national police . "
i joined the engineers as they left the comfort of forward operating base price this afternoon and cleared a road through what was , until a day ago , taleban territory , coming under fire at one point as they drove along an irrigation canal .
they stopped at a small bridge , not big enough for trucks with supplies to cross over , so in the heat they unloaded and built a metal bridge in just a couple of hours .
there were a few missing parts of the bridge , but the ana came up with a solution to get all the vehicles across and all the necessary equipment forward to build the front-line bases .
the commanding officer said it would also be left behind to help the locals .
that 's what it 's about now - having cleared many of the taleban fighters out , it 's a matter of trying to win the support of the people to stop them from coming back and re-establishing themselves in the area .
and the troops say the locals are now helping to point out where the taleban are .
2345 local time -lrb- 2015 bst -rrb- : : 30 april i had nothing but respect for the men of b company 1st royal anglians who headed back out for another night in the desert and another day of fighting ahead of them .
their faces said it all as i took my bags off the viking armoured vehicle -lrb- not a moment too soon -rrb- at forward operating base -lrb- fob -rrb- price in gereshk .
rather than writing this crammed into a corner of the viking in the dark , the only relief from the heat of the day bottled water so warm i 've had colder cups of tea , i 'm lying in my sleeping bag in a tent looking forward to a shower and breakfast in the morning .
the power supply in the van - a heath robinson affair taped together by an electrical engineer at camp bastion - had dramatically gone up in smoke in the back of the viking .
no power means no way of recharging camera batteries , laptop or satellite dish for e-mailing reports and broadcasting tv and radio , so i took the opportunity of an unplanned stop at fob price to jump ship .
and then there is the issue of holding the ground gained as the poppy harvest ends and more taleban foot soldiers potentially return to the insurgency one of the vehicles had broken down - the second one to need towing in as many days - and it had to be brought to a base for repairs - a three-hour round trip at night after a long , long day .
it 's not an easy way of life , sleeping rough in the desert , being woken periodically as sandstorms gust through , sandblasting the temporary camp , and living on cold rations , as fire to heat them up would give away the position after dark .
it was hot sitting in the back of the vehicle filming and broadcasting ; it was even hotter among the drainage ditches and compounds in the lower sangin valley where the fighting was intense .
an embargo was placed on our embedded reporting - for " operational reasons " - but the clashes i wrote about on monday morning continued all afternoon .
for seven hours , the british forces fought the taleban - at one point on three separate fronts - but by the end of the day they said they had reached their objective .
there had been aerial bombardments from fast jets and apache helicopters , and relatively close-quarter fighting as the nato force moved forward compound by compound .
we drove up to the front line position at dusk and saw that homes had been abandoned .
two donkeys wandered the streets , broken tethers hanging around their necks , and a huge afghan dog sat by a broken door , presumably of its owner 's house which was now empty , watching the line-up of british military vehicles rumble past .
as we waited for the order to pull back for the evening , i thought what it must be like on the other side in the battle - at the receiving end of high-tech fire power .
without the sophisticated supply lines or equipment , the determined taleban fighters are still fighting hard and at times put british troops under a lot of pressure .
people in the valley had been warned the operation was coming - but it 's hard to know if everyone got the message .
civilians fled the heavy fighting , and the engineers moving up behind to provide projects to try to win people over may have trouble finding many people to ask .
but i 'll find that out soon , as the plan is to switch units and see just how easy , or difficult , it is to bring in the next stage - development and rebuilding - to persuade the people that the international forces , and the government of afghanistan , are worth supporting .
the fighting 's not over either - the taleban will no doubt be fighting for every inch of ground .
and then , of course , there 's the issue of holding the ground gained as the poppy harvest ends and more taleban foot soldiers potentially return to the insurgency .
0930 local time -lrb- 0600 bst -rrb- : : 30 april the infantry soldiers started taking heavy fire on the ground as they were making their way through the valley .
the taleban had clearly been expecting them , after all the information campaigns and statements from the governor - used to try and warn civilians to get out of the area .
the mission is part of a larger operation launched in march they fired rocket propelled grenades and mortar bombs at the british troops - they returned fire with mortars , heavy machine guns and javelin missiles - anti-tank rockets used here -lrb- at great expense -rrb- to destroy compounds .
the vehicle i am in moved up onto high ground to watch the battle unfold and communicate with the rest of the forces what was going on .
i am sitting in the back of the viking armoured vehicle again writing this and listening to the bombs and rockets exploding in the valley below .
it has been more than an hour of fighting now and many plumes of smoke can be seen about 2kms away where the fighting is centred .
one of the soldiers said he was pleased when things had started quietly , but thought it would get more difficult as the day progressed .
this is taleban heartland and it appears the insurgents are putting up quite a fight .
0700 local time -lrb- 0330 bst -rrb- : : 30 april at first light the infantry dismounted from the armoured personnel carriers and headed on foot towards the green belt of trees and poppy fields irrigated by the helmand river .
troops have secured a number of taleban compounds the objective is to negotiate the high compound walls and deep irrigation ditches and push the insurgents further up the lower sangin valley .
it is taleban territory and has been out of government control since british forces arrived last year - the mission is to take ground and hold it .
a few sporadic shots were fired as operation silicon began at 0500 local time -lrb- 0130 bst -rrb- .
apache helicopters circled menacingly overhead as the platoons pushed forward slowly , heavy guns on the high ground watching their progress towards the known taleban positions .
i am now on high ground waiting and watching to see what unfolds in the valley below .
soldiers i spoke to said they thought it was more dangerous than anything they had done in iraq it had been a tortuous drive from camp bastion , packed like sardines in the back of the viking armoured vehicles - their twin cabs and tracks making them look like something out of star wars .
inside the air is stuffy , the air conditioning ineffective - the feeling , crammed in the back , is a combination of being in a sauna and a washing machine .
one viking had broken down , so it took longer to crawl out into the desert , well away from sight to prepare for the early start to the mission .
the wind whipped sand across the camp throughout the night , a nearly-full moon helping people sort out their equipment , clean their weapons and get last briefings from higher chains of command before getting a few hours of sleep .
it is the biggest operation the 1st battalion royal anglians , known as the vikings , have taken part in since they took over from the marines - and soldiers i spoke to said they thought it was more dangerous than anything they had done in iraq .
more than 3,000 troops are involved in operation silicon , with british forces taking the lead , and more than a thousand afghan national army soldiers also pushing up the lawless valley .
they will go into people 's homes to explain what is going on and put an afghan face on a multinational operation .
fighting alongside are dutch , danish , estonian , canadian and american forces who are moving up the valley through the difficult terrain alongside the river from gereshk .
lt col stuart carver , commanding officer of 1st battalion royal anglians , said the mission was to build on an earlier operation which took back control of sangin town - where british forces had been heavily bombarded in their small base by the river .
british scimitar tanks are being used in the operation " operation silicon is to extend the government of afghanistan 's authority in the lower sangin valley which for too long has been semi-controlled by the taleban , " he said .
" it 's part of a longer term plan to restore the whole of helmand to government control and we will be targeting the ideologically motivated taleban . "
british forces said they launched an information campaign ahead of the operation , with leaflet drops and radio messages telling local people it would be beginning soon and warning them to stay inside their homes when fighting begins - and to leave their houses if the taleban are using them to fight from .
it is impossible to know how many people would have received the message .
so far , all is relatively quiet and progress is slow and careful .
although the valley is a taleban heartland it is not known if there will be much resistance as many people are harvesting the opium poppies at the moment - the raw materials for heroin .
the information campaign also warned the local people to expect action - the british commander said he would be happy to push through without a fight , but he says that would be very unlikely .

that 's what it 's about now - having cleared many of the taleban fighters out , it 's a matter of trying to win the support of the people to stop them from coming back and re-establishing themselves in the area .
and the troops say the locals are now helping to point out where the taleban are .
2345 local time -lrb- 2015 bst -rrb- : : 30 april i had nothing but respect for the men of b company 1st royal anglians who headed back out for another night in the desert and another day of fighting ahead of them .
their faces said it all as i took my bags off the viking armoured vehicle -lrb- not a moment too soon -rrb- at forward operating base -lrb- fob -rrb- price in gereshk .
rather than writing this crammed into a corner of the viking in the dark , the only relief from the heat of the day bottled water so warm i 've had colder cups of tea , i 'm lying in my sleeping bag in a tent looking forward to a shower and breakfast in the morning .
the power supply in the van - a heath robinson affair taped together by an electrical engineer at camp bastion - had dramatically gone up in smoke in the back of the viking .
no power means no way of recharging camera batteries , laptop or satellite dish for e-mailing reports and broadcasting tv and radio , so i took the opportunity of an unplanned stop at fob price to jump ship .
and then there is the issue of holding the ground gained as the poppy harvest ends and more taleban foot soldiers potentially return to the insurgency one of the vehicles had broken down - the second one to need towing in as many days - and it had to be brought to a base for repairs - a three-hour round trip at night after a long , long day .
it 's not an easy way of life , sleeping rough in the desert , being woken periodically as sandstorms gust through , sandblasting the temporary camp , and living on cold rations , as fire to heat them up would give away the position after dark .
it was hot sitting in the back of the vehicle filming and broadcasting ; it was even hotter among the drainage ditches and compounds in the lower sangin valley where the fighting was intense .
an embargo was placed on our embedded reporting - for " operational reasons " - but the clashes i wrote about on monday morning continued all afternoon .
for seven hours , the british forces fought the taleban - at one point on three separate fronts - but by the end of the day they said they had reached their objective .
there had been aerial bombardments from fast jets and apache helicopters , and relatively close-quarter fighting as the nato force moved forward compound by compound .
we drove up to the front line position at dusk and saw that homes had been abandoned .
two donkeys wandered the streets , broken tethers hanging around their necks , and a huge afghan dog sat by a broken door , presumably of its owner 's house which was now empty , watching the line-up of british military vehicles rumble past .
as we waited for the order to pull back for the evening , i thought what it must be like on the other side in the battle - at the receiving end of high-tech fire power .
without the sophisticated supply lines or equipment , the determined taleban fighters are still fighting hard and at times put british troops under a lot of pressure .
people in the valley had been warned the operation was coming - but it 's hard to know if everyone got the message .
civilians fled the heavy fighting , and the engineers moving up behind to provide projects to try to win people over may have trouble finding many people to ask .
but i 'll find that out soon , as the plan is to switch units and see just how easy , or difficult , it is to bring in the next stage - development and rebuilding - to persuade the people that the international forces , and the government of afghanistan , are worth supporting .
the fighting 's not over either - the taleban will no doubt be fighting for every inch of ground .
and then , of course , there 's the issue of holding the ground gained as the poppy harvest ends and more taleban foot soldiers potentially return to the insurgency .
0930 local time -lrb- 0600 bst -rrb- : : 30 april the infantry soldiers started taking heavy fire on the ground as they were making their way through the valley .
the taleban had clearly been expecting them , after all the information campaigns and statements from the governor - used to try and warn civilians to get out of the area .
the mission is part of a larger operation launched in march they fired rocket propelled grenades and mortar bombs at the british troops - they returned fire with mortars , heavy machine guns and javelin missiles - anti-tank rockets used here -lrb- at great expense -rrb- to destroy compounds .
the vehicle i am in moved up onto high ground to watch the battle unfold and communicate with the rest of the forces what was going on .
i am sitting in the back of the viking armoured vehicle again writing this and listening to the bombs and rockets exploding in the valley below .
it has been more than an hour of fighting now and many plumes of smoke can be seen about 2kms away where the fighting is centred .
one of the soldiers said he was pleased when things had started quietly , but thought it would get more difficult as the day progressed .
this is taleban heartland and it appears the insurgents are putting up quite a fight .
0700 local time -lrb- 0330 bst -rrb- : : 30 april at first light the infantry dismounted from the armoured personnel carriers and headed on foot towards the green belt of trees and poppy fields irrigated by the helmand river .
troops have secured a number of taleban compounds the objective is to negotiate the high compound walls and deep irrigation ditches and push the insurgents further up the lower sangin valley .
it is taleban territory and has been out of government control since british forces arrived last year - the mission is to take ground and hold it .
a few sporadic shots were fired as operation silicon began at 0500 local time -lrb- 0130 bst -rrb- .
apache helicopters circled menacingly overhead as the platoons pushed forward slowly , heavy guns on the high ground watching their progress towards the known taleban positions .
i am now on high ground waiting and watching to see what unfolds in the valley below .
soldiers i spoke to said they thought it was more dangerous than anything they had done in iraq it had been a tortuous drive from camp bastion , packed like sardines in the back of the viking armoured vehicles - their twin cabs and tracks making them look like something out of star wars .
inside the air is stuffy , the air conditioning ineffective - the feeling , crammed in the back , is a combination of being in a sauna and a washing machine .
one viking had broken down , so it took longer to crawl out into the desert , well away from sight to prepare for the early start to the mission .
the wind whipped sand across the camp throughout the night , a nearly-full moon helping people sort out their equipment , clean their weapons and get last briefings from higher chains of command before getting a few hours of sleep .
it is the biggest operation the 1st battalion royal anglians , known as the vikings , have taken part in since they took over from the marines - and soldiers i spoke to said they thought it was more dangerous than anything they had done in iraq .
more than 3,000 troops are involved in operation silicon , with british forces taking the lead , and more than a thousand afghan national army soldiers also pushing up the lawless valley .
they will go into people 's homes to explain what is going on and put an afghan face on a multinational operation .
fighting alongside are dutch , danish , estonian , canadian and american forces who are moving up the valley through the difficult terrain alongside the river from gereshk .
lt col stuart carver , commanding officer of 1st battalion royal anglians , said the mission was to build on an earlier operation which took back control of sangin town - where british forces had been heavily bombarded in their small base by the river .
british scimitar tanks are being used in the operation " operation silicon is to extend the government of afghanistan 's authority in the lower sangin valley which for too long has been semi-controlled by the taleban , " he said .
" it 's part of a longer term plan to restore the whole of helmand to government control and we will be targeting the ideologically motivated taleban . "
british forces said they launched an information campaign ahead of the operation , with leaflet drops and radio messages telling local people it would be beginning soon and warning them to stay inside their homes when fighting begins - and to leave their houses if the taleban are using them to fight from .
it is impossible to know how many people would have received the message .
so far , all is relatively quiet and progress is slow and careful .
although the valley is a taleban heartland it is not known if there will be much resistance as many people are harvesting the opium poppies at the moment - the raw materials for heroin .
the information campaign also warned the local people to expect action - the british commander said he would be happy to push through without a fight , but he says that would be very unlikely .

bbc correspondent alastair leithead is with the royal anglians on the front line .
0900 local time -lrb- 0530 bst -rrb- : : 4 may if the raf gave out air miles i 'd be on to a winner .
it 's been a busy few days , bouncing from place to place mostly by helicopter , and as the tents are all identical , you can easily get disorientated and walk out of the front door expecting to be in one place , just to find yourself in another .
the bbc 's alastair leithead is with the royal anglians on the front line this morning i woke in fob price in gereshk to some pretty hairy news - the royal engineers had struck a mine on the way back to base after they finished building the defensive posts for the afghan army which they had been working on day and night for the last couple of days .
fortunately nobody was injured , but i 'd been on that same track just a few hours earlier and it 's a reminder of the random risk of mines left over from the soviet war .
they were never properly marked and the floods that come each spring when the river swells to the torrent it is at the moment the mines can shift and move around in the mud .
there was also news last night of another british fatality .
a grenadier guard , manning a checkpoint in garmsir in the south of helmand , had been shot during a firefight with a small group of taleban fighters .
he 'd been airlifted out very quickly but died of his injuries - his family and friends have been told .
the fight went on and a bomb was dropped on the taleban position , although it 's not known how many were killed .
the hope is that people will see the hand of the government , feel they are getting something out of it and turn their backs on the taleban i heard the news out at the front edge of the ground british forces had taken as part of operation silicon .
i got back there towards sunset to see how the engineers had done in 36 hours - it was amazing how the ground had been levelled , and the main defensive post built .
they use flat-pack wire supported sack-cloth containers that once filled with rubble and soil make huge sandbag blocks that can be stacked and arranged to build a small base .
three had to be built and the last one was just being finished as the darkness came and the full moon provided them light to work by .
i came back before they finished , but it was on the same way back to the base a few hours later that their vehicle struck the mine .
there had been some fighting going on - not as intense as in the previous days , but still some clashes .
it seemed the ground gained by the 1st anglians had been held , and the point of the defensive posts was to help the afghan national army to use them to secure the area .
lashkar gah had been interesting - hearing about all the development work being done from the provincial reconstruction team where the main british task force helmand command is based in the provincial capital of helmand .
the foreign and commonwealth office -lrb- fco -rrb- and the department for international development -lrb- dfid -rrb- have a large presence there now - compared to the last time i was there almost six months ago .
the dfid strategy is long-term , channeling money through the government structures to try and help build the capacity to spend it in the right places and through the right channels .
that is going ok , i was told , but it 's a long process , so the quick impact projects were explained to me .
i was taken out to lashkar gah town in an armoured vehicle convoy with armed guards to see a police checkpoint - one of more than half a dozen across the city to help show security is improving .
they also took me to a park which is being built landscaped and planted - for everyone , but also exclusively for women at certain times of the week .
" it goes deeper than just hearts and minds , it 's about creating stability and a normal life , " james mortimer from the fco told me .
" it 's about having a range of projects and creating a range of opportunities - stimulating the local environment and having a number of reconstruction projects that will extend over a number of years . "
the hope is that people will see the hand of the government , feel they are getting something out of it and turn their backs on the taleban .
the problem is there 's no confidence in any justice system , security is still a huge problem and corruption is the biggest failing of all .
people do n't trust the police or the government departments and that makes persuading them all is well so much more difficult .
there 's certainly more confidence within the provincial reconstrution team headquarters - new buildings and a lot of extra staff , but the challenge is huge , will take time and demands a long-term strategy in a place where politics want to see immediate results .
1200 local time -lrb- 0830 bst -rrb- : : 2 may it was a shorter stay than expected at the front line - there was a trip to the hotspot of sangin with the brigadier planned which meant a night-time move back to the fixed base .
sangin was the scene of some of the heaviest fighting last summer with british troops pinned down in the government compound facing waves of taleban attack day and night .
there had been a couple of breakdowns during our two days on the ground which did cause pretty major delays and diversions , but it seems it 's more serious than that things had been worsening at the start of this year and the precursor to operation silicon - operation silver - was carried out earlier this month to secure the town .
commanders felt they had an opportunity to push the taleban back , and with the ground still being held it 's being seen as a success so far .
things have quietened down on the front and the engineers are making fast progress on the defences .
one issue worth a mention is something pretty much everyone has mentioned to me - the shortage of vehicles .
one officer said only two thirds of the wmiks -lrb- weapon mounting installation kit -rrb- , which are heavily armed cut down land rovers , are operational .
there had been a couple of breakdowns during our two days on the ground which did cause pretty major delays and diversions , but it seems it 's more serious than that .
the task force helmand spokesman , lt col charlie mayo , said 170 wmiks had been requested , but only 126 operational , but that commanders do n't always get what the ask for .
he did say a fifth of the vehicles were not operational because they needed repairs , or had been damaged or destroyed by enemy fire .
" it 's tight , but we are not at our critical level , and more vehicles will be arriving soon , ' said col mayo .
" they are taking a hell of a hammering , " he added , and the conditions are incredibly difficult - the heat and dust , and the constant use of vehicles that do n't rest when the soldiers do as they are passed from unit to unit ... because of the shortfall .
new vehicles have also been delayed and extra troops have been deployed without extra transport .
last summer the issue was a shortfall in helicopters - they are still under pressure , but more operations are being done on the ground now - hence the problem .
the transport to sangin did n't arrive , by the way , so i was brought back to camp bastion and on to lashkar gah to find out more about the british operations - the foreign and commonwealth office and the department for international development .
2100 local time -lrb- 1730 bst -rrb- : : 1 may i managed to get to the front line after dark with an almost full moon lighting the river and a view over the valley ahead and the taleban positions .
after two days of hard fighting the british troops here are getting a little rest , while the royal engineers will be working through the night to build the defensive positions .
i 'm sitting with a few of the troops sheltering in the open next to their heavily-armed land rovers , hearing about their experiences .
there 's the loud calling of frogs in the marshlands close to the river , but other than that it 's quiet tonight .
colour sergeant peter yates from the argylls , 5th battalion , the royal regiment of scotland , who 's from oban , is one of the british troops helping to mentor the afghan national army -lrb- ana -rrb- .
there were some efforts by the afghan army to catch some fish earlier in the day - with rocket propelled grenades afghanistan 's ' lack of vehicles ' " the afghan soldiers are actually very motivated in the field - they may not have much experience , but they show no fear .
" at times it 's hard to hold them back as they do n't know the big picture and that there are other things happening on the battlefield , " he told me .
" it 's been physically and mentally very difficult - we 're still struggling with the heat - but the food is second to none if you like corned beef hash . "
there were some efforts by the afghan army to catch some fish earlier in the day - with rocket-propelled grenades - and some of them have found a comfortable spot to bed down - on a huge pile of marijuana discovered in one of the compounds .
captain rob worthington is from queen 's company of the grenadier guards and they have the job of training and fighting with the ana who took this strategically important position in the sangin valley .
" morale is high both among the british and the afghan forces - we 're keen to get on with the task in hand .
the local people are happy that we are here and have been helping us identify taleban positions , " he said .
" we 'll be here for three weeks to hold the ground we 've captured before we hand it over to the afghan national police . "
i joined the engineers as they left the comfort of forward operating base price this afternoon and cleared a road through what was , until a day ago , taleban territory , coming under fire at one point as they drove along an irrigation canal .
they stopped at a small bridge , not big enough for trucks with supplies to cross over , so in the heat they unloaded and built a metal bridge in just a couple of hours .
there were a few missing parts of the bridge , but the ana came up with a solution to get all the vehicles across and all the necessary equipment forward to build the front-line bases .
the commanding officer said it would also be left behind to help the locals .
that 's what it 's about now - having cleared many of the taleban fighters out , it 's a matter of trying to win the support of the people to stop them from coming back and re-establishing themselves in the area .
and the troops say the locals are now helping to point out where the taleban are .
2345 local time -lrb- 2015 bst -rrb- : : 30 april i had nothing but respect for the men of b company 1st royal anglians who headed back out for another night in the desert and another day of fighting ahead of them .
their faces said it all as i took my bags off the viking armoured vehicle -lrb- not a moment too soon -rrb- at forward operating base -lrb- fob -rrb- price in gereshk .
rather than writing this crammed into a corner of the viking in the dark , the only relief from the heat of the day bottled water so warm i 've had colder cups of tea , i 'm lying in my sleeping bag in a tent looking forward to a shower and breakfast in the morning .
the power supply in the van - a heath robinson affair taped together by an electrical engineer at camp bastion - had dramatically gone up in smoke in the back of the viking .
no power means no way of recharging camera batteries , laptop or satellite dish for e-mailing reports and broadcasting tv and radio , so i took the opportunity of an unplanned stop at fob price to jump ship .
and then there is the issue of holding the ground gained as the poppy harvest ends and more taleban foot soldiers potentially return to the insurgency one of the vehicles had broken down - the second one to need towing in as many days - and it had to be brought to a base for repairs - a three-hour round trip at night after a long , long day .

the party lost one seat on the unitary authority of south gloucestershire .
the party had said it hoped to emulate the liberal democrats by starting off with a solid local base and building up its profile nationally .
results show the principal minor parties are all losing support in key wards compared with last year .
but thousands of votes around the uk still have to be counted , with a full picture only likely to emerge later .
eyes on assembly before polls opened , a ukip spokesman said having 30 or 40 council seats would be the " first step on the road " to building its support .
it trebled the number of candidates it fielded to " about 1,030 " - excluding town and parish councillors .

some of the 10 artefacts donated by lord robert clive 's relations have never been on public display before .
among the riches on show at the clive of india museum at powis castle , in welshpool , is a silver opium smoking pipe set with rubies and diamonds .
the castle already boasts 300 of lord clive 's indian artefacts .
clive was the son of a shropshire squire and became a soldier , adventurer and a key figure in british india .
in 1757 , his army won the battle of plassey against the nawab of bengal , which signalled britain 's control over the country .
his son later married into the herbert family who once owned powis castle .
it is now run by the national trust .
margaret gray , of powis castle , said : " this september will mark the 20th anniversary of the opening of the clive museum , so the additions are an excellent way of celebrating .
" they are incredible pieces , necessities to any indian nobleman during the 18th century , adding to the exotica of this collection . "
other items on loan include a steel elephant goad - a prod used to guide the animals - and two ceremonial staffs with ivory shafts , topped with a tiger 's head .
the powis castle museum was opened in 1987 by countess mountbatten of burma .

boosting renewable energy , reducing deforestation and improving energy efficiency can all help , they said .
this is the third report this year from the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , and aims to set out the costs and benefits of various policies .
ipcc chair rajendra pachauri said the report was " stunning " . "
if we continue to do what we are doing now , we are in deep trouble " ogunlade davidson , ipcc most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need adobe reader " human society as a whole has to look for changes in consumption patterns , " he told reporters at a news conference in the thai capital .
the report suggests that if major climate impacts are to be avoided , global emissions should peak and begin declining within one or two decades .
the ipcc has already this year produced the two other elements of this global assessment report - its fourth since 1990 - dealing respectively with the science of climate change and the potential impacts .
continued growth greenhouse gas emissions have risen by 70 % since 1970 , and will rise by between 25 % and 90 % over the next 25 years under " business as usual " .
that rise will mainly be caused by an expansion in the use of fossil fuels , which are set to continue as the world 's dominant energy source .
" if we continue to do what we are doing now , we are in deep trouble , " observed ogunlade davidson , a senior author on the report .
economics of climate change climate curbs : who will buy ?
during the early part of the week , china had repeatedly tried to tone down some elements of the draft text , delegates said , being keen to remove references to scenarios which it feared could affect its short-term economic growth .
but in later sessions it played a more consensual hand .
stable futures the report assesses the likely costs to the global economy of stabilising greenhouse gases at various concentrations in the atmosphere .
stabilisation at reasonable cost is possible , it concludes , commenting : " there is considerable economic potential for the mitigation of global greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades , that could offset the projected growth of global emissions or reduce emissions below current levels . "
the sharpest cuts , keeping greenhouse gas concentrations to levels equivalent to between 445 and 535 parts per million of carbon dioxide , might cost anything up to 3 % of global gdp by 2030 , while milder curbs could even enhance growth .
costs of stabilisation ipcc assesses the likely impacts on global gdp by 2030 if cost-effective routes are used stabilisation between 445ppm and 535ppm would cost less than 3 % of global gdp , it concludes between 535ppm and 590ppm would cost 0.2-2.5 % between 590ppm and 710ppm would bring anything between a net benefit of 0.6 % and a net cost of 1.2 % different greenhouse gases have different impacts on warming per volume ; total concentrations are expressed as the equivalent in parts per million of a certain volume of co2 -lrb- ppm co2-eq -rrb- current concentration is about 425ppm co2-eq the current atmospheric concentrations are equivalent to about 425 parts per million of co2 .
assessing the impacts of a given concentration is not an exact science , but many researchers believe that keeping concentrations below about 450ppm co2-eq is necessary if the average global temperature rise is to be kept below 2c , and major impacts avoided .
the ipcc suggests that concentrations between 445ppm and 490ppm would keep the temperature rise to 2.0-2.8c.
european union policy is to avoid a rise greater than 2c .
" if you want to stabilise around 450ppm , that means in a decade or two you have to start reducing emissions far below the current level , " said dr pachauri .
" so in other words , we have a very short window for turning around the trend we have in rising greenhouse gas emissions .
we do n't have the luxury of time .
building concensus " renewable energy generally has a positive impact on energy security , employment and air quality " ipcc report in quotes : reaction to report many technologies can play a role in cutting emissions , the ipcc says ; but it singles out the building sector as a potential major contributor , and energy efficiency as something that " plays a key role across many scenarios for most regions and timescales " .
nuclear power and carbon capture and storage , where emissions from fossil fuel power stations are captured and buried underground , could play important roles ; but with nuclear , " safety , weapons , proliferation and waste remain as constraints " .
but , observed dr pachauri , economic incentives are needed to drive any technological transformation .
" technology alone will not be enough , " he told bbc news , " and in any case , technology has a clear connection with government policy .
" incentives ... must come from taxes or a carbon price . "
catherine pearce , international climate campaigner with friends of the earth uk , said there was now no economic excuse for inaction .
have your say " you can not cut back co2 without catastrophic economic consequences " mark , usa send us your comments " this report shows that many affordable technologies and effective policies are readily available to tackle climate change , " she said .
" by introducing measures and investment that will stimulate sustainable renewable energies and energy efficiency , governments can help to achieve cuts in global emissions by 50 % by 2050 .
without this , we face devastating consequences . "

the report suggests that if major climate impacts are to be avoided , global emissions should peak and begin declining within one or two decades .
the ipcc has already this year produced the two other elements of this global assessment report - its fourth since 1990 - dealing respectively with the science of climate change and the potential impacts .
continued growth greenhouse gas emissions have risen by 70 % since 1970 , and will rise by between 25 % and 90 % over the next 25 years under " business as usual " .
that rise will mainly be caused by an expansion in the use of fossil fuels , which are set to continue as the world 's dominant energy source .
" if we continue to do what we are doing now , we are in deep trouble , " observed ogunlade davidson , a senior author on the report .
economics of climate change climate curbs : who will buy ?
during the early part of the week , china had repeatedly tried to tone down some elements of the draft text , delegates said , being keen to remove references to scenarios which it feared could affect its short-term economic growth .
but in later sessions it played a more consensual hand .
stable futures the report assesses the likely costs to the global economy of stabilising greenhouse gases at various concentrations in the atmosphere .
stabilisation at reasonable cost is possible , it concludes , commenting : " there is considerable economic potential for the mitigation of global greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades , that could offset the projected growth of global emissions or reduce emissions below current levels . "
the sharpest cuts , keeping greenhouse gas concentrations to levels equivalent to between 445 and 535 parts per million of carbon dioxide , might cost anything up to 3 % of global gdp by 2030 , while milder curbs could even enhance growth .
costs of stabilisation ipcc assesses the likely impacts on global gdp by 2030 if cost-effective routes are used stabilisation between 445ppm and 535ppm would cost less than 3 % of global gdp , it concludes between 535ppm and 590ppm would cost 0.2-2.5 % between 590ppm and 710ppm would bring anything between a net benefit of 0.6 % and a net cost of 1.2 % different greenhouse gases have different impacts on warming per volume ; total concentrations are expressed as the equivalent in parts per million of a certain volume of co2 -lrb- ppm co2-eq -rrb- current concentration is about 425ppm co2-eq the current atmospheric concentrations are equivalent to about 425 parts per million of co2 .
assessing the impacts of a given concentration is not an exact science , but many researchers believe that keeping concentrations below about 450ppm co2-eq is necessary if the average global temperature rise is to be kept below 2c , and major impacts avoided .
the ipcc suggests that concentrations between 445ppm and 490ppm would keep the temperature rise to 2.0-2.8c.
european union policy is to avoid a rise greater than 2c .
" if you want to stabilise around 450ppm , that means in a decade or two you have to start reducing emissions far below the current level , " said dr pachauri .
" so in other words , we have a very short window for turning around the trend we have in rising greenhouse gas emissions .
we do n't have the luxury of time .
building concensus renewable energy generally has a positive impact on energy security , employment and air quality ipcc report in quotes : reaction to report many technologies can play a role in cutting emissions , the ipcc says ; but it singles out the building sector as a potential major contributor , and energy efficiency as something that " plays a key role across many scenarios for most regions and timescales " .
nuclear power and carbon capture and storage , where emissions from fossil fuel power stations are captured and buried underground , could play important roles ; but with nuclear , " safety , weapons , proliferation and waste remain as constraints " .
but , observed dr pachauri , economic incentives are needed to drive any technological transformation .
" technology alone will not be enough , " he told bbc news , " and in any case , technology has a clear connection with government policy .
" incentives ... must come from taxes or a carbon price . "
catherine pearce , international climate campaigner with friends of the earth uk , said there was now no economic excuse for inaction .
have your say you can not cut back co2 without catastrophic economic consequences mark , usa send us your comments " this report shows that many affordable technologies and effective policies are readily available to tackle climate change , " she said .
" by introducing measures and investment that will stimulate sustainable renewable energies and energy efficiency , governments can help to achieve cuts in global emissions by 50 % by 2050 .
without this , we face devastating consequences . "

mr brown , favourite to succeed tony blair as prime minister , is confirmed for the literary event 's 20th year .
he will discuss his heroes , while former prime minister sir john major will talk about his love of cricket .
the line-up includes novelists doris lessing and thomas keneally , cricketer imran khan and comedy veterans ronnie corbett and leslie phillips .
the festival in the border town of hay-on-wye , famed for its 39 bookshops , has grown steadily in size and stature since its launch in 1988 .
then it was an invitation to " a few like-minded friends " to gather in the welsh countryside for a weekend of literary relaxation .
now moved to a huge tented field just outside hay , last year 's festival attracted around 130,000 people from the uk and overseas to 392 events .
the full line-up , confirmed by organisers , includes a range of musical events and a film festival which will run alongside the literary event .
as well as mr brown 's talk , sir john major will discuss the early years of his sporting passion , cricket .
meanwhile , current conservative leader david cameron will discuss the environment and shadow foreign secretary william hague slavery .
nobel prize winners wangari maathai , wole soyinka and derek walcott are included in this year 's programme alongside writers like kiran desai , martin amis , and edna o 'brien .
from the world of film and tv , comedy actors leslie phillips and ronnie corbett and peter falk - of colombo fame - are visiting hay .
other famous faces include singer billy bragg , and comedians marcus brigstocke and keith allen who will also be making appearances .
among the musical highlights will be a return for sir bob geldof , a long-time hay supporter , soul ii soul , senegalese singer baaba maal , and the festival will be rounded off by a performance by wales ' own operatic supremo bryn terfel , who performed at the first hay festival two decades ago .
ex us president bill clinton famously called it " the woodstock of the mind " when he addressed a packed hay tent it in 2001 .
last year his former vice-president al gore following in his footsteps brought his film an inconvenient truth about climate change to the festival stage .
the welsh festival , which runs from 24 may until 3 june , now has satellite events in segovia in spain and cartagena in colombia .

with budgets routinely topping $ 250m -lrb- £ 125m -rrb- , the studios ' reluctance to gamble with unfamiliar material is understandable .
in a climate of spiralling production costs , vast marketing outlays and increasingly narrow windows of box office opportunity , the stakes have never been higher .
but how many of this year 's blockbusters will realise their potential ?
the bbc news website offers its guide to the runners and riders .
spider-man 3 release dates : 4 may -lrb- uk & us -rrb- .
key players : tobey maguire , kirsten dunst , sam raimi -lrb- director -rrb- .
in a nutshell : the web-slinging superhero is back to battle an old foe , an evil doppelganger and a nemesis made of sand .
the buzz : though critics have voiced reservations about its surfeit of villains , the third instalment in sony 's comic-book franchise is guaranteed to start the summer with a bang .
its early release date gives it a head start on its nearest competitors .
shrek the third release dates : 18 may -lrb- us -rrb- , 29 june -lrb- uk -rrb- .
key players : mike myers , eddie murphy , chris miller -lrb- director -rrb- .
in a nutshell : to avoid being crowned king of far , far away , grumpy ogre shrek sets out to find a more suitable heir to the throne .
the buzz : shrek 2 's $ 920m -lrb- £ 460m -rrb- takings made it the most successful animated film ever , raising the bar for a third helping that boldly opens in the us slap-bang between two other eagerly-awaited ' three-quels ' .
pirates of the caribbean : at world 's end release dates : 24 may -lrb- uk -rrb- , 25 may -lrb- us -rrb- .
key players : johnny depp , orlando bloom , gore verbinski -lrb- director -rrb- .
in a nutshell : captain jack returns to lead a rogue 's gallery of pirates drawn from the four corners of the globe .
the buzz : rumours of a three-hour running time and a $ 300m -lrb- £ 150m -rrb- price-tag have made disney 's trilogy-completing swashbuckler the talk of hollywood .
but with pirates 2 breaking the $ 1bn -lrb- £ 500m -rrb- barrier last year , producer jerry bruckheimer wo n't be paying much attention .
ocean 's 13 release dates : 8 june -lrb- uk & us -rrb- .
key players : george clooney , brad pitt , steven soderbergh -lrb- director -rrb- .
in a nutshell : smooth criminal danny ocean rounds up the usual suspects to make casino owner al pacino pay for double-crossing a friend .
the buzz : screening out of competition at cannes will be the perfect launch pad for an all-star heist comedy that clooney and soderbergh promise will be an improvement on the critically slated ocean 's 12 .
die hard 4.0 release dates : 27 june -lrb- us -rrb- , 4 july -lrb- uk -rrb- .
key players : bruce willis , justin long , len wiseman -lrb- director -rrb- .
in a nutshell : veteran detective john mcclane teams up with a young computer hacker to foil a hi-tech terrorist plot .
the buzz : with more than a decade separating the third die hard from this latest instalment , nostalgia will be a key factor for a fox release that opens in the us on the same day as pixar 's ratatouille , and a week before transformers .
harry potter and the order of the phoenix release dates : 13 july -lrb- us & uk -rrb- .
key players : daniel radcliffe , emma watson , david yates -lrb- director -rrb- .
in a nutshell : the boy magician faces official opposition as he attempts to marshal forces against the evil lord voldemort .
the buzz : opening just ahead of the final potter book 's 21 july publication date certainly wo n't hurt the fifth instalment in a family-friendly franchise that has so far earned $ 3.5bn -lrb- £ 1.7bn -rrb- worldwide .
the bourne ultimatum release dates : 3 august -lrb- us -rrb- , 17 august -lrb- uk -rrb- .
key players : matt damon , joan allen , paul greengrass -lrb- director -rrb- .
in a nutshell : jason bourne 's quest to uncover his past is hampered by a new generation of agents with orders to kill him .
the buzz : with oscar nominee greengrass back behind the camera and sir tom stoppard penning the script , this universal offering has a stronger pedigree than most .
early trailers promise a lean , explosive thriller in the casino royale mould .

there are fears the national figure for spoilt ballots could exceed 100,000 .
seven counts have been suspended across scotland because of major problems with the new electronic system .
a statement from the scotland office said drs , the company responsible for the counting machines , must investigate the delays .
send us your views on the spoilt papers the scotland office said it shared the public 's concern about the high number of rejected ballot papers .
it said : " obviously , in various places , serious technical failures have arisen to delay the announcement of results .
" in the first instance , these failures must be investigated by drs and relevant returning officers against the timing targets set in the supply contract . "
the statement said that the scotland office shared the public 's concern about the high number of rejected ballot papers .
it said : " the independent electoral commission will undertake a statutory review into the conduct of this election .
" it is important that they look as a matter of urgency into delays in postal ballots , the high number of spoiled ballot papers , and the performance of the electronic counting machines . "
concerns have been raised about the decision to stage the scottish parliament and the local authority elections on the same day .
voters were presented with two ballot papers and two different voting systems .
the local authority elections are being held under the new single transferable vote system .
the returning officer at the glasgow shettleston count said there had been 2,035 spoilt papers , while in airdrie and shotts , labour 's majority of 1,446 was less than the 1,536 rejected ballots .
there were 1,850 spoilt papers in glasgow baillieston and 1,736 in the city 's anniesland constituency .
suspended counts aberdeen argyll and bute eastwood edinburgh livingston and linlithgow perth and tayside north strathkelvin and bearsden the counts in aberdeen , argyll and bute , edinburgh , eastwood , perth and tayside north and strathkelvin and bearsden were suspended until later on friday due to technical problems .
the problem at the strathkelvin and bearsden count occurred when the computer system could not validate the votes that had been counted so far .
bbc scotland political editor brian taylor described the situation as a disgrace .
sonya anderson , head of elections for drs which implemented the automated counting system , said there was a problem with the " consolidation " of the votes .
she said : " as we scan the ballot papers we are capturing the votes and recording the fact we are capturing those votes .
" once we have recorded all those votes we need to use a calculation to pull those results together and produce the results the returning officer is going to declare from .
" that process is taking longer than anticipated in some of the centres and some returning officers have decided because of the long wait that the staff and the candidates are experiencing that they are going to ask staff and candidates to go home while we resolve the issue . "
during his acceptance speech as the new msp for the gordon constituency , snp leader alex salmond criticised the voting arrangements and also earlier problems with postal voting .
he said : " the postal voting arrangements for this election across scotland were totally inadequate .

" as a direct result , tens of thousands of votes across scotland have been discounted .
that is totally unacceptable in a democratic society . "
david henderson , who worked as an information officer at thornwood primary school in the glasgow kelvin constituency , said he had " no doubt " that the decision to hold two elections , under different voting systems , on the same day , had led to the high number of spoilt votes .
in a response to bbc scotland political editor brian taylor 's blog , he wrote : " i would say 60 % of people coming into our polling station were unsure of how to vote .
" i 'm sure the electoral commission will find that spoilt ballots were due to either to ' x 's ' or ' 1 's ' and ' 2 's ' on the wrong ballot paper . "
alex donnelly , a voter in the airdrie and shotts constituency , said many voters had been told to fold their ballot papers despite national advice to the contrary .
