he joined the german greens party in 1984 and has been a member of the european parliament for the german and french greens in an alternating fashion since 1994 .
he is currently the co-president of the group european greens-european free alliance in the european parliament . dw-tv : daniel cohn-bendit , anyone observing the french presidential election campaign in the last few weeks could have been forgiven for thinking the winner will be the per son who can best sing the marseillaise . is patriotism the winner in this election ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit daniel cohn-bendit : well , it 's always like that during a presidential election in france .
the nearer you get to the ballot , the more french identity takes center stage .
but you 're right ; there has been some overstatement of the marseillaise and the french flag .
but that can be important when we 're not just talking about the french flag , but about what color is the hand holding it . does that mean france is moving more to the extreme right ? france is rightwing , that 's the reality .
or we might say it 's conservative , structurally conservative .
we saw that with the referendum on the european constitution .
you have to be aware that whoever wants to be president of france must also embody france , and that 's why it plays a role .
i do think the other issues are also important , though .
but i admit that i find this election is like a soccer cup tie match : somebody has to win and that means the result is what matters , but the game itself is rather boring . that means issues do n't play such an important role ? they change so quickly . no single issue is paramount . not even france 's decline or french fear of globalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters line up to cast their votes no , that would last a few days .
someone would then make one remark or another and it would become the main issue for four days .
but then social issues , the budget or europe would take over - it would take only a few days .
basically it 's really an election about personalities .
is sarkozy believable ?
is segolene royal as a woman capable ?
is bayrou able to create a majority ? they 're the central questions . according to the opinion polls we are looking at a three-way battle between segolene royal , francois bayrou and sarkozy .
or do you think that jean-marie le pen has a chance ? there are problems interpreting le pen 's ratings .
in the last election le pen got 17 percent of the vote .
a few days before that he had just 6 .
9 percent of voters who were prepared to say they would vote for him .
that 's the problem with the polls .
sarkozy 's strategy is to position himself so far to the right as possible so that le pen loses support . will he succeed ? until two weeks ago i would have said : yes .
but now when you look at the trend sarkozy is looking shaky and le pen once again has 15 or 16 percent .
if le pen does very well , then that would be a serious problem for sarkozy , because the biggest competition for votes is between sarkozy and le pen .
it would be a big surprise if sarkozy was not in the second round .
i do n't think it 's going to happen , though . so patriotism is playing such an important role that le pen could suddenly do very well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parisians wait to vote the problem is that sarkozy is polarizing the electorate to the right with very strange arguments .
he says that if a young person commits suicide , then genetic reasons are to blame .
paedophilia and homosexuality are also genetic .
sarkozy has made a big mistake there and even the church has distanced itself from him .
sarkozy is presenting very right-wing arguments .
he wants to create a ministry of immigration and national identity .
his arguments about culture are similar to those that were made in germany a few years ago .
this is all about taking votes away from le pen .
but it encourages people to move right because le pen has made it okay to discuss such things .
sarkozy has another very dangerous side : he says people should be proud of france , we 're not the ones who invented the final solution , we 're not the ones who invented genocide .
he 's alluding to anti-german sentiment that exists in certain conservative circles .
that 's very dangerous . if he wins , will he continue in that vein ? that 's the question : what will he do then ? germany and france are both in europe .
there 's a german-french relationship .
if sarkozy tries to play with that he 'll have problems later with people in the middle ground because they do n't want that .
the past history between the two countries is exactly that : it 's in the past .
there 's a new relationship with germany .
i think it 's very dangerous to throw that relationship back to 1945 .
it 's not only playing with french society and with europe 's future , it 's also endangering sarkozy 's acceptance by the french people . can segolene royal fill that gap ? well , i think that 's exactly the situation right now .
royal stands for renewal in the socialist party . she also instituted a change in generation . she embodies the new generation .
but she 's a woman and during the campaign people suddenly realized that when a woman makes a mistake it 's doubly worse .
there have been several examples during the campaign and people have questioned segolene royal 's ability to be president . has there suddenly been a sympathy-effect for royal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one thing 's for certain : chirac wo n't be france 's next president there has been , but in my opinion it was not enough .
i think that in the second round royal has the chance to achieve a bigger wave of support .
but only for a single reason as it is with most elections : which aversion is stronger ?
the anti-sarkozy or the anti-royal ? the election would be a choice between being anti-sarkozy and anti-royal .
it would be a battle between two camps .
one camp would be everybody who does n't want sarkozy and the other everybody who does n't want royal .
that will be crucial . what can europe expect from a president royal or president sarkozy ? if he 's elected , sarkozy will quite quickly take small steps in institutional reform , basically implementing the treaty of nice accept with some improvements .
i think segolene royal would be forced to bring content and institution together , meaning she would have to put more emphasis on social issues within europe .
as regards bayrou : it would lead to a center-left coalition , if royal wins .
bayrou is the most pro-european judging by his arguments and that 's why i think a center-left government would play a positive role in the constitutional process . alexander kudascheff interviewed daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sunshine and suspense bring france out to vote bright sunshine and high suspense saw voters across france pouring into polling booths sunday to take part in a nail-biting presidential election that kept the country guessing to the last .

german officials on sunday called for reopening the probe of the 1977 murder of a federal prosecutor after a former leftist radical stepped forward to say a man serving time was not involved . the news weekly der spiegel reported in an issue to be published monday that it had evidence which allegedly showed that an ex-member of the red army faction guerrilla group , stefan wisniewski , had shot and killed chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback . the murder , which was never solved , had long been blamed in part on fellow raf radical christian klar , who recently lodged a plea for clemency with president horst köhler after more than 24 years in prison . klar was arrested in 1982 and jailed for his role in multiple murders .
his sentence stipulates that he will not be eligible for parole until 2009 , unless he is pardoned first . buback became the first victim of a bloody era dubbed the " german autumn " of 1977 when he was shot in his mercedes car by a raf gunman on a motorcycle in the southwestern city of karlsruhe . old news for german officials ? der spiegel reported that former raf member verena becker had told german authorities in the early 1980s that wisniewski had slain buback , and it quoted another raf militant , peter-jürgen boock , as now confirming that claim . they said klar had merely driven the get-away car . wisniewski was released in 1999 after 21 years in prison for other raf murders .

in germany murder is not subject to a statute of limitations . unforgivable oversight ? former interior minister gerhard baum of the opposition free democrats led a chorus at the weekend calling for the case to be reopened , adding that if prosecutors ignored exculpatory evidence in the 1980s it would be " an oversight that would be difficult to forgive .

german officials on sunday called for reopening the probe of the 1977 murder of a federal prosecutor after a former leftist radical stepped forward to say a man serving time was not involved . the news weekly der spiegel reported in an issue to be published monday that it had evidence which allegedly showed that an ex-member of the red army faction guerrilla group , stefan wisniewski , had shot and killed chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback . the murder , which was never solved , had long been blamed in part on fellow raf radical christian klar , who recently lodged a plea for clemency with president horst köhler after more than 24 years in prison . klar was arrested in 1982 and jailed for his role in multiple murders .
his sentence stipulates that he will not be eligible for parole until 2009 , unless he is pardoned first . buback became the first victim of a bloody era dubbed the " german autumn " of 1977 when he was shot in his mercedes car by a raf gunman on a motorcycle in the southwestern city of karlsruhe . old news for german officials ? der spiegel reported that former raf member verena becker had told german authorities in the early 1980s that wisniewski had slain buback , and it quoted another raf militant , peter-jürgen boock , as now confirming that claim . they said klar had merely driven the get-away car . wisniewski was released in 1999 after 21 years in prison for other raf murders .

in germany murder is not subject to a statute of limitations . unforgivable oversight ? former interior minister gerhard baum of the opposition free democrats led a chorus at the weekend calling for the case to be reopened , adding that if prosecutors ignored exculpatory evidence in the 1980s it would be " an oversight that would be difficult to forgive .

torsten frings considers swapping bremen for turin and juventus the bundesliga is looking at a potential exodus of star names in the summer , with a number of players looking outside germany for prospective new employers as the current season draws to a close . germany midfielder torsten frings has met representatives of italian giants juventus to discuss a possible move from werder bremen to the italian giants , he said on tuesday .
frings was in turin monday with his wife , petra , and his adviser , norbert flippen , for talks with juventus sports director alessio secco and club official roberto bettega .
" i liked it there .
but that will not speed up my decision .
i will make up my mind over the next weeks , " he said .
" juve want me at all costs .
they do n't want me to be just another midfielder but ' the ' playmaker , " frings told the daily bild newspaper .
" i 'm thinking a lot about this idea . "
according to tuesday 's edition of turin 's la stampa daily , the issue mainly depends on frings ' wife , who allegedly is not thrilled about a move to the northern italian city .
but german reports also say werder would want considerably more than the roughly 8 million euros -lrb- $ 10.8 million -rrb- juve are said to be offering for frings before agreeing to any move .
secco is said to be preparing a trip to bremen next week for negotiations with werder , the 2004 german league and cup champions .
juve want frings to run midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings ' combative style will fit well in serie a the turin club are keen on signing the germany international this summer as they prepare for a return to serie a for forced demotion for the current season over a match-fixing scheme .
they have already signed a bundesliga player in bosnian midfielder hasan salihamidzic from bayern munich and are reportedly also interested in frings ' bremen teammate miroslav klose , the 2006 world cup top scorer .
although frings , 30 , still has two more years on his contract at bremen , he said at the weekend he was considering the approach from juventus but " wo n't be put under any pressure . "
klose has a deal in bremen until 2008 .
werder coach thomas schaaf said it was " legitimate " for frings to consider the offer , with italian reports saying the player could double his salary at juventus .
" if he has the feeling that he absolutely has to try something new then we will speak to him about the situation , " schaaf said .
" but the fact is that the conditions -lrb- for a move -rrb- have to be in place .
both miro -lrb- klose -rrb- and torsten still have a contract with us . "
werder bremen sporting director klaus allofs said he was surprised by the news .
" we 're not going to put ourselves under pressure .
if torsten no longer wants to play for werder i 'm not going to force him , " said allofs .
" we have in the past always succeeded in finding new talent .
we 're not dependant on one player , werder is more important than any player . "
however , losing both frings and klose would shear werder of two of their most established and world class players .

" miro thought he would have decided by now .
he says himself that it 's a difficult decision to take , " said agent alexander schutt .
news that the 28-year-old germany striker is looking to pastures new has put a number of europe 's big clubs on alert with manchester united and barcelona keeping tabs on his situation , while werder 's great rivals bayern munich are said to be considering making an offer which could tempt the polish-born forward to stay in the bundesliga .
after losing out on fiorentina ’ s world cup-winning hit-man , luca toni , bayern would gladly redirect the funds to their northern foes if it meant securing another of europe 's hottest strikers .

while the bayern hierarchy were less than willing to sell the england international earlier this season , the elimination form the champions league has seemingly changed their minds .

frings was in turin monday with his wife , petra , and his adviser , norbert flippen , for talks with juventus sports director alessio secco and club official roberto bettega .
" i liked it there .
but that will not speed up my decision .
i will make up my mind over the next weeks , " he said .
" juve want me at all costs .
they do n't want me to be just another midfielder but ' the ' playmaker , " frings told the daily bild newspaper .
" i 'm thinking a lot about this idea . "
according to tuesday 's edition of turin 's la stampa daily , the issue mainly depends on frings ' wife , who allegedly is not thrilled about a move to the northern italian city .
but german reports also say werder would want considerably more than the roughly 8 million euros -lrb- $ 10.8 million -rrb- juve are said to be offering for frings before agreeing to any move .
secco is said to be preparing a trip to bremen next week for negotiations with werder , the 2004 german league and cup champions .
juve want frings to run midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings ' combative style will fit well in serie a the turin club are keen on signing the germany international this summer as they prepare for a return to serie a for forced demotion for the current season over a match-fixing scheme .
they have already signed a bundesliga player in bosnian midfielder hasan salihamidzic from bayern munich and are reportedly also interested in frings ' bremen teammate miroslav klose , the 2006 world cup top scorer .
although frings , 30 , still has two more years on his contract at bremen , he said at the weekend he was considering the approach from juventus but " wo n't be put under any pressure . "
klose has a deal in bremen until 2008 .
werder coach thomas schaaf said it was " legitimate " for frings to consider the offer , with italian reports saying the player could double his salary at juventus .
" if he has the feeling that he absolutely has to try something new then we will speak to him about the situation , " schaaf said .
" but the fact is that the conditions -lrb- for a move -rrb- have to be in place .
both miro -lrb- klose -rrb- and torsten still have a contract with us . "
werder bremen sporting director klaus allofs said he was surprised by the news .
" we 're not going to put ourselves under pressure .
if torsten no longer wants to play for werder i 'm not going to force him , " said allofs .
" we have in the past always succeeded in finding new talent .
we 're not dependant on one player , werder is more important than any player . "
however , losing both frings and klose would shear werder of two of their most established and world class players .
hot-shot klose the must-have striker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has a number of top clubs monitoring his situation klose has been making noises of a possible move abroad for the best part of six months with his current deal at bremen coming up for renewal .
he is under contract with the german title challengers until next year but had previously told them he would have come to a decision by the beginning of 2007 .
" miro thought he would have decided by now .
he says himself that it 's a difficult decision to take , " said agent alexander schutt .
news that the 28-year-old germany striker is looking to pastures new has put a number of europe 's big clubs on alert with manchester united and barcelona keeping tabs on his situation , while werder 's great rivals bayern munich are said to be considering making an offer which could tempt the polish-born forward to stay in the bundesliga .
after losing out on fiorentina ’ s world cup-winning hit-man , luca toni , bayern would gladly redirect the funds to their northern foes if it meant securing another of europe 's hottest strikers .
hargreaves ' move to manchester back on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hargreaves could be wearing a different red kit next season the financial outlay for klose would also be eased if bayern allow the exit of another star name - owen hargreaves .
hargreaves has been a manchester united target since last summer and remains on sir alex ferguson 's wish list for the new season .
while the bayern hierarchy were less than willing to sell the england international earlier this season , the elimination form the champions league has seemingly changed their minds .
" if we really get an offer of 25 or 30 million euros for hargreaves i would think about it very seriously , " club president franz beckenbauer told premiere tv in germany after the bavarians crashed out to ac milan last week . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern search for replacements as departures draw near the season is only half-way through and yet a number of bayern munich 's midfielders are looking for new clubs .

he joined the german greens party in 1984 and has been a member of the european parliament for the german and french greens in an alternating fashion since 1994 .
he is currently the co-president of the group european greens-european free alliance in the european parliament . dw-tv : daniel cohn-bendit , anyone observing the french presidential election campaign in the last few weeks could have been forgiven for thinking the winner will be the per son who can best sing the marseillaise . is patriotism the winner in this election ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit daniel cohn-bendit : well , it 's always like that during a presidential election in france .
the nearer you get to the ballot , the more french identity takes center stage .
but you 're right ; there has been some overstatement of the marseillaise and the french flag .
but that can be important when we 're not just talking about the french flag , but about what color is the hand holding it . does that mean france is moving more to the extreme right ? france is rightwing , that 's the reality .
or we might say it 's conservative , structurally conservative .
we saw that with the referendum on the european constitution .
you have to be aware that whoever wants to be president of france must also embody france , and that 's why it plays a role .
i do think the other issues are also important , though .
but i admit that i find this election is like a soccer cup tie match : somebody has to win and that means the result is what matters , but the game itself is rather boring . that means issues do n't play such an important role ? they change so quickly . no single issue is paramount . not even france 's decline or french fear of globalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters line up to cast their votes no , that would last a few days .
someone would then make one remark or another and it would become the main issue for four days .
but then social issues , the budget or europe would take over - it would take only a few days .
basically it 's really an election about personalities .
is sarkozy believable ?
is segolene royal as a woman capable ?
is bayrou able to create a majority ? they 're the central questions . according to the opinion polls we are looking at a three-way battle between segolene royal , francois bayrou and sarkozy .
or do you think that jean-marie le pen has a chance ? there are problems interpreting le pen 's ratings .
in the last election le pen got 17 percent of the vote .
a few days before that he had just 6 .
9 percent of voters who were prepared to say they would vote for him .
that 's the problem with the polls .
sarkozy 's strategy is to position himself so far to the right as possible so that le pen loses support . will he succeed ? until two weeks ago i would have said : yes .
but now when you look at the trend sarkozy is looking shaky and le pen once again has 15 or 16 percent .
if le pen does very well , then that would be a serious problem for sarkozy , because the biggest competition for votes is between sarkozy and le pen .
it would be a big surprise if sarkozy was not in the second round .
i do n't think it 's going to happen , though . so patriotism is playing such an important role that le pen could suddenly do very well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parisians wait to vote the problem is that sarkozy is polarizing the electorate to the right with very strange arguments .
he says that if a young person commits suicide , then genetic reasons are to blame .
paedophilia and homosexuality are also genetic .
sarkozy has made a big mistake there and even the church has distanced itself from him .
sarkozy is presenting very right-wing arguments .
he wants to create a ministry of immigration and national identity .
his arguments about culture are similar to those that were made in germany a few years ago .
this is all about taking votes away from le pen .
but it encourages people to move right because le pen has made it okay to discuss such things .
sarkozy has another very dangerous side : he says people should be proud of france , we 're not the ones who invented the final solution , we 're not the ones who invented genocide .
he 's alluding to anti-german sentiment that exists in certain conservative circles .
that 's very dangerous . if he wins , will he continue in that vein ? that 's the question : what will he do then ? germany and france are both in europe .
there 's a german-french relationship .
if sarkozy tries to play with that he 'll have problems later with people in the middle ground because they do n't want that .
the past history between the two countries is exactly that : it 's in the past .
there 's a new relationship with germany .
i think it 's very dangerous to throw that relationship back to 1945 .
it 's not only playing with french society and with europe 's future , it 's also endangering sarkozy 's acceptance by the french people . can segolene royal fill that gap ? well , i think that 's exactly the situation right now .
royal stands for renewal in the socialist party . she also instituted a change in generation . she embodies the new generation .
but she 's a woman and during the campaign people suddenly realized that when a woman makes a mistake it 's doubly worse .
there have been several examples during the campaign and people have questioned segolene royal 's ability to be president . has there suddenly been a sympathy-effect for royal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one thing 's for certain : chirac wo n't be france 's next president there has been , but in my opinion it was not enough .
i think that in the second round royal has the chance to achieve a bigger wave of support .
but only for a single reason as it is with most elections : which aversion is stronger ?
the anti-sarkozy or the anti-royal ? the election would be a choice between being anti-sarkozy and anti-royal .
it would be a battle between two camps .
one camp would be everybody who does n't want sarkozy and the other everybody who does n't want royal .
that will be crucial . what can europe expect from a president royal or president sarkozy ? if he 's elected , sarkozy will quite quickly take small steps in institutional reform , basically implementing the treaty of nice accept with some improvements .
i think segolene royal would be forced to bring content and institution together , meaning she would have to put more emphasis on social issues within europe .
as regards bayrou : it would lead to a center-left coalition , if royal wins .
bayrou is the most pro-european judging by his arguments and that 's why i think a center-left government would play a positive role in the constitutional process . alexander kudascheff interviewed daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sunshine and suspense bring france out to vote bright sunshine and high suspense saw voters across france pouring into polling booths sunday to take part in a nail-biting presidential election that kept the country guessing to the last .

the club will be modeled on highly exclusive establishments found in london 's soho and new york 's manhattan districts , where entrance is restricted to club members and specially invited guests only , and membership costs around 900 euros -lrb- $ 1,224 -rrb- annually .
the publicity-shy british investor has commissioned the jsk architectural bureau in berlin to carry out renovations on the downtrodden berlin building , which remains a listed property and is located near the former communist palace of the republic , which is now being demolished .
department store turned party hq the building 's history in prenzlauer berg dates back to 1928-29 when jewish business partners hermann golluber and hugo halle invested their life savings in a department store in lothringerstrasse , now renamed torstrasse , where customers could purchase goods on credit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis forced all jews out of business but its history was chequered from the start .
within a few years , its two owners were to be robbed of their premises by the nazis , and forced to flee the country .
golluber found refuge in america .
" aryanized , " by the new " german " owners , the building was later sold to the regime , which turned it into a nazi party youth headquarters from 1942 .
the german youth leadership , or reichsjugendfuerhrung , supervised leisure activities of 9 million members of the hitler youth from there .
then , in the early postwar years , the building became the " haus der einheit , " or house of unity , and served as the seat of the east german communist party from 1946-56 .
two powerful communist party leaders , wilhelm pieck and otto grotowohl worked there .
the street also renamed wilhem pieck strasse .
later , the building housed the east german communist party archives , and the central committee 's historical institute .
but that chapter ended in late 1989 when the berlin wall fell , and the east german communist party itself was confined to history 's rubbish bin a few months later .
years of neglect for the past 12 years the building , within sight of the city 's soaring tv tower on alexanderplatz , has lain empty and was steadily decaying ; its interior walls peeling , parquet floor rotting and electrical installations destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around alexanderplatz has undergone huge changes since the wall went down after the city 's reunification , it was legally returned to the jewish family descendants of the original owners , scattered across the world , who finally managed to sell the property to a british investor .
earlier in the week , rainer eppelmann , a former fierce opponent of the east german communist regime , together with andre schmitz , a berlin government -lrb- culture -rrb- state secretary , unveiled a stele outside the " haus der einheit . "
texts written in four languages and exhibited behind a sealed glass panel explain the building 's turbulent , near 80-year-old history .
" remembrance needs location , but remembrance also needs knowledge and recognition , " said eppelmann , when noting that there were today few survivors remaining to tell of the building 's convulsive past .
" if houses could relate history , this one would have enough for a complete novel , " smitz said .
converting the property into the soho house media club is expected to take 16 months , and it is expected to open sometime in 2008 .

the club will be modeled on highly exclusive establishments found in london 's soho and new york 's manhattan districts , where entrance is restricted to club members and specially invited guests only , and membership costs around 900 euros -lrb- $ 1,224 -rrb- annually .
the publicity-shy british investor has commissioned the jsk architectural bureau in berlin to carry out renovations on the downtrodden berlin building , which remains a listed property and is located near the former communist palace of the republic , which is now being demolished .
department store turned party hq the building 's history in prenzlauer berg dates back to 1928-29 when jewish business partners hermann golluber and hugo halle invested their life savings in a department store in lothringerstrasse , now renamed torstrasse , where customers could purchase goods on credit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis forced all jews out of business but its history was chequered from the start .
within a few years , its two owners were to be robbed of their premises by the nazis , and forced to flee the country .
golluber found refuge in america .
" aryanized , " by the new " german " owners , the building was later sold to the regime , which turned it into a nazi party youth headquarters from 1942 .
the german youth leadership , or reichsjugendfuerhrung , supervised leisure activities of 9 million members of the hitler youth from there .
then , in the early postwar years , the building became the " haus der einheit , " or house of unity , and served as the seat of the east german communist party from 1946-56 .
two powerful communist party leaders , wilhelm pieck and otto grotowohl worked there .
the street also renamed wilhem pieck strasse .
later , the building housed the east german communist party archives , and the central committee 's historical institute .
but that chapter ended in late 1989 when the berlin wall fell , and the east german communist party itself was confined to history 's rubbish bin a few months later .
years of neglect for the past 12 years the building , within sight of the city 's soaring tv tower on alexanderplatz , has lain empty and was steadily decaying ; its interior walls peeling , parquet floor rotting and electrical installations destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around alexanderplatz has undergone huge changes since the wall went down after the city 's reunification , it was legally returned to the jewish family descendants of the original owners , scattered across the world , who finally managed to sell the property to a british investor .
earlier in the week , rainer eppelmann , a former fierce opponent of the east german communist regime , together with andre schmitz , a berlin government -lrb- culture -rrb- state secretary , unveiled a stele outside the " haus der einheit . "
texts written in four languages and exhibited behind a sealed glass panel explain the building 's turbulent , near 80-year-old history .
" remembrance needs location , but remembrance also needs knowledge and recognition , " said eppelmann , when noting that there were today few survivors remaining to tell of the building 's convulsive past .
" if houses could relate history , this one would have enough for a complete novel , " smitz said .
converting the property into the soho house media club is expected to take 16 months , and it is expected to open sometime in 2008 .

but the polls also say that about a third of the 45 million voters are undecided , with many indicating they would only make up their minds in the hours before heading for the polling station .
that has given hope to centrist francois bayrou and far-right leader jean-marie le pen that they can sneak past socialist segolene royal who has been second behind sarkozy in months of polls leading up to the vote .
no one in the french political establishment has forgotten le pen 's stunning feat in 2002 when he beat the socialist candidate lionel jospin in the first round to reach the runoff .
confusion reins analysts say the months of campaigning by sarkozy , royal , bayrou , le pen and their rival trotskyist , ecologist and nationalist candidates has left the public more confused than decisive .
there is also a greater awareness of tactical voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question is who will join sarkozy for the second round there has been much talk of some left wingers voting for bayrou instead of royal in a bid to have a better chance of stopping sarkozy in the second round .
could a protest vote for ecologist dominique voynet in the first round help le pen reach the runoff again , some wonder .
jerome perani , a 37-year-old marketing executive for a paris technology firm who voted socialist in 2002 , said he was considering voting bayrou this time as a " purely tactical choice - almost like game theory . "
the authoritative le monde newspaper summed up the dilemma facing the french : " many voters are not wondering who they should vote for sunday , but how : with their heart or their head ? "
one recent survey said that only 43 percent of voters considered that the campaign had helped them .
fifty-nine percent said they thought the campaign had been of poor standard .
many polls have indicated that the public has been turned off by the reliance on personal attacks rather than political debate by the rival candidates .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen has been good for surprises in the past " no candidate has managed to impress with durable themes , " said roland cayrol of the polling organization bva .
cayrol highlighted how the socialist francois mitterrand won an emphatic victory in 1981 because of widespread fears about employment .
in 2002 , insecurity was a key topic after a series of murders and other crimes .
cayrol said that french voters had wanted a debate before the first round to help them make up their minds .

but the polls also say that about a third of the 45 million voters are undecided , with many indicating they would only make up their minds in the hours before heading for the polling station .
that has given hope to centrist francois bayrou and far-right leader jean-marie le pen that they can sneak past socialist segolene royal who has been second behind sarkozy in months of polls leading up to the vote .
no one in the french political establishment has forgotten le pen 's stunning feat in 2002 when he beat the socialist candidate lionel jospin in the first round to reach the runoff .
confusion reins analysts say the months of campaigning by sarkozy , royal , bayrou , le pen and their rival trotskyist , ecologist and nationalist candidates has left the public more confused than decisive .
there is also a greater awareness of tactical voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question is who will join sarkozy for the second round there has been much talk of some left wingers voting for bayrou instead of royal in a bid to have a better chance of stopping sarkozy in the second round .
could a protest vote for ecologist dominique voynet in the first round help le pen reach the runoff again , some wonder .
jerome perani , a 37-year-old marketing executive for a paris technology firm who voted socialist in 2002 , said he was considering voting bayrou this time as a " purely tactical choice - almost like game theory . "
the authoritative le monde newspaper summed up the dilemma facing the french : " many voters are not wondering who they should vote for sunday , but how : with their heart or their head ? "
one recent survey said that only 43 percent of voters considered that the campaign had helped them .
fifty-nine percent said they thought the campaign had been of poor standard .
many polls have indicated that the public has been turned off by the reliance on personal attacks rather than political debate by the rival candidates .

at the saint-charles primary school in marseille , long queues formed from early morning for the curtained-off ballot booths in a room festooned with children 's drawings .
some voters in the southern port city had to cool their heels for more than an hour after the locks on the doors of several polling stations were found to have been blocked with glue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen cast his ballot in saint-cloud , outside paris many younger voters in their 20s said they were partially motivated by the need to prevent a repetition of the 2002 election , when a low turnout helped far-right leader jean-marie le pen eliminate the socialist candidate in the first round and secure a stunning run-off spot against president jacques chirac .
galvanized by concerns " i did n't vote in 2002 out of indifference , but then there was that terrible shock , " said kaoutcher ben amor , a 30-year-old medical assistant .
" i decided to register and come out today so as to avoid a similar situation where we would be left with virtually no choice in the second round . "
other voters also acknowledged being galvanized by the result in 2002 , like nurse brigitte cuvelliez , 49 , who cast her ballot in the central city of lyon for the first time since 1988 .
cuvelliez was one of the estimated one-third of french voters who , despite months of frenzied campaigning , only decided who to back at the last moment .

having reached her decision , however , she remained skeptical what her vote might achieve .
" once elected , politicians do just what they want , " she said .

looking for change in the regions around paris , voters waited patiently for their chance to participate in what many believed to be the most important presidential election for decades .
" i 'm looking for major social reform , especially given the gap between rich and poor which is worsening all the time , " said musician xavier cocollos , 40 , in suresnes , a suburb west of the french capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist candidate royal cast her vote in melle , western france businessman bruno labarre , 44 , was also looking for change .

he joined the german greens party in 1984 and has been a member of the european parliament for the german and french greens in an alternating fashion since 1994 .
he is currently the co-president of the group european greens-european free alliance in the european parliament . dw-tv : daniel cohn-bendit , anyone observing the french presidential election campaign in the last few weeks could have been forgiven for thinking the winner will be the per son who can best sing the marseillaise . is patriotism the winner in this election ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit daniel cohn-bendit : well , it 's always like that during a presidential election in france .
the nearer you get to the ballot , the more french identity takes center stage .
but you 're right ; there has been some overstatement of the marseillaise and the french flag .
but that can be important when we 're not just talking about the french flag , but about what color is the hand holding it . does that mean france is moving more to the extreme right ? france is rightwing , that 's the reality .
or we might say it 's conservative , structurally conservative .
we saw that with the referendum on the european constitution .
you have to be aware that whoever wants to be president of france must also embody france , and that 's why it plays a role .
i do think the other issues are also important , though .
but i admit that i find this election is like a soccer cup tie match : somebody has to win and that means the result is what matters , but the game itself is rather boring . that means issues do n't play such an important role ? they change so quickly . no single issue is paramount . not even france 's decline or french fear of globalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters line up to cast their votes no , that would last a few days .
someone would then make one remark or another and it would become the main issue for four days .
but then social issues , the budget or europe would take over - it would take only a few days .
basically it 's really an election about personalities .
is sarkozy believable ?
is segolene royal as a woman capable ?
is bayrou able to create a majority ? they 're the central questions . according to the opinion polls we are looking at a three-way battle between segolene royal , francois bayrou and sarkozy .
or do you think that jean-marie le pen has a chance ? there are problems interpreting le pen 's ratings .
in the last election le pen got 17 percent of the vote .
a few days before that he had just 6 .
9 percent of voters who were prepared to say they would vote for him .
that 's the problem with the polls .
sarkozy 's strategy is to position himself so far to the right as possible so that le pen loses support . will he succeed ? until two weeks ago i would have said : yes .
but now when you look at the trend sarkozy is looking shaky and le pen once again has 15 or 16 percent .
if le pen does very well , then that would be a serious problem for sarkozy , because the biggest competition for votes is between sarkozy and le pen .
it would be a big surprise if sarkozy was not in the second round .
i do n't think it 's going to happen , though . so patriotism is playing such an important role that le pen could suddenly do very well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parisians wait to vote the problem is that sarkozy is polarizing the electorate to the right with very strange arguments .
he says that if a young person commits suicide , then genetic reasons are to blame .
paedophilia and homosexuality are also genetic .
sarkozy has made a big mistake there and even the church has distanced itself from him .
sarkozy is presenting very right-wing arguments .
he wants to create a ministry of immigration and national identity .
his arguments about culture are similar to those that were made in germany a few years ago .
this is all about taking votes away from le pen .
but it encourages people to move right because le pen has made it okay to discuss such things .
sarkozy has another very dangerous side : he says people should be proud of france , we 're not the ones who invented the final solution , we 're not the ones who invented genocide .
he 's alluding to anti-german sentiment that exists in certain conservative circles .
that 's very dangerous . if he wins , will he continue in that vein ? that 's the question : what will he do then ? germany and france are both in europe .
there 's a german-french relationship .
if sarkozy tries to play with that he 'll have problems later with people in the middle ground because they do n't want that .
the past history between the two countries is exactly that : it 's in the past .
there 's a new relationship with germany .
i think it 's very dangerous to throw that relationship back to 1945 .
it 's not only playing with french society and with europe 's future , it 's also endangering sarkozy 's acceptance by the french people . can segolene royal fill that gap ? well , i think that 's exactly the situation right now .
royal stands for renewal in the socialist party . she also instituted a change in generation . she embodies the new generation .
but she 's a woman and during the campaign people suddenly realized that when a woman makes a mistake it 's doubly worse .
there have been several examples during the campaign and people have questioned segolene royal 's ability to be president . has there suddenly been a sympathy-effect for royal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one thing 's for certain : chirac wo n't be france 's next president there has been , but in my opinion it was not enough .
i think that in the second round royal has the chance to achieve a bigger wave of support .
but only for a single reason as it is with most elections : which aversion is stronger ?
the anti-sarkozy or the anti-royal ? the election would be a choice between being anti-sarkozy and anti-royal .
it would be a battle between two camps .
one camp would be everybody who does n't want sarkozy and the other everybody who does n't want royal .
that will be crucial . what can europe expect from a president royal or president sarkozy ? if he 's elected , sarkozy will quite quickly take small steps in institutional reform , basically implementing the treaty of nice accept with some improvements .
i think segolene royal would be forced to bring content and institution together , meaning she would have to put more emphasis on social issues within europe .
as regards bayrou : it would lead to a center-left coalition , if royal wins .
bayrou is the most pro-european judging by his arguments and that 's why i think a center-left government would play a positive role in the constitutional process . alexander kudascheff interviewed daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sunshine and suspense bring france out to vote bright sunshine and high suspense saw voters across france pouring into polling booths sunday to take part in a nail-biting presidential election that kept the country guessing to the last .

he joined the german greens party in 1984 and has been a member of the european parliament for the german and french greens in an alternating fashion since 1994 .
he is currently the co-president of the group european greens-european free alliance in the european parliament . dw-tv : daniel cohn-bendit , anyone observing the french presidential election campaign in the last few weeks could have been forgiven for thinking the winner will be the per son who can best sing the marseillaise . is patriotism the winner in this election ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit daniel cohn-bendit : well , it 's always like that during a presidential election in france .
the nearer you get to the ballot , the more french identity takes center stage .
but you 're right ; there has been some overstatement of the marseillaise and the french flag .
but that can be important when we 're not just talking about the french flag , but about what color is the hand holding it . does that mean france is moving more to the extreme right ? france is rightwing , that 's the reality .
or we might say it 's conservative , structurally conservative .
we saw that with the referendum on the european constitution .
you have to be aware that whoever wants to be president of france must also embody france , and that 's why it plays a role .
i do think the other issues are also important , though .
but i admit that i find this election is like a soccer cup tie match : somebody has to win and that means the result is what matters , but the game itself is rather boring . that means issues do n't play such an important role ? they change so quickly . no single issue is paramount . not even france 's decline or french fear of globalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters line up to cast their votes no , that would last a few days .
someone would then make one remark or another and it would become the main issue for four days .
but then social issues , the budget or europe would take over - it would take only a few days .
basically it 's really an election about personalities .
is sarkozy believable ?
is segolene royal as a woman capable ?
is bayrou able to create a majority ? they 're the central questions . according to the opinion polls we are looking at a three-way battle between segolene royal , francois bayrou and sarkozy .
or do you think that jean-marie le pen has a chance ? there are problems interpreting le pen 's ratings .
in the last election le pen got 17 percent of the vote .
a few days before that he had just 6 .
9 percent of voters who were prepared to say they would vote for him .
that 's the problem with the polls .
sarkozy 's strategy is to position himself so far to the right as possible so that le pen loses support . will he succeed ? until two weeks ago i would have said : yes .
but now when you look at the trend sarkozy is looking shaky and le pen once again has 15 or 16 percent .
if le pen does very well , then that would be a serious problem for sarkozy , because the biggest competition for votes is between sarkozy and le pen .
it would be a big surprise if sarkozy was not in the second round .
i do n't think it 's going to happen , though . so patriotism is playing such an important role that le pen could suddenly do very well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parisians wait to vote the problem is that sarkozy is polarizing the electorate to the right with very strange arguments .
he says that if a young person commits suicide , then genetic reasons are to blame .
paedophilia and homosexuality are also genetic .
sarkozy has made a big mistake there and even the church has distanced itself from him .
sarkozy is presenting very right-wing arguments .
he wants to create a ministry of immigration and national identity .
his arguments about culture are similar to those that were made in germany a few years ago .
this is all about taking votes away from le pen .
but it encourages people to move right because le pen has made it okay to discuss such things .
sarkozy has another very dangerous side : he says people should be proud of france , we 're not the ones who invented the final solution , we 're not the ones who invented genocide .
he 's alluding to anti-german sentiment that exists in certain conservative circles .
that 's very dangerous . if he wins , will he continue in that vein ? that 's the question : what will he do then ? germany and france are both in europe .
there 's a german-french relationship .
if sarkozy tries to play with that he 'll have problems later with people in the middle ground because they do n't want that .
the past history between the two countries is exactly that : it 's in the past .
there 's a new relationship with germany .
i think it 's very dangerous to throw that relationship back to 1945 .
it 's not only playing with french society and with europe 's future , it 's also endangering sarkozy 's acceptance by the french people . can segolene royal fill that gap ? well , i think that 's exactly the situation right now .
royal stands for renewal in the socialist party . she also instituted a change in generation . she embodies the new generation .
but she 's a woman and during the campaign people suddenly realized that when a woman makes a mistake it 's doubly worse .
there have been several examples during the campaign and people have questioned segolene royal 's ability to be president . has there suddenly been a sympathy-effect for royal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one thing 's for certain : chirac wo n't be france 's next president there has been , but in my opinion it was not enough .
i think that in the second round royal has the chance to achieve a bigger wave of support .
but only for a single reason as it is with most elections : which aversion is stronger ?
the anti-sarkozy or the anti-royal ? the election would be a choice between being anti-sarkozy and anti-royal .
it would be a battle between two camps .
one camp would be everybody who does n't want sarkozy and the other everybody who does n't want royal .

schalke have 62 points to retain a two-point lead over werder bremen -lrb- 60 -rrb- , who briefly climbed to the top from a 3-1 friday victory against lowly alemannia aachen .
" it will remain tight until the end , " warned schalke coach mirko slomka .
vfb stuttgart have 58 points after an impressive 2-0 against the ailing champions munich , who remained on 53 points and - with only four rounds left - are in serious danger of not playing in the lucrative champions league for the first time since 1996 .
the top two finishers gain direct entry into the elite event , the third-placed team enters the qualifying round , the fourth and fifth- placed sides have to be content with a place in the uefa cup .
diego stuns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hard work paid off bremen 's win - with a stunning injury-time strike from playmaker diego from inside his own half rounding it off - seemed to have rattled schalke who had lots of trouble against the feared cottbus defense .
fabian ernst was denied by goalkeeper tomislav piplica , and schalke then called in vain for a penalty late in the first half when dario rodriguez appeared to have been brought down .
rost almost scored for cottbus in the 53rd when his intended cross hit the crossbar , and his bad luck was complete when he tapped hamit altintop 's cross into his own net seven minutes later for schalke 's lead .
schalke remained on course towards their first title in 49 years when bordon 's header for 2-0 in the 64th assured them of victory .
" cottbus made life difficult for us .
i told my players to be patient and we managed to create more pressure in the second half , " said slomka .
munich out of the race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no fun for munich in stuttgart , the opening goal in the 23rd minute reflected munich 's miserable campaign -lrb- by their standard -rrb- .
defender christian lell tried to clear in his area , but the ball hit stuttgart forward cacao , of whose body it bounced into the net .
cacao doubled the lead two minutes later for the cup finalists stuttgart , tapping in a cross from sami khedira .
the brazilian striker could have easily scored more goals within the next minutes against a crumbling munich defense , aiming inches wide in the 28th and denied by the crossbar in the 32nd .
" we are fourth and it is our own fault , " said munich midfielder mark van bommel after the team 's ninth season defeat .

mönchengladbach in trouble meanwhile on sunday , sv hamburg twice came from behind to earn a 2-2 draw against visiting mainz who remain deep in trouble near the foot of the bundesliga . the point , following four successive defeats , was not enough for mainz who are second from bottom , two points adrift of fellow strugglers alemannia aachen and arminia bielefeld . however the relegation battle remains dramatic , with only five points between mainz and 10th placed hamburg with four matches of the season remaining . bottom club borussia mönchengladbach 's fate now looks sealed after a 1-0 defeat at hanover which leaves them eight points adrift of mainz . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de werder back on top of bundesliga werder bremen swept to the top of the bundesliga after coming from behind to beat alemannia aachen 3-1 friday .

but the polls also say that about a third of the 45 million voters are undecided , with many indicating they would only make up their minds in the hours before heading for the polling station .
that has given hope to centrist francois bayrou and far-right leader jean-marie le pen that they can sneak past socialist segolene royal who has been second behind sarkozy in months of polls leading up to the vote .
no one in the french political establishment has forgotten le pen 's stunning feat in 2002 when he beat the socialist candidate lionel jospin in the first round to reach the runoff .
confusion reins analysts say the months of campaigning by sarkozy , royal , bayrou , le pen and their rival trotskyist , ecologist and nationalist candidates has left the public more confused than decisive .
there is also a greater awareness of tactical voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question is who will join sarkozy for the second round there has been much talk of some left wingers voting for bayrou instead of royal in a bid to have a better chance of stopping sarkozy in the second round .
could a protest vote for ecologist dominique voynet in the first round help le pen reach the runoff again , some wonder .
jerome perani , a 37-year-old marketing executive for a paris technology firm who voted socialist in 2002 , said he was considering voting bayrou this time as a " purely tactical choice - almost like game theory . "
the authoritative le monde newspaper summed up the dilemma facing the french : " many voters are not wondering who they should vote for sunday , but how : with their heart or their head ? "
one recent survey said that only 43 percent of voters considered that the campaign had helped them .
fifty-nine percent said they thought the campaign had been of poor standard .
many polls have indicated that the public has been turned off by the reliance on personal attacks rather than political debate by the rival candidates .
country in crisis all the candidates say france is a country in crisis , social and economic , but no one platform has grabbed the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen has been good for surprises in the past " no candidate has managed to impress with durable themes , " said roland cayrol of the polling organization bva .
cayrol highlighted how the socialist francois mitterrand won an emphatic victory in 1981 because of widespread fears about employment .
in 2002 , insecurity was a key topic after a series of murders and other crimes .
cayrol said that french voters had wanted a debate before the first round to help them make up their minds .

the club will be modeled on highly exclusive establishments found in london 's soho and new york 's manhattan districts , where entrance is restricted to club members and specially invited guests only , and membership costs around 900 euros -lrb- $ 1,224 -rrb- annually .
the publicity-shy british investor has commissioned the jsk architectural bureau in berlin to carry out renovations on the downtrodden berlin building , which remains a listed property and is located near the former communist palace of the republic , which is now being demolished .
department store turned party hq the building 's history in prenzlauer berg dates back to 1928-29 when jewish business partners hermann golluber and hugo halle invested their life savings in a department store in lothringerstrasse , now renamed torstrasse , where customers could purchase goods on credit .

the german youth leadership , or reichsjugendfuerhrung , supervised leisure activities of 9 million members of the hitler youth from there .
then , in the early postwar years , the building became the " haus der einheit , " or house of unity , and served as the seat of the east german communist party from 1946-56 .
two powerful communist party leaders , wilhelm pieck and otto grotowohl worked there .
the street also renamed wilhem pieck strasse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 22.04.2007 germans mull reopening left-wing terror murder case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what - if any - role did stefan wisniewski play ?
german officials on sunday called for reopening the probe of the 1977 murder of a federal prosecutor after a former leftist radical stepped forward to say a man serving time was not involved . the news weekly der spiegel reported in an issue to be published monday that it had evidence which allegedly showed that an ex-member of the red army faction guerrilla group , stefan wisniewski , had shot and killed chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback . the murder , which was never solved , had long been blamed in part on fellow raf radical christian klar , who recently lodged a plea for clemency with president horst köhler after more than 24 years in prison . klar was arrested in 1982 and jailed for his role in multiple murders .
his sentence stipulates that he will not be eligible for parole until 2009 , unless he is pardoned first . buback became the first victim of a bloody era dubbed the " german autumn " of 1977 when he was shot in his mercedes car by a raf gunman on a motorcycle in the southwestern city of karlsruhe . old news for german officials ? der spiegel reported that former raf member verena becker had told german authorities in the early 1980s that wisniewski had slain buback , and it quoted another raf militant , peter-jürgen boock , as now confirming that claim . they said klar had merely driven the get-away car . wisniewski was released in 1999 after 21 years in prison for other raf murders .
germany 's süddeutsche zeitung meanwhile reported that there was no evidence linking wisniewski to the buback murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael buback earlier this month , buback 's son michael gave his support to klar 's plea for clemency after receiving what he called credible information from anonymous sources connected to the now-disbanded group that klar was not involved in killing . michael buback told the welt am sonntag newspaper that he had now been called as a witness in the case by federal prosecutors .
in germany murder is not subject to a statute of limitations . unforgivable oversight ? former interior minister gerhard baum of the opposition free democrats led a chorus at the weekend calling for the case to be reopened , adding that if prosecutors ignored exculpatory evidence in the 1980s it would be " an oversight that would be difficult to forgive . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf still killed people in the late 1980s the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang after its founders andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , mounted a violent campaign against what it considered was the oppressive capitalist state of west germany from 1977 to 1982 . it targeted the german elite and the us military bases in germany and is suspected of killing 34 people .
the group officially disbanded in 1998 . brigitte mohnhaupt , who led the raf with klar after the group 's original leaders committed suicide in jail , was released from prison in march after serving 24 years for her role in nine murders , including buback 's . justice authorities said she no longer posed a threat to society . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we need proof that the german state is capable of mercy " gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison .

german officials on sunday called for reopening the probe of the 1977 murder of a federal prosecutor after a former leftist radical stepped forward to say a man serving time was not involved . the news weekly der spiegel reported in an issue to be published monday that it had evidence which allegedly showed that an ex-member of the red army faction guerrilla group , stefan wisniewski , had shot and killed chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback . the murder , which was never solved , had long been blamed in part on fellow raf radical christian klar , who recently lodged a plea for clemency with president horst köhler after more than 24 years in prison . klar was arrested in 1982 and jailed for his role in multiple murders .
his sentence stipulates that he will not be eligible for parole until 2009 , unless he is pardoned first . buback became the first victim of a bloody era dubbed the " german autumn " of 1977 when he was shot in his mercedes car by a raf gunman on a motorcycle in the southwestern city of karlsruhe . old news for german officials ? der spiegel reported that former raf member verena becker had told german authorities in the early 1980s that wisniewski had slain buback , and it quoted another raf militant , peter-jürgen boock , as now confirming that claim . they said klar had merely driven the get-away car . wisniewski was released in 1999 after 21 years in prison for other raf murders .

they will now square off on may 6 as french voters elect the next head of state for the coming five years . centrist francois bayrou came in third , with about 18 percent , with right-wing extremist jean-marie le pen finishing a distant fourth , at around 11 percent . sarkozy 's new dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy supporters cheered on sunday sarkozy told cheering supporters of his center-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- that he wanted to rally the french people behind a " new dream . " france must now choose between two visions of society in the second round , sarkozy said . " by placing me in the lead and madame royal in second position , -lrb- voters -rrb- clearly marked their wish to have a definitive debate on two ideas of the nation , two projects of society , two value systems , " he said . advantage : sarkozy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy does n't have too worry too much , analysts say analyst said that sarkozy was now a clear favorite to be france 's next president . according to a telephone poll conducted after sarkozy and royal were declared winners , sarkozy would get 54 percent while royal would only get 46 percent of the vote on may 6 . " it 's clear there is a big advantage for sarkozy , " jean-philippe roy , a politics professor at tours university , told afp news service .
" the whole left-right balance in the country has shifted .
it is really a historic moment . " simple arithmetic works in sarkozy 's favor , others said . " what we have set up for round two is a clear right-left showdown , but it is a showdown which i find hard to see how the left can win , " said dominique moisi of the french institute for international affairs , according to afp .
" the left are clearly a minority in the country .
if you add right , far-right and half the center , sarkozy is in an extremely comfortable position .
his decision to court the far-right vote has clearly paid off . " although sarkozy has the lead , analysts agreed that the race is not yet won .
this is because of the deep mistrust with which the former interior minister is regarded by many voters - even by some who support his ideas . " we have today a political situation i have never seen : a man who is highly likely to be the next president but who provokes unprecedented levels of hatred and rejection , " said dominique reynie , professor at the paris school of political sciences . " this is the moment for sarkozy to start talking to the french people - not just to his own camp , " he added .
" he 's got to look like a president , which in france means someone who has the nation behind him .
from now on it 's not his policies , but his personality that 's the issue . " royal reaches out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal hopes to become france 's first female president speaking to her socialist party supporters in the small town of melle in western france , royal called for voters to rally round her for the presidential runoff , promising to bring france change without upheaval . " i call on all those who ... believe it is possible to reform france without brutalizing it , who want a triumph of human values over the stock market , who want an end to the painful rise of insecurity and precariousness , to come together , " she said .
" i reach out to all those who believe it is not only possible but urgent to break with a system that is no longer working " after a disastrous start to her campaign , royal 's result was impressive , as she is credited with about nine percent more of the vote than the socialist candidate in 2002 , lionel jospin , received . many voters certainly remembered the first round of the 2002 presidential election , when le pen caused a political earthquake by outpolling jospin to make it to the run-off . in 2002 , left-wing candidates other than jospin garnered an impressive 26.71 per cent of the vote , while the socialist received only 16.18 per cent . this year , three trotskyist candidates , the green party standard-bearer and anti-globalization activist jose bove picked up only about 11 percent of the vote .
record turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters came out in record numbers the memory of 2002 no doubt also contributed to a voter participation rate that was near an all-time high for a first-round election in postwar france , with an estimated 84.5 percent of the country 's 44.5 million registered voters casting their ballots on sunday . the previous record was 84.75 percent , set in 1965 . five years ago , only 71.6 percent of registered voters went to the polls in the first round . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " this election is like a soccer cup tie match " in an interview with dw-tv , franco-german daniel cohn-bendit , a leading politician for the greens in europe , talked about the french presidential election and the consequences for france and europe .
-lrb- 22.04.2007 -rrb- sunshine and suspense bring france out to vote bright sunshine and high suspense saw voters across france pouring into polling booths sunday to take part in a nail-biting presidential election that kept the country guessing to the last .

" it 's clear there is a big advantage for sarkozy , " jean-philippe roy , a politics professor at tours university , told afp news service .
" the whole left-right balance in the country has shifted .
it is really a historic moment . " simple arithmetic works in sarkozy 's favor , others said . " what we have set up for round two is a clear right-left showdown , but it is a showdown which i find hard to see how the left can win , " said dominique moisi of the french institute for international affairs , according to afp .
" the left are clearly a minority in the country .
if you add right , far-right and half the center , sarkozy is in an extremely comfortable position .
his decision to court the far-right vote has clearly paid off . " although sarkozy has the lead , analysts agreed that the race is not yet won .
this is because of the deep mistrust with which the former interior minister is regarded by many voters - even by some who support his ideas . " we have today a political situation i have never seen : a man who is highly likely to be the next president but who provokes unprecedented levels of hatred and rejection , " said dominique reynie , professor at the paris school of political sciences . " this is the moment for sarkozy to start talking to the french people - not just to his own camp , " he added .
" he 's got to look like a president , which in france means someone who has the nation behind him .
from now on it 's not his policies , but his personality that 's the issue . " royal reaches out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal hopes to become france 's first female president speaking to her socialist party supporters in the small town of melle in western france , royal called for voters to rally round her for the presidential runoff , promising to bring france change without upheaval . " i call on all those who ... believe it is possible to reform france without brutalizing it , who want a triumph of human values over the stock market , who want an end to the painful rise of insecurity and precariousness , to come together , " she said .
" i reach out to all those who believe it is not only possible but urgent to break with a system that is no longer working " after a disastrous start to her campaign , royal 's result was impressive , as she is credited with about nine percent more of the vote than the socialist candidate in 2002 , lionel jospin , received . many voters certainly remembered the first round of the 2002 presidential election , when le pen caused a political earthquake by outpolling jospin to make it to the run-off . in 2002 , left-wing candidates other than jospin garnered an impressive 26.71 per cent of the vote , while the socialist received only 16.18 per cent . this year , three trotskyist candidates , the green party standard-bearer and anti-globalization activist jose bove picked up only about 11 percent of the vote .
record turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters came out in record numbers the memory of 2002 no doubt also contributed to a voter participation rate that was near an all-time high for a first-round election in postwar france , with an estimated 84.5 percent of the country 's 44.5 million registered voters casting their ballots on sunday . the previous record was 84.75 percent , set in 1965 . five years ago , only 71.6 percent of registered voters went to the polls in the first round . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " this election is like a soccer cup tie match " in an interview with dw-tv , franco-german daniel cohn-bendit , a leading politician for the greens in europe , talked about the french presidential election and the consequences for france and europe .

he joined the german greens party in 1984 and has been a member of the european parliament for the german and french greens in an alternating fashion since 1994 .
he is currently the co-president of the group european greens-european free alliance in the european parliament . dw-tv : daniel cohn-bendit , anyone observing the french presidential election campaign in the last few weeks could have been forgiven for thinking the winner will be the per son who can best sing the marseillaise . is patriotism the winner in this election ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit daniel cohn-bendit : well , it 's always like that during a presidential election in france .
the nearer you get to the ballot , the more french identity takes center stage .
but you 're right ; there has been some overstatement of the marseillaise and the french flag .
but that can be important when we 're not just talking about the french flag , but about what color is the hand holding it . does that mean france is moving more to the extreme right ? france is rightwing , that 's the reality .
or we might say it 's conservative , structurally conservative .
we saw that with the referendum on the european constitution .
you have to be aware that whoever wants to be president of france must also embody france , and that 's why it plays a role .
i do think the other issues are also important , though .
but i admit that i find this election is like a soccer cup tie match : somebody has to win and that means the result is what matters , but the game itself is rather boring . that means issues do n't play such an important role ? they change so quickly . no single issue is paramount . not even france 's decline or french fear of globalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters line up to cast their votes no , that would last a few days .
someone would then make one remark or another and it would become the main issue for four days .
but then social issues , the budget or europe would take over - it would take only a few days .
basically it 's really an election about personalities .
is sarkozy believable ?
is segolene royal as a woman capable ?
is bayrou able to create a majority ? they 're the central questions . according to the opinion polls we are looking at a three-way battle between segolene royal , francois bayrou and sarkozy .
or do you think that jean-marie le pen has a chance ? there are problems interpreting le pen 's ratings .
in the last election le pen got 17 percent of the vote .
a few days before that he had just 6 .
9 percent of voters who were prepared to say they would vote for him .
that 's the problem with the polls .
sarkozy 's strategy is to position himself so far to the right as possible so that le pen loses support . will he succeed ? until two weeks ago i would have said : yes .
but now when you look at the trend sarkozy is looking shaky and le pen once again has 15 or 16 percent .
if le pen does very well , then that would be a serious problem for sarkozy , because the biggest competition for votes is between sarkozy and le pen .
it would be a big surprise if sarkozy was not in the second round .
i do n't think it 's going to happen , though . so patriotism is playing such an important role that le pen could suddenly do very well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parisians wait to vote the problem is that sarkozy is polarizing the electorate to the right with very strange arguments .
he says that if a young person commits suicide , then genetic reasons are to blame .
paedophilia and homosexuality are also genetic .
sarkozy has made a big mistake there and even the church has distanced itself from him .
sarkozy is presenting very right-wing arguments .
he wants to create a ministry of immigration and national identity .
his arguments about culture are similar to those that were made in germany a few years ago .
this is all about taking votes away from le pen .
but it encourages people to move right because le pen has made it okay to discuss such things .
sarkozy has another very dangerous side : he says people should be proud of france , we 're not the ones who invented the final solution , we 're not the ones who invented genocide .
he 's alluding to anti-german sentiment that exists in certain conservative circles .
that 's very dangerous . if he wins , will he continue in that vein ? that 's the question : what will he do then ? germany and france are both in europe .
there 's a german-french relationship .
if sarkozy tries to play with that he 'll have problems later with people in the middle ground because they do n't want that .
the past history between the two countries is exactly that : it 's in the past .
there 's a new relationship with germany .
i think it 's very dangerous to throw that relationship back to 1945 .
it 's not only playing with french society and with europe 's future , it 's also endangering sarkozy 's acceptance by the french people . can segolene royal fill that gap ? well , i think that 's exactly the situation right now .
royal stands for renewal in the socialist party . she also instituted a change in generation . she embodies the new generation .
but she 's a woman and during the campaign people suddenly realized that when a woman makes a mistake it 's doubly worse .
there have been several examples during the campaign and people have questioned segolene royal 's ability to be president . has there suddenly been a sympathy-effect for royal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one thing 's for certain : chirac wo n't be france 's next president there has been , but in my opinion it was not enough .
i think that in the second round royal has the chance to achieve a bigger wave of support .
but only for a single reason as it is with most elections : which aversion is stronger ?
the anti-sarkozy or the anti-royal ? the election would be a choice between being anti-sarkozy and anti-royal .
it would be a battle between two camps .
one camp would be everybody who does n't want sarkozy and the other everybody who does n't want royal .
that will be crucial . what can europe expect from a president royal or president sarkozy ? if he 's elected , sarkozy will quite quickly take small steps in institutional reform , basically implementing the treaty of nice accept with some improvements .
i think segolene royal would be forced to bring content and institution together , meaning she would have to put more emphasis on social issues within europe .
as regards bayrou : it would lead to a center-left coalition , if royal wins .
bayrou is the most pro-european judging by his arguments and that 's why i think a center-left government would play a positive role in the constitutional process . alexander kudascheff interviewed daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sunshine and suspense bring france out to vote bright sunshine and high suspense saw voters across france pouring into polling booths sunday to take part in a nail-biting presidential election that kept the country guessing to the last .

sarkozy 's strategy is to position himself so far to the right as possible so that le pen loses support . will he succeed ? until two weeks ago i would have said : yes .
but now when you look at the trend sarkozy is looking shaky and le pen once again has 15 or 16 percent .
if le pen does very well , then that would be a serious problem for sarkozy , because the biggest competition for votes is between sarkozy and le pen .
it would be a big surprise if sarkozy was not in the second round .
i do n't think it 's going to happen , though . so patriotism is playing such an important role that le pen could suddenly do very well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parisians wait to vote the problem is that sarkozy is polarizing the electorate to the right with very strange arguments .
he says that if a young person commits suicide , then genetic reasons are to blame .
paedophilia and homosexuality are also genetic .
sarkozy has made a big mistake there and even the church has distanced itself from him .
sarkozy is presenting very right-wing arguments .
he wants to create a ministry of immigration and national identity .
his arguments about culture are similar to those that were made in germany a few years ago .
this is all about taking votes away from le pen .
but it encourages people to move right because le pen has made it okay to discuss such things .
sarkozy has another very dangerous side : he says people should be proud of france , we 're not the ones who invented the final solution , we 're not the ones who invented genocide .
he 's alluding to anti-german sentiment that exists in certain conservative circles .
that 's very dangerous . if he wins , will he continue in that vein ? that 's the question : what will he do then ? germany and france are both in europe .
there 's a german-french relationship .
if sarkozy tries to play with that he 'll have problems later with people in the middle ground because they do n't want that .
the past history between the two countries is exactly that : it 's in the past .
there 's a new relationship with germany .
i think it 's very dangerous to throw that relationship back to 1945 .
it 's not only playing with french society and with europe 's future , it 's also endangering sarkozy 's acceptance by the french people . can segolene royal fill that gap ? well , i think that 's exactly the situation right now .
royal stands for renewal in the socialist party . she also instituted a change in generation . she embodies the new generation .
but she 's a woman and during the campaign people suddenly realized that when a woman makes a mistake it 's doubly worse .
there have been several examples during the campaign and people have questioned segolene royal 's ability to be president . has there suddenly been a sympathy-effect for royal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one thing 's for certain : chirac wo n't be france 's next president there has been , but in my opinion it was not enough .
i think that in the second round royal has the chance to achieve a bigger wave of support .
but only for a single reason as it is with most elections : which aversion is stronger ?
the anti-sarkozy or the anti-royal ? the election would be a choice between being anti-sarkozy and anti-royal .
it would be a battle between two camps .
one camp would be everybody who does n't want sarkozy and the other everybody who does n't want royal .
that will be crucial . what can europe expect from a president royal or president sarkozy ? if he 's elected , sarkozy will quite quickly take small steps in institutional reform , basically implementing the treaty of nice accept with some improvements .
i think segolene royal would be forced to bring content and institution together , meaning she would have to put more emphasis on social issues within europe .
as regards bayrou : it would lead to a center-left coalition , if royal wins .

he joined the german greens party in 1984 and has been a member of the european parliament for the german and french greens in an alternating fashion since 1994 .
he is currently the co-president of the group european greens-european free alliance in the european parliament . dw-tv : daniel cohn-bendit , anyone observing the french presidential election campaign in the last few weeks could have been forgiven for thinking the winner will be the per son who can best sing the marseillaise . is patriotism the winner in this election ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit daniel cohn-bendit : well , it 's always like that during a presidential election in france .
the nearer you get to the ballot , the more french identity takes center stage .
but you 're right ; there has been some overstatement of the marseillaise and the french flag .
but that can be important when we 're not just talking about the french flag , but about what color is the hand holding it . does that mean france is moving more to the extreme right ? france is rightwing , that 's the reality .
or we might say it 's conservative , structurally conservative .
we saw that with the referendum on the european constitution .
you have to be aware that whoever wants to be president of france must also embody france , and that 's why it plays a role .
i do think the other issues are also important , though .
but i admit that i find this election is like a soccer cup tie match : somebody has to win and that means the result is what matters , but the game itself is rather boring . that means issues do n't play such an important role ? they change so quickly . no single issue is paramount . not even france 's decline or french fear of globalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters line up to cast their votes no , that would last a few days .
someone would then make one remark or another and it would become the main issue for four days .
but then social issues , the budget or europe would take over - it would take only a few days .
basically it 's really an election about personalities .
is sarkozy believable ?
is segolene royal as a woman capable ?
is bayrou able to create a majority ? they 're the central questions . according to the opinion polls we are looking at a three-way battle between segolene royal , francois bayrou and sarkozy .
or do you think that jean-marie le pen has a chance ? there are problems interpreting le pen 's ratings .
in the last election le pen got 17 percent of the vote .
a few days before that he had just 6 .
9 percent of voters who were prepared to say they would vote for him .
that 's the problem with the polls .
sarkozy 's strategy is to position himself so far to the right as possible so that le pen loses support . will he succeed ? until two weeks ago i would have said : yes .

at the saint-charles primary school in marseille , long queues formed from early morning for the curtained-off ballot booths in a room festooned with children 's drawings .

" i decided to register and come out today so as to avoid a similar situation where we would be left with virtually no choice in the second round . "
other voters also acknowledged being galvanized by the result in 2002 , like nurse brigitte cuvelliez , 49 , who cast her ballot in the central city of lyon for the first time since 1988 .
cuvelliez was one of the estimated one-third of french voters who , despite months of frenzied campaigning , only decided who to back at the last moment .

they will now square off on may 6 as french voters elect the next head of state for the coming five years . centrist francois bayrou came in third , with about 18 percent , with right-wing extremist jean-marie le pen finishing a distant fourth , at around 11 percent . sarkozy 's new dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy supporters cheered on sunday sarkozy told cheering supporters of his center-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- that he wanted to rally the french people behind a " new dream . " france must now choose between two visions of society in the second round , sarkozy said . " by placing me in the lead and madame royal in second position , -lrb- voters -rrb- clearly marked their wish to have a definitive debate on two ideas of the nation , two projects of society , two value systems , " he said . advantage : sarkozy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy does n't have too worry too much , analysts say analyst said that sarkozy was now a clear favorite to be france 's next president . according to a telephone poll conducted after sarkozy and royal were declared winners , sarkozy would get 54 percent while royal would only get 46 percent of the vote on may 6 . " it 's clear there is a big advantage for sarkozy , " jean-philippe roy , a politics professor at tours university , told afp news service .
" the whole left-right balance in the country has shifted .
it is really a historic moment . " simple arithmetic works in sarkozy 's favor , others said . " what we have set up for round two is a clear right-left showdown , but it is a showdown which i find hard to see how the left can win , " said dominique moisi of the french institute for international affairs , according to afp .
" the left are clearly a minority in the country .
if you add right , far-right and half the center , sarkozy is in an extremely comfortable position .
his decision to court the far-right vote has clearly paid off . " although sarkozy has the lead , analysts agreed that the race is not yet won .
this is because of the deep mistrust with which the former interior minister is regarded by many voters - even by some who support his ideas . " we have today a political situation i have never seen : a man who is highly likely to be the next president but who provokes unprecedented levels of hatred and rejection , " said dominique reynie , professor at the paris school of political sciences . " this is the moment for sarkozy to start talking to the french people - not just to his own camp , " he added .
" he 's got to look like a president , which in france means someone who has the nation behind him .

" royal reaches out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal hopes to become france 's first female president speaking to her socialist party supporters in the small town of melle in western france , royal called for voters to rally round her for the presidential runoff , promising to bring france change without upheaval . " i call on all those who ... believe it is possible to reform france without brutalizing it , who want a triumph of human values over the stock market , who want an end to the painful rise of insecurity and precariousness , to come together , " she said .
" i reach out to all those who believe it is not only possible but urgent to break with a system that is no longer working " after a disastrous start to her campaign , royal 's result was impressive , as she is credited with about nine percent more of the vote than the socialist candidate in 2002 , lionel jospin , received . many voters certainly remembered the first round of the 2002 presidential election , when le pen caused a political earthquake by outpolling jospin to make it to the run-off . in 2002 , left-wing candidates other than jospin garnered an impressive 26.71 per cent of the vote , while the socialist received only 16.18 per cent . this year , three trotskyist candidates , the green party standard-bearer and anti-globalization activist jose bove picked up only about 11 percent of the vote .
record turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters came out in record numbers the memory of 2002 no doubt also contributed to a voter participation rate that was near an all-time high for a first-round election in postwar france , with an estimated 84.5 percent of the country 's 44.5 million registered voters casting their ballots on sunday . the previous record was 84.75 percent , set in 1965 . five years ago , only 71.6 percent of registered voters went to the polls in the first round . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " this election is like a soccer cup tie match " in an interview with dw-tv , franco-german daniel cohn-bendit , a leading politician for the greens in europe , talked about the french presidential election and the consequences for france and europe .

they will now square off on may 6 as french voters elect the next head of state for the coming five years . centrist francois bayrou came in third , with about 18 percent , with right-wing extremist jean-marie le pen finishing a distant fourth , at around 11 percent . sarkozy 's new dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy supporters cheered on sunday sarkozy told cheering supporters of his center-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- that he wanted to rally the french people behind a " new dream . " france must now choose between two visions of society in the second round , sarkozy said . " by placing me in the lead and madame royal in second position , -lrb- voters -rrb- clearly marked their wish to have a definitive debate on two ideas of the nation , two projects of society , two value systems , " he said . advantage : sarkozy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy does n't have too worry too much , analysts say analyst said that sarkozy was now a clear favorite to be france 's next president . according to a telephone poll conducted after sarkozy and royal were declared winners , sarkozy would get 54 percent while royal would only get 46 percent of the vote on may 6 . " it 's clear there is a big advantage for sarkozy , " jean-philippe roy , a politics professor at tours university , told afp news service .
" the whole left-right balance in the country has shifted .
it is really a historic moment . " simple arithmetic works in sarkozy 's favor , others said . " what we have set up for round two is a clear right-left showdown , but it is a showdown which i find hard to see how the left can win , " said dominique moisi of the french institute for international affairs , according to afp .
" the left are clearly a minority in the country .
if you add right , far-right and half the center , sarkozy is in an extremely comfortable position .
his decision to court the far-right vote has clearly paid off . " although sarkozy has the lead , analysts agreed that the race is not yet won .
this is because of the deep mistrust with which the former interior minister is regarded by many voters - even by some who support his ideas . " we have today a political situation i have never seen : a man who is highly likely to be the next president but who provokes unprecedented levels of hatred and rejection , " said dominique reynie , professor at the paris school of political sciences . " this is the moment for sarkozy to start talking to the french people - not just to his own camp , " he added .
" he 's got to look like a president , which in france means someone who has the nation behind him .
from now on it 's not his policies , but his personality that 's the issue . " royal reaches out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal hopes to become france 's first female president speaking to her socialist party supporters in the small town of melle in western france , royal called for voters to rally round her for the presidential runoff , promising to bring france change without upheaval . " i call on all those who ... believe it is possible to reform france without brutalizing it , who want a triumph of human values over the stock market , who want an end to the painful rise of insecurity and precariousness , to come together , " she said .
" i reach out to all those who believe it is not only possible but urgent to break with a system that is no longer working " after a disastrous start to her campaign , royal 's result was impressive , as she is credited with about nine percent more of the vote than the socialist candidate in 2002 , lionel jospin , received . many voters certainly remembered the first round of the 2002 presidential election , when le pen caused a political earthquake by outpolling jospin to make it to the run-off . in 2002 , left-wing candidates other than jospin garnered an impressive 26.71 per cent of the vote , while the socialist received only 16.18 per cent . this year , three trotskyist candidates , the green party standard-bearer and anti-globalization activist jose bove picked up only about 11 percent of the vote .
record turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters came out in record numbers the memory of 2002 no doubt also contributed to a voter participation rate that was near an all-time high for a first-round election in postwar france , with an estimated 84.5 percent of the country 's 44.5 million registered voters casting their ballots on sunday . the previous record was 84.75 percent , set in 1965 . five years ago , only 71.6 percent of registered voters went to the polls in the first round . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " this election is like a soccer cup tie match " in an interview with dw-tv , franco-german daniel cohn-bendit , a leading politician for the greens in europe , talked about the french presidential election and the consequences for france and europe .

torsten frings considers swapping bremen for turin and juventus the bundesliga is looking at a potential exodus of star names in the summer , with a number of players looking outside germany for prospective new employers as the current season draws to a close . germany midfielder torsten frings has met representatives of italian giants juventus to discuss a possible move from werder bremen to the italian giants , he said on tuesday .
frings was in turin monday with his wife , petra , and his adviser , norbert flippen , for talks with juventus sports director alessio secco and club official roberto bettega .

" juve want me at all costs .
they do n't want me to be just another midfielder but ' the ' playmaker , " frings told the daily bild newspaper .
" i 'm thinking a lot about this idea . "
according to tuesday 's edition of turin 's la stampa daily , the issue mainly depends on frings ' wife , who allegedly is not thrilled about a move to the northern italian city .
but german reports also say werder would want considerably more than the roughly 8 million euros -lrb- $ 10.8 million -rrb- juve are said to be offering for frings before agreeing to any move .

torsten frings considers swapping bremen for turin and juventus the bundesliga is looking at a potential exodus of star names in the summer , with a number of players looking outside germany for prospective new employers as the current season draws to a close . germany midfielder torsten frings has met representatives of italian giants juventus to discuss a possible move from werder bremen to the italian giants , he said on tuesday .
frings was in turin monday with his wife , petra , and his adviser , norbert flippen , for talks with juventus sports director alessio secco and club official roberto bettega .
" i liked it there .
but that will not speed up my decision .
i will make up my mind over the next weeks , " he said .
" juve want me at all costs .
they do n't want me to be just another midfielder but ' the ' playmaker , " frings told the daily bild newspaper .
" i 'm thinking a lot about this idea . "
according to tuesday 's edition of turin 's la stampa daily , the issue mainly depends on frings ' wife , who allegedly is not thrilled about a move to the northern italian city .
but german reports also say werder would want considerably more than the roughly 8 million euros -lrb- $ 10.8 million -rrb- juve are said to be offering for frings before agreeing to any move .
secco is said to be preparing a trip to bremen next week for negotiations with werder , the 2004 german league and cup champions .
juve want frings to run midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings ' combative style will fit well in serie a the turin club are keen on signing the germany international this summer as they prepare for a return to serie a for forced demotion for the current season over a match-fixing scheme .
they have already signed a bundesliga player in bosnian midfielder hasan salihamidzic from bayern munich and are reportedly also interested in frings ' bremen teammate miroslav klose , the 2006 world cup top scorer .
although frings , 30 , still has two more years on his contract at bremen , he said at the weekend he was considering the approach from juventus but " wo n't be put under any pressure . "
klose has a deal in bremen until 2008 .
werder coach thomas schaaf said it was " legitimate " for frings to consider the offer , with italian reports saying the player could double his salary at juventus .
" if he has the feeling that he absolutely has to try something new then we will speak to him about the situation , " schaaf said .
" but the fact is that the conditions -lrb- for a move -rrb- have to be in place .
both miro -lrb- klose -rrb- and torsten still have a contract with us . "
werder bremen sporting director klaus allofs said he was surprised by the news .
" we 're not going to put ourselves under pressure .
if torsten no longer wants to play for werder i 'm not going to force him , " said allofs .
" we have in the past always succeeded in finding new talent .
we 're not dependant on one player , werder is more important than any player . "
however , losing both frings and klose would shear werder of two of their most established and world class players .

he is under contract with the german title challengers until next year but had previously told them he would have come to a decision by the beginning of 2007 .
" miro thought he would have decided by now .
he says himself that it 's a difficult decision to take , " said agent alexander schutt .
news that the 28-year-old germany striker is looking to pastures new has put a number of europe 's big clubs on alert with manchester united and barcelona keeping tabs on his situation , while werder 's great rivals bayern munich are said to be considering making an offer which could tempt the polish-born forward to stay in the bundesliga .
after losing out on fiorentina ’ s world cup-winning hit-man , luca toni , bayern would gladly redirect the funds to their northern foes if it meant securing another of europe 's hottest strikers .

german officials on sunday called for reopening the probe of the 1977 murder of a federal prosecutor after a former leftist radical stepped forward to say a man serving time was not involved . the news weekly der spiegel reported in an issue to be published monday that it had evidence which allegedly showed that an ex-member of the red army faction guerrilla group , stefan wisniewski , had shot and killed chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback . the murder , which was never solved , had long been blamed in part on fellow raf radical christian klar , who recently lodged a plea for clemency with president horst köhler after more than 24 years in prison . klar was arrested in 1982 and jailed for his role in multiple murders .
his sentence stipulates that he will not be eligible for parole until 2009 , unless he is pardoned first . buback became the first victim of a bloody era dubbed the " german autumn " of 1977 when he was shot in his mercedes car by a raf gunman on a motorcycle in the southwestern city of karlsruhe . old news for german officials ? der spiegel reported that former raf member verena becker had told german authorities in the early 1980s that wisniewski had slain buback , and it quoted another raf militant , peter-jürgen boock , as now confirming that claim . they said klar had merely driven the get-away car . wisniewski was released in 1999 after 21 years in prison for other raf murders .

in germany murder is not subject to a statute of limitations . unforgivable oversight ? former interior minister gerhard baum of the opposition free democrats led a chorus at the weekend calling for the case to be reopened , adding that if prosecutors ignored exculpatory evidence in the 1980s it would be " an oversight that would be difficult to forgive .

german officials on sunday called for reopening the probe of the 1977 murder of a federal prosecutor after a former leftist radical stepped forward to say a man serving time was not involved . the news weekly der spiegel reported in an issue to be published monday that it had evidence which allegedly showed that an ex-member of the red army faction guerrilla group , stefan wisniewski , had shot and killed chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback . the murder , which was never solved , had long been blamed in part on fellow raf radical christian klar , who recently lodged a plea for clemency with president horst köhler after more than 24 years in prison . klar was arrested in 1982 and jailed for his role in multiple murders .
his sentence stipulates that he will not be eligible for parole until 2009 , unless he is pardoned first . buback became the first victim of a bloody era dubbed the " german autumn " of 1977 when he was shot in his mercedes car by a raf gunman on a motorcycle in the southwestern city of karlsruhe . old news for german officials ? der spiegel reported that former raf member verena becker had told german authorities in the early 1980s that wisniewski had slain buback , and it quoted another raf militant , peter-jürgen boock , as now confirming that claim . they said klar had merely driven the get-away car . wisniewski was released in 1999 after 21 years in prison for other raf murders .

many german companies are getting burned by it .
some are also getting rich , while hardly any are getting caught . over a third of the german companies surveyed , and 43 percent of the total participants , said they had lost a contract in the last five years because rival firms had resorted to offering bribes .
in the previous study , conducted five years ago , only a quarter of german companies had said the same , indicating that corruption is on the rise . consulting firm control risks and law firm simmons & simmons surveyed 350 companies in brazil , europe , hong kong and the united states on their approach to fighting corruption .

and , according to handelsblatt.com , only a handful of german companies employ an ombudsman specially trained in investigating and resolving corruption-related problems . without effective anti-corruption mechanisms in place , improvements are likely to be slow in coming . forty-two percent of the survey respondents thought corruption levels would remain the same over the next five years .

torsten frings considers swapping bremen for turin and juventus the bundesliga is looking at a potential exodus of star names in the summer , with a number of players looking outside germany for prospective new employers as the current season draws to a close . germany midfielder torsten frings has met representatives of italian giants juventus to discuss a possible move from werder bremen to the italian giants , he said on tuesday .
frings was in turin monday with his wife , petra , and his adviser , norbert flippen , for talks with juventus sports director alessio secco and club official roberto bettega .
" i liked it there .
but that will not speed up my decision .
i will make up my mind over the next weeks , " he said .
" juve want me at all costs .
they do n't want me to be just another midfielder but ' the ' playmaker , " frings told the daily bild newspaper .
" i 'm thinking a lot about this idea . "
according to tuesday 's edition of turin 's la stampa daily , the issue mainly depends on frings ' wife , who allegedly is not thrilled about a move to the northern italian city .
but german reports also say werder would want considerably more than the roughly 8 million euros -lrb- $ 10.8 million -rrb- juve are said to be offering for frings before agreeing to any move .
secco is said to be preparing a trip to bremen next week for negotiations with werder , the 2004 german league and cup champions .
juve want frings to run midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings ' combative style will fit well in serie a the turin club are keen on signing the germany international this summer as they prepare for a return to serie a for forced demotion for the current season over a match-fixing scheme .
they have already signed a bundesliga player in bosnian midfielder hasan salihamidzic from bayern munich and are reportedly also interested in frings ' bremen teammate miroslav klose , the 2006 world cup top scorer .
although frings , 30 , still has two more years on his contract at bremen , he said at the weekend he was considering the approach from juventus but " wo n't be put under any pressure . "
klose has a deal in bremen until 2008 .
werder coach thomas schaaf said it was " legitimate " for frings to consider the offer , with italian reports saying the player could double his salary at juventus .
" if he has the feeling that he absolutely has to try something new then we will speak to him about the situation , " schaaf said .
" but the fact is that the conditions -lrb- for a move -rrb- have to be in place .
both miro -lrb- klose -rrb- and torsten still have a contract with us . "
werder bremen sporting director klaus allofs said he was surprised by the news .
" we 're not going to put ourselves under pressure .
if torsten no longer wants to play for werder i 'm not going to force him , " said allofs .
" we have in the past always succeeded in finding new talent .
we 're not dependant on one player , werder is more important than any player . "
however , losing both frings and klose would shear werder of two of their most established and world class players .
hot-shot klose the must-have striker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has a number of top clubs monitoring his situation klose has been making noises of a possible move abroad for the best part of six months with his current deal at bremen coming up for renewal .
he is under contract with the german title challengers until next year but had previously told them he would have come to a decision by the beginning of 2007 .
" miro thought he would have decided by now .
he says himself that it 's a difficult decision to take , " said agent alexander schutt .
news that the 28-year-old germany striker is looking to pastures new has put a number of europe 's big clubs on alert with manchester united and barcelona keeping tabs on his situation , while werder 's great rivals bayern munich are said to be considering making an offer which could tempt the polish-born forward to stay in the bundesliga .
after losing out on fiorentina ’ s world cup-winning hit-man , luca toni , bayern would gladly redirect the funds to their northern foes if it meant securing another of europe 's hottest strikers .
hargreaves ' move to manchester back on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hargreaves could be wearing a different red kit next season the financial outlay for klose would also be eased if bayern allow the exit of another star name - owen hargreaves .
hargreaves has been a manchester united target since last summer and remains on sir alex ferguson 's wish list for the new season .
while the bayern hierarchy were less than willing to sell the england international earlier this season , the elimination form the champions league has seemingly changed their minds .
" if we really get an offer of 25 or 30 million euros for hargreaves i would think about it very seriously , " club president franz beckenbauer told premiere tv in germany after the bavarians crashed out to ac milan last week . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern search for replacements as departures draw near the season is only half-way through and yet a number of bayern munich 's midfielders are looking for new clubs .
it would be okay if money was involved or the players were expendable - but it 's not and they are n't .

fifty of the participants were located in germany . a quarter of the respondents reported that bribes make international projects at least 5 percent more expensive , while a tenth of the bribes are said to amount to up to a half of the value of the business contract . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption in an issue worldwide " the numbers indicate that international measures taken against corruption are not as effective as hoped , " control risks officials wrote in the report . anti-corruption mechanisms go unheeded indeed , more and more international anti-corruption measures have been put in place .
in 2005 , for example , an oecd -lrb- organization for economic cooperation and development -rrb- convention called on its member states to prosecute companies for paying bribes when conducting business abroad . the same year , the united nations drew up an anti-corruption convention expressing a commitment to prosecute both active and passive forms of bribery . germany did n't sign the un document , but introduced an anti-bribery law of its own in 1998 . however , only half of german companies were aware of the existing law and only three cases had been prosecuted since it went into effect nine years ago , the study said . room for improvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw exec peter hartz was convicted of 44 accounts of corruption despite recent high-profile corruption cases at firms , including siemens and volkswagen , german companies seem reluctant to crack down . " those who want to fight corruption effectively have to be prepared for a drop in sales , " corruption expert hans-hermann aldenhoff from simmons & simmons told the web site of german business daily handelsblatt . only a quarter of the companies surveyed said they had a confidential telephone hotline where cases of corruption could be reported .
and , according to handelsblatt.com , only a handful of german companies employ an ombudsman specially trained in investigating and resolving corruption-related problems . without effective anti-corruption mechanisms in place , improvements are likely to be slow in coming . forty-two percent of the survey respondents thought corruption levels would remain the same over the next five years .

torsten frings considers swapping bremen for turin and juventus the bundesliga is looking at a potential exodus of star names in the summer , with a number of players looking outside germany for prospective new employers as the current season draws to a close . germany midfielder torsten frings has met representatives of italian giants juventus to discuss a possible move from werder bremen to the italian giants , he said on tuesday .
frings was in turin monday with his wife , petra , and his adviser , norbert flippen , for talks with juventus sports director alessio secco and club official roberto bettega .
" i liked it there .
but that will not speed up my decision .
i will make up my mind over the next weeks , " he said .
" juve want me at all costs .
they do n't want me to be just another midfielder but ' the ' playmaker , " frings told the daily bild newspaper .
" i 'm thinking a lot about this idea . "
according to tuesday 's edition of turin 's la stampa daily , the issue mainly depends on frings ' wife , who allegedly is not thrilled about a move to the northern italian city .
but german reports also say werder would want considerably more than the roughly 8 million euros -lrb- $ 10.8 million -rrb- juve are said to be offering for frings before agreeing to any move .
secco is said to be preparing a trip to bremen next week for negotiations with werder , the 2004 german league and cup champions .
juve want frings to run midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings ' combative style will fit well in serie a the turin club are keen on signing the germany international this summer as they prepare for a return to serie a for forced demotion for the current season over a match-fixing scheme .
they have already signed a bundesliga player in bosnian midfielder hasan salihamidzic from bayern munich and are reportedly also interested in frings ' bremen teammate miroslav klose , the 2006 world cup top scorer .
although frings , 30 , still has two more years on his contract at bremen , he said at the weekend he was considering the approach from juventus but " wo n't be put under any pressure . "
klose has a deal in bremen until 2008 .
werder coach thomas schaaf said it was " legitimate " for frings to consider the offer , with italian reports saying the player could double his salary at juventus .
" if he has the feeling that he absolutely has to try something new then we will speak to him about the situation , " schaaf said .
" but the fact is that the conditions -lrb- for a move -rrb- have to be in place .
both miro -lrb- klose -rrb- and torsten still have a contract with us . "
werder bremen sporting director klaus allofs said he was surprised by the news .
" we 're not going to put ourselves under pressure .
if torsten no longer wants to play for werder i 'm not going to force him , " said allofs .
" we have in the past always succeeded in finding new talent .
we 're not dependant on one player , werder is more important than any player . "
however , losing both frings and klose would shear werder of two of their most established and world class players .
hot-shot klose the must-have striker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has a number of top clubs monitoring his situation klose has been making noises of a possible move abroad for the best part of six months with his current deal at bremen coming up for renewal .
he is under contract with the german title challengers until next year but had previously told them he would have come to a decision by the beginning of 2007 .
" miro thought he would have decided by now .
he says himself that it 's a difficult decision to take , " said agent alexander schutt .
news that the 28-year-old germany striker is looking to pastures new has put a number of europe 's big clubs on alert with manchester united and barcelona keeping tabs on his situation , while werder 's great rivals bayern munich are said to be considering making an offer which could tempt the polish-born forward to stay in the bundesliga .
after losing out on fiorentina ’ s world cup-winning hit-man , luca toni , bayern would gladly redirect the funds to their northern foes if it meant securing another of europe 's hottest strikers .
hargreaves ' move to manchester back on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hargreaves could be wearing a different red kit next season the financial outlay for klose would also be eased if bayern allow the exit of another star name - owen hargreaves .
hargreaves has been a manchester united target since last summer and remains on sir alex ferguson 's wish list for the new season .
while the bayern hierarchy were less than willing to sell the england international earlier this season , the elimination form the champions league has seemingly changed their minds .
" if we really get an offer of 25 or 30 million euros for hargreaves i would think about it very seriously , " club president franz beckenbauer told premiere tv in germany after the bavarians crashed out to ac milan last week . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern search for replacements as departures draw near the season is only half-way through and yet a number of bayern munich 's midfielders are looking for new clubs .
it would be okay if money was involved or the players were expendable - but it 's not and they are n't .
-lrb- 27.01.2007 -rrb- bundesliga ca n't play beautiful game all season long the aggressive soccer germany played in the month-long world cup was exciting to watch , but ca n't be played effectively throughout an entire bundesliga season , according to coaches in the top german division .

but the polls also say that about a third of the 45 million voters are undecided , with many indicating they would only make up their minds in the hours before heading for the polling station .
that has given hope to centrist francois bayrou and far-right leader jean-marie le pen that they can sneak past socialist segolene royal who has been second behind sarkozy in months of polls leading up to the vote .
no one in the french political establishment has forgotten le pen 's stunning feat in 2002 when he beat the socialist candidate lionel jospin in the first round to reach the runoff .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : france 's next president : sarko vs. sego police , protesters battle after sarkozy win sarkozy favored as french elect new president conservative sarkozy is france 's next president as election nears , french duo fight to a draw in last debate politics -pipe- 22.04.2007 " this election is like a soccer cup tie match " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " forward france " : what works for soccer might just work for politics as well in an interview with dw-tv , franco-german daniel cohn-bendit , a leading politician for the greens in europe , talked about the french presidential election and the consequences for france and europe . born to german-jewish parents in france on april 4 , 1945 , daniel cohn-bendit was a leader of the french student protests of 1968 .
he joined the german greens party in 1984 and has been a member of the european parliament for the german and french greens in an alternating fashion since 1994 .
he is currently the co-president of the group european greens-european free alliance in the european parliament . dw-tv : daniel cohn-bendit , anyone observing the french presidential election campaign in the last few weeks could have been forgiven for thinking the winner will be the per son who can best sing the marseillaise . is patriotism the winner in this election ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit daniel cohn-bendit : well , it 's always like that during a presidential election in france .
the nearer you get to the ballot , the more french identity takes center stage .
but you 're right ; there has been some overstatement of the marseillaise and the french flag .
but that can be important when we 're not just talking about the french flag , but about what color is the hand holding it . does that mean france is moving more to the extreme right ? france is rightwing , that 's the reality .
or we might say it 's conservative , structurally conservative .
we saw that with the referendum on the european constitution .
you have to be aware that whoever wants to be president of france must also embody france , and that 's why it plays a role .
i do think the other issues are also important , though .
but i admit that i find this election is like a soccer cup tie match : somebody has to win and that means the result is what matters , but the game itself is rather boring . that means issues do n't play such an important role ? they change so quickly . no single issue is paramount . not even france 's decline or french fear of globalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters line up to cast their votes no , that would last a few days .
someone would then make one remark or another and it would become the main issue for four days .
but then social issues , the budget or europe would take over - it would take only a few days .
basically it 's really an election about personalities .
is sarkozy believable ?
is segolene royal as a woman capable ?
is bayrou able to create a majority ? they 're the central questions . according to the opinion polls we are looking at a three-way battle between segolene royal , francois bayrou and sarkozy .
or do you think that jean-marie le pen has a chance ? there are problems interpreting le pen 's ratings .
in the last election le pen got 17 percent of the vote .
a few days before that he had just 6 .
9 percent of voters who were prepared to say they would vote for him .
that 's the problem with the polls .
sarkozy 's strategy is to position himself so far to the right as possible so that le pen loses support . will he succeed ? until two weeks ago i would have said : yes .
but now when you look at the trend sarkozy is looking shaky and le pen once again has 15 or 16 percent .
if le pen does very well , then that would be a serious problem for sarkozy , because the biggest competition for votes is between sarkozy and le pen .
it would be a big surprise if sarkozy was not in the second round .
i do n't think it 's going to happen , though . so patriotism is playing such an important role that le pen could suddenly do very well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parisians wait to vote the problem is that sarkozy is polarizing the electorate to the right with very strange arguments .
he says that if a young person commits suicide , then genetic reasons are to blame .
paedophilia and homosexuality are also genetic .
sarkozy has made a big mistake there and even the church has distanced itself from him .
sarkozy is presenting very right-wing arguments .
he wants to create a ministry of immigration and national identity .
his arguments about culture are similar to those that were made in germany a few years ago .
this is all about taking votes away from le pen .
but it encourages people to move right because le pen has made it okay to discuss such things .
sarkozy has another very dangerous side : he says people should be proud of france , we 're not the ones who invented the final solution , we 're not the ones who invented genocide .
he 's alluding to anti-german sentiment that exists in certain conservative circles .
that 's very dangerous . if he wins , will he continue in that vein ? that 's the question : what will he do then ? germany and france are both in europe .
there 's a german-french relationship .
if sarkozy tries to play with that he 'll have problems later with people in the middle ground because they do n't want that .
the past history between the two countries is exactly that : it 's in the past .
there 's a new relationship with germany .
i think it 's very dangerous to throw that relationship back to 1945 .
it 's not only playing with french society and with europe 's future , it 's also endangering sarkozy 's acceptance by the french people . can segolene royal fill that gap ? well , i think that 's exactly the situation right now .
royal stands for renewal in the socialist party . she also instituted a change in generation . she embodies the new generation .
but she 's a woman and during the campaign people suddenly realized that when a woman makes a mistake it 's doubly worse .
there have been several examples during the campaign and people have questioned segolene royal 's ability to be president . has there suddenly been a sympathy-effect for royal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one thing 's for certain : chirac wo n't be france 's next president there has been , but in my opinion it was not enough .
i think that in the second round royal has the chance to achieve a bigger wave of support .
but only for a single reason as it is with most elections : which aversion is stronger ?
the anti-sarkozy or the anti-royal ? the election would be a choice between being anti-sarkozy and anti-royal .
it would be a battle between two camps .
one camp would be everybody who does n't want sarkozy and the other everybody who does n't want royal .
that will be crucial . what can europe expect from a president royal or president sarkozy ? if he 's elected , sarkozy will quite quickly take small steps in institutional reform , basically implementing the treaty of nice accept with some improvements .
i think segolene royal would be forced to bring content and institution together , meaning she would have to put more emphasis on social issues within europe .
as regards bayrou : it would lead to a center-left coalition , if royal wins .
bayrou is the most pro-european judging by his arguments and that 's why i think a center-left government would play a positive role in the constitutional process . alexander kudascheff interviewed daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sunshine and suspense bring france out to vote bright sunshine and high suspense saw voters across france pouring into polling booths sunday to take part in a nail-biting presidential election that kept the country guessing to the last .

he joined the german greens party in 1984 and has been a member of the european parliament for the german and french greens in an alternating fashion since 1994 .
he is currently the co-president of the group european greens-european free alliance in the european parliament . dw-tv : daniel cohn-bendit , anyone observing the french presidential election campaign in the last few weeks could have been forgiven for thinking the winner will be the per son who can best sing the marseillaise . is patriotism the winner in this election ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit daniel cohn-bendit : well , it 's always like that during a presidential election in france .
the nearer you get to the ballot , the more french identity takes center stage .
but you 're right ; there has been some overstatement of the marseillaise and the french flag .
but that can be important when we 're not just talking about the french flag , but about what color is the hand holding it . does that mean france is moving more to the extreme right ? france is rightwing , that 's the reality .
or we might say it 's conservative , structurally conservative .
we saw that with the referendum on the european constitution .
you have to be aware that whoever wants to be president of france must also embody france , and that 's why it plays a role .
i do think the other issues are also important , though .
but i admit that i find this election is like a soccer cup tie match : somebody has to win and that means the result is what matters , but the game itself is rather boring . that means issues do n't play such an important role ? they change so quickly . no single issue is paramount . not even france 's decline or french fear of globalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters line up to cast their votes no , that would last a few days .
someone would then make one remark or another and it would become the main issue for four days .
but then social issues , the budget or europe would take over - it would take only a few days .
basically it 's really an election about personalities .
is sarkozy believable ?
is segolene royal as a woman capable ?
is bayrou able to create a majority ? they 're the central questions . according to the opinion polls we are looking at a three-way battle between segolene royal , francois bayrou and sarkozy .
or do you think that jean-marie le pen has a chance ? there are problems interpreting le pen 's ratings .
in the last election le pen got 17 percent of the vote .
a few days before that he had just 6 .
9 percent of voters who were prepared to say they would vote for him .
that 's the problem with the polls .
sarkozy 's strategy is to position himself so far to the right as possible so that le pen loses support . will he succeed ? until two weeks ago i would have said : yes .
but now when you look at the trend sarkozy is looking shaky and le pen once again has 15 or 16 percent .
if le pen does very well , then that would be a serious problem for sarkozy , because the biggest competition for votes is between sarkozy and le pen .
it would be a big surprise if sarkozy was not in the second round .
i do n't think it 's going to happen , though . so patriotism is playing such an important role that le pen could suddenly do very well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parisians wait to vote the problem is that sarkozy is polarizing the electorate to the right with very strange arguments .
he says that if a young person commits suicide , then genetic reasons are to blame .
paedophilia and homosexuality are also genetic .
sarkozy has made a big mistake there and even the church has distanced itself from him .
sarkozy is presenting very right-wing arguments .
he wants to create a ministry of immigration and national identity .
his arguments about culture are similar to those that were made in germany a few years ago .
this is all about taking votes away from le pen .
but it encourages people to move right because le pen has made it okay to discuss such things .
sarkozy has another very dangerous side : he says people should be proud of france , we 're not the ones who invented the final solution , we 're not the ones who invented genocide .
he 's alluding to anti-german sentiment that exists in certain conservative circles .
that 's very dangerous . if he wins , will he continue in that vein ? that 's the question : what will he do then ? germany and france are both in europe .
there 's a german-french relationship .
if sarkozy tries to play with that he 'll have problems later with people in the middle ground because they do n't want that .
the past history between the two countries is exactly that : it 's in the past .
there 's a new relationship with germany .
i think it 's very dangerous to throw that relationship back to 1945 .
it 's not only playing with french society and with europe 's future , it 's also endangering sarkozy 's acceptance by the french people . can segolene royal fill that gap ? well , i think that 's exactly the situation right now .
royal stands for renewal in the socialist party . she also instituted a change in generation . she embodies the new generation .
but she 's a woman and during the campaign people suddenly realized that when a woman makes a mistake it 's doubly worse .
there have been several examples during the campaign and people have questioned segolene royal 's ability to be president . has there suddenly been a sympathy-effect for royal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one thing 's for certain : chirac wo n't be france 's next president there has been , but in my opinion it was not enough .
i think that in the second round royal has the chance to achieve a bigger wave of support .
but only for a single reason as it is with most elections : which aversion is stronger ?
the anti-sarkozy or the anti-royal ? the election would be a choice between being anti-sarkozy and anti-royal .
it would be a battle between two camps .
one camp would be everybody who does n't want sarkozy and the other everybody who does n't want royal .
that will be crucial . what can europe expect from a president royal or president sarkozy ? if he 's elected , sarkozy will quite quickly take small steps in institutional reform , basically implementing the treaty of nice accept with some improvements .
i think segolene royal would be forced to bring content and institution together , meaning she would have to put more emphasis on social issues within europe .
as regards bayrou : it would lead to a center-left coalition , if royal wins .
bayrou is the most pro-european judging by his arguments and that 's why i think a center-left government would play a positive role in the constitutional process . alexander kudascheff interviewed daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sunshine and suspense bring france out to vote bright sunshine and high suspense saw voters across france pouring into polling booths sunday to take part in a nail-biting presidential election that kept the country guessing to the last .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : france 's next president : sarko vs. sego police , protesters battle after sarkozy win sarkozy favored as french elect new president conservative sarkozy is france 's next president as election nears , french duo fight to a draw in last debate politics -pipe- 22.04.2007 " this election is like a soccer cup tie match " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " forward france " : what works for soccer might just work for politics as well in an interview with dw-tv , franco-german daniel cohn-bendit , a leading politician for the greens in europe , talked about the french presidential election and the consequences for france and europe . born to german-jewish parents in france on april 4 , 1945 , daniel cohn-bendit was a leader of the french student protests of 1968 .
he joined the german greens party in 1984 and has been a member of the european parliament for the german and french greens in an alternating fashion since 1994 .
he is currently the co-president of the group european greens-european free alliance in the european parliament . dw-tv : daniel cohn-bendit , anyone observing the french presidential election campaign in the last few weeks could have been forgiven for thinking the winner will be the per son who can best sing the marseillaise . is patriotism the winner in this election ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit daniel cohn-bendit : well , it 's always like that during a presidential election in france .
the nearer you get to the ballot , the more french identity takes center stage .
but you 're right ; there has been some overstatement of the marseillaise and the french flag .
but that can be important when we 're not just talking about the french flag , but about what color is the hand holding it . does that mean france is moving more to the extreme right ? france is rightwing , that 's the reality .
or we might say it 's conservative , structurally conservative .
we saw that with the referendum on the european constitution .
you have to be aware that whoever wants to be president of france must also embody france , and that 's why it plays a role .
i do think the other issues are also important , though .
but i admit that i find this election is like a soccer cup tie match : somebody has to win and that means the result is what matters , but the game itself is rather boring . that means issues do n't play such an important role ? they change so quickly . no single issue is paramount . not even france 's decline or french fear of globalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters line up to cast their votes no , that would last a few days .
someone would then make one remark or another and it would become the main issue for four days .
but then social issues , the budget or europe would take over - it would take only a few days .
basically it 's really an election about personalities .
is sarkozy believable ?
is segolene royal as a woman capable ?
is bayrou able to create a majority ? they 're the central questions . according to the opinion polls we are looking at a three-way battle between segolene royal , francois bayrou and sarkozy .
or do you think that jean-marie le pen has a chance ? there are problems interpreting le pen 's ratings .
in the last election le pen got 17 percent of the vote .
a few days before that he had just 6 .
9 percent of voters who were prepared to say they would vote for him .
that 's the problem with the polls .
sarkozy 's strategy is to position himself so far to the right as possible so that le pen loses support . will he succeed ? until two weeks ago i would have said : yes .
but now when you look at the trend sarkozy is looking shaky and le pen once again has 15 or 16 percent .
if le pen does very well , then that would be a serious problem for sarkozy , because the biggest competition for votes is between sarkozy and le pen .
it would be a big surprise if sarkozy was not in the second round .
i do n't think it 's going to happen , though . so patriotism is playing such an important role that le pen could suddenly do very well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parisians wait to vote the problem is that sarkozy is polarizing the electorate to the right with very strange arguments .
he says that if a young person commits suicide , then genetic reasons are to blame .
paedophilia and homosexuality are also genetic .
sarkozy has made a big mistake there and even the church has distanced itself from him .
sarkozy is presenting very right-wing arguments .
he wants to create a ministry of immigration and national identity .
his arguments about culture are similar to those that were made in germany a few years ago .
this is all about taking votes away from le pen .
but it encourages people to move right because le pen has made it okay to discuss such things .
sarkozy has another very dangerous side : he says people should be proud of france , we 're not the ones who invented the final solution , we 're not the ones who invented genocide .
he 's alluding to anti-german sentiment that exists in certain conservative circles .
that 's very dangerous . if he wins , will he continue in that vein ? that 's the question : what will he do then ? germany and france are both in europe .
there 's a german-french relationship .
if sarkozy tries to play with that he 'll have problems later with people in the middle ground because they do n't want that .
the past history between the two countries is exactly that : it 's in the past .
there 's a new relationship with germany .
i think it 's very dangerous to throw that relationship back to 1945 .
it 's not only playing with french society and with europe 's future , it 's also endangering sarkozy 's acceptance by the french people . can segolene royal fill that gap ? well , i think that 's exactly the situation right now .
royal stands for renewal in the socialist party . she also instituted a change in generation . she embodies the new generation .
but she 's a woman and during the campaign people suddenly realized that when a woman makes a mistake it 's doubly worse .
there have been several examples during the campaign and people have questioned segolene royal 's ability to be president . has there suddenly been a sympathy-effect for royal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one thing 's for certain : chirac wo n't be france 's next president there has been , but in my opinion it was not enough .
i think that in the second round royal has the chance to achieve a bigger wave of support .
but only for a single reason as it is with most elections : which aversion is stronger ?
the anti-sarkozy or the anti-royal ? the election would be a choice between being anti-sarkozy and anti-royal .
it would be a battle between two camps .
one camp would be everybody who does n't want sarkozy and the other everybody who does n't want royal .
that will be crucial . what can europe expect from a president royal or president sarkozy ? if he 's elected , sarkozy will quite quickly take small steps in institutional reform , basically implementing the treaty of nice accept with some improvements .
i think segolene royal would be forced to bring content and institution together , meaning she would have to put more emphasis on social issues within europe .
as regards bayrou : it would lead to a center-left coalition , if royal wins .
bayrou is the most pro-european judging by his arguments and that 's why i think a center-left government would play a positive role in the constitutional process . alexander kudascheff interviewed daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sunshine and suspense bring france out to vote bright sunshine and high suspense saw voters across france pouring into polling booths sunday to take part in a nail-biting presidential election that kept the country guessing to the last .

they will now square off on may 6 as french voters elect the next head of state for the coming five years . centrist francois bayrou came in third , with about 18 percent , with right-wing extremist jean-marie le pen finishing a distant fourth , at around 11 percent . sarkozy 's new dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy supporters cheered on sunday sarkozy told cheering supporters of his center-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- that he wanted to rally the french people behind a " new dream . " france must now choose between two visions of society in the second round , sarkozy said . " by placing me in the lead and madame royal in second position , -lrb- voters -rrb- clearly marked their wish to have a definitive debate on two ideas of the nation , two projects of society , two value systems , " he said . advantage : sarkozy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy does n't have too worry too much , analysts say analyst said that sarkozy was now a clear favorite to be france 's next president . according to a telephone poll conducted after sarkozy and royal were declared winners , sarkozy would get 54 percent while royal would only get 46 percent of the vote on may 6 . " it 's clear there is a big advantage for sarkozy , " jean-philippe roy , a politics professor at tours university , told afp news service .
" the whole left-right balance in the country has shifted .
it is really a historic moment . " simple arithmetic works in sarkozy 's favor , others said . " what we have set up for round two is a clear right-left showdown , but it is a showdown which i find hard to see how the left can win , " said dominique moisi of the french institute for international affairs , according to afp .
" the left are clearly a minority in the country .
if you add right , far-right and half the center , sarkozy is in an extremely comfortable position .
his decision to court the far-right vote has clearly paid off . " although sarkozy has the lead , analysts agreed that the race is not yet won .
this is because of the deep mistrust with which the former interior minister is regarded by many voters - even by some who support his ideas . " we have today a political situation i have never seen : a man who is highly likely to be the next president but who provokes unprecedented levels of hatred and rejection , " said dominique reynie , professor at the paris school of political sciences . " this is the moment for sarkozy to start talking to the french people - not just to his own camp , " he added .
" he 's got to look like a president , which in france means someone who has the nation behind him .
from now on it 's not his policies , but his personality that 's the issue . " royal reaches out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal hopes to become france 's first female president speaking to her socialist party supporters in the small town of melle in western france , royal called for voters to rally round her for the presidential runoff , promising to bring france change without upheaval . " i call on all those who ... believe it is possible to reform france without brutalizing it , who want a triumph of human values over the stock market , who want an end to the painful rise of insecurity and precariousness , to come together , " she said .
" i reach out to all those who believe it is not only possible but urgent to break with a system that is no longer working " after a disastrous start to her campaign , royal 's result was impressive , as she is credited with about nine percent more of the vote than the socialist candidate in 2002 , lionel jospin , received . many voters certainly remembered the first round of the 2002 presidential election , when le pen caused a political earthquake by outpolling jospin to make it to the run-off . in 2002 , left-wing candidates other than jospin garnered an impressive 26.71 per cent of the vote , while the socialist received only 16.18 per cent . this year , three trotskyist candidates , the green party standard-bearer and anti-globalization activist jose bove picked up only about 11 percent of the vote .
record turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters came out in record numbers the memory of 2002 no doubt also contributed to a voter participation rate that was near an all-time high for a first-round election in postwar france , with an estimated 84.5 percent of the country 's 44.5 million registered voters casting their ballots on sunday . the previous record was 84.75 percent , set in 1965 . five years ago , only 71.6 percent of registered voters went to the polls in the first round . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " this election is like a soccer cup tie match " in an interview with dw-tv , franco-german daniel cohn-bendit , a leading politician for the greens in europe , talked about the french presidential election and the consequences for france and europe .

but the polls also say that about a third of the 45 million voters are undecided , with many indicating they would only make up their minds in the hours before heading for the polling station .
that has given hope to centrist francois bayrou and far-right leader jean-marie le pen that they can sneak past socialist segolene royal who has been second behind sarkozy in months of polls leading up to the vote .
no one in the french political establishment has forgotten le pen 's stunning feat in 2002 when he beat the socialist candidate lionel jospin in the first round to reach the runoff .
confusion reins analysts say the months of campaigning by sarkozy , royal , bayrou , le pen and their rival trotskyist , ecologist and nationalist candidates has left the public more confused than decisive .
there is also a greater awareness of tactical voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question is who will join sarkozy for the second round there has been much talk of some left wingers voting for bayrou instead of royal in a bid to have a better chance of stopping sarkozy in the second round .
could a protest vote for ecologist dominique voynet in the first round help le pen reach the runoff again , some wonder .
jerome perani , a 37-year-old marketing executive for a paris technology firm who voted socialist in 2002 , said he was considering voting bayrou this time as a " purely tactical choice - almost like game theory . "
the authoritative le monde newspaper summed up the dilemma facing the french : " many voters are not wondering who they should vote for sunday , but how : with their heart or their head ? "
one recent survey said that only 43 percent of voters considered that the campaign had helped them .
fifty-nine percent said they thought the campaign had been of poor standard .
many polls have indicated that the public has been turned off by the reliance on personal attacks rather than political debate by the rival candidates .
country in crisis all the candidates say france is a country in crisis , social and economic , but no one platform has grabbed the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen has been good for surprises in the past " no candidate has managed to impress with durable themes , " said roland cayrol of the polling organization bva .
cayrol highlighted how the socialist francois mitterrand won an emphatic victory in 1981 because of widespread fears about employment .
in 2002 , insecurity was a key topic after a series of murders and other crimes .
cayrol said that french voters had wanted a debate before the first round to help them make up their minds .
now they are frustrated because it did not happen , though the political fireworks could still come in the next two weeks between the finalists in the presidential battle . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france 's next president : sarko vs. sego dw-world.de reviews the candidates and issues that drove the french presidential campaign ahead of sunday 's vote .

the club will be modeled on highly exclusive establishments found in london 's soho and new york 's manhattan districts , where entrance is restricted to club members and specially invited guests only , and membership costs around 900 euros -lrb- $ 1,224 -rrb- annually .
the publicity-shy british investor has commissioned the jsk architectural bureau in berlin to carry out renovations on the downtrodden berlin building , which remains a listed property and is located near the former communist palace of the republic , which is now being demolished .
department store turned party hq the building 's history in prenzlauer berg dates back to 1928-29 when jewish business partners hermann golluber and hugo halle invested their life savings in a department store in lothringerstrasse , now renamed torstrasse , where customers could purchase goods on credit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis forced all jews out of business but its history was chequered from the start .
within a few years , its two owners were to be robbed of their premises by the nazis , and forced to flee the country .
golluber found refuge in america .
" aryanized , " by the new " german " owners , the building was later sold to the regime , which turned it into a nazi party youth headquarters from 1942 .
the german youth leadership , or reichsjugendfuerhrung , supervised leisure activities of 9 million members of the hitler youth from there .
then , in the early postwar years , the building became the " haus der einheit , " or house of unity , and served as the seat of the east german communist party from 1946-56 .
two powerful communist party leaders , wilhelm pieck and otto grotowohl worked there .
the street also renamed wilhem pieck strasse .
later , the building housed the east german communist party archives , and the central committee 's historical institute .
but that chapter ended in late 1989 when the berlin wall fell , and the east german communist party itself was confined to history 's rubbish bin a few months later .
years of neglect for the past 12 years the building , within sight of the city 's soaring tv tower on alexanderplatz , has lain empty and was steadily decaying ; its interior walls peeling , parquet floor rotting and electrical installations destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around alexanderplatz has undergone huge changes since the wall went down after the city 's reunification , it was legally returned to the jewish family descendants of the original owners , scattered across the world , who finally managed to sell the property to a british investor .
earlier in the week , rainer eppelmann , a former fierce opponent of the east german communist regime , together with andre schmitz , a berlin government -lrb- culture -rrb- state secretary , unveiled a stele outside the " haus der einheit . "
texts written in four languages and exhibited behind a sealed glass panel explain the building 's turbulent , near 80-year-old history .
" remembrance needs location , but remembrance also needs knowledge and recognition , " said eppelmann , when noting that there were today few survivors remaining to tell of the building 's convulsive past .
" if houses could relate history , this one would have enough for a complete novel , " smitz said .
converting the property into the soho house media club is expected to take 16 months , and it is expected to open sometime in 2008 .

the club will be modeled on highly exclusive establishments found in london 's soho and new york 's manhattan districts , where entrance is restricted to club members and specially invited guests only , and membership costs around 900 euros -lrb- $ 1,224 -rrb- annually .
the publicity-shy british investor has commissioned the jsk architectural bureau in berlin to carry out renovations on the downtrodden berlin building , which remains a listed property and is located near the former communist palace of the republic , which is now being demolished .
department store turned party hq the building 's history in prenzlauer berg dates back to 1928-29 when jewish business partners hermann golluber and hugo halle invested their life savings in a department store in lothringerstrasse , now renamed torstrasse , where customers could purchase goods on credit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis forced all jews out of business but its history was chequered from the start .
within a few years , its two owners were to be robbed of their premises by the nazis , and forced to flee the country .
golluber found refuge in america .
" aryanized , " by the new " german " owners , the building was later sold to the regime , which turned it into a nazi party youth headquarters from 1942 .
the german youth leadership , or reichsjugendfuerhrung , supervised leisure activities of 9 million members of the hitler youth from there .
then , in the early postwar years , the building became the " haus der einheit , " or house of unity , and served as the seat of the east german communist party from 1946-56 .
two powerful communist party leaders , wilhelm pieck and otto grotowohl worked there .
the street also renamed wilhem pieck strasse .
later , the building housed the east german communist party archives , and the central committee 's historical institute .
but that chapter ended in late 1989 when the berlin wall fell , and the east german communist party itself was confined to history 's rubbish bin a few months later .
years of neglect for the past 12 years the building , within sight of the city 's soaring tv tower on alexanderplatz , has lain empty and was steadily decaying ; its interior walls peeling , parquet floor rotting and electrical installations destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around alexanderplatz has undergone huge changes since the wall went down after the city 's reunification , it was legally returned to the jewish family descendants of the original owners , scattered across the world , who finally managed to sell the property to a british investor .
earlier in the week , rainer eppelmann , a former fierce opponent of the east german communist regime , together with andre schmitz , a berlin government -lrb- culture -rrb- state secretary , unveiled a stele outside the " haus der einheit . "
texts written in four languages and exhibited behind a sealed glass panel explain the building 's turbulent , near 80-year-old history .
" remembrance needs location , but remembrance also needs knowledge and recognition , " said eppelmann , when noting that there were today few survivors remaining to tell of the building 's convulsive past .
" if houses could relate history , this one would have enough for a complete novel , " smitz said .

the club will be modeled on highly exclusive establishments found in london 's soho and new york 's manhattan districts , where entrance is restricted to club members and specially invited guests only , and membership costs around 900 euros -lrb- $ 1,224 -rrb- annually .
the publicity-shy british investor has commissioned the jsk architectural bureau in berlin to carry out renovations on the downtrodden berlin building , which remains a listed property and is located near the former communist palace of the republic , which is now being demolished .
department store turned party hq the building 's history in prenzlauer berg dates back to 1928-29 when jewish business partners hermann golluber and hugo halle invested their life savings in a department store in lothringerstrasse , now renamed torstrasse , where customers could purchase goods on credit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis forced all jews out of business but its history was chequered from the start .
within a few years , its two owners were to be robbed of their premises by the nazis , and forced to flee the country .
golluber found refuge in america .
" aryanized , " by the new " german " owners , the building was later sold to the regime , which turned it into a nazi party youth headquarters from 1942 .
the german youth leadership , or reichsjugendfuerhrung , supervised leisure activities of 9 million members of the hitler youth from there .
then , in the early postwar years , the building became the " haus der einheit , " or house of unity , and served as the seat of the east german communist party from 1946-56 .
two powerful communist party leaders , wilhelm pieck and otto grotowohl worked there .
the street also renamed wilhem pieck strasse .
later , the building housed the east german communist party archives , and the central committee 's historical institute .
but that chapter ended in late 1989 when the berlin wall fell , and the east german communist party itself was confined to history 's rubbish bin a few months later .
years of neglect for the past 12 years the building , within sight of the city 's soaring tv tower on alexanderplatz , has lain empty and was steadily decaying ; its interior walls peeling , parquet floor rotting and electrical installations destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around alexanderplatz has undergone huge changes since the wall went down after the city 's reunification , it was legally returned to the jewish family descendants of the original owners , scattered across the world , who finally managed to sell the property to a british investor .
earlier in the week , rainer eppelmann , a former fierce opponent of the east german communist regime , together with andre schmitz , a berlin government -lrb- culture -rrb- state secretary , unveiled a stele outside the " haus der einheit . "
texts written in four languages and exhibited behind a sealed glass panel explain the building 's turbulent , near 80-year-old history .
" remembrance needs location , but remembrance also needs knowledge and recognition , " said eppelmann , when noting that there were today few survivors remaining to tell of the building 's convulsive past .
" if houses could relate history , this one would have enough for a complete novel , " smitz said .
converting the property into the soho house media club is expected to take 16 months , and it is expected to open sometime in 2008 .
guenter p.j. buerk , one of jsk 's partners in berlin , says the british investor 's " club-hotel " project aims to create an exclusive meeting place for artists and top media representatives from around the world . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lured by property bargains , foreign investors flock to berlin drawn by some of the lowest property prices in europe and signs of an economic revival in germany , foreign investors are rushing to berlin to get a piece of the hot real estate market .

they will now square off on may 6 as french voters elect the next head of state for the coming five years . centrist francois bayrou came in third , with about 18 percent , with right-wing extremist jean-marie le pen finishing a distant fourth , at around 11 percent . sarkozy 's new dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy supporters cheered on sunday sarkozy told cheering supporters of his center-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- that he wanted to rally the french people behind a " new dream .

" it 's clear there is a big advantage for sarkozy , " jean-philippe roy , a politics professor at tours university , told afp news service .
" the whole left-right balance in the country has shifted .
it is really a historic moment . " simple arithmetic works in sarkozy 's favor , others said . " what we have set up for round two is a clear right-left showdown , but it is a showdown which i find hard to see how the left can win , " said dominique moisi of the french institute for international affairs , according to afp .
" the left are clearly a minority in the country .
if you add right , far-right and half the center , sarkozy is in an extremely comfortable position .
his decision to court the far-right vote has clearly paid off . " although sarkozy has the lead , analysts agreed that the race is not yet won .
this is because of the deep mistrust with which the former interior minister is regarded by many voters - even by some who support his ideas . " we have today a political situation i have never seen : a man who is highly likely to be the next president but who provokes unprecedented levels of hatred and rejection , " said dominique reynie , professor at the paris school of political sciences . " this is the moment for sarkozy to start talking to the french people - not just to his own camp , " he added .

" i call on all those who ... believe it is possible to reform france without brutalizing it , who want a triumph of human values over the stock market , who want an end to the painful rise of insecurity and precariousness , to come together , " she said .
" i reach out to all those who believe it is not only possible but urgent to break with a system that is no longer working " after a disastrous start to her campaign , royal 's result was impressive , as she is credited with about nine percent more of the vote than the socialist candidate in 2002 , lionel jospin , received . many voters certainly remembered the first round of the 2002 presidential election , when le pen caused a political earthquake by outpolling jospin to make it to the run-off . in 2002 , left-wing candidates other than jospin garnered an impressive 26.71 per cent of the vote , while the socialist received only 16.18 per cent . this year , three trotskyist candidates , the green party standard-bearer and anti-globalization activist jose bove picked up only about 11 percent of the vote .

at the saint-charles primary school in marseille , long queues formed from early morning for the curtained-off ballot booths in a room festooned with children 's drawings .
some voters in the southern port city had to cool their heels for more than an hour after the locks on the doors of several polling stations were found to have been blocked with glue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen cast his ballot in saint-cloud , outside paris many younger voters in their 20s said they were partially motivated by the need to prevent a repetition of the 2002 election , when a low turnout helped far-right leader jean-marie le pen eliminate the socialist candidate in the first round and secure a stunning run-off spot against president jacques chirac .
galvanized by concerns " i did n't vote in 2002 out of indifference , but then there was that terrible shock , " said kaoutcher ben amor , a 30-year-old medical assistant .
" i decided to register and come out today so as to avoid a similar situation where we would be left with virtually no choice in the second round . "
other voters also acknowledged being galvanized by the result in 2002 , like nurse brigitte cuvelliez , 49 , who cast her ballot in the central city of lyon for the first time since 1988 .
cuvelliez was one of the estimated one-third of french voters who , despite months of frenzied campaigning , only decided who to back at the last moment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative candidate sarkozy voted in neuilly sur seine " i did n't know who i was going to vote for , but i knew who i was n't going to vote for , " she said .
" i made my decision in the last couple of days by comparing the candidates ' policies , point by point . "
having reached her decision , however , she remained skeptical what her vote might achieve .
" once elected , politicians do just what they want , " she said .
in the northern city of lille , in the red-brick pasteur primary school , nicolas fouilleron , a 28-year-old medical intern , swung between a similar mood of " hope for change " and fatalism .
" as with every election , when it 's over , nothing happens , " he said .
looking for change in the regions around paris , voters waited patiently for their chance to participate in what many believed to be the most important presidential election for decades .
" i 'm looking for major social reform , especially given the gap between rich and poor which is worsening all the time , " said musician xavier cocollos , 40 , in suresnes , a suburb west of the french capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist candidate royal cast her vote in melle , western france businessman bruno labarre , 44 , was also looking for change .
" i 'm hoping that we can build a new model , a new society on the back of serious reforms , " labarre said .
" the system we have now is going nowhere . "
for the first time in a presidential election , some of the 44.5 million registered french voters cast their ballots on electronic voting machines - an innovation that appeared to meet with general approval .
" i was a bit apprehensive at first , " said yvette lalanne , 70 , in the southwestern city of toulouse .
" but , in fact it 's pretty simple and quick and , i hope , reliable .

torsten frings considers swapping bremen for turin and juventus the bundesliga is looking at a potential exodus of star names in the summer , with a number of players looking outside germany for prospective new employers as the current season draws to a close . germany midfielder torsten frings has met representatives of italian giants juventus to discuss a possible move from werder bremen to the italian giants , he said on tuesday .
frings was in turin monday with his wife , petra , and his adviser , norbert flippen , for talks with juventus sports director alessio secco and club official roberto bettega .
" i liked it there .
but that will not speed up my decision .
i will make up my mind over the next weeks , " he said .
" juve want me at all costs .
they do n't want me to be just another midfielder but ' the ' playmaker , " frings told the daily bild newspaper .
" i 'm thinking a lot about this idea . "
according to tuesday 's edition of turin 's la stampa daily , the issue mainly depends on frings ' wife , who allegedly is not thrilled about a move to the northern italian city .
but german reports also say werder would want considerably more than the roughly 8 million euros -lrb- $ 10.8 million -rrb- juve are said to be offering for frings before agreeing to any move .
secco is said to be preparing a trip to bremen next week for negotiations with werder , the 2004 german league and cup champions .

they have already signed a bundesliga player in bosnian midfielder hasan salihamidzic from bayern munich and are reportedly also interested in frings ' bremen teammate miroslav klose , the 2006 world cup top scorer .
although frings , 30 , still has two more years on his contract at bremen , he said at the weekend he was considering the approach from juventus but " wo n't be put under any pressure . "
klose has a deal in bremen until 2008 .
werder coach thomas schaaf said it was " legitimate " for frings to consider the offer , with italian reports saying the player could double his salary at juventus .
" if he has the feeling that he absolutely has to try something new then we will speak to him about the situation , " schaaf said .
" but the fact is that the conditions -lrb- for a move -rrb- have to be in place .
both miro -lrb- klose -rrb- and torsten still have a contract with us . "
werder bremen sporting director klaus allofs said he was surprised by the news .
" we 're not going to put ourselves under pressure .
if torsten no longer wants to play for werder i 'm not going to force him , " said allofs .
" we have in the past always succeeded in finding new talent .
we 're not dependant on one player , werder is more important than any player . "
however , losing both frings and klose would shear werder of two of their most established and world class players .

he is under contract with the german title challengers until next year but had previously told them he would have come to a decision by the beginning of 2007 .
" miro thought he would have decided by now .
he says himself that it 's a difficult decision to take , " said agent alexander schutt .
news that the 28-year-old germany striker is looking to pastures new has put a number of europe 's big clubs on alert with manchester united and barcelona keeping tabs on his situation , while werder 's great rivals bayern munich are said to be considering making an offer which could tempt the polish-born forward to stay in the bundesliga .
after losing out on fiorentina ’ s world cup-winning hit-man , luca toni , bayern would gladly redirect the funds to their northern foes if it meant securing another of europe 's hottest strikers .

while the bayern hierarchy were less than willing to sell the england international earlier this season , the elimination form the champions league has seemingly changed their minds .

he joined the german greens party in 1984 and has been a member of the european parliament for the german and french greens in an alternating fashion since 1994 .
he is currently the co-president of the group european greens-european free alliance in the european parliament . dw-tv : daniel cohn-bendit , anyone observing the french presidential election campaign in the last few weeks could have been forgiven for thinking the winner will be the per son who can best sing the marseillaise . is patriotism the winner in this election ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit daniel cohn-bendit : well , it 's always like that during a presidential election in france .
the nearer you get to the ballot , the more french identity takes center stage .
but you 're right ; there has been some overstatement of the marseillaise and the french flag .
but that can be important when we 're not just talking about the french flag , but about what color is the hand holding it . does that mean france is moving more to the extreme right ? france is rightwing , that 's the reality .
or we might say it 's conservative , structurally conservative .
we saw that with the referendum on the european constitution .
you have to be aware that whoever wants to be president of france must also embody france , and that 's why it plays a role .
i do think the other issues are also important , though .
but i admit that i find this election is like a soccer cup tie match : somebody has to win and that means the result is what matters , but the game itself is rather boring . that means issues do n't play such an important role ? they change so quickly . no single issue is paramount . not even france 's decline or french fear of globalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters line up to cast their votes no , that would last a few days .
someone would then make one remark or another and it would become the main issue for four days .
but then social issues , the budget or europe would take over - it would take only a few days .
basically it 's really an election about personalities .
is sarkozy believable ?
is segolene royal as a woman capable ?
is bayrou able to create a majority ? they 're the central questions . according to the opinion polls we are looking at a three-way battle between segolene royal , francois bayrou and sarkozy .
or do you think that jean-marie le pen has a chance ? there are problems interpreting le pen 's ratings .
in the last election le pen got 17 percent of the vote .
a few days before that he had just 6 .
9 percent of voters who were prepared to say they would vote for him .
that 's the problem with the polls .
sarkozy 's strategy is to position himself so far to the right as possible so that le pen loses support . will he succeed ? until two weeks ago i would have said : yes .
but now when you look at the trend sarkozy is looking shaky and le pen once again has 15 or 16 percent .
if le pen does very well , then that would be a serious problem for sarkozy , because the biggest competition for votes is between sarkozy and le pen .
it would be a big surprise if sarkozy was not in the second round .
i do n't think it 's going to happen , though . so patriotism is playing such an important role that le pen could suddenly do very well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parisians wait to vote the problem is that sarkozy is polarizing the electorate to the right with very strange arguments .
he says that if a young person commits suicide , then genetic reasons are to blame .
paedophilia and homosexuality are also genetic .
sarkozy has made a big mistake there and even the church has distanced itself from him .
sarkozy is presenting very right-wing arguments .
he wants to create a ministry of immigration and national identity .
his arguments about culture are similar to those that were made in germany a few years ago .
this is all about taking votes away from le pen .
but it encourages people to move right because le pen has made it okay to discuss such things .
sarkozy has another very dangerous side : he says people should be proud of france , we 're not the ones who invented the final solution , we 're not the ones who invented genocide .
he 's alluding to anti-german sentiment that exists in certain conservative circles .
that 's very dangerous . if he wins , will he continue in that vein ? that 's the question : what will he do then ? germany and france are both in europe .
there 's a german-french relationship .
if sarkozy tries to play with that he 'll have problems later with people in the middle ground because they do n't want that .
the past history between the two countries is exactly that : it 's in the past .
there 's a new relationship with germany .
i think it 's very dangerous to throw that relationship back to 1945 .
it 's not only playing with french society and with europe 's future , it 's also endangering sarkozy 's acceptance by the french people . can segolene royal fill that gap ? well , i think that 's exactly the situation right now .
royal stands for renewal in the socialist party . she also instituted a change in generation . she embodies the new generation .
but she 's a woman and during the campaign people suddenly realized that when a woman makes a mistake it 's doubly worse .
there have been several examples during the campaign and people have questioned segolene royal 's ability to be president . has there suddenly been a sympathy-effect for royal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one thing 's for certain : chirac wo n't be france 's next president there has been , but in my opinion it was not enough .
i think that in the second round royal has the chance to achieve a bigger wave of support .
but only for a single reason as it is with most elections : which aversion is stronger ?
the anti-sarkozy or the anti-royal ? the election would be a choice between being anti-sarkozy and anti-royal .
it would be a battle between two camps .
one camp would be everybody who does n't want sarkozy and the other everybody who does n't want royal .
that will be crucial . what can europe expect from a president royal or president sarkozy ? if he 's elected , sarkozy will quite quickly take small steps in institutional reform , basically implementing the treaty of nice accept with some improvements .
i think segolene royal would be forced to bring content and institution together , meaning she would have to put more emphasis on social issues within europe .
as regards bayrou : it would lead to a center-left coalition , if royal wins .
bayrou is the most pro-european judging by his arguments and that 's why i think a center-left government would play a positive role in the constitutional process . alexander kudascheff interviewed daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sunshine and suspense bring france out to vote bright sunshine and high suspense saw voters across france pouring into polling booths sunday to take part in a nail-biting presidential election that kept the country guessing to the last .

he joined the german greens party in 1984 and has been a member of the european parliament for the german and french greens in an alternating fashion since 1994 .
he is currently the co-president of the group european greens-european free alliance in the european parliament . dw-tv : daniel cohn-bendit , anyone observing the french presidential election campaign in the last few weeks could have been forgiven for thinking the winner will be the per son who can best sing the marseillaise . is patriotism the winner in this election ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit daniel cohn-bendit : well , it 's always like that during a presidential election in france .
the nearer you get to the ballot , the more french identity takes center stage .
but you 're right ; there has been some overstatement of the marseillaise and the french flag .
but that can be important when we 're not just talking about the french flag , but about what color is the hand holding it . does that mean france is moving more to the extreme right ? france is rightwing , that 's the reality .
or we might say it 's conservative , structurally conservative .
we saw that with the referendum on the european constitution .
you have to be aware that whoever wants to be president of france must also embody france , and that 's why it plays a role .
i do think the other issues are also important , though .
but i admit that i find this election is like a soccer cup tie match : somebody has to win and that means the result is what matters , but the game itself is rather boring . that means issues do n't play such an important role ? they change so quickly . no single issue is paramount . not even france 's decline or french fear of globalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters line up to cast their votes no , that would last a few days .
someone would then make one remark or another and it would become the main issue for four days .
but then social issues , the budget or europe would take over - it would take only a few days .
basically it 's really an election about personalities .
is sarkozy believable ?
is segolene royal as a woman capable ?
is bayrou able to create a majority ? they 're the central questions . according to the opinion polls we are looking at a three-way battle between segolene royal , francois bayrou and sarkozy .
or do you think that jean-marie le pen has a chance ? there are problems interpreting le pen 's ratings .
in the last election le pen got 17 percent of the vote .
a few days before that he had just 6 .
9 percent of voters who were prepared to say they would vote for him .
that 's the problem with the polls .
sarkozy 's strategy is to position himself so far to the right as possible so that le pen loses support . will he succeed ? until two weeks ago i would have said : yes .
but now when you look at the trend sarkozy is looking shaky and le pen once again has 15 or 16 percent .

he says that if a young person commits suicide , then genetic reasons are to blame .
paedophilia and homosexuality are also genetic .
sarkozy has made a big mistake there and even the church has distanced itself from him .
sarkozy is presenting very right-wing arguments .
he wants to create a ministry of immigration and national identity .
his arguments about culture are similar to those that were made in germany a few years ago .
this is all about taking votes away from le pen .
but it encourages people to move right because le pen has made it okay to discuss such things .
sarkozy has another very dangerous side : he says people should be proud of france , we 're not the ones who invented the final solution , we 're not the ones who invented genocide .
he 's alluding to anti-german sentiment that exists in certain conservative circles .
that 's very dangerous . if he wins , will he continue in that vein ? that 's the question : what will he do then ? germany and france are both in europe .
there 's a german-french relationship .
if sarkozy tries to play with that he 'll have problems later with people in the middle ground because they do n't want that .
the past history between the two countries is exactly that : it 's in the past .
there 's a new relationship with germany .
i think it 's very dangerous to throw that relationship back to 1945 .
it 's not only playing with french society and with europe 's future , it 's also endangering sarkozy 's acceptance by the french people . can segolene royal fill that gap ? well , i think that 's exactly the situation right now .
royal stands for renewal in the socialist party . she also instituted a change in generation . she embodies the new generation .
but she 's a woman and during the campaign people suddenly realized that when a woman makes a mistake it 's doubly worse .
there have been several examples during the campaign and people have questioned segolene royal 's ability to be president . has there suddenly been a sympathy-effect for royal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one thing 's for certain : chirac wo n't be france 's next president there has been , but in my opinion it was not enough .
i think that in the second round royal has the chance to achieve a bigger wave of support .
but only for a single reason as it is with most elections : which aversion is stronger ?
the anti-sarkozy or the anti-royal ? the election would be a choice between being anti-sarkozy and anti-royal .
it would be a battle between two camps .
one camp would be everybody who does n't want sarkozy and the other everybody who does n't want royal .
that will be crucial . what can europe expect from a president royal or president sarkozy ? if he 's elected , sarkozy will quite quickly take small steps in institutional reform , basically implementing the treaty of nice accept with some improvements .
i think segolene royal would be forced to bring content and institution together , meaning she would have to put more emphasis on social issues within europe .
as regards bayrou : it would lead to a center-left coalition , if royal wins .

he joined the german greens party in 1984 and has been a member of the european parliament for the german and french greens in an alternating fashion since 1994 .
he is currently the co-president of the group european greens-european free alliance in the european parliament . dw-tv : daniel cohn-bendit , anyone observing the french presidential election campaign in the last few weeks could have been forgiven for thinking the winner will be the per son who can best sing the marseillaise . is patriotism the winner in this election ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit daniel cohn-bendit : well , it 's always like that during a presidential election in france .
the nearer you get to the ballot , the more french identity takes center stage .
but you 're right ; there has been some overstatement of the marseillaise and the french flag .
but that can be important when we 're not just talking about the french flag , but about what color is the hand holding it . does that mean france is moving more to the extreme right ? france is rightwing , that 's the reality .
or we might say it 's conservative , structurally conservative .
we saw that with the referendum on the european constitution .
you have to be aware that whoever wants to be president of france must also embody france , and that 's why it plays a role .
i do think the other issues are also important , though .
but i admit that i find this election is like a soccer cup tie match : somebody has to win and that means the result is what matters , but the game itself is rather boring . that means issues do n't play such an important role ? they change so quickly . no single issue is paramount . not even france 's decline or french fear of globalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters line up to cast their votes no , that would last a few days .
someone would then make one remark or another and it would become the main issue for four days .
but then social issues , the budget or europe would take over - it would take only a few days .
basically it 's really an election about personalities .
is sarkozy believable ?
is segolene royal as a woman capable ?
is bayrou able to create a majority ? they 're the central questions . according to the opinion polls we are looking at a three-way battle between segolene royal , francois bayrou and sarkozy .
or do you think that jean-marie le pen has a chance ? there are problems interpreting le pen 's ratings .
in the last election le pen got 17 percent of the vote .
a few days before that he had just 6 .
9 percent of voters who were prepared to say they would vote for him .
that 's the problem with the polls .
sarkozy 's strategy is to position himself so far to the right as possible so that le pen loses support . will he succeed ? until two weeks ago i would have said : yes .
but now when you look at the trend sarkozy is looking shaky and le pen once again has 15 or 16 percent .
if le pen does very well , then that would be a serious problem for sarkozy , because the biggest competition for votes is between sarkozy and le pen .
it would be a big surprise if sarkozy was not in the second round .
i do n't think it 's going to happen , though . so patriotism is playing such an important role that le pen could suddenly do very well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parisians wait to vote the problem is that sarkozy is polarizing the electorate to the right with very strange arguments .

they will now square off on may 6 as french voters elect the next head of state for the coming five years . centrist francois bayrou came in third , with about 18 percent , with right-wing extremist jean-marie le pen finishing a distant fourth , at around 11 percent . sarkozy 's new dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy supporters cheered on sunday sarkozy told cheering supporters of his center-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- that he wanted to rally the french people behind a " new dream . " france must now choose between two visions of society in the second round , sarkozy said . " by placing me in the lead and madame royal in second position , -lrb- voters -rrb- clearly marked their wish to have a definitive debate on two ideas of the nation , two projects of society , two value systems , " he said . advantage : sarkozy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy does n't have too worry too much , analysts say analyst said that sarkozy was now a clear favorite to be france 's next president . according to a telephone poll conducted after sarkozy and royal were declared winners , sarkozy would get 54 percent while royal would only get 46 percent of the vote on may 6 . " it 's clear there is a big advantage for sarkozy , " jean-philippe roy , a politics professor at tours university , told afp news service .
" the whole left-right balance in the country has shifted .
it is really a historic moment . " simple arithmetic works in sarkozy 's favor , others said . " what we have set up for round two is a clear right-left showdown , but it is a showdown which i find hard to see how the left can win , " said dominique moisi of the french institute for international affairs , according to afp .
" the left are clearly a minority in the country .
if you add right , far-right and half the center , sarkozy is in an extremely comfortable position .
his decision to court the far-right vote has clearly paid off . " although sarkozy has the lead , analysts agreed that the race is not yet won .
this is because of the deep mistrust with which the former interior minister is regarded by many voters - even by some who support his ideas . " we have today a political situation i have never seen : a man who is highly likely to be the next president but who provokes unprecedented levels of hatred and rejection , " said dominique reynie , professor at the paris school of political sciences . " this is the moment for sarkozy to start talking to the french people - not just to his own camp , " he added .
" he 's got to look like a president , which in france means someone who has the nation behind him .
from now on it 's not his policies , but his personality that 's the issue . " royal reaches out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal hopes to become france 's first female president speaking to her socialist party supporters in the small town of melle in western france , royal called for voters to rally round her for the presidential runoff , promising to bring france change without upheaval . " i call on all those who ... believe it is possible to reform france without brutalizing it , who want a triumph of human values over the stock market , who want an end to the painful rise of insecurity and precariousness , to come together , " she said .
" i reach out to all those who believe it is not only possible but urgent to break with a system that is no longer working " after a disastrous start to her campaign , royal 's result was impressive , as she is credited with about nine percent more of the vote than the socialist candidate in 2002 , lionel jospin , received . many voters certainly remembered the first round of the 2002 presidential election , when le pen caused a political earthquake by outpolling jospin to make it to the run-off . in 2002 , left-wing candidates other than jospin garnered an impressive 26.71 per cent of the vote , while the socialist received only 16.18 per cent . this year , three trotskyist candidates , the green party standard-bearer and anti-globalization activist jose bove picked up only about 11 percent of the vote .
record turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters came out in record numbers the memory of 2002 no doubt also contributed to a voter participation rate that was near an all-time high for a first-round election in postwar france , with an estimated 84.5 percent of the country 's 44.5 million registered voters casting their ballots on sunday . the previous record was 84.75 percent , set in 1965 . five years ago , only 71.6 percent of registered voters went to the polls in the first round . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " this election is like a soccer cup tie match " in an interview with dw-tv , franco-german daniel cohn-bendit , a leading politician for the greens in europe , talked about the french presidential election and the consequences for france and europe .

torsten frings considers swapping bremen for turin and juventus the bundesliga is looking at a potential exodus of star names in the summer , with a number of players looking outside germany for prospective new employers as the current season draws to a close . germany midfielder torsten frings has met representatives of italian giants juventus to discuss a possible move from werder bremen to the italian giants , he said on tuesday .
frings was in turin monday with his wife , petra , and his adviser , norbert flippen , for talks with juventus sports director alessio secco and club official roberto bettega .
" i liked it there .
but that will not speed up my decision .
i will make up my mind over the next weeks , " he said .
" juve want me at all costs .
they do n't want me to be just another midfielder but ' the ' playmaker , " frings told the daily bild newspaper .
" i 'm thinking a lot about this idea . "
according to tuesday 's edition of turin 's la stampa daily , the issue mainly depends on frings ' wife , who allegedly is not thrilled about a move to the northern italian city .
but german reports also say werder would want considerably more than the roughly 8 million euros -lrb- $ 10.8 million -rrb- juve are said to be offering for frings before agreeing to any move .
secco is said to be preparing a trip to bremen next week for negotiations with werder , the 2004 german league and cup champions .
juve want frings to run midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings ' combative style will fit well in serie a the turin club are keen on signing the germany international this summer as they prepare for a return to serie a for forced demotion for the current season over a match-fixing scheme .
they have already signed a bundesliga player in bosnian midfielder hasan salihamidzic from bayern munich and are reportedly also interested in frings ' bremen teammate miroslav klose , the 2006 world cup top scorer .
although frings , 30 , still has two more years on his contract at bremen , he said at the weekend he was considering the approach from juventus but " wo n't be put under any pressure . "
klose has a deal in bremen until 2008 .
werder coach thomas schaaf said it was " legitimate " for frings to consider the offer , with italian reports saying the player could double his salary at juventus .
" if he has the feeling that he absolutely has to try something new then we will speak to him about the situation , " schaaf said .
" but the fact is that the conditions -lrb- for a move -rrb- have to be in place .
both miro -lrb- klose -rrb- and torsten still have a contract with us . "
werder bremen sporting director klaus allofs said he was surprised by the news .
" we 're not going to put ourselves under pressure .
if torsten no longer wants to play for werder i 'm not going to force him , " said allofs .
" we have in the past always succeeded in finding new talent .
we 're not dependant on one player , werder is more important than any player . "
however , losing both frings and klose would shear werder of two of their most established and world class players .
hot-shot klose the must-have striker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has a number of top clubs monitoring his situation klose has been making noises of a possible move abroad for the best part of six months with his current deal at bremen coming up for renewal .
he is under contract with the german title challengers until next year but had previously told them he would have come to a decision by the beginning of 2007 .
" miro thought he would have decided by now .
he says himself that it 's a difficult decision to take , " said agent alexander schutt .
news that the 28-year-old germany striker is looking to pastures new has put a number of europe 's big clubs on alert with manchester united and barcelona keeping tabs on his situation , while werder 's great rivals bayern munich are said to be considering making an offer which could tempt the polish-born forward to stay in the bundesliga .
after losing out on fiorentina ’ s world cup-winning hit-man , luca toni , bayern would gladly redirect the funds to their northern foes if it meant securing another of europe 's hottest strikers .
hargreaves ' move to manchester back on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hargreaves could be wearing a different red kit next season the financial outlay for klose would also be eased if bayern allow the exit of another star name - owen hargreaves .
hargreaves has been a manchester united target since last summer and remains on sir alex ferguson 's wish list for the new season .
while the bayern hierarchy were less than willing to sell the england international earlier this season , the elimination form the champions league has seemingly changed their minds .
" if we really get an offer of 25 or 30 million euros for hargreaves i would think about it very seriously , " club president franz beckenbauer told premiere tv in germany after the bavarians crashed out to ac milan last week . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern search for replacements as departures draw near the season is only half-way through and yet a number of bayern munich 's midfielders are looking for new clubs .

torsten frings considers swapping bremen for turin and juventus the bundesliga is looking at a potential exodus of star names in the summer , with a number of players looking outside germany for prospective new employers as the current season draws to a close . germany midfielder torsten frings has met representatives of italian giants juventus to discuss a possible move from werder bremen to the italian giants , he said on tuesday .
frings was in turin monday with his wife , petra , and his adviser , norbert flippen , for talks with juventus sports director alessio secco and club official roberto bettega .
" i liked it there .
but that will not speed up my decision .
i will make up my mind over the next weeks , " he said .
" juve want me at all costs .
they do n't want me to be just another midfielder but ' the ' playmaker , " frings told the daily bild newspaper .
" i 'm thinking a lot about this idea . "
according to tuesday 's edition of turin 's la stampa daily , the issue mainly depends on frings ' wife , who allegedly is not thrilled about a move to the northern italian city .
but german reports also say werder would want considerably more than the roughly 8 million euros -lrb- $ 10.8 million -rrb- juve are said to be offering for frings before agreeing to any move .

they have already signed a bundesliga player in bosnian midfielder hasan salihamidzic from bayern munich and are reportedly also interested in frings ' bremen teammate miroslav klose , the 2006 world cup top scorer .
although frings , 30 , still has two more years on his contract at bremen , he said at the weekend he was considering the approach from juventus but " wo n't be put under any pressure . "
klose has a deal in bremen until 2008 .
werder coach thomas schaaf said it was " legitimate " for frings to consider the offer , with italian reports saying the player could double his salary at juventus .
" if he has the feeling that he absolutely has to try something new then we will speak to him about the situation , " schaaf said .
" but the fact is that the conditions -lrb- for a move -rrb- have to be in place .
both miro -lrb- klose -rrb- and torsten still have a contract with us . "
werder bremen sporting director klaus allofs said he was surprised by the news .
" we 're not going to put ourselves under pressure .

" we have in the past always succeeded in finding new talent .

schalke have 62 points to retain a two-point lead over werder bremen -lrb- 60 -rrb- , who briefly climbed to the top from a 3-1 friday victory against lowly alemannia aachen .
" it will remain tight until the end , " warned schalke coach mirko slomka .
vfb stuttgart have 58 points after an impressive 2-0 against the ailing champions munich , who remained on 53 points and - with only four rounds left - are in serious danger of not playing in the lucrative champions league for the first time since 1996 .
the top two finishers gain direct entry into the elite event , the third-placed team enters the qualifying round , the fourth and fifth- placed sides have to be content with a place in the uefa cup .
diego stuns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hard work paid off bremen 's win - with a stunning injury-time strike from playmaker diego from inside his own half rounding it off - seemed to have rattled schalke who had lots of trouble against the feared cottbus defense .
fabian ernst was denied by goalkeeper tomislav piplica , and schalke then called in vain for a penalty late in the first half when dario rodriguez appeared to have been brought down .
rost almost scored for cottbus in the 53rd when his intended cross hit the crossbar , and his bad luck was complete when he tapped hamit altintop 's cross into his own net seven minutes later for schalke 's lead .
schalke remained on course towards their first title in 49 years when bordon 's header for 2-0 in the 64th assured them of victory .
" cottbus made life difficult for us .
i told my players to be patient and we managed to create more pressure in the second half , " said slomka .
munich out of the race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no fun for munich in stuttgart , the opening goal in the 23rd minute reflected munich 's miserable campaign -lrb- by their standard -rrb- .
defender christian lell tried to clear in his area , but the ball hit stuttgart forward cacao , of whose body it bounced into the net .
cacao doubled the lead two minutes later for the cup finalists stuttgart , tapping in a cross from sami khedira .
the brazilian striker could have easily scored more goals within the next minutes against a crumbling munich defense , aiming inches wide in the 28th and denied by the crossbar in the 32nd .
" we are fourth and it is our own fault , " said munich midfielder mark van bommel after the team 's ninth season defeat .

but the polls also say that about a third of the 45 million voters are undecided , with many indicating they would only make up their minds in the hours before heading for the polling station .
that has given hope to centrist francois bayrou and far-right leader jean-marie le pen that they can sneak past socialist segolene royal who has been second behind sarkozy in months of polls leading up to the vote .
no one in the french political establishment has forgotten le pen 's stunning feat in 2002 when he beat the socialist candidate lionel jospin in the first round to reach the runoff .

jerome perani , a 37-year-old marketing executive for a paris technology firm who voted socialist in 2002 , said he was considering voting bayrou this time as a " purely tactical choice - almost like game theory . "
the authoritative le monde newspaper summed up the dilemma facing the french : " many voters are not wondering who they should vote for sunday , but how : with their heart or their head ? "
one recent survey said that only 43 percent of voters considered that the campaign had helped them .
fifty-nine percent said they thought the campaign had been of poor standard .

cayrol highlighted how the socialist francois mitterrand won an emphatic victory in 1981 because of widespread fears about employment .
in 2002 , insecurity was a key topic after a series of murders and other crimes .

but the polls also say that about a third of the 45 million voters are undecided , with many indicating they would only make up their minds in the hours before heading for the polling station .
that has given hope to centrist francois bayrou and far-right leader jean-marie le pen that they can sneak past socialist segolene royal who has been second behind sarkozy in months of polls leading up to the vote .
no one in the french political establishment has forgotten le pen 's stunning feat in 2002 when he beat the socialist candidate lionel jospin in the first round to reach the runoff .
confusion reins analysts say the months of campaigning by sarkozy , royal , bayrou , le pen and their rival trotskyist , ecologist and nationalist candidates has left the public more confused than decisive .
there is also a greater awareness of tactical voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question is who will join sarkozy for the second round there has been much talk of some left wingers voting for bayrou instead of royal in a bid to have a better chance of stopping sarkozy in the second round .
could a protest vote for ecologist dominique voynet in the first round help le pen reach the runoff again , some wonder .
jerome perani , a 37-year-old marketing executive for a paris technology firm who voted socialist in 2002 , said he was considering voting bayrou this time as a " purely tactical choice - almost like game theory . "
the authoritative le monde newspaper summed up the dilemma facing the french : " many voters are not wondering who they should vote for sunday , but how : with their heart or their head ? "
one recent survey said that only 43 percent of voters considered that the campaign had helped them .
fifty-nine percent said they thought the campaign had been of poor standard .
many polls have indicated that the public has been turned off by the reliance on personal attacks rather than political debate by the rival candidates .
country in crisis all the candidates say france is a country in crisis , social and economic , but no one platform has grabbed the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen has been good for surprises in the past " no candidate has managed to impress with durable themes , " said roland cayrol of the polling organization bva .
cayrol highlighted how the socialist francois mitterrand won an emphatic victory in 1981 because of widespread fears about employment .
in 2002 , insecurity was a key topic after a series of murders and other crimes .
cayrol said that french voters had wanted a debate before the first round to help them make up their minds .
now they are frustrated because it did not happen , though the political fireworks could still come in the next two weeks between the finalists in the presidential battle . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france 's next president : sarko vs. sego dw-world.de reviews the candidates and issues that drove the french presidential campaign ahead of sunday 's vote .

torsten frings considers swapping bremen for turin and juventus the bundesliga is looking at a potential exodus of star names in the summer , with a number of players looking outside germany for prospective new employers as the current season draws to a close . germany midfielder torsten frings has met representatives of italian giants juventus to discuss a possible move from werder bremen to the italian giants , he said on tuesday .
frings was in turin monday with his wife , petra , and his adviser , norbert flippen , for talks with juventus sports director alessio secco and club official roberto bettega .
" i liked it there .
but that will not speed up my decision .
i will make up my mind over the next weeks , " he said .
" juve want me at all costs .
they do n't want me to be just another midfielder but ' the ' playmaker , " frings told the daily bild newspaper .
" i 'm thinking a lot about this idea . "
according to tuesday 's edition of turin 's la stampa daily , the issue mainly depends on frings ' wife , who allegedly is not thrilled about a move to the northern italian city .
but german reports also say werder would want considerably more than the roughly 8 million euros -lrb- $ 10.8 million -rrb- juve are said to be offering for frings before agreeing to any move .
secco is said to be preparing a trip to bremen next week for negotiations with werder , the 2004 german league and cup champions .

they have already signed a bundesliga player in bosnian midfielder hasan salihamidzic from bayern munich and are reportedly also interested in frings ' bremen teammate miroslav klose , the 2006 world cup top scorer .
although frings , 30 , still has two more years on his contract at bremen , he said at the weekend he was considering the approach from juventus but " wo n't be put under any pressure . "
klose has a deal in bremen until 2008 .
werder coach thomas schaaf said it was " legitimate " for frings to consider the offer , with italian reports saying the player could double his salary at juventus .
" if he has the feeling that he absolutely has to try something new then we will speak to him about the situation , " schaaf said .
" but the fact is that the conditions -lrb- for a move -rrb- have to be in place .
both miro -lrb- klose -rrb- and torsten still have a contract with us . "
werder bremen sporting director klaus allofs said he was surprised by the news .
" we 're not going to put ourselves under pressure .
if torsten no longer wants to play for werder i 'm not going to force him , " said allofs .
" we have in the past always succeeded in finding new talent .
we 're not dependant on one player , werder is more important than any player . "
however , losing both frings and klose would shear werder of two of their most established and world class players .

" miro thought he would have decided by now .
he says himself that it 's a difficult decision to take , " said agent alexander schutt .
news that the 28-year-old germany striker is looking to pastures new has put a number of europe 's big clubs on alert with manchester united and barcelona keeping tabs on his situation , while werder 's great rivals bayern munich are said to be considering making an offer which could tempt the polish-born forward to stay in the bundesliga .

torsten frings considers swapping bremen for turin and juventus the bundesliga is looking at a potential exodus of star names in the summer , with a number of players looking outside germany for prospective new employers as the current season draws to a close . germany midfielder torsten frings has met representatives of italian giants juventus to discuss a possible move from werder bremen to the italian giants , he said on tuesday .
frings was in turin monday with his wife , petra , and his adviser , norbert flippen , for talks with juventus sports director alessio secco and club official roberto bettega .
" i liked it there .
but that will not speed up my decision .
i will make up my mind over the next weeks , " he said .
" juve want me at all costs .
they do n't want me to be just another midfielder but ' the ' playmaker , " frings told the daily bild newspaper .
" i 'm thinking a lot about this idea . "
according to tuesday 's edition of turin 's la stampa daily , the issue mainly depends on frings ' wife , who allegedly is not thrilled about a move to the northern italian city .
but german reports also say werder would want considerably more than the roughly 8 million euros -lrb- $ 10.8 million -rrb- juve are said to be offering for frings before agreeing to any move .
secco is said to be preparing a trip to bremen next week for negotiations with werder , the 2004 german league and cup champions .
juve want frings to run midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings ' combative style will fit well in serie a the turin club are keen on signing the germany international this summer as they prepare for a return to serie a for forced demotion for the current season over a match-fixing scheme .
they have already signed a bundesliga player in bosnian midfielder hasan salihamidzic from bayern munich and are reportedly also interested in frings ' bremen teammate miroslav klose , the 2006 world cup top scorer .
although frings , 30 , still has two more years on his contract at bremen , he said at the weekend he was considering the approach from juventus but " wo n't be put under any pressure . "
klose has a deal in bremen until 2008 .
werder coach thomas schaaf said it was " legitimate " for frings to consider the offer , with italian reports saying the player could double his salary at juventus .
" if he has the feeling that he absolutely has to try something new then we will speak to him about the situation , " schaaf said .
" but the fact is that the conditions -lrb- for a move -rrb- have to be in place .
both miro -lrb- klose -rrb- and torsten still have a contract with us . "
werder bremen sporting director klaus allofs said he was surprised by the news .
" we 're not going to put ourselves under pressure .
if torsten no longer wants to play for werder i 'm not going to force him , " said allofs .
" we have in the past always succeeded in finding new talent .
we 're not dependant on one player , werder is more important than any player . "
however , losing both frings and klose would shear werder of two of their most established and world class players .
hot-shot klose the must-have striker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has a number of top clubs monitoring his situation klose has been making noises of a possible move abroad for the best part of six months with his current deal at bremen coming up for renewal .
he is under contract with the german title challengers until next year but had previously told them he would have come to a decision by the beginning of 2007 .
" miro thought he would have decided by now .
he says himself that it 's a difficult decision to take , " said agent alexander schutt .
news that the 28-year-old germany striker is looking to pastures new has put a number of europe 's big clubs on alert with manchester united and barcelona keeping tabs on his situation , while werder 's great rivals bayern munich are said to be considering making an offer which could tempt the polish-born forward to stay in the bundesliga .
after losing out on fiorentina ’ s world cup-winning hit-man , luca toni , bayern would gladly redirect the funds to their northern foes if it meant securing another of europe 's hottest strikers .
hargreaves ' move to manchester back on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hargreaves could be wearing a different red kit next season the financial outlay for klose would also be eased if bayern allow the exit of another star name - owen hargreaves .
hargreaves has been a manchester united target since last summer and remains on sir alex ferguson 's wish list for the new season .
while the bayern hierarchy were less than willing to sell the england international earlier this season , the elimination form the champions league has seemingly changed their minds .
" if we really get an offer of 25 or 30 million euros for hargreaves i would think about it very seriously , " club president franz beckenbauer told premiere tv in germany after the bavarians crashed out to ac milan last week . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern search for replacements as departures draw near the season is only half-way through and yet a number of bayern munich 's midfielders are looking for new clubs .

many german companies are getting burned by it .
some are also getting rich , while hardly any are getting caught . over a third of the german companies surveyed , and 43 percent of the total participants , said they had lost a contract in the last five years because rival firms had resorted to offering bribes .
in the previous study , conducted five years ago , only a quarter of german companies had said the same , indicating that corruption is on the rise . consulting firm control risks and law firm simmons & simmons surveyed 350 companies in brazil , europe , hong kong and the united states on their approach to fighting corruption .
fifty of the participants were located in germany . a quarter of the respondents reported that bribes make international projects at least 5 percent more expensive , while a tenth of the bribes are said to amount to up to a half of the value of the business contract . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption in an issue worldwide " the numbers indicate that international measures taken against corruption are not as effective as hoped , " control risks officials wrote in the report . anti-corruption mechanisms go unheeded indeed , more and more international anti-corruption measures have been put in place .
in 2005 , for example , an oecd -lrb- organization for economic cooperation and development -rrb- convention called on its member states to prosecute companies for paying bribes when conducting business abroad . the same year , the united nations drew up an anti-corruption convention expressing a commitment to prosecute both active and passive forms of bribery . germany did n't sign the un document , but introduced an anti-bribery law of its own in 1998 . however , only half of german companies were aware of the existing law and only three cases had been prosecuted since it went into effect nine years ago , the study said . room for improvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw exec peter hartz was convicted of 44 accounts of corruption despite recent high-profile corruption cases at firms , including siemens and volkswagen , german companies seem reluctant to crack down . " those who want to fight corruption effectively have to be prepared for a drop in sales , " corruption expert hans-hermann aldenhoff from simmons & simmons told the web site of german business daily handelsblatt . only a quarter of the companies surveyed said they had a confidential telephone hotline where cases of corruption could be reported .
and , according to handelsblatt.com , only a handful of german companies employ an ombudsman specially trained in investigating and resolving corruption-related problems . without effective anti-corruption mechanisms in place , improvements are likely to be slow in coming . forty-two percent of the survey respondents thought corruption levels would remain the same over the next five years .
still , a quarter said they thought progress would be made in the fight against corruption . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens chairman steps down amid corruption scandal siemens supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer will resign next week , according to a statement by the german engineering giant , which is at the center of corruption allegations .

torsten frings considers swapping bremen for turin and juventus the bundesliga is looking at a potential exodus of star names in the summer , with a number of players looking outside germany for prospective new employers as the current season draws to a close . germany midfielder torsten frings has met representatives of italian giants juventus to discuss a possible move from werder bremen to the italian giants , he said on tuesday .
frings was in turin monday with his wife , petra , and his adviser , norbert flippen , for talks with juventus sports director alessio secco and club official roberto bettega .
" i liked it there .
but that will not speed up my decision .
i will make up my mind over the next weeks , " he said .
" juve want me at all costs .
they do n't want me to be just another midfielder but ' the ' playmaker , " frings told the daily bild newspaper .
" i 'm thinking a lot about this idea . "
according to tuesday 's edition of turin 's la stampa daily , the issue mainly depends on frings ' wife , who allegedly is not thrilled about a move to the northern italian city .
but german reports also say werder would want considerably more than the roughly 8 million euros -lrb- $ 10.8 million -rrb- juve are said to be offering for frings before agreeing to any move .
secco is said to be preparing a trip to bremen next week for negotiations with werder , the 2004 german league and cup champions .

they have already signed a bundesliga player in bosnian midfielder hasan salihamidzic from bayern munich and are reportedly also interested in frings ' bremen teammate miroslav klose , the 2006 world cup top scorer .
although frings , 30 , still has two more years on his contract at bremen , he said at the weekend he was considering the approach from juventus but " wo n't be put under any pressure . "
klose has a deal in bremen until 2008 .
werder coach thomas schaaf said it was " legitimate " for frings to consider the offer , with italian reports saying the player could double his salary at juventus .
" if he has the feeling that he absolutely has to try something new then we will speak to him about the situation , " schaaf said .
" but the fact is that the conditions -lrb- for a move -rrb- have to be in place .
both miro -lrb- klose -rrb- and torsten still have a contract with us . "
werder bremen sporting director klaus allofs said he was surprised by the news .
" we 're not going to put ourselves under pressure .
if torsten no longer wants to play for werder i 'm not going to force him , " said allofs .
" we have in the past always succeeded in finding new talent .
we 're not dependant on one player , werder is more important than any player . "
however , losing both frings and klose would shear werder of two of their most established and world class players .

" miro thought he would have decided by now .
he says himself that it 's a difficult decision to take , " said agent alexander schutt .
news that the 28-year-old germany striker is looking to pastures new has put a number of europe 's big clubs on alert with manchester united and barcelona keeping tabs on his situation , while werder 's great rivals bayern munich are said to be considering making an offer which could tempt the polish-born forward to stay in the bundesliga .
after losing out on fiorentina ’ s world cup-winning hit-man , luca toni , bayern would gladly redirect the funds to their northern foes if it meant securing another of europe 's hottest strikers .

while the bayern hierarchy were less than willing to sell the england international earlier this season , the elimination form the champions league has seemingly changed their minds .
" if we really get an offer of 25 or 30 million euros for hargreaves i would think about it very seriously , " club president franz beckenbauer told premiere tv in germany after the bavarians crashed out to ac milan last week . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern search for replacements as departures draw near the season is only half-way through and yet a number of bayern munich 's midfielders are looking for new clubs .

no one in the french political establishment has forgotten le pen 's stunning feat in 2002 when he beat the socialist candidate lionel jospin in the first round to reach the runoff .

schalke have 62 points to retain a two-point lead over werder bremen -lrb- 60 -rrb- , who briefly climbed to the top from a 3-1 friday victory against lowly alemannia aachen .
" it will remain tight until the end , " warned schalke coach mirko slomka .
vfb stuttgart have 58 points after an impressive 2-0 against the ailing champions munich , who remained on 53 points and - with only four rounds left - are in serious danger of not playing in the lucrative champions league for the first time since 1996 .

diego stuns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hard work paid off bremen 's win - with a stunning injury-time strike from playmaker diego from inside his own half rounding it off - seemed to have rattled schalke who had lots of trouble against the feared cottbus defense .
fabian ernst was denied by goalkeeper tomislav piplica , and schalke then called in vain for a penalty late in the first half when dario rodriguez appeared to have been brought down .
rost almost scored for cottbus in the 53rd when his intended cross hit the crossbar , and his bad luck was complete when he tapped hamit altintop 's cross into his own net seven minutes later for schalke 's lead .
schalke remained on course towards their first title in 49 years when bordon 's header for 2-0 in the 64th assured them of victory .
" cottbus made life difficult for us .
i told my players to be patient and we managed to create more pressure in the second half , " said slomka .

cacao doubled the lead two minutes later for the cup finalists stuttgart , tapping in a cross from sami khedira .
the brazilian striker could have easily scored more goals within the next minutes against a crumbling munich defense , aiming inches wide in the 28th and denied by the crossbar in the 32nd .
" we are fourth and it is our own fault , " said munich midfielder mark van bommel after the team 's ninth season defeat .

at the saint-charles primary school in marseille , long queues formed from early morning for the curtained-off ballot booths in a room festooned with children 's drawings .

" i decided to register and come out today so as to avoid a similar situation where we would be left with virtually no choice in the second round . "
other voters also acknowledged being galvanized by the result in 2002 , like nurse brigitte cuvelliez , 49 , who cast her ballot in the central city of lyon for the first time since 1988 .

german officials on sunday called for reopening the probe of the 1977 murder of a federal prosecutor after a former leftist radical stepped forward to say a man serving time was not involved . the news weekly der spiegel reported in an issue to be published monday that it had evidence which allegedly showed that an ex-member of the red army faction guerrilla group , stefan wisniewski , had shot and killed chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback . the murder , which was never solved , had long been blamed in part on fellow raf radical christian klar , who recently lodged a plea for clemency with president horst köhler after more than 24 years in prison . klar was arrested in 1982 and jailed for his role in multiple murders .
his sentence stipulates that he will not be eligible for parole until 2009 , unless he is pardoned first . buback became the first victim of a bloody era dubbed the " german autumn " of 1977 when he was shot in his mercedes car by a raf gunman on a motorcycle in the southwestern city of karlsruhe . old news for german officials ? der spiegel reported that former raf member verena becker had told german authorities in the early 1980s that wisniewski had slain buback , and it quoted another raf militant , peter-jürgen boock , as now confirming that claim . they said klar had merely driven the get-away car . wisniewski was released in 1999 after 21 years in prison for other raf murders .
germany 's süddeutsche zeitung meanwhile reported that there was no evidence linking wisniewski to the buback murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael buback earlier this month , buback 's son michael gave his support to klar 's plea for clemency after receiving what he called credible information from anonymous sources connected to the now-disbanded group that klar was not involved in killing . michael buback told the welt am sonntag newspaper that he had now been called as a witness in the case by federal prosecutors .
in germany murder is not subject to a statute of limitations . unforgivable oversight ? former interior minister gerhard baum of the opposition free democrats led a chorus at the weekend calling for the case to be reopened , adding that if prosecutors ignored exculpatory evidence in the 1980s it would be " an oversight that would be difficult to forgive .

the group officially disbanded in 1998 . brigitte mohnhaupt , who led the raf with klar after the group 's original leaders committed suicide in jail , was released from prison in march after serving 24 years for her role in nine murders , including buback 's . justice authorities said she no longer posed a threat to society . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we need proof that the german state is capable of mercy " gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison .

german officials on sunday called for reopening the probe of the 1977 murder of a federal prosecutor after a former leftist radical stepped forward to say a man serving time was not involved . the news weekly der spiegel reported in an issue to be published monday that it had evidence which allegedly showed that an ex-member of the red army faction guerrilla group , stefan wisniewski , had shot and killed chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback . the murder , which was never solved , had long been blamed in part on fellow raf radical christian klar , who recently lodged a plea for clemency with president horst köhler after more than 24 years in prison . klar was arrested in 1982 and jailed for his role in multiple murders .
his sentence stipulates that he will not be eligible for parole until 2009 , unless he is pardoned first . buback became the first victim of a bloody era dubbed the " german autumn " of 1977 when he was shot in his mercedes car by a raf gunman on a motorcycle in the southwestern city of karlsruhe . old news for german officials ? der spiegel reported that former raf member verena becker had told german authorities in the early 1980s that wisniewski had slain buback , and it quoted another raf militant , peter-jürgen boock , as now confirming that claim . they said klar had merely driven the get-away car . wisniewski was released in 1999 after 21 years in prison for other raf murders .

at the saint-charles primary school in marseille , long queues formed from early morning for the curtained-off ballot booths in a room festooned with children 's drawings .
some voters in the southern port city had to cool their heels for more than an hour after the locks on the doors of several polling stations were found to have been blocked with glue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen cast his ballot in saint-cloud , outside paris many younger voters in their 20s said they were partially motivated by the need to prevent a repetition of the 2002 election , when a low turnout helped far-right leader jean-marie le pen eliminate the socialist candidate in the first round and secure a stunning run-off spot against president jacques chirac .
galvanized by concerns " i did n't vote in 2002 out of indifference , but then there was that terrible shock , " said kaoutcher ben amor , a 30-year-old medical assistant .
" i decided to register and come out today so as to avoid a similar situation where we would be left with virtually no choice in the second round . "
other voters also acknowledged being galvanized by the result in 2002 , like nurse brigitte cuvelliez , 49 , who cast her ballot in the central city of lyon for the first time since 1988 .
cuvelliez was one of the estimated one-third of french voters who , despite months of frenzied campaigning , only decided who to back at the last moment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative candidate sarkozy voted in neuilly sur seine " i did n't know who i was going to vote for , but i knew who i was n't going to vote for , " she said .
" i made my decision in the last couple of days by comparing the candidates ' policies , point by point . "
having reached her decision , however , she remained skeptical what her vote might achieve .
" once elected , politicians do just what they want , " she said .
in the northern city of lille , in the red-brick pasteur primary school , nicolas fouilleron , a 28-year-old medical intern , swung between a similar mood of " hope for change " and fatalism .
" as with every election , when it 's over , nothing happens , " he said .
looking for change in the regions around paris , voters waited patiently for their chance to participate in what many believed to be the most important presidential election for decades .
" i 'm looking for major social reform , especially given the gap between rich and poor which is worsening all the time , " said musician xavier cocollos , 40 , in suresnes , a suburb west of the french capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist candidate royal cast her vote in melle , western france businessman bruno labarre , 44 , was also looking for change .
" i 'm hoping that we can build a new model , a new society on the back of serious reforms , " labarre said .
" the system we have now is going nowhere . "
for the first time in a presidential election , some of the 44.5 million registered french voters cast their ballots on electronic voting machines - an innovation that appeared to meet with general approval .
" i was a bit apprehensive at first , " said yvette lalanne , 70 , in the southwestern city of toulouse .

he joined the german greens party in 1984 and has been a member of the european parliament for the german and french greens in an alternating fashion since 1994 .
he is currently the co-president of the group european greens-european free alliance in the european parliament . dw-tv : daniel cohn-bendit , anyone observing the french presidential election campaign in the last few weeks could have been forgiven for thinking the winner will be the per son who can best sing the marseillaise . is patriotism the winner in this election ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit daniel cohn-bendit : well , it 's always like that during a presidential election in france .
the nearer you get to the ballot , the more french identity takes center stage .
but you 're right ; there has been some overstatement of the marseillaise and the french flag .
but that can be important when we 're not just talking about the french flag , but about what color is the hand holding it . does that mean france is moving more to the extreme right ? france is rightwing , that 's the reality .
or we might say it 's conservative , structurally conservative .
we saw that with the referendum on the european constitution .
you have to be aware that whoever wants to be president of france must also embody france , and that 's why it plays a role .
i do think the other issues are also important , though .
but i admit that i find this election is like a soccer cup tie match : somebody has to win and that means the result is what matters , but the game itself is rather boring . that means issues do n't play such an important role ? they change so quickly . no single issue is paramount . not even france 's decline or french fear of globalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters line up to cast their votes no , that would last a few days .
someone would then make one remark or another and it would become the main issue for four days .
but then social issues , the budget or europe would take over - it would take only a few days .
basically it 's really an election about personalities .
is sarkozy believable ?
is segolene royal as a woman capable ?
is bayrou able to create a majority ? they 're the central questions . according to the opinion polls we are looking at a three-way battle between segolene royal , francois bayrou and sarkozy .
or do you think that jean-marie le pen has a chance ? there are problems interpreting le pen 's ratings .
in the last election le pen got 17 percent of the vote .
a few days before that he had just 6 .
9 percent of voters who were prepared to say they would vote for him .
that 's the problem with the polls .
sarkozy 's strategy is to position himself so far to the right as possible so that le pen loses support . will he succeed ? until two weeks ago i would have said : yes .
but now when you look at the trend sarkozy is looking shaky and le pen once again has 15 or 16 percent .
if le pen does very well , then that would be a serious problem for sarkozy , because the biggest competition for votes is between sarkozy and le pen .
it would be a big surprise if sarkozy was not in the second round .
i do n't think it 's going to happen , though . so patriotism is playing such an important role that le pen could suddenly do very well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parisians wait to vote the problem is that sarkozy is polarizing the electorate to the right with very strange arguments .
he says that if a young person commits suicide , then genetic reasons are to blame .
paedophilia and homosexuality are also genetic .
sarkozy has made a big mistake there and even the church has distanced itself from him .
sarkozy is presenting very right-wing arguments .
he wants to create a ministry of immigration and national identity .
his arguments about culture are similar to those that were made in germany a few years ago .
this is all about taking votes away from le pen .
but it encourages people to move right because le pen has made it okay to discuss such things .
sarkozy has another very dangerous side : he says people should be proud of france , we 're not the ones who invented the final solution , we 're not the ones who invented genocide .
he 's alluding to anti-german sentiment that exists in certain conservative circles .
that 's very dangerous . if he wins , will he continue in that vein ? that 's the question : what will he do then ? germany and france are both in europe .
there 's a german-french relationship .
if sarkozy tries to play with that he 'll have problems later with people in the middle ground because they do n't want that .
the past history between the two countries is exactly that : it 's in the past .
there 's a new relationship with germany .
i think it 's very dangerous to throw that relationship back to 1945 .
it 's not only playing with french society and with europe 's future , it 's also endangering sarkozy 's acceptance by the french people . can segolene royal fill that gap ? well , i think that 's exactly the situation right now .
royal stands for renewal in the socialist party . she also instituted a change in generation . she embodies the new generation .
but she 's a woman and during the campaign people suddenly realized that when a woman makes a mistake it 's doubly worse .
there have been several examples during the campaign and people have questioned segolene royal 's ability to be president . has there suddenly been a sympathy-effect for royal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one thing 's for certain : chirac wo n't be france 's next president there has been , but in my opinion it was not enough .
i think that in the second round royal has the chance to achieve a bigger wave of support .
but only for a single reason as it is with most elections : which aversion is stronger ?
the anti-sarkozy or the anti-royal ? the election would be a choice between being anti-sarkozy and anti-royal .
it would be a battle between two camps .
one camp would be everybody who does n't want sarkozy and the other everybody who does n't want royal .
that will be crucial . what can europe expect from a president royal or president sarkozy ? if he 's elected , sarkozy will quite quickly take small steps in institutional reform , basically implementing the treaty of nice accept with some improvements .
i think segolene royal would be forced to bring content and institution together , meaning she would have to put more emphasis on social issues within europe .
as regards bayrou : it would lead to a center-left coalition , if royal wins .
bayrou is the most pro-european judging by his arguments and that 's why i think a center-left government would play a positive role in the constitutional process . alexander kudascheff interviewed daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sunshine and suspense bring france out to vote bright sunshine and high suspense saw voters across france pouring into polling booths sunday to take part in a nail-biting presidential election that kept the country guessing to the last .

he joined the german greens party in 1984 and has been a member of the european parliament for the german and french greens in an alternating fashion since 1994 .
he is currently the co-president of the group european greens-european free alliance in the european parliament . dw-tv : daniel cohn-bendit , anyone observing the french presidential election campaign in the last few weeks could have been forgiven for thinking the winner will be the per son who can best sing the marseillaise . is patriotism the winner in this election ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit daniel cohn-bendit : well , it 's always like that during a presidential election in france .
the nearer you get to the ballot , the more french identity takes center stage .
but you 're right ; there has been some overstatement of the marseillaise and the french flag .
but that can be important when we 're not just talking about the french flag , but about what color is the hand holding it . does that mean france is moving more to the extreme right ? france is rightwing , that 's the reality .
or we might say it 's conservative , structurally conservative .
we saw that with the referendum on the european constitution .
you have to be aware that whoever wants to be president of france must also embody france , and that 's why it plays a role .
i do think the other issues are also important , though .
but i admit that i find this election is like a soccer cup tie match : somebody has to win and that means the result is what matters , but the game itself is rather boring . that means issues do n't play such an important role ? they change so quickly . no single issue is paramount . not even france 's decline or french fear of globalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters line up to cast their votes no , that would last a few days .
someone would then make one remark or another and it would become the main issue for four days .
but then social issues , the budget or europe would take over - it would take only a few days .
basically it 's really an election about personalities .
is sarkozy believable ?
is segolene royal as a woman capable ?
is bayrou able to create a majority ? they 're the central questions . according to the opinion polls we are looking at a three-way battle between segolene royal , francois bayrou and sarkozy .
or do you think that jean-marie le pen has a chance ? there are problems interpreting le pen 's ratings .
in the last election le pen got 17 percent of the vote .
a few days before that he had just 6 .
9 percent of voters who were prepared to say they would vote for him .
that 's the problem with the polls .
sarkozy 's strategy is to position himself so far to the right as possible so that le pen loses support . will he succeed ? until two weeks ago i would have said : yes .
but now when you look at the trend sarkozy is looking shaky and le pen once again has 15 or 16 percent .
if le pen does very well , then that would be a serious problem for sarkozy , because the biggest competition for votes is between sarkozy and le pen .
it would be a big surprise if sarkozy was not in the second round .
i do n't think it 's going to happen , though . so patriotism is playing such an important role that le pen could suddenly do very well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parisians wait to vote the problem is that sarkozy is polarizing the electorate to the right with very strange arguments .
he says that if a young person commits suicide , then genetic reasons are to blame .
paedophilia and homosexuality are also genetic .
sarkozy has made a big mistake there and even the church has distanced itself from him .
sarkozy is presenting very right-wing arguments .
he wants to create a ministry of immigration and national identity .
his arguments about culture are similar to those that were made in germany a few years ago .
this is all about taking votes away from le pen .
but it encourages people to move right because le pen has made it okay to discuss such things .
sarkozy has another very dangerous side : he says people should be proud of france , we 're not the ones who invented the final solution , we 're not the ones who invented genocide .
he 's alluding to anti-german sentiment that exists in certain conservative circles .
that 's very dangerous . if he wins , will he continue in that vein ? that 's the question : what will he do then ? germany and france are both in europe .
there 's a german-french relationship .
if sarkozy tries to play with that he 'll have problems later with people in the middle ground because they do n't want that .
the past history between the two countries is exactly that : it 's in the past .
there 's a new relationship with germany .
i think it 's very dangerous to throw that relationship back to 1945 .
it 's not only playing with french society and with europe 's future , it 's also endangering sarkozy 's acceptance by the french people . can segolene royal fill that gap ? well , i think that 's exactly the situation right now .
royal stands for renewal in the socialist party . she also instituted a change in generation . she embodies the new generation .
but she 's a woman and during the campaign people suddenly realized that when a woman makes a mistake it 's doubly worse .
there have been several examples during the campaign and people have questioned segolene royal 's ability to be president . has there suddenly been a sympathy-effect for royal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one thing 's for certain : chirac wo n't be france 's next president there has been , but in my opinion it was not enough .
i think that in the second round royal has the chance to achieve a bigger wave of support .
but only for a single reason as it is with most elections : which aversion is stronger ?
the anti-sarkozy or the anti-royal ? the election would be a choice between being anti-sarkozy and anti-royal .
it would be a battle between two camps .
one camp would be everybody who does n't want sarkozy and the other everybody who does n't want royal .
that will be crucial . what can europe expect from a president royal or president sarkozy ? if he 's elected , sarkozy will quite quickly take small steps in institutional reform , basically implementing the treaty of nice accept with some improvements .
i think segolene royal would be forced to bring content and institution together , meaning she would have to put more emphasis on social issues within europe .
as regards bayrou : it would lead to a center-left coalition , if royal wins .
bayrou is the most pro-european judging by his arguments and that 's why i think a center-left government would play a positive role in the constitutional process . alexander kudascheff interviewed daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sunshine and suspense bring france out to vote bright sunshine and high suspense saw voters across france pouring into polling booths sunday to take part in a nail-biting presidential election that kept the country guessing to the last .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de breaking news -pipe- 22.04.2007 sarkozy and royal in runoff election for french presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy or royal will become france 's next president conservative nicolas sarkozy and his socialist rival , segolene royal , got the most votes in sunday 's election and will face each other in the second vote for the french presidency on may 6 . sarkozy and royal finished first and second respectively in sunday 's first round of the french presidential election . sarkozy was credited with about 30 percent of the vote and royal picked up about 25 percent .
they will now square off on may 6 as french voters elect the next head of state for the coming five years . centrist francois bayrou came in third , with about 18 percent , with right-wing extremist jean-marie le pen finishing a distant fourth , at around 11 percent . sarkozy 's new dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy supporters cheered on sunday sarkozy told cheering supporters of his center-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- that he wanted to rally the french people behind a " new dream . " france must now choose between two visions of society in the second round , sarkozy said . " by placing me in the lead and madame royal in second position , -lrb- voters -rrb- clearly marked their wish to have a definitive debate on two ideas of the nation , two projects of society , two value systems , " he said . advantage : sarkozy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy does n't have too worry too much , analysts say analyst said that sarkozy was now a clear favorite to be france 's next president . according to a telephone poll conducted after sarkozy and royal were declared winners , sarkozy would get 54 percent while royal would only get 46 percent of the vote on may 6 . " it 's clear there is a big advantage for sarkozy , " jean-philippe roy , a politics professor at tours university , told afp news service .
" the whole left-right balance in the country has shifted .
it is really a historic moment . " simple arithmetic works in sarkozy 's favor , others said . " what we have set up for round two is a clear right-left showdown , but it is a showdown which i find hard to see how the left can win , " said dominique moisi of the french institute for international affairs , according to afp .
" the left are clearly a minority in the country .
if you add right , far-right and half the center , sarkozy is in an extremely comfortable position .
his decision to court the far-right vote has clearly paid off . " although sarkozy has the lead , analysts agreed that the race is not yet won .
this is because of the deep mistrust with which the former interior minister is regarded by many voters - even by some who support his ideas . " we have today a political situation i have never seen : a man who is highly likely to be the next president but who provokes unprecedented levels of hatred and rejection , " said dominique reynie , professor at the paris school of political sciences . " this is the moment for sarkozy to start talking to the french people - not just to his own camp , " he added .
" he 's got to look like a president , which in france means someone who has the nation behind him .
from now on it 's not his policies , but his personality that 's the issue . " royal reaches out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal hopes to become france 's first female president speaking to her socialist party supporters in the small town of melle in western france , royal called for voters to rally round her for the presidential runoff , promising to bring france change without upheaval . " i call on all those who ... believe it is possible to reform france without brutalizing it , who want a triumph of human values over the stock market , who want an end to the painful rise of insecurity and precariousness , to come together , " she said .
" i reach out to all those who believe it is not only possible but urgent to break with a system that is no longer working " after a disastrous start to her campaign , royal 's result was impressive , as she is credited with about nine percent more of the vote than the socialist candidate in 2002 , lionel jospin , received . many voters certainly remembered the first round of the 2002 presidential election , when le pen caused a political earthquake by outpolling jospin to make it to the run-off . in 2002 , left-wing candidates other than jospin garnered an impressive 26.71 per cent of the vote , while the socialist received only 16.18 per cent . this year , three trotskyist candidates , the green party standard-bearer and anti-globalization activist jose bove picked up only about 11 percent of the vote .
record turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters came out in record numbers the memory of 2002 no doubt also contributed to a voter participation rate that was near an all-time high for a first-round election in postwar france , with an estimated 84.5 percent of the country 's 44.5 million registered voters casting their ballots on sunday . the previous record was 84.75 percent , set in 1965 . five years ago , only 71.6 percent of registered voters went to the polls in the first round . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " this election is like a soccer cup tie match " in an interview with dw-tv , franco-german daniel cohn-bendit , a leading politician for the greens in europe , talked about the french presidential election and the consequences for france and europe .

german officials on sunday called for reopening the probe of the 1977 murder of a federal prosecutor after a former leftist radical stepped forward to say a man serving time was not involved . the news weekly der spiegel reported in an issue to be published monday that it had evidence which allegedly showed that an ex-member of the red army faction guerrilla group , stefan wisniewski , had shot and killed chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback . the murder , which was never solved , had long been blamed in part on fellow raf radical christian klar , who recently lodged a plea for clemency with president horst köhler after more than 24 years in prison . klar was arrested in 1982 and jailed for his role in multiple murders .
his sentence stipulates that he will not be eligible for parole until 2009 , unless he is pardoned first . buback became the first victim of a bloody era dubbed the " german autumn " of 1977 when he was shot in his mercedes car by a raf gunman on a motorcycle in the southwestern city of karlsruhe . old news for german officials ? der spiegel reported that former raf member verena becker had told german authorities in the early 1980s that wisniewski had slain buback , and it quoted another raf militant , peter-jürgen boock , as now confirming that claim . they said klar had merely driven the get-away car . wisniewski was released in 1999 after 21 years in prison for other raf murders .
germany 's süddeutsche zeitung meanwhile reported that there was no evidence linking wisniewski to the buback murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael buback earlier this month , buback 's son michael gave his support to klar 's plea for clemency after receiving what he called credible information from anonymous sources connected to the now-disbanded group that klar was not involved in killing . michael buback told the welt am sonntag newspaper that he had now been called as a witness in the case by federal prosecutors .
in germany murder is not subject to a statute of limitations . unforgivable oversight ? former interior minister gerhard baum of the opposition free democrats led a chorus at the weekend calling for the case to be reopened , adding that if prosecutors ignored exculpatory evidence in the 1980s it would be " an oversight that would be difficult to forgive . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf still killed people in the late 1980s the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang after its founders andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , mounted a violent campaign against what it considered was the oppressive capitalist state of west germany from 1977 to 1982 . it targeted the german elite and the us military bases in germany and is suspected of killing 34 people .
the group officially disbanded in 1998 . brigitte mohnhaupt , who led the raf with klar after the group 's original leaders committed suicide in jail , was released from prison in march after serving 24 years for her role in nine murders , including buback 's . justice authorities said she no longer posed a threat to society . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we need proof that the german state is capable of mercy " gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : france 's next president : sarko vs. sego police , protesters battle after sarkozy win sarkozy favored as french elect new president conservative sarkozy is france 's next president as election nears , french duo fight to a draw in last debate politics -pipe- 22.04.2007 " this election is like a soccer cup tie match " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " forward france " : what works for soccer might just work for politics as well in an interview with dw-tv , franco-german daniel cohn-bendit , a leading politician for the greens in europe , talked about the french presidential election and the consequences for france and europe . born to german-jewish parents in france on april 4 , 1945 , daniel cohn-bendit was a leader of the french student protests of 1968 .
he joined the german greens party in 1984 and has been a member of the european parliament for the german and french greens in an alternating fashion since 1994 .
he is currently the co-president of the group european greens-european free alliance in the european parliament . dw-tv : daniel cohn-bendit , anyone observing the french presidential election campaign in the last few weeks could have been forgiven for thinking the winner will be the per son who can best sing the marseillaise . is patriotism the winner in this election ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit daniel cohn-bendit : well , it 's always like that during a presidential election in france .
the nearer you get to the ballot , the more french identity takes center stage .
but you 're right ; there has been some overstatement of the marseillaise and the french flag .
but that can be important when we 're not just talking about the french flag , but about what color is the hand holding it . does that mean france is moving more to the extreme right ? france is rightwing , that 's the reality .
or we might say it 's conservative , structurally conservative .
we saw that with the referendum on the european constitution .
you have to be aware that whoever wants to be president of france must also embody france , and that 's why it plays a role .
i do think the other issues are also important , though .
but i admit that i find this election is like a soccer cup tie match : somebody has to win and that means the result is what matters , but the game itself is rather boring . that means issues do n't play such an important role ? they change so quickly . no single issue is paramount . not even france 's decline or french fear of globalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters line up to cast their votes no , that would last a few days .
someone would then make one remark or another and it would become the main issue for four days .
but then social issues , the budget or europe would take over - it would take only a few days .
basically it 's really an election about personalities .
is sarkozy believable ?
is segolene royal as a woman capable ?
is bayrou able to create a majority ? they 're the central questions . according to the opinion polls we are looking at a three-way battle between segolene royal , francois bayrou and sarkozy .
or do you think that jean-marie le pen has a chance ? there are problems interpreting le pen 's ratings .
in the last election le pen got 17 percent of the vote .
a few days before that he had just 6 .
9 percent of voters who were prepared to say they would vote for him .
that 's the problem with the polls .
sarkozy 's strategy is to position himself so far to the right as possible so that le pen loses support . will he succeed ? until two weeks ago i would have said : yes .
but now when you look at the trend sarkozy is looking shaky and le pen once again has 15 or 16 percent .
if le pen does very well , then that would be a serious problem for sarkozy , because the biggest competition for votes is between sarkozy and le pen .
it would be a big surprise if sarkozy was not in the second round .
i do n't think it 's going to happen , though . so patriotism is playing such an important role that le pen could suddenly do very well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parisians wait to vote the problem is that sarkozy is polarizing the electorate to the right with very strange arguments .
he says that if a young person commits suicide , then genetic reasons are to blame .
paedophilia and homosexuality are also genetic .
sarkozy has made a big mistake there and even the church has distanced itself from him .
sarkozy is presenting very right-wing arguments .
he wants to create a ministry of immigration and national identity .
his arguments about culture are similar to those that were made in germany a few years ago .
this is all about taking votes away from le pen .
but it encourages people to move right because le pen has made it okay to discuss such things .
sarkozy has another very dangerous side : he says people should be proud of france , we 're not the ones who invented the final solution , we 're not the ones who invented genocide .
he 's alluding to anti-german sentiment that exists in certain conservative circles .
that 's very dangerous . if he wins , will he continue in that vein ? that 's the question : what will he do then ? germany and france are both in europe .
there 's a german-french relationship .
if sarkozy tries to play with that he 'll have problems later with people in the middle ground because they do n't want that .
the past history between the two countries is exactly that : it 's in the past .
there 's a new relationship with germany .
i think it 's very dangerous to throw that relationship back to 1945 .
it 's not only playing with french society and with europe 's future , it 's also endangering sarkozy 's acceptance by the french people . can segolene royal fill that gap ? well , i think that 's exactly the situation right now .
royal stands for renewal in the socialist party . she also instituted a change in generation . she embodies the new generation .
but she 's a woman and during the campaign people suddenly realized that when a woman makes a mistake it 's doubly worse .
there have been several examples during the campaign and people have questioned segolene royal 's ability to be president . has there suddenly been a sympathy-effect for royal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one thing 's for certain : chirac wo n't be france 's next president there has been , but in my opinion it was not enough .
i think that in the second round royal has the chance to achieve a bigger wave of support .
but only for a single reason as it is with most elections : which aversion is stronger ?
the anti-sarkozy or the anti-royal ? the election would be a choice between being anti-sarkozy and anti-royal .
it would be a battle between two camps .
one camp would be everybody who does n't want sarkozy and the other everybody who does n't want royal .
that will be crucial . what can europe expect from a president royal or president sarkozy ? if he 's elected , sarkozy will quite quickly take small steps in institutional reform , basically implementing the treaty of nice accept with some improvements .
i think segolene royal would be forced to bring content and institution together , meaning she would have to put more emphasis on social issues within europe .
as regards bayrou : it would lead to a center-left coalition , if royal wins .
bayrou is the most pro-european judging by his arguments and that 's why i think a center-left government would play a positive role in the constitutional process . alexander kudascheff interviewed daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sunshine and suspense bring france out to vote bright sunshine and high suspense saw voters across france pouring into polling booths sunday to take part in a nail-biting presidential election that kept the country guessing to the last .

torsten frings considers swapping bremen for turin and juventus the bundesliga is looking at a potential exodus of star names in the summer , with a number of players looking outside germany for prospective new employers as the current season draws to a close . germany midfielder torsten frings has met representatives of italian giants juventus to discuss a possible move from werder bremen to the italian giants , he said on tuesday .
frings was in turin monday with his wife , petra , and his adviser , norbert flippen , for talks with juventus sports director alessio secco and club official roberto bettega .
" i liked it there .
but that will not speed up my decision .
i will make up my mind over the next weeks , " he said .
" juve want me at all costs .
they do n't want me to be just another midfielder but ' the ' playmaker , " frings told the daily bild newspaper .
" i 'm thinking a lot about this idea . "
according to tuesday 's edition of turin 's la stampa daily , the issue mainly depends on frings ' wife , who allegedly is not thrilled about a move to the northern italian city .

they will now square off on may 6 as french voters elect the next head of state for the coming five years . centrist francois bayrou came in third , with about 18 percent , with right-wing extremist jean-marie le pen finishing a distant fourth , at around 11 percent . sarkozy 's new dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy supporters cheered on sunday sarkozy told cheering supporters of his center-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- that he wanted to rally the french people behind a " new dream . " france must now choose between two visions of society in the second round , sarkozy said . " by placing me in the lead and madame royal in second position , -lrb- voters -rrb- clearly marked their wish to have a definitive debate on two ideas of the nation , two projects of society , two value systems , " he said . advantage : sarkozy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy does n't have too worry too much , analysts say analyst said that sarkozy was now a clear favorite to be france 's next president . according to a telephone poll conducted after sarkozy and royal were declared winners , sarkozy would get 54 percent while royal would only get 46 percent of the vote on may 6 . " it 's clear there is a big advantage for sarkozy , " jean-philippe roy , a politics professor at tours university , told afp news service .
" the whole left-right balance in the country has shifted .
it is really a historic moment . " simple arithmetic works in sarkozy 's favor , others said . " what we have set up for round two is a clear right-left showdown , but it is a showdown which i find hard to see how the left can win , " said dominique moisi of the french institute for international affairs , according to afp .
" the left are clearly a minority in the country .
if you add right , far-right and half the center , sarkozy is in an extremely comfortable position .
his decision to court the far-right vote has clearly paid off . " although sarkozy has the lead , analysts agreed that the race is not yet won .
this is because of the deep mistrust with which the former interior minister is regarded by many voters - even by some who support his ideas . " we have today a political situation i have never seen : a man who is highly likely to be the next president but who provokes unprecedented levels of hatred and rejection , " said dominique reynie , professor at the paris school of political sciences . " this is the moment for sarkozy to start talking to the french people - not just to his own camp , " he added .
" he 's got to look like a president , which in france means someone who has the nation behind him .
from now on it 's not his policies , but his personality that 's the issue . " royal reaches out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal hopes to become france 's first female president speaking to her socialist party supporters in the small town of melle in western france , royal called for voters to rally round her for the presidential runoff , promising to bring france change without upheaval . " i call on all those who ... believe it is possible to reform france without brutalizing it , who want a triumph of human values over the stock market , who want an end to the painful rise of insecurity and precariousness , to come together , " she said .
" i reach out to all those who believe it is not only possible but urgent to break with a system that is no longer working " after a disastrous start to her campaign , royal 's result was impressive , as she is credited with about nine percent more of the vote than the socialist candidate in 2002 , lionel jospin , received . many voters certainly remembered the first round of the 2002 presidential election , when le pen caused a political earthquake by outpolling jospin to make it to the run-off . in 2002 , left-wing candidates other than jospin garnered an impressive 26.71 per cent of the vote , while the socialist received only 16.18 per cent . this year , three trotskyist candidates , the green party standard-bearer and anti-globalization activist jose bove picked up only about 11 percent of the vote .
record turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters came out in record numbers the memory of 2002 no doubt also contributed to a voter participation rate that was near an all-time high for a first-round election in postwar france , with an estimated 84.5 percent of the country 's 44.5 million registered voters casting their ballots on sunday . the previous record was 84.75 percent , set in 1965 . five years ago , only 71.6 percent of registered voters went to the polls in the first round . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " this election is like a soccer cup tie match " in an interview with dw-tv , franco-german daniel cohn-bendit , a leading politician for the greens in europe , talked about the french presidential election and the consequences for france and europe .

the club will be modeled on highly exclusive establishments found in london 's soho and new york 's manhattan districts , where entrance is restricted to club members and specially invited guests only , and membership costs around 900 euros -lrb- $ 1,224 -rrb- annually .
the publicity-shy british investor has commissioned the jsk architectural bureau in berlin to carry out renovations on the downtrodden berlin building , which remains a listed property and is located near the former communist palace of the republic , which is now being demolished .
department store turned party hq the building 's history in prenzlauer berg dates back to 1928-29 when jewish business partners hermann golluber and hugo halle invested their life savings in a department store in lothringerstrasse , now renamed torstrasse , where customers could purchase goods on credit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis forced all jews out of business but its history was chequered from the start .
within a few years , its two owners were to be robbed of their premises by the nazis , and forced to flee the country .
golluber found refuge in america .
" aryanized , " by the new " german " owners , the building was later sold to the regime , which turned it into a nazi party youth headquarters from 1942 .
the german youth leadership , or reichsjugendfuerhrung , supervised leisure activities of 9 million members of the hitler youth from there .
then , in the early postwar years , the building became the " haus der einheit , " or house of unity , and served as the seat of the east german communist party from 1946-56 .
two powerful communist party leaders , wilhelm pieck and otto grotowohl worked there .
the street also renamed wilhem pieck strasse .
later , the building housed the east german communist party archives , and the central committee 's historical institute .
but that chapter ended in late 1989 when the berlin wall fell , and the east german communist party itself was confined to history 's rubbish bin a few months later .
years of neglect for the past 12 years the building , within sight of the city 's soaring tv tower on alexanderplatz , has lain empty and was steadily decaying ; its interior walls peeling , parquet floor rotting and electrical installations destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around alexanderplatz has undergone huge changes since the wall went down after the city 's reunification , it was legally returned to the jewish family descendants of the original owners , scattered across the world , who finally managed to sell the property to a british investor .
earlier in the week , rainer eppelmann , a former fierce opponent of the east german communist regime , together with andre schmitz , a berlin government -lrb- culture -rrb- state secretary , unveiled a stele outside the " haus der einheit . "
texts written in four languages and exhibited behind a sealed glass panel explain the building 's turbulent , near 80-year-old history .
" remembrance needs location , but remembrance also needs knowledge and recognition , " said eppelmann , when noting that there were today few survivors remaining to tell of the building 's convulsive past .
" if houses could relate history , this one would have enough for a complete novel , " smitz said .
converting the property into the soho house media club is expected to take 16 months , and it is expected to open sometime in 2008 .
guenter p.j. buerk , one of jsk 's partners in berlin , says the british investor 's " club-hotel " project aims to create an exclusive meeting place for artists and top media representatives from around the world . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lured by property bargains , foreign investors flock to berlin drawn by some of the lowest property prices in europe and signs of an economic revival in germany , foreign investors are rushing to berlin to get a piece of the hot real estate market .

they will now square off on may 6 as french voters elect the next head of state for the coming five years . centrist francois bayrou came in third , with about 18 percent , with right-wing extremist jean-marie le pen finishing a distant fourth , at around 11 percent . sarkozy 's new dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy supporters cheered on sunday sarkozy told cheering supporters of his center-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- that he wanted to rally the french people behind a " new dream .

" it 's clear there is a big advantage for sarkozy , " jean-philippe roy , a politics professor at tours university , told afp news service .
" the whole left-right balance in the country has shifted .
it is really a historic moment . " simple arithmetic works in sarkozy 's favor , others said . " what we have set up for round two is a clear right-left showdown , but it is a showdown which i find hard to see how the left can win , " said dominique moisi of the french institute for international affairs , according to afp .
" the left are clearly a minority in the country .
if you add right , far-right and half the center , sarkozy is in an extremely comfortable position .
his decision to court the far-right vote has clearly paid off . " although sarkozy has the lead , analysts agreed that the race is not yet won .
this is because of the deep mistrust with which the former interior minister is regarded by many voters - even by some who support his ideas . " we have today a political situation i have never seen : a man who is highly likely to be the next president but who provokes unprecedented levels of hatred and rejection , " said dominique reynie , professor at the paris school of political sciences . " this is the moment for sarkozy to start talking to the french people - not just to his own camp , " he added .

" i call on all those who ... believe it is possible to reform france without brutalizing it , who want a triumph of human values over the stock market , who want an end to the painful rise of insecurity and precariousness , to come together , " she said .
" i reach out to all those who believe it is not only possible but urgent to break with a system that is no longer working " after a disastrous start to her campaign , royal 's result was impressive , as she is credited with about nine percent more of the vote than the socialist candidate in 2002 , lionel jospin , received . many voters certainly remembered the first round of the 2002 presidential election , when le pen caused a political earthquake by outpolling jospin to make it to the run-off . in 2002 , left-wing candidates other than jospin garnered an impressive 26.71 per cent of the vote , while the socialist received only 16.18 per cent . this year , three trotskyist candidates , the green party standard-bearer and anti-globalization activist jose bove picked up only about 11 percent of the vote .

but the polls also say that about a third of the 45 million voters are undecided , with many indicating they would only make up their minds in the hours before heading for the polling station .
that has given hope to centrist francois bayrou and far-right leader jean-marie le pen that they can sneak past socialist segolene royal who has been second behind sarkozy in months of polls leading up to the vote .
no one in the french political establishment has forgotten le pen 's stunning feat in 2002 when he beat the socialist candidate lionel jospin in the first round to reach the runoff .
confusion reins analysts say the months of campaigning by sarkozy , royal , bayrou , le pen and their rival trotskyist , ecologist and nationalist candidates has left the public more confused than decisive .
there is also a greater awareness of tactical voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question is who will join sarkozy for the second round there has been much talk of some left wingers voting for bayrou instead of royal in a bid to have a better chance of stopping sarkozy in the second round .
could a protest vote for ecologist dominique voynet in the first round help le pen reach the runoff again , some wonder .
jerome perani , a 37-year-old marketing executive for a paris technology firm who voted socialist in 2002 , said he was considering voting bayrou this time as a " purely tactical choice - almost like game theory . "
the authoritative le monde newspaper summed up the dilemma facing the french : " many voters are not wondering who they should vote for sunday , but how : with their heart or their head ? "
one recent survey said that only 43 percent of voters considered that the campaign had helped them .
fifty-nine percent said they thought the campaign had been of poor standard .
many polls have indicated that the public has been turned off by the reliance on personal attacks rather than political debate by the rival candidates .
country in crisis all the candidates say france is a country in crisis , social and economic , but no one platform has grabbed the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen has been good for surprises in the past " no candidate has managed to impress with durable themes , " said roland cayrol of the polling organization bva .
cayrol highlighted how the socialist francois mitterrand won an emphatic victory in 1981 because of widespread fears about employment .
in 2002 , insecurity was a key topic after a series of murders and other crimes .
cayrol said that french voters had wanted a debate before the first round to help them make up their minds .

german officials on sunday called for reopening the probe of the 1977 murder of a federal prosecutor after a former leftist radical stepped forward to say a man serving time was not involved . the news weekly der spiegel reported in an issue to be published monday that it had evidence which allegedly showed that an ex-member of the red army faction guerrilla group , stefan wisniewski , had shot and killed chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback . the murder , which was never solved , had long been blamed in part on fellow raf radical christian klar , who recently lodged a plea for clemency with president horst köhler after more than 24 years in prison . klar was arrested in 1982 and jailed for his role in multiple murders .
his sentence stipulates that he will not be eligible for parole until 2009 , unless he is pardoned first . buback became the first victim of a bloody era dubbed the " german autumn " of 1977 when he was shot in his mercedes car by a raf gunman on a motorcycle in the southwestern city of karlsruhe . old news for german officials ? der spiegel reported that former raf member verena becker had told german authorities in the early 1980s that wisniewski had slain buback , and it quoted another raf militant , peter-jürgen boock , as now confirming that claim . they said klar had merely driven the get-away car . wisniewski was released in 1999 after 21 years in prison for other raf murders .

german officials on sunday called for reopening the probe of the 1977 murder of a federal prosecutor after a former leftist radical stepped forward to say a man serving time was not involved . the news weekly der spiegel reported in an issue to be published monday that it had evidence which allegedly showed that an ex-member of the red army faction guerrilla group , stefan wisniewski , had shot and killed chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback . the murder , which was never solved , had long been blamed in part on fellow raf radical christian klar , who recently lodged a plea for clemency with president horst köhler after more than 24 years in prison . klar was arrested in 1982 and jailed for his role in multiple murders .
his sentence stipulates that he will not be eligible for parole until 2009 , unless he is pardoned first . buback became the first victim of a bloody era dubbed the " german autumn " of 1977 when he was shot in his mercedes car by a raf gunman on a motorcycle in the southwestern city of karlsruhe . old news for german officials ? der spiegel reported that former raf member verena becker had told german authorities in the early 1980s that wisniewski had slain buback , and it quoted another raf militant , peter-jürgen boock , as now confirming that claim . they said klar had merely driven the get-away car . wisniewski was released in 1999 after 21 years in prison for other raf murders .

in germany murder is not subject to a statute of limitations . unforgivable oversight ? former interior minister gerhard baum of the opposition free democrats led a chorus at the weekend calling for the case to be reopened , adding that if prosecutors ignored exculpatory evidence in the 1980s it would be " an oversight that would be difficult to forgive .

but the polls also say that about a third of the 45 million voters are undecided , with many indicating they would only make up their minds in the hours before heading for the polling station .
that has given hope to centrist francois bayrou and far-right leader jean-marie le pen that they can sneak past socialist segolene royal who has been second behind sarkozy in months of polls leading up to the vote .
no one in the french political establishment has forgotten le pen 's stunning feat in 2002 when he beat the socialist candidate lionel jospin in the first round to reach the runoff .
confusion reins analysts say the months of campaigning by sarkozy , royal , bayrou , le pen and their rival trotskyist , ecologist and nationalist candidates has left the public more confused than decisive .
there is also a greater awareness of tactical voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question is who will join sarkozy for the second round there has been much talk of some left wingers voting for bayrou instead of royal in a bid to have a better chance of stopping sarkozy in the second round .
could a protest vote for ecologist dominique voynet in the first round help le pen reach the runoff again , some wonder .
jerome perani , a 37-year-old marketing executive for a paris technology firm who voted socialist in 2002 , said he was considering voting bayrou this time as a " purely tactical choice - almost like game theory . "
the authoritative le monde newspaper summed up the dilemma facing the french : " many voters are not wondering who they should vote for sunday , but how : with their heart or their head ? "
one recent survey said that only 43 percent of voters considered that the campaign had helped them .
fifty-nine percent said they thought the campaign had been of poor standard .
many polls have indicated that the public has been turned off by the reliance on personal attacks rather than political debate by the rival candidates .
country in crisis all the candidates say france is a country in crisis , social and economic , but no one platform has grabbed the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen has been good for surprises in the past " no candidate has managed to impress with durable themes , " said roland cayrol of the polling organization bva .
cayrol highlighted how the socialist francois mitterrand won an emphatic victory in 1981 because of widespread fears about employment .
in 2002 , insecurity was a key topic after a series of murders and other crimes .
cayrol said that french voters had wanted a debate before the first round to help them make up their minds .

he joined the german greens party in 1984 and has been a member of the european parliament for the german and french greens in an alternating fashion since 1994 .
he is currently the co-president of the group european greens-european free alliance in the european parliament . dw-tv : daniel cohn-bendit , anyone observing the french presidential election campaign in the last few weeks could have been forgiven for thinking the winner will be the per son who can best sing the marseillaise . is patriotism the winner in this election ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit daniel cohn-bendit : well , it 's always like that during a presidential election in france .
the nearer you get to the ballot , the more french identity takes center stage .
but you 're right ; there has been some overstatement of the marseillaise and the french flag .
but that can be important when we 're not just talking about the french flag , but about what color is the hand holding it . does that mean france is moving more to the extreme right ? france is rightwing , that 's the reality .
or we might say it 's conservative , structurally conservative .
we saw that with the referendum on the european constitution .
you have to be aware that whoever wants to be president of france must also embody france , and that 's why it plays a role .
i do think the other issues are also important , though .
but i admit that i find this election is like a soccer cup tie match : somebody has to win and that means the result is what matters , but the game itself is rather boring . that means issues do n't play such an important role ? they change so quickly . no single issue is paramount . not even france 's decline or french fear of globalization ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters line up to cast their votes no , that would last a few days .
someone would then make one remark or another and it would become the main issue for four days .
but then social issues , the budget or europe would take over - it would take only a few days .
basically it 's really an election about personalities .
is sarkozy believable ?
is segolene royal as a woman capable ?
is bayrou able to create a majority ? they 're the central questions . according to the opinion polls we are looking at a three-way battle between segolene royal , francois bayrou and sarkozy .
or do you think that jean-marie le pen has a chance ? there are problems interpreting le pen 's ratings .
in the last election le pen got 17 percent of the vote .
a few days before that he had just 6 .
9 percent of voters who were prepared to say they would vote for him .
that 's the problem with the polls .
sarkozy 's strategy is to position himself so far to the right as possible so that le pen loses support . will he succeed ? until two weeks ago i would have said : yes .
but now when you look at the trend sarkozy is looking shaky and le pen once again has 15 or 16 percent .
if le pen does very well , then that would be a serious problem for sarkozy , because the biggest competition for votes is between sarkozy and le pen .
it would be a big surprise if sarkozy was not in the second round .
i do n't think it 's going to happen , though . so patriotism is playing such an important role that le pen could suddenly do very well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parisians wait to vote the problem is that sarkozy is polarizing the electorate to the right with very strange arguments .
he says that if a young person commits suicide , then genetic reasons are to blame .
paedophilia and homosexuality are also genetic .
sarkozy has made a big mistake there and even the church has distanced itself from him .
sarkozy is presenting very right-wing arguments .
he wants to create a ministry of immigration and national identity .
his arguments about culture are similar to those that were made in germany a few years ago .
this is all about taking votes away from le pen .
but it encourages people to move right because le pen has made it okay to discuss such things .
sarkozy has another very dangerous side : he says people should be proud of france , we 're not the ones who invented the final solution , we 're not the ones who invented genocide .
he 's alluding to anti-german sentiment that exists in certain conservative circles .
that 's very dangerous . if he wins , will he continue in that vein ? that 's the question : what will he do then ? germany and france are both in europe .
there 's a german-french relationship .
if sarkozy tries to play with that he 'll have problems later with people in the middle ground because they do n't want that .
the past history between the two countries is exactly that : it 's in the past .
there 's a new relationship with germany .
i think it 's very dangerous to throw that relationship back to 1945 .
it 's not only playing with french society and with europe 's future , it 's also endangering sarkozy 's acceptance by the french people . can segolene royal fill that gap ? well , i think that 's exactly the situation right now .
royal stands for renewal in the socialist party . she also instituted a change in generation . she embodies the new generation .
but she 's a woman and during the campaign people suddenly realized that when a woman makes a mistake it 's doubly worse .
there have been several examples during the campaign and people have questioned segolene royal 's ability to be president . has there suddenly been a sympathy-effect for royal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one thing 's for certain : chirac wo n't be france 's next president there has been , but in my opinion it was not enough .
i think that in the second round royal has the chance to achieve a bigger wave of support .
but only for a single reason as it is with most elections : which aversion is stronger ?
the anti-sarkozy or the anti-royal ? the election would be a choice between being anti-sarkozy and anti-royal .
it would be a battle between two camps .
one camp would be everybody who does n't want sarkozy and the other everybody who does n't want royal .
that will be crucial . what can europe expect from a president royal or president sarkozy ? if he 's elected , sarkozy will quite quickly take small steps in institutional reform , basically implementing the treaty of nice accept with some improvements .
i think segolene royal would be forced to bring content and institution together , meaning she would have to put more emphasis on social issues within europe .
as regards bayrou : it would lead to a center-left coalition , if royal wins .
bayrou is the most pro-european judging by his arguments and that 's why i think a center-left government would play a positive role in the constitutional process . alexander kudascheff interviewed daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sunshine and suspense bring france out to vote bright sunshine and high suspense saw voters across france pouring into polling booths sunday to take part in a nail-biting presidential election that kept the country guessing to the last .

torsten frings considers swapping bremen for turin and juventus the bundesliga is looking at a potential exodus of star names in the summer , with a number of players looking outside germany for prospective new employers as the current season draws to a close . germany midfielder torsten frings has met representatives of italian giants juventus to discuss a possible move from werder bremen to the italian giants , he said on tuesday .
frings was in turin monday with his wife , petra , and his adviser , norbert flippen , for talks with juventus sports director alessio secco and club official roberto bettega .
" i liked it there .
but that will not speed up my decision .
i will make up my mind over the next weeks , " he said .
" juve want me at all costs .
they do n't want me to be just another midfielder but ' the ' playmaker , " frings told the daily bild newspaper .
" i 'm thinking a lot about this idea . "
according to tuesday 's edition of turin 's la stampa daily , the issue mainly depends on frings ' wife , who allegedly is not thrilled about a move to the northern italian city .
but german reports also say werder would want considerably more than the roughly 8 million euros -lrb- $ 10.8 million -rrb- juve are said to be offering for frings before agreeing to any move .
secco is said to be preparing a trip to bremen next week for negotiations with werder , the 2004 german league and cup champions .
juve want frings to run midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings ' combative style will fit well in serie a the turin club are keen on signing the germany international this summer as they prepare for a return to serie a for forced demotion for the current season over a match-fixing scheme .
they have already signed a bundesliga player in bosnian midfielder hasan salihamidzic from bayern munich and are reportedly also interested in frings ' bremen teammate miroslav klose , the 2006 world cup top scorer .
although frings , 30 , still has two more years on his contract at bremen , he said at the weekend he was considering the approach from juventus but " wo n't be put under any pressure . "
klose has a deal in bremen until 2008 .
werder coach thomas schaaf said it was " legitimate " for frings to consider the offer , with italian reports saying the player could double his salary at juventus .
" if he has the feeling that he absolutely has to try something new then we will speak to him about the situation , " schaaf said .
" but the fact is that the conditions -lrb- for a move -rrb- have to be in place .
both miro -lrb- klose -rrb- and torsten still have a contract with us . "
werder bremen sporting director klaus allofs said he was surprised by the news .
" we 're not going to put ourselves under pressure .
if torsten no longer wants to play for werder i 'm not going to force him , " said allofs .
" we have in the past always succeeded in finding new talent .
we 're not dependant on one player , werder is more important than any player . "
however , losing both frings and klose would shear werder of two of their most established and world class players .
hot-shot klose the must-have striker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has a number of top clubs monitoring his situation klose has been making noises of a possible move abroad for the best part of six months with his current deal at bremen coming up for renewal .
he is under contract with the german title challengers until next year but had previously told them he would have come to a decision by the beginning of 2007 .
" miro thought he would have decided by now .
he says himself that it 's a difficult decision to take , " said agent alexander schutt .
news that the 28-year-old germany striker is looking to pastures new has put a number of europe 's big clubs on alert with manchester united and barcelona keeping tabs on his situation , while werder 's great rivals bayern munich are said to be considering making an offer which could tempt the polish-born forward to stay in the bundesliga .
after losing out on fiorentina ’ s world cup-winning hit-man , luca toni , bayern would gladly redirect the funds to their northern foes if it meant securing another of europe 's hottest strikers .
hargreaves ' move to manchester back on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hargreaves could be wearing a different red kit next season the financial outlay for klose would also be eased if bayern allow the exit of another star name - owen hargreaves .
hargreaves has been a manchester united target since last summer and remains on sir alex ferguson 's wish list for the new season .
while the bayern hierarchy were less than willing to sell the england international earlier this season , the elimination form the champions league has seemingly changed their minds .
" if we really get an offer of 25 or 30 million euros for hargreaves i would think about it very seriously , " club president franz beckenbauer told premiere tv in germany after the bavarians crashed out to ac milan last week . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern search for replacements as departures draw near the season is only half-way through and yet a number of bayern munich 's midfielders are looking for new clubs .

german officials on sunday called for reopening the probe of the 1977 murder of a federal prosecutor after a former leftist radical stepped forward to say a man serving time was not involved . the news weekly der spiegel reported in an issue to be published monday that it had evidence which allegedly showed that an ex-member of the red army faction guerrilla group , stefan wisniewski , had shot and killed chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback . the murder , which was never solved , had long been blamed in part on fellow raf radical christian klar , who recently lodged a plea for clemency with president horst köhler after more than 24 years in prison . klar was arrested in 1982 and jailed for his role in multiple murders .
his sentence stipulates that he will not be eligible for parole until 2009 , unless he is pardoned first . buback became the first victim of a bloody era dubbed the " german autumn " of 1977 when he was shot in his mercedes car by a raf gunman on a motorcycle in the southwestern city of karlsruhe . old news for german officials ? der spiegel reported that former raf member verena becker had told german authorities in the early 1980s that wisniewski had slain buback , and it quoted another raf militant , peter-jürgen boock , as now confirming that claim . they said klar had merely driven the get-away car . wisniewski was released in 1999 after 21 years in prison for other raf murders .
germany 's süddeutsche zeitung meanwhile reported that there was no evidence linking wisniewski to the buback murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael buback earlier this month , buback 's son michael gave his support to klar 's plea for clemency after receiving what he called credible information from anonymous sources connected to the now-disbanded group that klar was not involved in killing . michael buback told the welt am sonntag newspaper that he had now been called as a witness in the case by federal prosecutors .
in germany murder is not subject to a statute of limitations . unforgivable oversight ? former interior minister gerhard baum of the opposition free democrats led a chorus at the weekend calling for the case to be reopened , adding that if prosecutors ignored exculpatory evidence in the 1980s it would be " an oversight that would be difficult to forgive . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf still killed people in the late 1980s the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang after its founders andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , mounted a violent campaign against what it considered was the oppressive capitalist state of west germany from 1977 to 1982 . it targeted the german elite and the us military bases in germany and is suspected of killing 34 people .
the group officially disbanded in 1998 . brigitte mohnhaupt , who led the raf with klar after the group 's original leaders committed suicide in jail , was released from prison in march after serving 24 years for her role in nine murders , including buback 's . justice authorities said she no longer posed a threat to society . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we need proof that the german state is capable of mercy " gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison .

at the saint-charles primary school in marseille , long queues formed from early morning for the curtained-off ballot booths in a room festooned with children 's drawings .

fabian ernst was denied by goalkeeper tomislav piplica , and schalke then called in vain for a penalty late in the first half when dario rodriguez appeared to have been brought down .
rost almost scored for cottbus in the 53rd when his intended cross hit the crossbar , and his bad luck was complete when he tapped hamit altintop 's cross into his own net seven minutes later for schalke 's lead .
schalke remained on course towards their first title in 49 years when bordon 's header for 2-0 in the 64th assured them of victory .

the club will be modeled on highly exclusive establishments found in london 's soho and new york 's manhattan districts , where entrance is restricted to club members and specially invited guests only , and membership costs around 900 euros -lrb- $ 1,224 -rrb- annually .
the publicity-shy british investor has commissioned the jsk architectural bureau in berlin to carry out renovations on the downtrodden berlin building , which remains a listed property and is located near the former communist palace of the republic , which is now being demolished .
department store turned party hq the building 's history in prenzlauer berg dates back to 1928-29 when jewish business partners hermann golluber and hugo halle invested their life savings in a department store in lothringerstrasse , now renamed torstrasse , where customers could purchase goods on credit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis forced all jews out of business but its history was chequered from the start .
within a few years , its two owners were to be robbed of their premises by the nazis , and forced to flee the country .
golluber found refuge in america .
" aryanized , " by the new " german " owners , the building was later sold to the regime , which turned it into a nazi party youth headquarters from 1942 .
the german youth leadership , or reichsjugendfuerhrung , supervised leisure activities of 9 million members of the hitler youth from there .
then , in the early postwar years , the building became the " haus der einheit , " or house of unity , and served as the seat of the east german communist party from 1946-56 .
two powerful communist party leaders , wilhelm pieck and otto grotowohl worked there .
the street also renamed wilhem pieck strasse .
later , the building housed the east german communist party archives , and the central committee 's historical institute .
but that chapter ended in late 1989 when the berlin wall fell , and the east german communist party itself was confined to history 's rubbish bin a few months later .
years of neglect for the past 12 years the building , within sight of the city 's soaring tv tower on alexanderplatz , has lain empty and was steadily decaying ; its interior walls peeling , parquet floor rotting and electrical installations destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around alexanderplatz has undergone huge changes since the wall went down after the city 's reunification , it was legally returned to the jewish family descendants of the original owners , scattered across the world , who finally managed to sell the property to a british investor .
earlier in the week , rainer eppelmann , a former fierce opponent of the east german communist regime , together with andre schmitz , a berlin government -lrb- culture -rrb- state secretary , unveiled a stele outside the " haus der einheit . "
texts written in four languages and exhibited behind a sealed glass panel explain the building 's turbulent , near 80-year-old history .
" remembrance needs location , but remembrance also needs knowledge and recognition , " said eppelmann , when noting that there were today few survivors remaining to tell of the building 's convulsive past .
" if houses could relate history , this one would have enough for a complete novel , " smitz said .
converting the property into the soho house media club is expected to take 16 months , and it is expected to open sometime in 2008 .

other voters also acknowledged being galvanized by the result in 2002 , like nurse brigitte cuvelliez , 49 , who cast her ballot in the central city of lyon for the first time since 1988 .
cuvelliez was one of the estimated one-third of french voters who , despite months of frenzied campaigning , only decided who to back at the last moment .

they will now square off on may 6 as french voters elect the next head of state for the coming five years . centrist francois bayrou came in third , with about 18 percent , with right-wing extremist jean-marie le pen finishing a distant fourth , at around 11 percent . sarkozy 's new dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy supporters cheered on sunday sarkozy told cheering supporters of his center-right union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- that he wanted to rally the french people behind a " new dream . " france must now choose between two visions of society in the second round , sarkozy said . " by placing me in the lead and madame royal in second position , -lrb- voters -rrb- clearly marked their wish to have a definitive debate on two ideas of the nation , two projects of society , two value systems , " he said . advantage : sarkozy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy does n't have too worry too much , analysts say analyst said that sarkozy was now a clear favorite to be france 's next president . according to a telephone poll conducted after sarkozy and royal were declared winners , sarkozy would get 54 percent while royal would only get 46 percent of the vote on may 6 . " it 's clear there is a big advantage for sarkozy , " jean-philippe roy , a politics professor at tours university , told afp news service .
" the whole left-right balance in the country has shifted .
it is really a historic moment . " simple arithmetic works in sarkozy 's favor , others said . " what we have set up for round two is a clear right-left showdown , but it is a showdown which i find hard to see how the left can win , " said dominique moisi of the french institute for international affairs , according to afp .
" the left are clearly a minority in the country .
if you add right , far-right and half the center , sarkozy is in an extremely comfortable position .
his decision to court the far-right vote has clearly paid off . " although sarkozy has the lead , analysts agreed that the race is not yet won .
this is because of the deep mistrust with which the former interior minister is regarded by many voters - even by some who support his ideas . " we have today a political situation i have never seen : a man who is highly likely to be the next president but who provokes unprecedented levels of hatred and rejection , " said dominique reynie , professor at the paris school of political sciences . " this is the moment for sarkozy to start talking to the french people - not just to his own camp , " he added .
" he 's got to look like a president , which in france means someone who has the nation behind him .
from now on it 's not his policies , but his personality that 's the issue . " royal reaches out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal hopes to become france 's first female president speaking to her socialist party supporters in the small town of melle in western france , royal called for voters to rally round her for the presidential runoff , promising to bring france change without upheaval . " i call on all those who ... believe it is possible to reform france without brutalizing it , who want a triumph of human values over the stock market , who want an end to the painful rise of insecurity and precariousness , to come together , " she said .
" i reach out to all those who believe it is not only possible but urgent to break with a system that is no longer working " after a disastrous start to her campaign , royal 's result was impressive , as she is credited with about nine percent more of the vote than the socialist candidate in 2002 , lionel jospin , received . many voters certainly remembered the first round of the 2002 presidential election , when le pen caused a political earthquake by outpolling jospin to make it to the run-off . in 2002 , left-wing candidates other than jospin garnered an impressive 26.71 per cent of the vote , while the socialist received only 16.18 per cent . this year , three trotskyist candidates , the green party standard-bearer and anti-globalization activist jose bove picked up only about 11 percent of the vote .
record turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters came out in record numbers the memory of 2002 no doubt also contributed to a voter participation rate that was near an all-time high for a first-round election in postwar france , with an estimated 84.5 percent of the country 's 44.5 million registered voters casting their ballots on sunday . the previous record was 84.75 percent , set in 1965 . five years ago , only 71.6 percent of registered voters went to the polls in the first round . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " this election is like a soccer cup tie match " in an interview with dw-tv , franco-german daniel cohn-bendit , a leading politician for the greens in europe , talked about the french presidential election and the consequences for france and europe .

the club will be modeled on highly exclusive establishments found in london 's soho and new york 's manhattan districts , where entrance is restricted to club members and specially invited guests only , and membership costs around 900 euros -lrb- $ 1,224 -rrb- annually .
the publicity-shy british investor has commissioned the jsk architectural bureau in berlin to carry out renovations on the downtrodden berlin building , which remains a listed property and is located near the former communist palace of the republic , which is now being demolished .

german officials on sunday called for reopening the probe of the 1977 murder of a federal prosecutor after a former leftist radical stepped forward to say a man serving time was not involved . the news weekly der spiegel reported in an issue to be published monday that it had evidence which allegedly showed that an ex-member of the red army faction guerrilla group , stefan wisniewski , had shot and killed chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback . the murder , which was never solved , had long been blamed in part on fellow raf radical christian klar , who recently lodged a plea for clemency with president horst köhler after more than 24 years in prison . klar was arrested in 1982 and jailed for his role in multiple murders .
his sentence stipulates that he will not be eligible for parole until 2009 , unless he is pardoned first . buback became the first victim of a bloody era dubbed the " german autumn " of 1977 when he was shot in his mercedes car by a raf gunman on a motorcycle in the southwestern city of karlsruhe . old news for german officials ? der spiegel reported that former raf member verena becker had told german authorities in the early 1980s that wisniewski had slain buback , and it quoted another raf militant , peter-jürgen boock , as now confirming that claim . they said klar had merely driven the get-away car . wisniewski was released in 1999 after 21 years in prison for other raf murders .
germany 's süddeutsche zeitung meanwhile reported that there was no evidence linking wisniewski to the buback murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael buback earlier this month , buback 's son michael gave his support to klar 's plea for clemency after receiving what he called credible information from anonymous sources connected to the now-disbanded group that klar was not involved in killing . michael buback told the welt am sonntag newspaper that he had now been called as a witness in the case by federal prosecutors .
in germany murder is not subject to a statute of limitations . unforgivable oversight ? former interior minister gerhard baum of the opposition free democrats led a chorus at the weekend calling for the case to be reopened , adding that if prosecutors ignored exculpatory evidence in the 1980s it would be " an oversight that would be difficult to forgive . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf still killed people in the late 1980s the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang after its founders andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , mounted a violent campaign against what it considered was the oppressive capitalist state of west germany from 1977 to 1982 . it targeted the german elite and the us military bases in germany and is suspected of killing 34 people .
the group officially disbanded in 1998 . brigitte mohnhaupt , who led the raf with klar after the group 's original leaders committed suicide in jail , was released from prison in march after serving 24 years for her role in nine murders , including buback 's . justice authorities said she no longer posed a threat to society . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we need proof that the german state is capable of mercy " gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison .

german officials on sunday called for reopening the probe of the 1977 murder of a federal prosecutor after a former leftist radical stepped forward to say a man serving time was not involved . the news weekly der spiegel reported in an issue to be published monday that it had evidence which allegedly showed that an ex-member of the red army faction guerrilla group , stefan wisniewski , had shot and killed chief federal prosecutor siegfried buback . the murder , which was never solved , had long been blamed in part on fellow raf radical christian klar , who recently lodged a plea for clemency with president horst köhler after more than 24 years in prison . klar was arrested in 1982 and jailed for his role in multiple murders .
his sentence stipulates that he will not be eligible for parole until 2009 , unless he is pardoned first . buback became the first victim of a bloody era dubbed the " german autumn " of 1977 when he was shot in his mercedes car by a raf gunman on a motorcycle in the southwestern city of karlsruhe . old news for german officials ? der spiegel reported that former raf member verena becker had told german authorities in the early 1980s that wisniewski had slain buback , and it quoted another raf militant , peter-jürgen boock , as now confirming that claim . they said klar had merely driven the get-away car . wisniewski was released in 1999 after 21 years in prison for other raf murders .
germany 's süddeutsche zeitung meanwhile reported that there was no evidence linking wisniewski to the buback murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael buback earlier this month , buback 's son michael gave his support to klar 's plea for clemency after receiving what he called credible information from anonymous sources connected to the now-disbanded group that klar was not involved in killing . michael buback told the welt am sonntag newspaper that he had now been called as a witness in the case by federal prosecutors .
in germany murder is not subject to a statute of limitations . unforgivable oversight ? former interior minister gerhard baum of the opposition free democrats led a chorus at the weekend calling for the case to be reopened , adding that if prosecutors ignored exculpatory evidence in the 1980s it would be " an oversight that would be difficult to forgive . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf still killed people in the late 1980s the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang after its founders andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , mounted a violent campaign against what it considered was the oppressive capitalist state of west germany from 1977 to 1982 . it targeted the german elite and the us military bases in germany and is suspected of killing 34 people .
the group officially disbanded in 1998 . brigitte mohnhaupt , who led the raf with klar after the group 's original leaders committed suicide in jail , was released from prison in march after serving 24 years for her role in nine murders , including buback 's . justice authorities said she no longer posed a threat to society . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we need proof that the german state is capable of mercy " gerhart baum , interior minister during the height of left-wing terror group raf 's bloody campaign , spoke with dw-world.de about why two former terrorists should be released from prison .
-lrb- 02.02.2007 -rrb- victim 's son backs clemency plea for german ex-terrorist the son of a victim of germany 's notorious red army faction terrorists has given his support to a plea for clemency lodged by one of the group 's jailed leaders .
-lrb- 18.04.2007 -rrb- germany remembers bloodiest year of left-wing terrorism past germany saturday marks the 30th anniversary of the raf killing of federal prosecutor buback , sparking the worst year of left-wing terror in west german history .

but the polls also say that about a third of the 45 million voters are undecided , with many indicating they would only make up their minds in the hours before heading for the polling station .
that has given hope to centrist francois bayrou and far-right leader jean-marie le pen that they can sneak past socialist segolene royal who has been second behind sarkozy in months of polls leading up to the vote .
no one in the french political establishment has forgotten le pen 's stunning feat in 2002 when he beat the socialist candidate lionel jospin in the first round to reach the runoff .
confusion reins analysts say the months of campaigning by sarkozy , royal , bayrou , le pen and their rival trotskyist , ecologist and nationalist candidates has left the public more confused than decisive .
there is also a greater awareness of tactical voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question is who will join sarkozy for the second round there has been much talk of some left wingers voting for bayrou instead of royal in a bid to have a better chance of stopping sarkozy in the second round .
could a protest vote for ecologist dominique voynet in the first round help le pen reach the runoff again , some wonder .
jerome perani , a 37-year-old marketing executive for a paris technology firm who voted socialist in 2002 , said he was considering voting bayrou this time as a " purely tactical choice - almost like game theory . "
the authoritative le monde newspaper summed up the dilemma facing the french : " many voters are not wondering who they should vote for sunday , but how : with their heart or their head ? "
one recent survey said that only 43 percent of voters considered that the campaign had helped them .
fifty-nine percent said they thought the campaign had been of poor standard .
many polls have indicated that the public has been turned off by the reliance on personal attacks rather than political debate by the rival candidates .
country in crisis all the candidates say france is a country in crisis , social and economic , but no one platform has grabbed the public .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen has been good for surprises in the past " no candidate has managed to impress with durable themes , " said roland cayrol of the polling organization bva .
cayrol highlighted how the socialist francois mitterrand won an emphatic victory in 1981 because of widespread fears about employment .
in 2002 , insecurity was a key topic after a series of murders and other crimes .
cayrol said that french voters had wanted a debate before the first round to help them make up their minds .
now they are frustrated because it did not happen , though the political fireworks could still come in the next two weeks between the finalists in the presidential battle . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france 's next president : sarko vs. sego dw-world.de reviews the candidates and issues that drove the french presidential campaign ahead of sunday 's vote .

the club will be modeled on highly exclusive establishments found in london 's soho and new york 's manhattan districts , where entrance is restricted to club members and specially invited guests only , and membership costs around 900 euros -lrb- $ 1,224 -rrb- annually .
the publicity-shy british investor has commissioned the jsk architectural bureau in berlin to carry out renovations on the downtrodden berlin building , which remains a listed property and is located near the former communist palace of the republic , which is now being demolished .
department store turned party hq the building 's history in prenzlauer berg dates back to 1928-29 when jewish business partners hermann golluber and hugo halle invested their life savings in a department store in lothringerstrasse , now renamed torstrasse , where customers could purchase goods on credit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis forced all jews out of business but its history was chequered from the start .
within a few years , its two owners were to be robbed of their premises by the nazis , and forced to flee the country .
golluber found refuge in america .
" aryanized , " by the new " german " owners , the building was later sold to the regime , which turned it into a nazi party youth headquarters from 1942 .
the german youth leadership , or reichsjugendfuerhrung , supervised leisure activities of 9 million members of the hitler youth from there .
then , in the early postwar years , the building became the " haus der einheit , " or house of unity , and served as the seat of the east german communist party from 1946-56 .
two powerful communist party leaders , wilhelm pieck and otto grotowohl worked there .
the street also renamed wilhem pieck strasse .
later , the building housed the east german communist party archives , and the central committee 's historical institute .
but that chapter ended in late 1989 when the berlin wall fell , and the east german communist party itself was confined to history 's rubbish bin a few months later .
years of neglect for the past 12 years the building , within sight of the city 's soaring tv tower on alexanderplatz , has lain empty and was steadily decaying ; its interior walls peeling , parquet floor rotting and electrical installations destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around alexanderplatz has undergone huge changes since the wall went down after the city 's reunification , it was legally returned to the jewish family descendants of the original owners , scattered across the world , who finally managed to sell the property to a british investor .
earlier in the week , rainer eppelmann , a former fierce opponent of the east german communist regime , together with andre schmitz , a berlin government -lrb- culture -rrb- state secretary , unveiled a stele outside the " haus der einheit . "
texts written in four languages and exhibited behind a sealed glass panel explain the building 's turbulent , near 80-year-old history .
" remembrance needs location , but remembrance also needs knowledge and recognition , " said eppelmann , when noting that there were today few survivors remaining to tell of the building 's convulsive past .
" if houses could relate history , this one would have enough for a complete novel , " smitz said .
converting the property into the soho house media club is expected to take 16 months , and it is expected to open sometime in 2008 .

many german companies are getting burned by it .
some are also getting rich , while hardly any are getting caught . over a third of the german companies surveyed , and 43 percent of the total participants , said they had lost a contract in the last five years because rival firms had resorted to offering bribes .
in the previous study , conducted five years ago , only a quarter of german companies had said the same , indicating that corruption is on the rise . consulting firm control risks and law firm simmons & simmons surveyed 350 companies in brazil , europe , hong kong and the united states on their approach to fighting corruption .
fifty of the participants were located in germany . a quarter of the respondents reported that bribes make international projects at least 5 percent more expensive , while a tenth of the bribes are said to amount to up to a half of the value of the business contract . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption in an issue worldwide " the numbers indicate that international measures taken against corruption are not as effective as hoped , " control risks officials wrote in the report . anti-corruption mechanisms go unheeded indeed , more and more international anti-corruption measures have been put in place .
in 2005 , for example , an oecd -lrb- organization for economic cooperation and development -rrb- convention called on its member states to prosecute companies for paying bribes when conducting business abroad . the same year , the united nations drew up an anti-corruption convention expressing a commitment to prosecute both active and passive forms of bribery . germany did n't sign the un document , but introduced an anti-bribery law of its own in 1998 . however , only half of german companies were aware of the existing law and only three cases had been prosecuted since it went into effect nine years ago , the study said . room for improvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw exec peter hartz was convicted of 44 accounts of corruption despite recent high-profile corruption cases at firms , including siemens and volkswagen , german companies seem reluctant to crack down .

and , according to handelsblatt.com , only a handful of german companies employ an ombudsman specially trained in investigating and resolving corruption-related problems . without effective anti-corruption mechanisms in place , improvements are likely to be slow in coming . forty-two percent of the survey respondents thought corruption levels would remain the same over the next five years .

torsten frings considers swapping bremen for turin and juventus the bundesliga is looking at a potential exodus of star names in the summer , with a number of players looking outside germany for prospective new employers as the current season draws to a close . germany midfielder torsten frings has met representatives of italian giants juventus to discuss a possible move from werder bremen to the italian giants , he said on tuesday .
frings was in turin monday with his wife , petra , and his adviser , norbert flippen , for talks with juventus sports director alessio secco and club official roberto bettega .
" i liked it there .
but that will not speed up my decision .
i will make up my mind over the next weeks , " he said .
" juve want me at all costs .
they do n't want me to be just another midfielder but ' the ' playmaker , " frings told the daily bild newspaper .
" i 'm thinking a lot about this idea . "
according to tuesday 's edition of turin 's la stampa daily , the issue mainly depends on frings ' wife , who allegedly is not thrilled about a move to the northern italian city .
but german reports also say werder would want considerably more than the roughly 8 million euros -lrb- $ 10.8 million -rrb- juve are said to be offering for frings before agreeing to any move .
secco is said to be preparing a trip to bremen next week for negotiations with werder , the 2004 german league and cup champions .
juve want frings to run midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings ' combative style will fit well in serie a the turin club are keen on signing the germany international this summer as they prepare for a return to serie a for forced demotion for the current season over a match-fixing scheme .
they have already signed a bundesliga player in bosnian midfielder hasan salihamidzic from bayern munich and are reportedly also interested in frings ' bremen teammate miroslav klose , the 2006 world cup top scorer .
although frings , 30 , still has two more years on his contract at bremen , he said at the weekend he was considering the approach from juventus but " wo n't be put under any pressure . "
klose has a deal in bremen until 2008 .
werder coach thomas schaaf said it was " legitimate " for frings to consider the offer , with italian reports saying the player could double his salary at juventus .
" if he has the feeling that he absolutely has to try something new then we will speak to him about the situation , " schaaf said .
" but the fact is that the conditions -lrb- for a move -rrb- have to be in place .
both miro -lrb- klose -rrb- and torsten still have a contract with us . "
werder bremen sporting director klaus allofs said he was surprised by the news .
" we 're not going to put ourselves under pressure .
if torsten no longer wants to play for werder i 'm not going to force him , " said allofs .
" we have in the past always succeeded in finding new talent .
we 're not dependant on one player , werder is more important than any player . "
however , losing both frings and klose would shear werder of two of their most established and world class players .
hot-shot klose the must-have striker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has a number of top clubs monitoring his situation klose has been making noises of a possible move abroad for the best part of six months with his current deal at bremen coming up for renewal .
he is under contract with the german title challengers until next year but had previously told them he would have come to a decision by the beginning of 2007 .
" miro thought he would have decided by now .
he says himself that it 's a difficult decision to take , " said agent alexander schutt .
news that the 28-year-old germany striker is looking to pastures new has put a number of europe 's big clubs on alert with manchester united and barcelona keeping tabs on his situation , while werder 's great rivals bayern munich are said to be considering making an offer which could tempt the polish-born forward to stay in the bundesliga .
after losing out on fiorentina ’ s world cup-winning hit-man , luca toni , bayern would gladly redirect the funds to their northern foes if it meant securing another of europe 's hottest strikers .
hargreaves ' move to manchester back on ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hargreaves could be wearing a different red kit next season the financial outlay for klose would also be eased if bayern allow the exit of another star name - owen hargreaves .
hargreaves has been a manchester united target since last summer and remains on sir alex ferguson 's wish list for the new season .
while the bayern hierarchy were less than willing to sell the england international earlier this season , the elimination form the champions league has seemingly changed their minds .
" if we really get an offer of 25 or 30 million euros for hargreaves i would think about it very seriously , " club president franz beckenbauer told premiere tv in germany after the bavarians crashed out to ac milan last week . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern search for replacements as departures draw near the season is only half-way through and yet a number of bayern munich 's midfielders are looking for new clubs .

many german companies are getting burned by it .
some are also getting rich , while hardly any are getting caught . over a third of the german companies surveyed , and 43 percent of the total participants , said they had lost a contract in the last five years because rival firms had resorted to offering bribes .
in the previous study , conducted five years ago , only a quarter of german companies had said the same , indicating that corruption is on the rise . consulting firm control risks and law firm simmons & simmons surveyed 350 companies in brazil , europe , hong kong and the united states on their approach to fighting corruption .
fifty of the participants were located in germany . a quarter of the respondents reported that bribes make international projects at least 5 percent more expensive , while a tenth of the bribes are said to amount to up to a half of the value of the business contract . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption in an issue worldwide " the numbers indicate that international measures taken against corruption are not as effective as hoped , " control risks officials wrote in the report . anti-corruption mechanisms go unheeded indeed , more and more international anti-corruption measures have been put in place .
in 2005 , for example , an oecd -lrb- organization for economic cooperation and development -rrb- convention called on its member states to prosecute companies for paying bribes when conducting business abroad . the same year , the united nations drew up an anti-corruption convention expressing a commitment to prosecute both active and passive forms of bribery . germany did n't sign the un document , but introduced an anti-bribery law of its own in 1998 . however , only half of german companies were aware of the existing law and only three cases had been prosecuted since it went into effect nine years ago , the study said . room for improvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw exec peter hartz was convicted of 44 accounts of corruption despite recent high-profile corruption cases at firms , including siemens and volkswagen , german companies seem reluctant to crack down . " those who want to fight corruption effectively have to be prepared for a drop in sales , " corruption expert hans-hermann aldenhoff from simmons & simmons told the web site of german business daily handelsblatt . only a quarter of the companies surveyed said they had a confidential telephone hotline where cases of corruption could be reported .
and , according to handelsblatt.com , only a handful of german companies employ an ombudsman specially trained in investigating and resolving corruption-related problems . without effective anti-corruption mechanisms in place , improvements are likely to be slow in coming . forty-two percent of the survey respondents thought corruption levels would remain the same over the next five years .
still , a quarter said they thought progress would be made in the fight against corruption . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens chairman steps down amid corruption scandal siemens supervisory board chairman heinrich von pierer will resign next week , according to a statement by the german engineering giant , which is at the center of corruption allegations .

the club will be modeled on highly exclusive establishments found in london 's soho and new york 's manhattan districts , where entrance is restricted to club members and specially invited guests only , and membership costs around 900 euros -lrb- $ 1,224 -rrb- annually .
the publicity-shy british investor has commissioned the jsk architectural bureau in berlin to carry out renovations on the downtrodden berlin building , which remains a listed property and is located near the former communist palace of the republic , which is now being demolished .
department store turned party hq the building 's history in prenzlauer berg dates back to 1928-29 when jewish business partners hermann golluber and hugo halle invested their life savings in a department store in lothringerstrasse , now renamed torstrasse , where customers could purchase goods on credit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis forced all jews out of business but its history was chequered from the start .
within a few years , its two owners were to be robbed of their premises by the nazis , and forced to flee the country .
golluber found refuge in america .
" aryanized , " by the new " german " owners , the building was later sold to the regime , which turned it into a nazi party youth headquarters from 1942 .
the german youth leadership , or reichsjugendfuerhrung , supervised leisure activities of 9 million members of the hitler youth from there .
then , in the early postwar years , the building became the " haus der einheit , " or house of unity , and served as the seat of the east german communist party from 1946-56 .
two powerful communist party leaders , wilhelm pieck and otto grotowohl worked there .
the street also renamed wilhem pieck strasse .
later , the building housed the east german communist party archives , and the central committee 's historical institute .
but that chapter ended in late 1989 when the berlin wall fell , and the east german communist party itself was confined to history 's rubbish bin a few months later .
years of neglect for the past 12 years the building , within sight of the city 's soaring tv tower on alexanderplatz , has lain empty and was steadily decaying ; its interior walls peeling , parquet floor rotting and electrical installations destroyed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around alexanderplatz has undergone huge changes since the wall went down after the city 's reunification , it was legally returned to the jewish family descendants of the original owners , scattered across the world , who finally managed to sell the property to a british investor .
earlier in the week , rainer eppelmann , a former fierce opponent of the east german communist regime , together with andre schmitz , a berlin government -lrb- culture -rrb- state secretary , unveiled a stele outside the " haus der einheit . "
texts written in four languages and exhibited behind a sealed glass panel explain the building 's turbulent , near 80-year-old history .
" remembrance needs location , but remembrance also needs knowledge and recognition , " said eppelmann , when noting that there were today few survivors remaining to tell of the building 's convulsive past .
" if houses could relate history , this one would have enough for a complete novel , " smitz said .
converting the property into the soho house media club is expected to take 16 months , and it is expected to open sometime in 2008 .
guenter p.j. buerk , one of jsk 's partners in berlin , says the british investor 's " club-hotel " project aims to create an exclusive meeting place for artists and top media representatives from around the world . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : lured by property bargains , foreign investors flock to berlin drawn by some of the lowest property prices in europe and signs of an economic revival in germany , foreign investors are rushing to berlin to get a piece of the hot real estate market .

the website free-alan.com includes a brief biography of mr johnston and messages in arabic and english calling on his captors to let him go .
alan johnston , 44 , has not been seen since he was seized at gunpoint on his way home in gaza city on 12 march .
on saturday , palestinian president mahmoud abbas , on a visit to athens , insisted that mr johnston was alive .
" i have said he is alive and we are making efforts to get him released , " mr abbas said after meeting greek foreign minister dora bakoyannis .
increasing pressure on friday , the media watchdog group reporters without borders called on mr abbas to do more to secure mr johnston 's release .
in the past mr abbas has said that he knows who is holding mr johnston , but has not said whether any contact has been made with the captors .
an unknown militant group said last sunday that it had killed the correspondent , who has been working in the gaza strip for the past three years , but both the bbc and palestinian officials have said they have been unable to verify the claim .
protests against mr johnston 's kidnap have been held in britain , the palestinian territories and other parts of the middle east almost daily since his abduction .
one of the messages on the free-alan website reads : " alan you need to know that those who kidnapped you do not represent the palestinians . "
mr johnston is the only western journalist still permanently based in gaza and had been due to finish his assignment there at the end of march .

a year after the nine-week programme , the eight to 12-year-olds were fitter healthier , and more confident .
details of the mend programme , now running in 100 areas across england , will be presented to an obesity conference in budapest on monday .
one expert said the scheme could underpin work to cut childhood obesity .
healthy attitude around 30 % of uk children are now considered to be overweight or obese .
the trial of the mend programme -lrb- which stands for mind , exercise , nutrition , do-it ! -rrb- involved 107 moderately obese children .
the programme involves the whole family and aims to teach both parents and children about healthy attitudes and behaviours relating to eating and activity , and to help children see being active as fun .
about 1,000 children have now been through the mend programme .
one of them is matthew williams , now 16 , who said the fact that his mother , helen ball , was also involved in the programme gave him extra confidence .
she said it had taught matthew , aged 11 at the time , how to eat healthily .
" it involved lessons about nutrition and diet and how to analyse food labels and food items so that you were in control of how much fat , salts and sugar you were taking in so that you could make the right choices , " she said .
over the next three years , it is hoped 26,000 can take part in 300 areas .
funding for the scheme , which will cost £ 11m in total , is coming from the big lottery fund , sainsbury 's and sport england .
paul sacher , research director of the programme and an honorary specialist dietician at great ormond street hospital , said the focus of the programme was not weight loss . "
this has the potential to underpin effective national strategies for obesity treatment and prevention " professor alan lucas , institute of child health " we do measure them , but their weight is just one of the things we measure .
it 's more about living healthily . "
that is presented to children in ways which they can relate to , such as not being picked last for sport and being able to fit into jeans .
in the study , half were put through the programme , while the rest had no interventions .
after six months , children in the programme had a waist measurement which was , on average , just over 4cm smaller than those in the non-intervention group .
the programme group also had a body mass index measure which was two points lower and did at least three more hours of physical activity per week .
tests also showed their confidence increased by 10 % .
healthy lifestyle twelve months after being on the programme , the children still showed significant benefits in their weight , fitness and wellbeing , although natural growth meant the figures are not directly comparable to their original measurements .
have your say " how to solve it ?
stop eating rubbish food and do exercise " lee wilson , somerset send us your comments after the initial study period , the children in the non-intervention group were also put through the programme because of its success .
mr sacher said : " we were delighted to see that the results were largely sustained at 12 months .
" obviously sustaining a healthy lifestyle is the holy grail of health and fitness . "
louise diss , from the obesity and awareness and solutions trust -lrb- toast -rrb- , praised the programme for looking at more than just food and exercise .
" the fantastic thing is that along with toast philosophy , what they do is look at the physical and the psychology at the same time , " she said .
professor alan lucas , director of the medical research council childhood nutrition research centre at the institute of child health , said : " obesity is an immense public health issue in both immediate and long term health .
" it costs the nation £ 7 billion a year .

this has the potential to underpin effective national strategies for obesity treatment and prevention professor alan lucas , institute of child health " we do measure them , but their weight is just one of the things we measure .
it 's more about living healthily . "

after six months , children in the programme had a waist measurement which was , on average , just over 4cm smaller than those in the non-intervention group .
the programme group also had a body mass index measure which was two points lower and did at least three more hours of physical activity per week .
tests also showed their confidence increased by 10 % .
healthy lifestyle twelve months after being on the programme , the children still showed significant benefits in their weight , fitness and wellbeing , although natural growth meant the figures are not directly comparable to their original measurements .

stop eating rubbish food and do exercise lee wilson , somerset send us your comments after the initial study period , the children in the non-intervention group were also put through the programme because of its success .
mr sacher said : " we were delighted to see that the results were largely sustained at 12 months .
" obviously sustaining a healthy lifestyle is the holy grail of health and fitness . "
louise diss , from the obesity and awareness and solutions trust -lrb- toast -rrb- , praised the programme for looking at more than just food and exercise .

orri vigfusson , 64 , won a goldman environmental prize for his efforts , which have led to a resurgence in salmon numbers in the north atlantic .
he founded an organisation that buys fishermen 's netting rights in areas along the migration route of the fish .
the award is described as " the nobel prize for grassroots environmentalism " .
mr vigfusson and five other winners will receive their awards on monday at a ceremony in san francisco .
end of the line " we have been killing too many fish for too long , " he said , explaining what prompted him 17 years ago to set up the north atlantic salmon fund -lrb- nasf -rrb- , a coalition of conservation groups that works alongside governments and fishermen to end commercial salmon fishing .
" having been a sport fisherman for over 20 years , i had been seeing the salmon stocks in rivers decline every year , " he told bbc news .
our ultimate goal is to return salmon stocks to historical abundance enjoyed 50 years ago orri vigfusson " i said that we had to do something about this or the fish would simply disappear . "
the nasf assessed the situation and decided that the most destructive element was overfishing .
" we had to ensure that the salmon came back from the feeding grounds all over the atlantic , " mr vigfusson explained .
the problem began in the 1950s when it was discovered that salmon from rivers in the us and canada , as well as from europe , gathered in the sea around greenland and the faroe isles .
a massive commercial fishing industry was established in the region , resulting in thousands of miles of driftnets across the routes taken by the fish .
after an initial surge in salmon catches , the numbers crashed .
between 1979 and 1990 , catches fell from four million to 700,000 .
mr vigfusson 's philosophy was simple - to pay licensed netsmen not to fish salmon .
if driftnet fishermen , who intercepted salmon migrating along the coast to rivers , sold their licences to the nasf they received generous compensation in return .
" we believe in commercial agreements , " he explained .
" over the past 17 years we have made commercial agreements all over the northern atlantic . "
the nasf began by striking deals in greenland , iceland and the faroe islands , but have now expanded across much of europe , including scotland , which is home to about 80 % of the uk 's salmon stock .
spawning success by raising $ 35m -lrb- £ 17.5m -rrb- , mr vigfusson 's coalition has been able to " retire " net licences around many of the continent 's key salmon spawning rivers .
as well as offering compensation , the nasf also finds alternative employment for the netsmen , either in sustainable fisheries or in the revived angling tourism industry , boosted by the replenished rivers .
mr vigfusson said his " green capitalism " efforts were already paying dividends .
" iceland , for the past three years , has enjoyed the best seasons ever , and there has also been an increase in salmon stocks in scotland and canada . "
but he said the job was far from done , even after winning a goldman prize .
" our ultimate goal is to return salmon stocks to historical abundance enjoyed 50 years ago . "
other winners of this year 's goldman environmental prize include : hammerskjoeld simwinga - an anti-poaching campaigner from zambia ts .

pumping equipment at the seafield wastewater treatment plant in leith failed at 1630 bst on friday .
thames water , who run the plant , said 1,000 litres a second of partially diluted untreated sewage had been pumping into the forth .
the scottish environment protection agency said a major solution is needed .
a sepa spokesman said emergency measures to " minimize the risk of pollution " were being put in place .
we urge people to ensure they maintain high standards of personal hygiene and do not take anything home from the beach until sewage has dispersed ewan aitken edinburgh council leader he added : " everything that needs to be done is being done . "
engineering works were expected to continue throughout the weekend .
thames water said it had not shut the plant down as it deals with most of the capital 's waste - from about 800,000 people .
spokeswoman hillary bennet said : " sewage is still pumping into the firth of forth .
we 're installing temporary pumping equipment which we expect will prevent further discharges from the pumping station . "
environmental health officers with edinburgh city council advised anyone who uses waterfront recreational areas to avoid contact with the water .
it has an infrastructure that is basically third world technology rob kirkwood leith links residents ' association the council said it was very concerned about the incident .
council leader ewan aitken said : " we urge people to ensure they maintain high standards of personal hygiene and do not take anything home from the beach until sewage has dispersed . "
the council has put up warning notices along the shore in areas which may potentially be affected to warn residents and visitors .
concerned locals are being advised to contact the environmental health service .
residents in leith have been campaigning for years about the smell from the plant and say it is not fit for purpose .
rob kirkwood , the chairman of leith links residents ' association , said : " it has an infrastructure that is basically third world technology . "
are you in the firth of forth and have you been affected by the spill ?
have you been on the waterfront and can you see the effects of the leak ?
your comments : we went for a walk along crammond on saturday afternoon , when we got there we could smell the problem .
there were no notices indeed it was only as we returned from our walk we were stopped by someone and informed of the incident verbally .
duncan wallace , edinburgh next it will be a major spill from the proposed oil transfer on the forth .
mix this in with all the other industrial chemicals and waste and the forth can be declared dead .
the bottom line is that our government and the industry treat the forth like a giant cesspool and see it as an asset for profit and not for its critical importance as part of the local ecosystem or for its beauty .
tony , culross , fife there were no warnings that i saw posted anywhere near portobello beach -lrb- just a mile or so down river -rrb- this morning when i was there briefly with my 2 children .
frankly this is just another one in a series of problems we have had with this plant - there have been constant complaints and even demonstrations regarding the smell from this plant .
thames water have promised to solve the problem but its been going on for years .
rodger moffet , leith , edinburgh , scotland i live beside the firth of forth and work beside seafield sewage plant .
the plant is a disgrace & has been the subject of many complaints for years .
the surrounding area stinks , blamed as usual on old equipment .
the council has repeatedly ignored calls for the plant to be updated and this major spillage comes as no suprise to many locals who have known for some time that it is substandard & should have been closed years ago .
simon arbuthnot , edinburgh , scotland i was surfing at pease bay on friday unaware until sunday morning that this has happened .
i want to know if we have been contaminated .
this is disgusting and not good for the environment .
grant finlayson , edinburgh here in west fife there are signs of this filth being washed up already .
walking the dog this morning -lrb- before i heard the news -rrb- , i remarked to my wife how filthy the beach looked .
there are examples of human waste in several places .
we are having reasonably high tides at the moment -lrb- the new moon has just passed -rrb- and i hope that this afternoon 's high tide will clean up the landscape .
my fear is that , as we 're moving towards a week of lower tides , some of this filth gets left on our waterfront .
i hope that hilary bennet and edinburgh city council remember that we 're being affected by this here in fife and do something about it .
eric blair , rosyth we live on the shore of the firth of forth in portobello and along the prom the notices that have been put up are very few and far between and pathetic - considering this is quite a serious problem .
there should surely be some major signs up , not just some a4 pieces of paper tied with string ? ? ?
